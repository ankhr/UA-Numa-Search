Apostolic succession

Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the <a href="Christian%20Church">Christian Church</a> is held to be derived from the <a href="Twelve%20Apostles">apostles</a> by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of <a href="bishop">bishop</a>s. This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a <a href="Apostolic%20see">particular see founded by one or more of the apostles</a>. According to historian <a href="Justo%20L.%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Justo L. González</a>, apostolic succession is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops, themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles. According to the <a href="Joint%20International%20Commission%20for%20Theological%20Dialogue%20Between%20the%20Catholic%20Church%20and%20the%20Orthodox%20Church">Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church</a>, "apostolic succession" means more than a mere transmission of powers. It is succession in a Church which witnesses to the apostolic faith, in communion with the other Churches, witnesses of the same apostolic faith. The "see ("<a href="cathedra">cathedra</a>") plays an important role in inserting the bishop into the heart of ecclesial apostolicity", but, once ordained, the bishop becomes in his Church the guarantor of apostolicity and becomes a successor of the apostles.

Those who hold for the importance of apostolic succession via episcopal <a href="Christian%20laying%20on%20of%20hands">laying on of hands</a> appeal to the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, which, they say, implies a personal apostolic succession (from <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">Paul</a> to <a href="Saint%20Timothy">Timothy</a> and <a href="Apostle%20Titus">Titus</a>, for example). They appeal as well to other documents of the early Church, especially the <a href="Epistle%20of%20Clement">Epistle of Clement</a>. In this context, Clement explicitly states that the apostles appointed bishops as successors and directed that these bishops should in turn appoint their own successors; given this, such leaders of the Church were not to be removed without cause and not in this way. Further, proponents of the necessity of the personal apostolic succession of bishops within the Church point to the universal practice of the undivided early Church (up to AD 431), before being divided into the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20East">Church of the East</a>, <a href="Oriental%20Orthodoxy">Oriental Orthodoxy</a>, the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> and the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. Christians of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>, <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a>, <a href="Old%20Catholic">Old Catholic</a>, <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican</a>, <a href="Moravian%20Church">Moravian</a>, and Scandinavian <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> traditions maintain that "a bishop cannot have regular or valid orders unless he has been consecrated in this apostolic succession." Each of these groups does not necessarily consider consecration of the other groups as valid.

However, some <a href="Protestantism">Protestants</a> deny the need for this type of continuity, and the historical claims involved have been severely questioned by them; Eric G. Jay comments that the account given of the emergence of the episcopate in chapter III of the <a href="encyclical">encyclical</a> "<a href="Lumen%20Gentium">Lumen Gentium</a>" (1964) "is very sketchy, and many ambiguities in the early history of the Christian ministry are passed over". These denominations, instead, hold that apostolic succession is "understood as a continuity in doctrinal teaching from the time of the apostles to the present."

<a href="Michael%20Ramsey">Michael Ramsey</a>, an English Anglican bishop and the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> (1961–1974), described three meanings of "apostolic succession":
He adds that this last has been controversial in that it has been claimed that this aspect of the doctrine is not found before the time of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, while others allege that it is implicit in the Church of the second and third centuries.

In its 1982 statement on <a href="Baptism%2C%20Eucharist%20and%20Ministry">Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry</a>, the Faith and Order Commission of the <a href="World%20Council%20of%20Churches">World Council of Churches</a> stated that "the primary manifestation of apostolic succession is to be found in the apostolic tradition of the Church as a whole... Under the particular historical circumstances of the growing Church in the early centuries, the succession of bishops became one of the ways, together with the transmission of the Gospel and the life of the community, in which the apostolic tradition of the Church was expressed." It spoke of episcopal succession as something that churches that do not have bishops can see "as a sign, though not a guarantee, of the continuity and unity of the Church" and that all churches can see "as a sign of the apostolicity of the life of the whole church".

The Porvoo Common Statement (1996), agreed to by the Anglican churches of the British Isles and most of the Lutheran churches of Scandinavia and the Baltic, echoed the Munich (1982) and Finland (1988) statements of the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church by stating that "the continuity signified in the consecration of a bishop to episcopal ministry cannot be divorced from the continuity of life and witness of the diocese to which he is called."

Some Anglicans, in addition to other Protestants, held that apostolic succession "may also be understood as a continuity in doctrinal teaching from the time of the apostles to the present." For example, the British <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> Conference locates the "true continuity" with the Church of past ages in "the continuity of Christian experience, the fellowship in the gift of the one Spirit; in the continuity in the allegiance to one Lord, the continued proclamation of the message; the continued acceptance of the mission;..."

The teaching of the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a> on apostolic succession has been summed up as follows:

According to <a href="International%20Theological%20Commission">International Theological Commission</a> (ITC), conflicts could not always be avoided between individuals among the New Testament communities; <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a> appealed to his apostolic authority when there was a disagreement about the Gospel or principles of Christian life. How the development of apostolic government developed is difficult to say accurately because of the absence of certain documents. ITC says that the apostles or their closest assistants or their successors directed the local colleges of "episkopoi" and "presbyteroi" by the end of the first century; while by the beginning of the second century the figure of a single bishop, as the head of the communities, appears explicitly in the letters of <a href="Ignatius%20of%20Antioch">Ignatius of Antioch</a> ( 35-107). In the "Epistle to the Smyrnaeans", Ignatius wrote about three degrees ministry:
"See that you all follow the "bishop", even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the "presbytery" as you would the apostles; and reverence the "deacons", as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop."

Ramsey says that the doctrine was formulated in the second century in the first of the <a href="%23Meanings">three senses given by him</a>, originally as a response to <a href="Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> claims of having received secret teaching from Christ or the apostles; it emphasised the public manner in which the apostles had passed on authentic teaching to those whom they entrusted with the care of the churches they founded and that these in turn had passed it on to their successors. Ramsey argues that only later was it given a different meaning, a process in which <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a> (Bp of Hippo Regis, 395–430) played a part by emphasising the idea of "the link from consecrator to consecrated whereby the grace of order was handed on."

Writing about AD 94, <a href="Clement%20of%20Rome">Clement of Rome</a> states that the apostles appointed successors to continue their work where they had planted churches and for these in their turn to do the same because they foresaw the risk of discord. He uses both 'bishop' and 'presbyter' to refer to these men. According to Eric G. Jay, the interpretation of his writing is disputed, but it is clear that he supports some sort of approved continuation of the ministry exercised by the apostles which in its turn was derived from Christ.

<a href="Hegesippus%20%28chronicler%29">Hegesippus</a> (180?) and <a href="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a> (180) introduce explicitly the idea of the bishop's succession in office as a guarantee of the truth of what he preached in that it could be traced back to the apostles. and they produced succession lists to back this up. That this succession depended on the fact of ordination to a vacant see and the status of those who administered the ordination is seldom commented on. Woollcombe also states that no one questioned the apostolicity of the See of Alexandria despite the fact that its Popes were consecrated by the college of presbyters up till the time of the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">Council of Nicaea</a> in 325. On the contrary, other sources clearly state that <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">Mark the Evangelist</a> is the first bishop of Alexandria (<a href="Pope%20of%20Alexandria">Pope of Alexandria</a>), then he ordained <a href="Annianus">Annianus</a> as his successor bishop (2nd Pope) as told by <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a> ("<a href="Church%20History%20%28Eusebius%29">Historia Ecclesiastica</a>" 2.24.1).

James F. Puglisi, director of <a href="Centro%20Pro%20Unione">Centro Pro Unione</a>, made a conclusion about Irenaeus' writings: "the terms "episkopos" and "presbyteros" are interchangeable, but the term "episkopos" [bishop] is applied to the person who is established in every Church by the apostles and their successors". According to Eric G. Jay, Irenaeus also refers to a succession of presbyters who preserve the tradition "which originates from the apostles". and later goes on to speak of their having "an infallible gift of truth" ["charisma veritatis certum"]. Jay comments that this is sometimes seen as an early reference to the idea of the transmission of grace through the apostolic succession which in later centuries was understood as being specifically transmitted through the laying on of hands by a bishop within the apostolic succession (the "pipeline theory"). He warns that this is open to the grave objection that it makes grace a (quasi)material commodity and represents an almost mechanical method of imparting what is by definition a free gift. He adds that the idea cannot be squeezed out of Irenaeus' words.

Writing a little later, Tertullian makes the same main point but adds expressly that recently founded churches (such as his own in Carthage) could be considered apostolic if they had "derived the tradition of faith and the seeds of doctrine" from an apostolic church. His disciple, <a href="Cyprian">Cyprian</a> (<a href="Bishop%20of%20Carthage">Bishop of Carthage</a> 248–58) appeals to the same fundamental principle of election to a vacant see in the aftermath of the <a href="Decius%23Persecution%20of%20Christians">Decian Persecution</a> when denying the legitimacy of his rigorist rival in Carthage and that of the anti-pope <a href="Novatian">Novatian</a> in Rome; Cyprian also laid great emphasis on the fact that any minister who broke with the Church lost "ipso facto" the gift of the Spirit which had validated his orders. This meant that the minister would have no power or authority to celebrate an efficacious sacrament.

For the adherents of this understanding of apostolic succession, grace is transmitted during <a href="Consecration%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">episcopal consecrations</a> (the <a href="ordination">ordination</a> of bishops) by the <a href="laying%20on%20of%20hands">laying on of hands</a> of bishops previously consecrated within the apostolic succession. They hold that this lineage of ordination derives from the <a href="Twelve%20Apostles">Twelve Apostles</a>, thus making the Church the continuation of the early <a href="Apostolic%20Age">Apostolic Christian community</a>. They see it as one of <a href="Four%20Marks%20of%20the%20Church">four elements</a> that define the true Church of Jesus Christ and legitimize the ministry of its clergy, since only a bishop within the succession can perform valid ordinations, and only bishops and <a href="Priesthood">presbyters (priests)</a> ordained by bishops in the apostolic succession can validly celebrate (or "confect") several of the other <a href="Sacraments%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">sacraments</a>, including the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, <a href="Confession%20%28religion%29">reconciliation of penitents</a>, <a href="confirmation">confirmation</a> and <a href="anointing%20of%20the%20sick">anointing of the sick</a>. <a href="Everett%20Ferguson">Everett Ferguson</a> argued that <a href="Hippolytus%20of%20Rome">Hippolytus</a>, in "Apostolic Tradition 9", is the first known source to state that only bishops have the authority to ordain; and normally at least three bishops were required to ordain another bishop (<a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>, "can". 4). <a href="Cyprian">Cyprian</a> also asserts that "if any one is not with the bishop, he is not in the church" ("Ep." 66.9). 

This position was stated by <a href="John%20Henry%20Newman">John Henry Newman</a>, before his conversion from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism, in "<a href="Tracts%20for%20the%20Times">Tracts for the Times</a>":
We [priests of the Church of England] have been born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. The Lord Jesus Christ gave His Spirit to His Apostles; they in turn laid their hands on those who should succeed them; and these again on others; and so the sacred gift has been handed down to our present bishops, who have appointed us as their assistants, and in some sense representatives. ... we must necessarily consider none to be "really" ordained who have not "thus" been ordained.

Ferguson, in "Encyclopedia of Early Christianity", says that example of <a href="James%20the%20Just">James</a> and the elders of the Jerusalem Church (Acts 21:18) may have provided a model for the development of 'monepiscopacy', in which James' position has figured conspicuously in modern theories about the rise of the monepiscopacy. <a href="Raymond%20E.%20Brown">Raymond E. Brown</a> says that in the earlier stage (before the third century and perhaps earlier) there were plural bishops or overseers ("presbyter-bishops") in an individual community; in the later stage changed to only one bishop per community. Little known about how the early bishops were formally chosen or appointed; afterwards the Church developed a regularized pattern of selection and ordination of bishops, and from the third century on that was universally applied. Brown asserts that the ministry was not ordained by the Church to act on its own authority, but as an important part to continue the ministry of Jesus Christ and helps to make the Church what it is.

Raymond E. Brown also states that by the early second century, as written in the letters of <a href="Ignatius%20of%20Antioch">Ignatius of Antioch</a>, in the threefold structure of the single bishop, plural presbyters, and plural deacons, the celebration of the Eucharist is assigned to the bishop alone; the bishop may delegate others when he goes away. At the <a href="Last%20Supper">Last Supper</a>, Jesus says to those present, who were or included the <a href="Twelve%20Apostles">Twelve Apostles</a>, "Do this in commemoration of me," Brown presumes that the Twelve were remembered as presiding at the Eucharist. But they could scarcely have been present at all the Eucharists of the first century, and no information in New Testament whether a person was regularly assigned to do this task and, if so, who that person was. After all the Church regulated and regularized the celebration of the Eucharist, as that was an inevitable establishment if communities were to be provided regularly with the 'bread of life', since it could not rely on gratuitous provision.

According to <a href="William%20Griffith%20Thomas">William Griffith Thomas</a>, some Protestants have objected that this theory is not explicitly found in Scripture, and the New Testament uses 'bishop' and 'presbyter' as alternative names for the same office. <a href="Michael%20Ramsey">Michael Ramsey</a> argued it is not clearly found in the writings of the Fathers before <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a> in the fourth century and there were attempts to read it back as implicit in earlier writers.

For example, <a href="C.%20K.%20Barrett">C. K. Barrett</a> points out that the Pastoral Epistles are concerned that ministers of the generation of Timothy and Titus should pass on the doctrine they had received to the third generation. According to Barrett, teaching and preaching are "the main, almost the only, activities of ministry." He argues that in <a href="Clement%20of%20Rome">Clement of Rome</a> ministerial activity is liturgical: the undifferentiated 'presbyter-bishops' are to "make offerings to the Lord at the right time and in the right places" something which is simply not defined by the evangelists. He also mentions the change in the use of sacrificial language as a more significant still: for Paul the Eucharist is a receiving of gifts from God, the Christian sacrifice is the offering of one's body (Romans 12:1). Moving on to <a href="Ignatius%20of%20Antioch">Ignatius of Antioch</a>, Barrett states that a sharp distinction found between 'presbyter' and 'bishop': the latter now stands out as "an isolated figure" who is to be obeyed and without whom it is not lawful to baptise or hold a love-feast. He also points out that when Ignatius writes to the Romans, there is no mention of a bishop of the Roman Church, "which we may suppose had not yet adopted the monarchical episcopate." Jalland comes to a similar conclusion and locates the change from the "polyepiscopacy" of the <a href="house%20church">house church</a> model in Rome, to monepiscopacy as occurring before the middle of the second century.

Similar objections are voiced by Harvey who comments that there is a "strong and ancient tradition" that the presence of an ordained man is necessary for the celebration of the Eucharist. But, according to him, there is "certainly no evidence for this view in the New Testament" and in the case of Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch the implication is not that it "cannot" be celebrated by anyone else, but that it "ought" not. Harvey says in the third century this "concern for propriety" begins to be displaced by the concept of 'power' to do so which means that in the absence of such a man it is "literally impossible" for a Eucharist to be celebrated.

Some <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> denominations, not including Scandinavian Lutherans, Anglicans and Moravians, deny the need of maintaining episcopal continuity with the early Church, holding that the role of the apostles was that, having been chosen directly by Jesus as witnesses of his resurrection, they were to be the "special instruments of the Holy Spirit in founding and building up the Church". E.A. Litton argues that the Church is "built upon 'the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles' (Ephes. ii. 20), but a foundation does not repeat itself"; therefore he says that when the apostles died, they were replaced by their writings. To share with the apostles the same faith, to believe their word as found in the Scriptures, to receive the same Holy Spirit, is to many Protestants the only meaningful "continuity". The most meaningful "apostolic succession" for them, then, is a "faithful succession" of apostolic teaching.

<a href="Max%20Thurian">Max Thurian</a>, before his conversion to Roman Catholicism on 1988, described the classic <a href="Reformed">Reformed</a>/<a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> concept of apostolic succession in the following terms. "The Christian ministry is not derived from the people but from the pastors; a scriptural ordinance provides for this ministry being renewed by the ordination of a presbyter by presbyters; this ordinance originates with the apostles, who were themselves presbyters, and through them it goes back to Christ as its source.". Then he continued:
At the same time Thurian argued that the realities form a "composite faithfulness" and are (i) "perseverance in the apostolic doctrine"; (ii) "the will to proclaim God's word"; (iii) "communion in the fundamental continuity of the Church, the Body of Christ, the faithful celebration of Baptism and the Eucharist"; (iv) "succession in the laying on of hands, the sign of ministerial continuity".

According to <a href="Walter%20Kasper">Walter Kasper</a>, the Reformed-Catholic dialogue came to belief that there is an apostolic succession which is important to the life of the Church, though both sides distinguish the meaning of that succession. Besides, the dialogue states that apostolic succession "consists at least in continuity of apostolic doctrine, but this is not in opposition to succession through continuity of ordained ministry" ("Ref I", 100). While the Lutheran-Catholic dialogue distinguishes between apostolic succession in faith (in substantive meaning) and apostolic succession as ministerial succession of bishops; agreed that "succession in the sense of the succession of ministers must be seen within the succession of the whole church in the apostolic faith" ("Ministry", 61; cf. "Malta", 48).

<a href="Joint%20International%20Commission%20for%20Theological%20Dialogue%20Between%20the%20Catholic%20Church%20and%20the%20Orthodox%20Church">Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church</a> asserts that apostolic succession means something more than just a transmission of authorities; it witnesses to the apostolic faith from the same apostolic faith, and in communion with other Churches (attached to the apostolic communion). Apostolic tradition deals with the community, not only an ordained bishop as an isolated person. Since the bishop, once ordained, becomes the guarantor of apostolicity and successor of the apostles; he joins together all the bishops, thus maintaining "episkope" of the local Churches derived from the college of the apostles.

Churches that claim some form of <a href="historical%20episcopate">episcopal apostolic succession</a>, dating back to the apostles or to leaders from the apostolic era, include the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, the <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, the <a href="Oriental%20Orthodoxy">Oriental Orthodox Churches</a>, the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20East">Church of the East</a>, the <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican Communion</a>, some <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> churches (see <a href="%23Lutheran%20churches">below</a>), the <a href="Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter%20Day%20Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a>, and other smaller bodies incorporating the term "Catholic". The <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> (see <a href="%23Anglican%20Churches">below</a>) and those Lutheran churches which claim apostolic succession do not specifically teach this but exclusively practice episcopal ordination. While some Anglicans claim it for their communion, their views are often nuanced and there is widespread reluctance to 'unchurch' Christian bodies which lack it.

Roman Catholics recognise the validity of the apostolic successions of the bishops, and therefore the rest of the clergy, of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Old Catholic Church (Union of Utrecht only), and <a href="Polish%20National%20Catholic%20Church">Polish National Catholic Church</a>. The Orthodox generally recognise Roman Catholic clerical orders as being of apostolic lineage, but have a different concept of the apostolic succession as it exists outside the canonical borders of the Orthodox Church, extending the term only to bishops who have maintained communion, received ordination from a line of apostolic bishops, and preserved the catholic faith once delivered through the apostles and handed down as <a href="Holy%20Tradition">Holy Tradition</a>. The lack of apostolic succession through bishops is the primary basis on which Protestant denominations are not called "Churches", in the proper sense, by the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, the latter referring to them as "ecclesial communities" in the official documents of the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a>.

<a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-Day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a> also claims apostolic succession. According to Mormon tradition, in 1829, <a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a> received the priesthood from Jesus' disciples Peter, James, and John. After its establishment, each subsequent prophet and leader of the church have received the authority passed down by the <a href="laying%20on%20of%20hands">laying on of hands</a>, or through apostolic succession. Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant Christians reject the claim that Smith possessed direct or indirect apostolic authority.

An early understanding of apostolic succession is represented by the traditional claims of various churches, as organised around important <a href="episcopal%20see">episcopal see</a>s, to have been founded by specific apostles. On the basis of these traditions, the churches claim to have inherited specific authority, doctrines and/or practices on the authority of their founding apostle(s), which is understood to be continued by the bishops of the <a href="apostolic%20throne">apostolic throne</a> of the church that each founded and whose original leader he was. Thus:


In <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> theology, the doctrine of apostolic succession is that the apostolic tradition - including apostolic teaching, preaching, and authority - is handed down from the college of apostles to the college of <a href="Bishop%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">bishops</a> through the laying on of hands, as a permanent office in the Church. Historically, this has been understood as a succession in office, a succession of valid ordinations, or a succession of the entire college. It is understood as a sign and guarantee that the Church, both local and universal, is in diachronic continuity with the apostles; a necessary but insufficient guarantor thereof.
<a href="Papal%20primacy">Papal primacy</a> is different though related to apostolic succession as described here. The Catholic Church has traditionally claimed a unique leadership role for the Apostle <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a>, believed to have been named by Jesus as head of the Apostles and as a focus of their unity, who became the first Bishop of <a href="diocese%20of%20Rome">Rome</a>, and whose successors inherited the role and accordingly became the leaders of the worldwide Church as well. Even so, Catholicism acknowledges the papacy is built on apostolic succession, not the other way around. As such, apostolic succession is a foundational doctrine of authority in the Catholic Church.

Catholicism holds that Christ entrusted the Apostles with the leadership of the community of believers, and the obligation to transmit and preserve the "deposit of faith" (the experience of Christ and his teachings contained in the doctrinal "tradition" handed down from the time of the apostles and the written portion, which is Scripture). The apostles then passed on this office and authority by ordaining bishops to follow after them.

Roman Catholic theology holds that the apostolic succession effects the power and authority to administer the <a href="Sacraments%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">sacraments</a> except for <a href="baptism">baptism</a> and <a href="matrimony">matrimony</a>. (Baptism may be administered by anyone and matrimony by the couple to each other.) Authority to so administer such sacraments is passed on only through the sacrament of <a href="Holy%20Orders">Holy Orders</a>, a rite by which a priest is ordained (ordination can be conferred only by bishop). The bishop, of course, must be from an unbroken line of bishops stemming from the original apostles selected by Jesus Christ. Thus, apostolic succession is necessary for the valid celebration of the sacraments.

On 29 June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith explained why apostolic succession is integral to, and indeed, "a constitutive element" of the Church. In response to the question why the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a> and other official statements of the Catholic Church do not call Protestant Christian Communities "Churches", it stated that "according to Catholic doctrine, these Communities do not enjoy "apostolic succession" in the sacrament of Orders, and are, therefore, deprived of a constitutive element of the Church. These ecclesial Communities which, specifically because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood, have not preserved the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic Mystery cannot, according to Catholic doctrine, be called 'Churches' in the proper sense".

In the Catholic Church, <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> stated in his 1896 <a href="Papal%20bull">bull</a> "<a href="Apostolicae%20curae">Apostolicae curae</a>" that the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> believes specifically that the Anglican consecrations are "absolutely null and utterly void" because of changes made to the rite of consecration during the 16th century under <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a>, thus denying that Anglicans participate in the apostolic succession. Anglican clergy, then, are ordained as Catholic priests upon entry into the Catholic Church.

A reply from the Archbishops of Canterbury and York (1896) was issued to counter Pope Leo's arguments: "<a href="Saepius%20officio">Saepius officio</a>: Answer of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to the Bull Apostolicae Curae of H. H. Leo XIII". They argued that if the Anglican orders were invalid, then the Roman orders were as well since the Pope based his case on the fact that the Anglican ordinals used did not contain certain essential elements but these were not found in the early Roman rites either. However, Catholics argue, this argument does not consider the sacramental intention involved in validating Holy Orders. In other words, Catholics believe that the ordination rites were reworded so as to invalidate the ordinations because the intention behind the alterations in the rite was a fundamental change in Anglican understanding of the priesthood.

It is Roman Catholic doctrine that the teaching of "Apostolicae curae" is a truth to be "held definitively", as stated in a commentary by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Cardinal <a href="Basil%20Hume">Basil Hume</a> explained the conditional character of his ordination of <a href="Graham%20Leonard">Graham Leonard</a>, former Anglican bishop of the Diocese of London, to the priesthood in the following way: "While firmly restating the judgement of "Apostolicae Curae" that Anglican ordination is invalid, the Catholic Church takes account of the involvement, in some Anglican episcopal ordinations, of bishops of the Old Catholic Church of the Union of Utrecht who are validly ordained. In particular and probably rare cases the authorities in Rome may judge that there is a 'prudent doubt' concerning the invalidity of priestly ordination received by an individual Anglican minister ordained in this line of succession." At the same time, he stated: "Since the church must be in no doubt of the validity of the sacraments celebrated for the Catholic community, it must ask all who are chosen to exercise the priesthood in the Catholic Church to accept sacramental ordination in order to fulfill their ministry and be integrated into the apostolic succession." Since "Apostolicae curae" was issued many Anglican jurisdictions have revised their ordinals, bringing them more in line with ordinals of the early Church.

Timothy Dufort, writing in "<a href="The%20Tablet">The Tablet</a>" in 1982, argued that by 1969 all Anglican bishops had acquired apostolic succession fully recognized by Rome, since from the 1930s <a href="Old%20Catholic">Old Catholic</a> bishops (whose orders Rome recognises as valid) have acted as co-consecrators in the ordination of Anglican bishops. This view is not accepted by the Holy See, and the matter has been further complicated by the Anglican ordination of women. In a document it published in July 1998, the <a href="Congregation%20for%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Faith">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a> stated that the Catholic Church's declaration on the invalidity of Anglican ordinations is a teaching that the church has definitively propounded and that therefore every Catholics is required to give "firm and definitive assent" to this matter.

While Eastern Orthodox sources often refer to the bishops as "successors of the apostles" under the influence of Scholastic theology, strict Orthodox ecclesiology and theology hold that all legitimate bishops are properly successors of Peter. This also means that presbyters (or "priests") are successors of the apostles. As a result, Orthodox theology makes a distinction between a geographical or historical succession and proper <a href="Ontology">ontological</a> or ecclesiological succession. Hence, the bishops of <a href="Pope">Rome</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Antioch">Antioch</a> can be considered successors of Peter in a historical sense on account of Peter's presence in the early community. This does not imply that these bishops are more successors of Peter than all others in an ontological sense.

According to ancient canons still observed with the Orthodox communion, a bishop must be consecrated by at least three other bishops; so-called "single handed ordinations" do not exist. Moreover, bishops are never ordained "at large" but only for a specific Eucharist community, in due historical and sacramental succession.

The <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodox</a> have often permitted non-Orthodox clergy to be rapidly ordained within Orthodoxy as a matter of pastoral necessity and <a href="Economy%20%28Eastern%20Orthodoxy%29">economia</a>. Priests entering Eastern Orthodoxy from Oriental Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism have usually been received by "vesting" and have been allowed to function immediately within Eastern Orthodoxy as priests. Recognition of Roman Catholic orders by the Russian Orthodox Church was stipulated in 1667 by the <a href="Moscow%20Sobor%20of%201666%E2%80%931667">Synod of Moscow</a>, but this position is not universal within the Eastern Orthodox communion. For example, Fr. John Morris of the <a href="Antiochian%20Orthodox%20Christian%20Archdiocese%20of%20North%20America">Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America</a>, states that "Apostolic Succession is not merely a historical pedigree, but also requires Apostolic Faith. This is because Apostolic Succession is not the private possession of a bishop, but is the attribute of a local Church. A bishop who goes in schism or is cast out of office due to heresy does not take his Apostolic Succession with him as a private possession." The validity of a priest's ordination is decided by each autocephalic Orthodox church.

The <a href="Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church">Armenian Apostolic Church</a>, which is one of the Oriental Orthodox churches, recognises Roman Catholic episcopal consecrations without qualification.

In 1922 the Eastern Orthodox <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople</a> recognised Anglican orders as valid, holding that they carry "the same validity as the Roman, Old Catholic and Armenian Churches possess". In the encyclical "From the Oecumenical Patriarch to the Presidents of the Particular Eastern Orthodox Churches", <a href="Meletius%20IV%20of%20Constantinople">Meletius IV of Constantinople</a>, the Oecumenical Patriarch, wrote: "That the Orthodox theologians who have scientifically examined the question have almost unanimously come to the same conclusions and have declared themselves as accepting the validity of Anglican Orders." Following this declaration, in 1923, the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Patriarchate%20of%20Jerusalem">Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem</a>, as well as the <a href="Church%20of%20Cyprus">Eastern Orthodox Church of Cyprus</a> agreed by "provisionally acceding that Anglican priests should not be re-ordained if they became Orthodox"; in 1936, the <a href="Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church">Romanian Orthodox Church</a> "endorsed Anglican Orders". Historically, some Eastern Orthodox bishops have assisted in the consecration of Anglican bishops; for example, in 1870, the Most Reverend Alexander Lycurgus, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Syra and Tinos, was one of the bishops who consecrated <a href="Henry%20Mackenzie%20%28bishop%29">Henry MacKenzie</a> as the <a href="Anglican%20Bishop%20of%20Nottingham">Suffragan Bishop of Nottingham</a>.

Succeeding judgements, however, have been more conflicting. The Eastern Orthodox churches require a totality of common teaching to recognise orders and in this broader view find ambiguities in Anglican teaching and practice problematic. Accordingly, in some parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Anglican clergy who convert to Orthodoxy are reordained, rather than vested.

The <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> "has never officially endorsed any one particular theory of the origin of the historic episcopate, its exact relation to the apostolate, and the sense in which it should be thought of as God given, and in fact tolerates a wide variety of views on these points". Its claim to apostolic succession is rooted in the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>'s evolution as part of the Western Church. Apostolic succession is viewed not so much as conveyed mechanically through an unbroken chain of the laying-on of hands, but as expressing continuity with the unbroken chain of commitment, beliefs and mission starting with the first apostles; and as hence emphasising the enduring yet evolving nature of the Church.

When <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> broke away from the jurisdiction of Rome in 1533/4, the English Church claimed the <a href="episcopal%20polity">episcopal polity</a> and apostolic succession inherent in its Catholic past; however, <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> theology gained a certain foothold and under his successor, <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a> what had been an administrative schism became a Protestant reformation under the guiding hand of <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>. Although care was taken to maintain the unbroken sequence of episcopal consecrations, particularly in the case of <a href="Matthew%20Parker">Matthew Parker</a>, who was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury in 1559 by two bishops who had been ordained in the 1530s with the Roman Pontifical and two ordained with the Edwardine Ordinal of 1550, apostolic succession was not seen as a major concern that a true ministry could not exist without episcopal consecrations: English Reformers such as <a href="Richard%20Hooker">Richard Hooker</a> rejected the Catholic position that Apostolic Succession is divinely commanded or necessary for true Christian ministry. Richard A. Norris says that the ""foreign" Reformed [Presbyterian] Churches" were genuine ones despite the lack of apostolic succession because they had been abandoned by their bishops at the Reformation.
In very different ways both <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> and <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III of England</a> made it plain that the Church of England could no longer count on the 'godly prince' to maintain its identity and traditions and the 'High Church' clergy of the time began to look to the idea of apostolic succession as a basis for the church's life. For William Beveridge (Bp of St Asaph 1704–8) the importance of this lay in the fact that Christ himself is "continually present at such imposition of hands; thereby transferring the same Spirit, which He had first breathed into His Apostles, upon others successively after them"., but the doctrine did not really come to the fore until the time of the <a href="Tractarian">Tractarian</a>s.

In 1833, before his conversion to Roman Catholicism, <a href="John%20Henry%20Newman">Newman</a> wrote about the apostolic succession: "We must necessarily consider none to be "really" ordained who has not been "thus" ordained". After quoting this, <a href="Michael%20Ramsey">Michael Ramsey</a> continues: "With romantic enthusiasm, the Tractarians propagated this doctrine. In doing so they involved themselves in some misunderstandings of history and in some confusion of theology". He goes on to explain that they ascribed to early Anglican authors a far more exclusive version of the doctrine than was the case, they blurred the distinction between succession in office (Irenaeus) and succession in consecration (Augustine); they spoke of apostolic succession as the channel of grace in a way that failed to do justice to His gracious activity within all the dispensations of the New Covenant. Newman, and after him, <a href="Charles%20Gore">Charles Gore</a> held that the episcopate was passed down from the apostles through men like Timothy and Titus to single bishops in particular localities (monarchial episcopacy). However Bp. Lightfoot argued that monarchial episcopacy evolved upwards from a college of presbyters by the elevation of one of their number to be the episcopal president and <a href="Arthur%20Headlam">A.C. Headlam</a> laid great stress on Irenaeus' understanding of succession which had been lost from sight behind the Augustinian 'pipe-line theory'.

Wide variations exist within Lutheranism on this issue. Most Lutheran churches in Scandinavian countries are favorable to the traditional doctrine of apostolic succession. Others de-emphasize it, e.g., many German Lutheran churches in former Prussian lands, resulting from <a href="Prussian%20Union%20of%20churches">their state-ordered union</a> with Reformed (Calvinist) churches in 1817.

In Scandinavia and the Baltic region, <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> churches participating in the <a href="Porvoo%20Communion">Porvoo Communion</a> (those of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Lithuania), as well as non Porvoo membership Lutheran churches in the region (including those of Latvia, and Russia), believe that they ordain their bishops in the apostolic succession in lines stemming from the original apostles. "The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History" states that "In Sweden the apostolic succession was preserved because the Catholic bishops were allowed to stay in office, but they had to approve changes in the ceremonies."

The Lutheran <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20of%20Finland">Church of Finland</a> was then one with the Church of Sweden and so holds the same view regarding the see of Åbo/Turku. 

In 2001, Francis Aloysius Sullivan wrote: ""To my knowledge, the Catholic Church has never officially expressed its judgement on the validity of orders as they have been handed down by episcopal succession in these two national Lutheran churches."" In 2007, the Holy See declared: ""Christian Communities born out of the Reformation of the sixteenth century [...] do not enjoy apostolic succession in the sacrament of Orders, and are, therefore, deprived of a constitutive element of the Church."" This statement speaks of the Protestant movement as a whole, not specifically of the Lutheran Churches in Sweden and Finland. The 2010 report from the Roman Catholic – Lutheran Dialogue Group for Sweden and Finland, "Justification in the Life of the Church", states: ""The Evangelical-Lutheran Churches in Sweden and Finland [...] believe that they are part of an unbroken apostolic chain of succession. The Catholic Church does however question how the ecclesiastical break in the 16th century has affected the apostolicity of the Churches of the Reformation and thus the apostolicity of their ministry"." Emil Anton interprets this report as saying that the Roman Catholic Church does not deny or approve the apostolic succession directly, but will continue with further inquiries about the matter.

Negotiated at <a href="J%C3%A4rvenp%C3%A4%C3%A4">Järvenpää</a>, Finland, and inaugurated with a celebration of the Eucharist at <a href="Porvoo%20Cathedral">Porvoo Cathedral</a> in 1992, the <a href="Porvoo%20Communion">Porvoo Communion</a> agreement of unity includes the mutual recognition of the traditional apostolic succession among the following Churches:


Of note is the fact that at least one of the Scandinavian Lutheran Churches in the Porvoo Communion of Churches, the <a href="Church%20of%20Denmark">Church of Denmark</a> has bishops, but strictly speaking they were not in the historic apostolic succession prior to their entry into the Porvoo Communion, since their Episcopate and Holy Orders derived from <a href="Johannes%20Bugenhagen">Johannes Bugenhagen</a>, who was a pastor, not a bishop. In 2010, the Church of Denmark joined the Porvoo Communion of Churches, after a process of mutual consecrations of bishops had led to the introduction of historic apostolic succession. The Lutheran Church in Great Britain also joined the Porvoo Agreement, in 2014.

Similarly, in the <a href="High%20Church%20Lutheranism">High Church Lutheranism</a> of Germany, some religious brotherhoods like <a href="Hochkirchliche%20St.%20Johannes-Bruderschaft">Hochkirchliche St. Johannes-Bruderschaft</a> and <a href="Hochkirchlicher%20Apostolat%20St.%20Ansgar">Hochkirchlicher Apostolat St. Ansgar</a> have managed to arrange for their own bishop to be re-ordained in apostolic succession. The members of these brotherhoods do not form into separate ecclesia.

The <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20America">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>, North America's largest Lutheran body, became united in the historic episcopate of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a> in 2000, upon the signing of "<a href="Called%20to%20Common%20Mission">Called to Common Mission</a>". By this document the full communion between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Episcopal Church was established. As such, "all episcopal installations in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America take place with the participation of bishops in the apostolic succession." The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is headed by a presiding bishop who is elected by the churchwide assembly for a six-year term.

In recent years a number of Lutheran churches at the most Catholic edge of the Evangelical Catholic <a href="High%20Church%20Lutheran">High Church Lutheran</a> spectrum in the United States of America have accepted the doctrine of apostolic succession and have successfully recovered it, generally from <a href="Independent%20Catholic%20Churches">Independent Catholic Churches</a>. At present, most of these church bodies have memberships numbering in the hundreds.


Many German Lutherans appear to demur on this issue, which may be sourced in the <a href="Church%20Order%20%28Lutheran%29">church governance views</a> of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>. Luther's reform movement, however, usually did not as a rule abrogate the ecclesiastic office of <a href="Bishop">Bishop</a>.

An important historical context to explicate the wide differences among German Lutheran Churches is the <a href="Prussian%20Union%20%28Evangelical%20Christian%20Church%29">Prussian Union</a> of 1817, whereby the secular government directed the Lutheran Churches in Prussia to merge with non-Lutheran <a href="Reformed%20Church">Reformed Church</a>es in Prussia. The Reformed Churches generally oppose on principle the traditional doctrine of ecclesiastic Apostolic Succession, e.g., not usually even recognising the church office of Bishop. Later in the 19th century, other Lutheran and Reformed congregations merged to form <a href="United%20and%20uniting%20churches">united church bodies</a> in some of the other 39 states of the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a>, e.g., in Anhalt, Baden, Bremen, Hesse and Nassau, Hesse-Kassel and Waldeck, and the Palatinate. Yet the partial nature of this list also serves to show that in Germany there remained many Lutherans who never did unite with the Reformed.

Other Lutheran Churches seem indifferent as a matter of understood doctrine regarding this particular issue of ecclesiastical governance. In America, the conservative <a href="Lutheran%20Church%E2%80%93Missouri%20Synod">Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod</a> (LCMS) places its church authority in the congregation rather than in the bishop, though its founder, C.F.W. Walther, while establishing congregational polity for the LCMS, did consider Polity (a Church's form of government) to be a matter of adiaphora (something indifferent.) Still, other conservative Lutherans, however, may favour <a href="High%20Church%20Lutheranism">High Church Lutheranism</a> which remains generally favourable to the traditional doctrine of Apostolic Succession (see above).

In the beginnings of the <a href="Methodism">Methodist movement</a>, adherents were instructed to receive the <a href="sacraments">sacraments</a> within the <a href="Anglican%20Church">Anglican Church</a> since the Methodists were still a movement and not as yet a separate church in England until 1805; however, the American Methodists soon petitioned to receive the sacraments from the <a href="Methodist%20local%20preacher">local preachers</a> who conducted <a href="worship%20service">worship service</a>s and <a href="Revival%20meeting">revivals</a>. The <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a> refused to ordain Methodist priests and deacons in the <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">British American colonies</a>. <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a>, the founder of the movement, was reluctant to allow unordained preachers to administer the sacraments:
Some scholars argue that in 1763, <a href="Greek%20Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a> bishop <a href="Erasmus%20of%20Arcadia">Erasmus of the Diocese of Arcadia</a>, who was visiting London at the time, consecrated John Wesley a bishop, and ordained several Methodist lay preachers as <a href="Elder%20%28Methodism%29">priests</a>, including John Jones. However, Wesley could not openly announce his episcopal consecration without incurring the penalty of the <a href="Praemunire">Præmunire Act</a>. In light of Wesley's episcopal consecration, the <a href="World%20Methodist%20Council">Methodist Church</a> can lay a claim on apostolic succession, as understood in the traditional sense. Since John Wesley "ordained and sent forth every Methodist preacher in his day, who preached and baptized and ordained, and since every Methodist preacher who has ever been ordained as a Methodist was ordained in this direct 'succession' from Wesley, then the Methodist Church teaches that it has all the direct merits coming from apostolic succession, if any such there be." This apostolic succession is recognized by Unity Catholic Church, an <a href="Independent%20Catholic%20churches">independent Catholic church</a>.

However, most Methodists view apostolic succession outside its <a href="high%20church">high church</a> sense. This is because Wesley believed that the offices of bishop and presbyter constituted one <a href="holy%20orders">order</a>, citing an ancient opinion from the <a href="Church%20of%20Alexandria">Church of Alexandria</a>; <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>, a Church Father, wrote: "For even at Alexandria from the time of Mark the Evangelist until the episcopates of Heraclas and Dionysius the presbyters always named as bishop one of their own number chosen by themselves and set in a more exalted position, just as an army elects a general, or as deacons appoint one of themselves whom they know to be diligent and call him archdeacon. For what function, excepting ordination, belongs to a bishop that does not also belong to a presbyter?" (Letter CXLVI). John Wesley thus argued that for two centuries the succession of bishops in the Church of Alexandria, which was founded by <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">Mark the Evangelist</a>, was preserved through ordination by presbyters alone and was considered valid by that ancient Church.

Since the Bishop of London refused to ordain <a href="Anglican%20ministry">ministers</a> in the <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">British American colonies</a>, this constituted an emergency and as a result, on 2 September 1784, Wesley, along with a priest from the Anglican Church and two other elders, operating under the ancient Alexandrian habitude, ordained <a href="Thomas%20Coke%20%28bishop%29">Thomas Coke</a> a superintendent, although Coke embraced the title bishop.

Today, the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a> follows this ancient Alexandrian practice as bishops are elected from the presbyterate: the "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Discipline%20%28United%20Methodist%29">Discipline of the Methodist Church</a>", in ¶303, affirms that "ordination to this ministry is a gift from God to the Church. In ordination, the Church affirms and continues the apostolic ministry through persons empowered by the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>." It also uses <a href="Bible">sacred scripture</a> in support of this practice, namely, 1 Timothy 4:14, which states:
The Methodist Church also buttresses this argument with the leg of <a href="sacred%20tradition">sacred tradition</a> of the <a href="Wesleyan%20Quadrilateral">Wesleyan Quadrilateral</a> by citing the <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a>, many of whom concur with this view.

In addition to the aforementioned arguments—or perhaps instead of them—in 1937 the annual Conference of the <a href="British%20Methodist%20Church">British Methodist Church</a> located the "true continuity" with the Church of past ages in "the continuity of Christian experience, the fellowship in the gift of the one Spirit; in the continuity in the allegiance to one Lord, the continued proclamation of the message; the continued acceptance of the mission;..." [through a long chain which goes back to] "the first disciples in the company of the Lord Himself ... This is our doctrine of apostolic succession" [which neither depends on, nor is secured by,] "an official succession of ministers, whether bishops or presbyters, from apostolic times, but rather by fidelity to apostolic truth".

In June 2014, the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>, a province of the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, extended its lines of apostolic succession into the <a href="Methodist%20Church%20in%20Ireland">Methodist Church in Ireland</a>, as "the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Dublin%20%28Church%20of%20Ireland%29">Archbishop of Dublin</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Down%20and%20Dromore">Bishop of Down and Dromore</a> took part in the installation of the new President of the Methodist Church of Ireland, the Rev. Peter Murray." In May 2014, the "Church of Ireland’s General Synod approved an agreement signed with the Methodist Church that provided for the interchangeability of clergy, allowing an ordained minister of either church to come under the discipline and oversight of the other."

The <a href="Moravian%20Church">Moravian Church</a> teaches that it has preserved apostolic succession. The Church claims apostolic succession as a legacy of the old <a href="Unity%20of%20the%20Brethren">Unity of the Brethren</a>. In order to preserve the succession, three Bohemian Brethren were consecrated bishops by Bishop Stephen of Austria, a <a href="Waldensian">Waldensian</a> bishop who had been ordained by a Roman Catholic bishop in 1434. These three consecrated bishops returned to <a href="Litice%20nad%20Orlic%C3%AD">Litice</a> in Bohemia and then ordained other brothers, thereby preserving the historic episcopate.

"Jus Divinum Regiminis Ecclesiastici" (English translation: The Divine Right of Church Government), which was promulgated by <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> clergy in 1646, holds that historic ministerial succession is necessary for legitimate ministerial authority. It states that ministerial succession is conferred by elders through the <a href="Christian%20laying%20on%20of%20hands">laying on of hands</a>, in accordance with . The <a href="Westminster%20Assembly">Westminster Assembly</a> held that "There is one general church visible" and that "every minister of the word is to be ordained by imposition of hands, and prayer, with fasting, by those preaching presbyters to whom it doth belong".

Denominations within the <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">Latter Day Saint movement</a> preach the necessity of apostolic succession and claim it through the process of <a href="Restoration%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">restoration</a>. According to their teaching, a period of universal <a href="apostasy">apostasy</a> followed the death of the Twelve Apostles. Without apostles or prophets left on the earth with the legitimate <a href="Priesthood%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Priesthood Authority</a>, many of the true teachings and practices of Christianity were lost. Eventually these were restored to the prophet <a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a> and various others in a series of divine conferrals and ordinations by angelic men who had held this authority during their lifetimes (see this <a href="Restoration%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29%23Partial%20list%20of%20restoration%20events">partial list of restoration events</a>). As it relates to apostolic succession, Joseph Smith and <a href="Oliver%20Cowdery">Oliver Cowdery</a> said that the apostles Peter, James, and John appeared to them in 1829 and conferred upon them the <a href="Melchizedek%20priesthood%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Melchizedek Priesthood</a> and with it "the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fullness of times".

For <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church), the largest denomination in the Latter-day Saint movement, Apostolic Succession involves the leadership of the Church being established through the <a href="Quorum%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Apostles%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</a>. Each time the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Church%20%28LDS%20Church%29">President of the Church</a> dies, the most senior <a href="Apostle%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Apostle</a>, who is designated as the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, is <a href="Setting%20apart">set apart</a> as the <a href="List%20of%20presidents%20of%20The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">new church president</a>.

Some Nonconformist Protestants, particularly those in the Calvinist tradition, deny the doctrine of apostolic succession, believing that it is neither taught in Scripture nor necessary for Christian teaching, life, and practice. Accordingly, these Protestants strip the notion of apostolic succession from the definition of "apostolic" or "apostolicity." For them, to be apostolic is simply to be in submission to the teachings of the original twelve apostles as recorded in Scripture. This doctrinal stance reflects the Protestant view of authority, embodied in the doctrine known as <a href="Sola%20Scriptura">Sola Scriptura</a>.

Among the original champions of Protestantism who rejected the doctrine of apostolic succession were <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, and <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>. They both said that the episcopacy was inadequate to address corruption, doctrinal or otherwise, and that this inadequacy justified the intervention of the church of common people. In part this position was also necessary, as otherwise there would have been no means to elicit or initiate reform of the church.

In the 20th century, there has been more contact between Protestants and Christians from Eastern traditions which claim apostolic succession for their ministry. Like the Roman Catholic Church, these ancient Eastern churches may use the doctrine of apostolic succession in ministry in their apologetics against some forms of Protestantism. Some Protestants feel that such claims of apostolic succession are proven false by the differences in traditions and doctrines between these churches: Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox consider both the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20East">Church of the East</a> and the <a href="Oriental%20Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a> churches to be heretical, having been anathematized in the early ecumenical councils of <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Ephesus">Ephesus</a> (431) and <a href="Council%20of%20Chalcedon">Chalcedon</a> (451) respectively. However, churches that claim apostolic succession in ministry distinguish this from doctrinal orthodoxy, holding that "it is possible to have valid orders coming down from the apostles, and yet not to have a continuous spiritual history coming down from the apostles".

All Christians who have a genuine relationship with God through and in Christ are part of the "true Church", according to exemplary statements of evangelical Protestant theology, notwithstanding condemnation of the Catholic Church by some Protestants. According to these statements, claims that one or more denominations might be the "true Church" are nothing more than propaganda which has evolved over centuries to support authoritarian claims—based on tradition or based on scripture—of merely human institutions. Such claims can be found among the worldwide community of Christians. Yet all appear to treasure the truth that liberates, and Jesus taught his followers to love one another.

<a href="Wisconsin%20Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Synod">WELS</a> rejects Apostolic Succession as a biblical doctrine, stating that there is no evidence the Popes have historic succession from Peter other than their own claim that it is so. Furthermore, they claim that the Bible contains no evidence showing that the office must be conveyed by laying-on of hands and no Biblical command that it must be by a special class of bishops. Laying-on of hands is repeatedly mentioned, especially in the case of Paul and Timothy; however, it is a descriptive, non-prescriptive teaching in the Bible:

WELS teaches:

WELS Lutheran apologists state that there are a number of major problems with the Roman Catholic view on apostolic succession:

WELS holds that it's their custom that ordination of pastors is by other pastors, and that neither the Bible nor the Lutheran confessions make this the only divinely mandated way of entering the pastoral ministry. WELS teaches that "it is the call of the church that is the essential element, more specifically, the call of Christ through the church."

Ascorbic acid (molecular aspects)

Ascorbic acid is a naturally occurring <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a> with <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> properties. It is a white solid, but impure samples can appear yellowish. It dissolves well in water to give mildly acidic solutions. Ascorbic acid is one form ("<a href="vitamer">vitamer</a>") of <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>. It was originally called -hexuronic acid, but, when it was found to have vitamin C activity in animals ("vitamin C" being defined as a vitamin activity, not then a specific substance), the suggestion was made to rename it. The new name, ascorbic acid, is derived from "a-" (meaning "no") and "scorbutus" (<a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>), the disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. Because it is derived from <a href="glucose">glucose</a>, many animals are able to produce it, but humans require it as part of their nutrition. Other vertebrates which lack the ability to produce ascorbic acid include some primates, guinea pigs, teleost fishes, bats, and some birds, all of which require it as a dietary micronutrient (that is, in vitamin form).

From the middle of the 18th century, it was noted that lemon and lime juice could help prevent sailors from getting <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>. At first, it was supposed that the acid properties were responsible for this benefit; however, it soon became clear that other dietary acids, such as vinegar, had no such benefits. In 1907, two Norwegian physicians reported an essential disease-preventing compound in foods that was distinct from the one that prevented <a href="beriberi">beriberi</a>. These physicians were investigating dietary-deficiency diseases using the new animal model of <a href="guinea%20pig">guinea pig</a>s, which are susceptible to <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>. The newly discovered food-factor was eventually called <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>.

From 1928 to 1932, the Hungarian research team led by <a href="Albert%20Szent-Gy%C3%B6rgyi">Albert Szent-Györgyi</a>, as well as that of the American researcher <a href="Charles%20Glen%20King">Charles Glen King</a>, identified the antiscorbutic factor as a particular single chemical substance. Szent-Györgyi isolated the chemical hexuronic acid first from plants and later from animal adrenal glands. He suspected it to be the antiscorbutic factor but could not prove it without a biological assay. This assay was finally conducted at the University of Pittsburgh in the laboratory of King, which had been working on the problem for years, using guinea pigs. In late 1931, King's lab obtained adrenal hexuronic acid indirectly from Szent-Györgyi and, using their animal model, proved that it is vitamin C, by early 1932.

This was the last of the compound from animal sources, but, later that year, Szent-Györgyi's group discovered that <a href="paprika">paprika</a> pepper, a common spice in the Hungarian diet, is a rich source of hexuronic acid. He sent some of the now more available chemical to <a href="Norman%20Haworth">Walter Norman Haworth</a>, a British sugar chemist. In 1933, working with the then-Assistant Director of Research (later Sir) <a href="Edmund%20Hirst">Edmund Hirst</a> and their research teams, Haworth deduced the correct structure and optical-isomeric nature of vitamin C, and in 1934 reported the first synthesis of the vitamin. In honor of the compound's antiscorbutic properties, Haworth and Szent-Györgyi now proposed the new name of "a-scorbic acid" for the compound. It was named -ascorbic acid by Haworth and Szent-Györgyi when its structure was finally proven by synthesis.

In 1937, the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> for chemistry was awarded to Haworth for his work in determining the structure of ascorbic acid — shared with <a href="Paul%20Karrer">Paul Karrer</a>, who received his award for work on <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a>s — and the prize for Physiology or Medicine that year went to <a href="Albert%20Szent-Gy%C3%B6rgyi">Albert Szent-Györgyi</a> for his studies of the biological functions of -ascorbic acid.

The American physician <a href="Fred%20R.%20Klenner">Fred R. Klenner</a>, M.D. promoted vitamin C as a cure for many diseases in the 1950s by elevating the dosages greatly to as much as tens of grams vitamin C daily orally and by injection. From 1967 on, Nobel prize winner <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> recommended high doses of ascorbic acid as a prevention against cold and cancer. However, modern evidence does not support a role for high-dose vitamin C in the treatment of cancer or the prevention of the common cold in the general population.

Ascorbic acid is classed as a <a href="reductone">reductone</a>. The ascorbate anion is stabilized by electron delocalization, as shown above in terms of resonance between two <a href="resonance%20%28chemistry%29">canonical form</a>s. For this reason, ascorbic acid is much more acidic than would be expected if the compound contained only isolated hydroxyl groups.

The ascorbate ion is the predominant species at typical biological pH values. It is a mild <a href="reducing%20agent">reducing agent</a> and <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a>. It is oxidized with loss of one electron to form a radical cation and then with loss of a second electron to form <a href="dehydroascorbic%20acid">dehydroascorbic acid</a>. It typically reacts with oxidants of the <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a>, such as the <a href="hydroxyl%20radical">hydroxyl radical</a>. Such radicals are damaging to animals and plants at the molecular level due to their possible interaction with <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s, proteins, and lipids. Sometimes these radicals initiate chain reactions. Ascorbate can terminate these chain radical reactions by <a href="electron%20transfer">electron transfer</a>. Ascorbic acid is special because it can transfer a single electron, owing to the resonance-stabilized nature of its own <a href="radical%20ion">radical ion</a>, called <a href="dehydroascorbate">semidehydroascorbate</a>. The net reaction is:
The oxidized forms of ascorbate are relatively unreactive and do not cause cellular damage.

However, being a good electron donor, excess ascorbate in the presence of free metal ions can not only promote but also initiate free radical reactions, thus making it a potentially dangerous pro-oxidative compound in certain metabolic contexts.

On exposure to <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, ascorbic acid will undergo further oxidative decomposition to various products including <a href="diketogulonic%20acid">diketogulonic acid</a>, <a href="xylonic%20acid">xylonic acid</a>, <a href="threonic%20acid">threonic acid</a> and <a href="oxalic%20acid">oxalic acid</a>.

Ascorbic acid and its sodium, potassium, and calcium <a href="Salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a>s are commonly used as <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> <a href="food%20additive">food additive</a>s. These compounds are water-soluble and, thus, cannot protect <a href="fat">fat</a>s from oxidation: For this purpose, the fat-<a href="Solubility">soluble</a> <a href="ester">ester</a>s of ascorbic acid with long-chain <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s (ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate) can be used as food antioxidants. Eighty percent of the world's supply of ascorbic acid is produced in China.

The relevant European food additive <a href="E%20number">E number</a>s are:

It creates volatile compounds when mixed with <a href="glucose">glucose</a> and <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s in 90 °C.

It is a cofactor in <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a> <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a>.


Ascorbic acid is found in plants and animals where it is produced from <a href="glucose">glucose</a>. Animals must either produce it or digest it, otherwise a lack of vitamin C may cause scurvy, which may eventually lead to death. Reptiles and older orders of birds make ascorbic acid in their kidneys. Recent orders of birds and most mammals make ascorbic acid in their liver where the enzyme <a href="L-gulonolactone%20oxidase">-gulonolactone oxidase</a> is required to convert glucose to ascorbic acid. Humans, other higher primates, guinea pigs and most bats require dietary ascorbic acid because the enzyme -gulonolactone oxidase catalysing the last step in the biosynthesis is highly mutated and non-functional, therefore, unable to make ascorbic acid. Synthesis and signalling properties are still under investigation.

The biosynthesis of ascorbic acid starts with the formation of UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucuronic acid is formed when UDP-glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a <a href="Uridine%20monophosphate">UMP</a> and <a href="glucuronokinase">glucuronokinase</a>, with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to -glucuronic acid. The aldehyde group of this is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme <a href="glucuronate%20reductase">glucuronate reductase</a> and the cofactor NADPH, yielding -gulonic acid. This is followed by lactone formation with the hydrolase <a href="gluconolactonase">gluconolactonase</a> between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. -Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme -gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other <a href="Haplorrhini">Haplorrhini</a> primates) and the cofactor FAD+. This reaction produces 2-oxogulonolactone, which spontaneously undergoes <a href="enolization">enolization</a> to form ascorbic acid.

There are many different biosynthesis pathways for ascorbic acid in plants. Most of these pathways are derived from products found in glycolysis and other pathways. For example, one pathway goes through the plant cell wall polymers. The plant ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathway most principal seems to be -galactose. -Galactose reacts with the enzyme -galactose dehydrogenase, whereby the lactone ring opens and forms again but with between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on the C4, resulting in -galactonolactone. -Galactonolactone then reacts with the mitochondrial ﬂavoenzyme <a href="Galactonolactone%20dehydrogenase">-galactonolactone dehydrogenase</a>. to produce ascorbic acid. -Ascorbic acid has a negative feedback on -galactose dehydrogenase in spinach.
Ascorbic acid efflux by embryo of dicots plants is a well-established mechanism of iron reduction, and a step obligatory for iron uptake.

Yeasts do not make -ascorbic acid but rather its <a href="stereoisomer">stereoisomer</a>, <a href="erythorbic%20acid">erythorbic acid</a>

Ascorbic acid is prepared in industry from <a href="glucose">glucose</a> in a method based on the historical <a href="Reichstein%20process">Reichstein process</a>. In the first of a five-step process, glucose is catalytically <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenated</a> to <a href="sorbitol">sorbitol</a>, which is then <a href="redox">oxidized</a> by the <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a> "<a href="Acetic%20acid%20bacteria%23Acetobacter">Acetobacter</a> suboxydans" to <a href="sorbose">sorbose</a>. Only one of the six hydroxy groups is oxidized by this enzymatic reaction. From this point, two routes are available. Treatment of the product with <a href="acetone">acetone</a> in the presence of an acid <a href="Catalysis">catalyst</a> converts four of the remaining <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> groups to <a href="acetal">acetal</a>s. The unprotected hydroxyl group is oxidized to the carboxylic acid by reaction with the catalytic oxidant <a href="TEMPO">TEMPO</a> (regenerated by <a href="sodium%20hypochlorite">sodium hypochlorite</a> — <a href="bleach">bleach</a>ing solution). Historically, industrial preparation via the Reichstein process used <a href="potassium%20permanganate">potassium permanganate</a> as the bleaching solution. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this product performs the dual function of removing the two acetal groups and <a href="lactone">ring-closing lactonization</a>. This step yields ascorbic acid. Each of the five steps has a yield larger than 90%.

A more biotechnological process, first developed in China in the 1960s, but further developed in the 1990s, bypasses the use of acetone-protecting groups. A second <a href="genetically%20modified">genetically modified</a> microbe species, such as mutant "<a href="Erwinia">Erwinia</a>", among others, oxidises sorbose into <a href="2-ketogluconic%20acid">2-ketogluconic acid</a> (2-KGA), which can then undergo ring-closing lactonization via dehydration. This method is used in the predominant process used by the ascorbic acid industry in China, which supplies 80% of world's ascorbic acid. American and Chinese researchers are competing to engineer a mutant that can carry out a <a href="one-pot%20synthesis">one-pot fermentation</a> directly from glucose to 2-KGA, bypassing both the need for a second fermentation and the need to reduce glucose to sorbitol.

There exists a -ascorbic acid, which does not occur in nature but can be synthesized artificially. To be specific, -ascorbate is known to participate in many specific enzyme reactions that require the correct enantiomer (-ascorbate and not -ascorbate). -Ascorbic acid has a <a href="specific%20rotation">specific rotation</a> of [α] = +23°.
The traditional way to analyze the ascorbic acid content is the process of <a href="titration">titration</a> with an <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizing agent</a>, and several procedures have been developed, mainly relying on <a href="iodometry">iodometry</a>. <a href="Iodine">Iodine</a> is used in the presence of a <a href="starch%20indicator">starch indicator</a>. Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid, and, when all the ascorbic acid has reacted, the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue-black complex with the starch indicator. This indicates the end-point of the titration. As an alternative, ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess, followed by back titration with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator. The preceding iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with <a href="iodate">iodate</a> and <a href="iodide">iodide</a> in <a href="acid">acid</a> solution. Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by <a href="potentiometric%20titration">potentiometric titration</a> in a manner similar to <a href="Karl%20Fischer%20titration">Karl Fischer titration</a>. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by <a href="Faraday%27s%20laws%20of%20electrolysis">Faraday's law</a>.

An uncommon oxidising agent is <a href="N-Bromosuccinimide">"N"-bromosuccinimide</a> (NBS). In this titration, the NBS oxidizes the ascorbic acid in the presence of <a href="potassium%20iodide">potassium iodide</a> and starch. When the NBS is in excess (i.e., the reaction is complete), the NBS liberates the iodine from the potassium iodide, which then forms the blue-black complex with starch, indicating the end-point of the titration.

AFC Ajax

Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax (), also AFC Ajax, Ajax Amsterdam or simply Ajax, is a Dutch professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> <a href="Football%20team">club</a> based in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. Historically, Ajax (named after the <a href="Ajax%20%28mythology%29">legendary Greek hero</a>) has been the most successful club in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, with 33 <a href="List%20of%20Dutch%20football%20champions">Eredivisie titles</a> and 18 <a href="KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a>s. It has continuously played in the <a href="Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a>, the Dutch football top division, since its inception in 1956 and, along with <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> and <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a>, it is one of the country's "<a href="Big%20Three%20%28Netherlands%29">big three</a>" clubs that have dominated that competition.

Ajax has historically been one of the most successful clubs in the world; according to the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Football%20History%20%26amp%3B%20Statistics">IFFHS</a>, Ajax were the seventh-most successful European club of the 20th century and "The World's Club Team of the Year" in 1992. According to German <a href="Kicker%20%28sports%20magazine%29">Kicker</a>, Ajax were the second most successful European club of the 20th century. The club is one of the five teams that has <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">earned the right</a> to keep the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> and to wear a multiple-winner badge; they won consecutively in 1971–1973. In 1972, they completed the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29%23Continental%20trebles">continental treble</a> by winning the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a>, <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a>, and the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a>. It also won the first organized <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> in 1972 against <a href="Rangers%20FC">Glasgow Rangers</a> (played in 1973). Ajax's last international trophies were the <a href="1995%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1995 Intercontinental Cup</a>, <a href="1995%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">1995 UEFA Super Cup</a> and the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1995 Champions League</a>, where they defeated <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> in the <a href="1995%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a>; they lost the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1996 Champions League</a> <a href="1996%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a> on <a href="Penalty%20shootout">penalties</a> to <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>. In 1995, Ajax was crowned as "World Team of the Year" by <a href="World%20Soccer%20%28magazine%29">World Soccer Magazine</a>".

Ajax is also one of three teams to win the continental treble and the <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> in the same season/calendar year; This was achieved in the 1971–72 season. Ajax, <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> are the five clubs to have won all three major UEFA club competitions. They have also won the <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> twice, the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20UEFA%20Cup">1991–92 UEFA Cup</a>, as well as the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Intertoto%20Cup">Karl Rappan Cup</a>, a predecessor of the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a> in 1962. Ajax plays at the <a href="Amsterdam%20Arena">Amsterdam Arena</a>, which opened in 1996. They previously played at <a href="De%20Meer%20Stadion">De Meer Stadion</a> and the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Amsterdam%29">Amsterdam Olympic Stadium</a> (for international matches).

Ajax was founded in Amsterdam on 18 March 1900. The club achieved promotion to the highest level of Dutch football in 1911 and had its first major success in 1917, winning the <a href="KNVB%20Beker">KNVB Beker</a>, the Netherlands' national cup. The <a href="1917%E2%80%9318%20Netherlands%20Football%20League%20Championship">following season</a>, Ajax became <a href="List%20of%20Dutch%20football%20champions">national champion</a> for the first time. The club defended its title in <a href="1918%E2%80%9319%20Netherlands%20Football%20League%20Championship">1918–19</a>, becoming the only team to achieve an unbeaten season in the Netherlands Football League Championship.

Throughout the 1920s, Ajax was a strong regional power, winning the Eerste Klasse West division in 1921, 1927 and 1928, but could not maintain its success at national level. This changed in the 1930s, with the club winning five national championships (<a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20Netherlands%20Football%20League%20Championship">1931</a>, <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20Netherlands%20Football%20League%20Championship">1932</a>, <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20Netherlands%20Football%20League%20Championship">1934</a>, <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20Netherlands%20Football%20League%20Championship">1937</a>, <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20Netherlands%20Football%20League%20Championship">1939</a>), making it the most successful Dutch team of the decade. Ajax won its second KNVB Cup in 1942–43, and an eighth Dutch title in <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Netherlands%20Football%20League%20Championship">1946–47</a>, the last season the club was managed by Englishman <a href="Jack%20Reynolds%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201881%29">Jack Reynolds</a>, who, up to this point, had overseen all of its national championship successes as well as its 1917 KNVB Cup win.

In 1956, the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20Eredivisie">first season</a> of the Netherlands' new professional league, the <a href="Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a>, was played with Ajax participating as a founding member. The Amsterdam club became the first national champions under the new format and made its debut in the <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Champion Clubs' Cup</a> the <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20European%20Cup">following year</a>, losing to Hungarian champions <a href="Vasas%20SC">Vasas SC</a> 6–2 on aggregate at the quarter-final stage. The team were again Eredivisie champions in <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20Eredivisie">1960</a> and won a third KNVB Cup in 1961.

In 1965, <a href="Rinus%20Michels">Rinus Michels</a>, who had played for the club between 1946 and 1958, was appointed manager of Ajax, implementing his philosophy of <a href="Total%20Football">Total Football</a> which was to become synonymous with both Ajax and the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands national football team</a>. A year earlier, <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a>, who would go on to become the greatest Dutch footballer of all time, made his debut. Between them, Michels and Cruyff led Ajax through the most successful period in its history, winning seven Eredivisie titles, four KNVB Cups and three European Cups.

Ajax won the Dutch championship in <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Eredivisie">1966</a>, <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Eredivisie">1967</a>, and <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Eredivisie">1968</a>, and reached the <a href="1969%20European%20Cup%20Final">1969 European Cup Final</a>, losing to <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a>. During the 1966–67 season, Ajax scored a record 122 goals in an Eredivisie season and also won the KNVB Cup to achieve its first league and cup <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a>. In <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Eredivisie">1969–70</a>, Ajax won a fourth Dutch league championship and second league and cup double in five seasons, winning 27 out of 34 league games and scoring 100 goals.

The <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Eredivisie">1970–71</a> season saw Ajax retain the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a> and reach the <a href="1971%20European%20Cup%20Final">1971 European Cup Final</a>, where they beat <a href="Panathinaikos%20F.C.">Panathinaikos</a> 2–0 with goals from <a href="Dick%20van%20Dijk">Dick van Dijk</a> and <a href="Arie%20Haan">Arie Haan</a> to become continental champions for the first time, with Cruyff being named <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or%20%281956%E2%80%932009%29">European Footballer of the Year</a>. After this success, Michels departed to become manager of <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and was replaced by the Romanian <a href="%C8%98tefan%20Kov%C3%A1cs">Ștefan Kovács</a>. In Kovács' first season, Ajax completed a <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a> of the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a>, the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a> and a third consecutive <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a>. The following season, the team beat Argentine club <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Independiente">Independiente</a> to win the <a href="1972%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1972 Intercontinental Cup</a> and retained their <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a> and <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a> titles, becoming the first club to win three consecutive European Cups since <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> in the 1950s.

In 1973, Michels' Barcelona broke the <a href="World%20football%20transfer%20record">world transfer record</a> to bring Cruyff to <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. Kovács also departed to become manager of the <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France national team</a>, signalling the end of this period of international success.

In <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Eredivisie">1976–77</a>, Ajax won its first domestic championship in four seasons and recorded a double of the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a> and <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a> two years later.

The early 1980s saw the return of Johan Cruyff to the club, as well as the emergence of young players <a href="Marco%20van%20Basten">Marco van Basten</a> and <a href="Frank%20Rijkaard">Frank Rijkaard</a>. The team won back-to-back Eredivisie titles in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Eredivisie">1982</a> and <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Eredivisie">1983</a>, with all three playing a significant role in the latter. After Cruyff's sale to rivals <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> in 1983, Van Basten became Ajax's key player, top scoring in the Eredivisie for four seasons between <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Eredivisie">1983–84</a> and <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Eredivisie">1986–87</a>.

In 1985, Cruyff returned to Ajax as manager and the team ended <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Eredivisie">his first season in charge</a> with 120 goals from 34 matches. Ajax, however, still finished as runner up to <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a> by eight points. The following season, Ajax again lost out on the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a> title to PSV, but won the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, its first continental trophy in 14 years. After this, Cruyff left the club to become manager of Barcelona and Rijkaard and Van Basten were sold to <a href="Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal">Sporting CP</a> and Milan respectively. Despite these losses, Ajax reached a second consecutive Cup Winners' Cup final in <a href="1988%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1988</a>, where they lost to Belgian club <a href="KV%20Mechelen">KV Mechelen</a>.

The <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Eredivisie">1988–89</a> season saw <a href="Dennis%20Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</a>, a young forward who had first appeared under Cruyff in 1986, establish himself as a regular goalscorer for Ajax. Bergkamp helped Ajax to the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Eredivisie">1989–90 Eredivisie</a> title and was the top scorer in the division in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Eredivisie">1990–91</a>, <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Eredivisie">1991–92</a> and <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Eredivisie">1992–93</a>. Under the management of <a href="Louis%20van%20Gaal">Louis van Gaal</a>, Ajax won the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20UEFA%20Cup">1992</a> to become the second club, after <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, to have won all three <a href="List%20of%20UEFA%20club%20competition%20winners">major European club competitions</a>.

After the sale of Bergkamp to <a href="Inter%20Milan">Internazionale</a> in 1993, Van Gaal re-signed the experienced Frank Rijkaard to complement his young Ajax team featuring academy graduates <a href="Frank%20de%20Boer">Frank</a> and <a href="Ronald%20de%20Boer">Ronald de Boer</a>, <a href="Edwin%20van%20der%20Sar">Edwin van der Sar</a>, <a href="Clarence%20Seedorf">Clarence Seedorf</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Davids">Edgar Davids</a>, <a href="Michael%20Reiziger">Michael Reiziger</a>, and <a href="Winston%20Bogarde">Winston Bogarde</a>, as well as mercurial foreign talents <a href="Finidi%20George">Finidi George</a>, <a href="Nwankwo%20Kanu">Nwankwo Kanu</a> and <a href="Jari%20Litmanen">Jari Litmanen</a>, and veteran captain <a href="Danny%20Blind">Danny Blind</a>. The team regained the Dutch championship in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Eredivisie">1993–94</a>, and won it again in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Eredivisie">1994–95</a> and <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Eredivisie">1995–96</a> to become the first Ajax side to win three back-to-back championships since 1968. The height of Van Gaal's success came in 1994–95, where Ajax became the first, and to date only, team to complete an entire Eredivisie season unbeaten. The team also won its first European Cup since its glorious 1970s era, beating Milan in the <a href="1995%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">1995 UEFA Champions League Final</a> 1–0, with the winning goal scored by 18-year-old <a href="Patrick%20Kluivert">Patrick Kluivert</a>. Ajax again reached <a href="1996%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">the final</a> a year later but were defeated on penalties by Juventus.

Ajax's return as a European force was short lived as Van Gaal and several members of the squad soon departed to some of the continent's biggest clubs. The 2000s was a lean decade for the club with only two Eredivisie championships won. However, Ajax's academy continued to produce star players such as <a href="Wesley%20Sneijder">Wesley Sneijder</a> and <a href="Rafael%20van%20der%20Vaart">Rafael van der Vaart</a>.

In 2010, Frank de Boer was appointed manager of Ajax and led the club to its first league title in seven years, and record 30th title overall, in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Eredivisie">2010–11</a> season. This was followed by back-to-back wins in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Eredivisie">2011–12</a> and <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Eredivisie">2012–13</a> to match his three consecutive titles as a player in the 1990s. In <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Eredivisie">2013–14</a>, Ajax were again Eredivisie champions, winning four consecutive league titles for the first time in the club's history. After finishing as runner-up to PSV in both <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Eredivisie">2014–15</a> and <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Eredivisie">2015–16</a>, De Boer stepped down as Ajax head coach in May 2016. 

<a href="Peter%20Bosz">Peter Bosz</a> took over the club and led them to the <a href="2017%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">Europa League final</a>, their first European final in 21 years. Although they lost to <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a>, the lineup they fielded was the youngest ever in a European final at 22 years, 282 days old. For the third consecutive season, they finished runner-up in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a>, this time to <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a>.

The club is also particularly famous for its renowned youth programme that has produced many Dutch talents over the years – <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a>, <a href="Edwin%20van%20der%20Sar">Edwin van der Sar</a>, <a href="Dennis%20Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</a>, former national team top scorer <a href="Patrick%20Kluivert">Patrick Kluivert</a>, and former national team coach <a href="Marco%20van%20Basten">Marco van Basten</a>. Dutch national first-team players <a href="Rafael%20van%20der%20Vaart">Rafael van der Vaart</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Babel">Ryan Babel</a>, <a href="Wesley%20Sneijder">Wesley Sneijder</a>, <a href="Maarten%20Stekelenburg">Maarten Stekelenburg</a>, <a href="Eljero%20Elia">Eljero Elia</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Ooijer">André Ooijer</a>, <a href="John%20Heitinga">John Heitinga</a> and <a href="Nigel%20de%20Jong">Nigel de Jong</a> had also came through the ranks at Ajax and all are now playing for top-flight clubs. Ajax also regularly supplies the Dutch national youth teams with local talent. First team regulars <a href="Siem%20de%20Jong">Siem de Jong</a>, <a href="Urby%20Emanuelson">Urby Emanuelson</a> and <a href="Gregory%20van%20der%20Wiel">Gregory van der Wiel</a> are former youth internationals who made the successful step up to the senior side.

Due to mutual agreements with foreign clubs, the youth academy has also signed foreign players as teenagers before making first team debuts, such as Belgian defensive trio <a href="Jan%20Vertonghen">Jan Vertonghen</a>, <a href="Toby%20Alderweireld">Toby Alderweireld</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Vermaelen">Thomas Vermaelen</a> along with winger <a href="Tom%20De%20Mul">Tom De Mul</a>, all of whom are full internationals, as well as Dutch international <a href="Vurnon%20Anita">Vurnon Anita</a> and <a href="Javier%20Martina">Javier Martina</a> of <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Curaçao</a>.

Ajax has also expanded its talent searching programme to South Africa with <a href="Ajax%20Cape%20Town%20FC">Ajax Cape Town</a>. Ajax Cape Town was set up with the help of Rob Moore. Ajax has also had a satellite club in the United States under the name <a href="Ajax%20Orlando%20Prospects">Ajax America</a>, until it filed for bankruptcy. There are some youth players from Ajax Cape Town that have been drafted into the Eredivisie squad, such as South African internationals <a href="Steven%20Pienaar">Steven Pienaar</a>, <a href="Thulani%20Serero">Thulani Serero</a> and Cameroonian international <a href="Eyong%20Enoh">Eyong Enoh</a>.

In 1995, the year Ajax won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands national team</a> was almost entirely composed of Ajax players, with Edwin van der Sar in goal; players such as <a href="Michael%20Reiziger">Michael Reiziger</a>, <a href="Frank%20de%20Boer">Frank de Boer</a> and <a href="Danny%20Blind">Danny Blind</a> in defence; <a href="Ronald%20de%20Boer">Ronald de Boer</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Davids">Edgar Davids</a> and <a href="Clarence%20Seedorf">Clarence Seedorf</a> in midfield; and <a href="Patrick%20Kluivert">Patrick Kluivert</a> and <a href="Marc%20Overmars">Marc Overmars</a> in attack.

In 2011, Ajax opened its first youth academies outside the Netherlands when the club partnered up with George Kazianis and All Star Consultancy in Greece to open the <a href="Ajax%20Hellas%20Youth%20Academy">Ajax Hellas Youth Academy</a>. The offices are based in <a href="Nea%20Smyrni">Nea Smyrni</a>, <a href="Attica%20%28region%29">Attica</a>, with the main training facility located on the island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>, hosting a total of 15 football youth academies throughout Greece and <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Eddie van Schaik heads the organization as coach and consultant, introducing the Ajax football philosophy at the various Greek football training camps.

Ajax' first stadium was built in 1911 out of wood and was called <a href="Het%20Houten%20Stadion">Het Houten Stadion</a> ("The Wooden Stadium"). Ajax later played in the stadium built for the <a href="1928%20Summer%20Olympics">1928 Summer Olympics</a> hosted in Amsterdam. This stadium, designed by <a href="Jan%20Wils">Jan Wils</a>, is known as the Olympic Stadium. In 1934, Ajax moved to <a href="De%20Meer%20Stadion">De Meer Stadion</a> in east Amsterdam, designed by architect and Ajax-member <a href="Jordanus%20Roodenburgh">Daan Roodenburgh</a>, who had also designed the club's first stadium. It could accommodate 29,500 spectators and Ajax continued to play there until 1996. For big European and national fixtures the club would often play at the Olympic Stadium, which could accommodate about twice the number of spectators.

In 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the <a href="Amsterdam%20Arena">Amsterdam Arena</a>. This was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding approximately 52,000 spectators. The average attendance in 2006–07 was 48,610, rising in the next season to 49,128. The Arena has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the Arena has earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008–09 season, ground staff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably.

The much-loved De Meer Stadion was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area. The only thing left of the old stadium are the letters "AJAX", which nowadays is in place on the façade of the youth training grounds <a href="Sportpark%20De%20Toekomst">De Toekomst</a>, near the <a href="Amsterdam%20Arena">Amsterdam Arena</a>.

In 1900, when the club was founded, the emblem of Ajax was just a picture of an Ajax player. The crest was slightly altered following the club's promotion to the top division in 1911 to match the club's new outfits. In 1928, the club logo was introduced with the head of the <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> hero <a href="Ajax%20%28mythology%29">Ajax</a>. The logo was once again changed in 1990 into an abstract version of the previous one. The new logo still sports the portrait of Ajax, but drawn with just 11 lines, symbolizing the 11 players of a football team.

Ajax originally played in an all-black uniform with a red sash tied around the players' waists, but that uniform was soon replaced by a red/white striped shirt and black shorts. Red, black and white are the three colours of the <a href="flag%20of%20Amsterdam">flag of Amsterdam</a>. When under manager <a href="Jack%20Kirwan">Jack Kirwan</a>, however, the club earned promotion to the top flight of Dutch football for the first time in 1911 (then the "Eerste Klasse" or 'First Class', later named the Eredivisie), Ajax were forced to change their colours because <a href="Sparta%20Rotterdam">Sparta Rotterdam</a> already had exactly the same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms. Ajax opted for white shorts and white shirt with a broad, vertical red stripe over chest and back, which still is Ajax's outfit.

AFC Ajax are the only Dutch club with an <a href="Initial%20public%20offering">Initial public offering</a> (IPO). The club is registered as a <a href="Naamloze%20vennootschap">Naamloze vennootschap</a> (N.V.) listed on the stock exchange <a href="Euronext">Euronext</a> Amsterdam, since 17 May 1998. With a launch price of ƒ25,- (Guilders) the club managed to a bring their total revenue up to €54 million euros (converted) in their first year on the market. After short-lived success, however, the rate dropped, at one point as low as €3.50. Criticism was brought forth that the legal grid for a naamloze vennootschap would not be suitable for a Football club, and that the sports related ambitions would suffer from the new commercial interests of the now listed Ajax. Shares of the company in the year 2008 were valued at approximately €5.90 per share.

In 2008, a Commission under guidance of honorary member Uri Coronel concluded that the <a href="Initial%20public%20offering">IPO</a> was of no value to the club, and that measures should be taken to exit the stock exchange by purchasing back all public shares. Ajax remain on the stock exchange.

Ajax's shirts have been <a href="sponsor%20%28commercial%29">sponsored</a> by <a href="TDK">TDK</a> from 1982 to 1991, and by <a href="ABN%20AMRO">ABN AMRO</a> from 1991 to 2008. <a href="Aegon%20N.V.">AEGON</a> then replaced ABN AMRO as the new head sponsor for a period of seven years. On 1 April 2007, Ajax wore a different sponsor for the match against <a href="Heracles%20Almelo">Heracles Almelo</a>, "Florius". Florius is a banking programme launched by ABN AMRO who wanted it to be the shirt sponsor for one match.

The shirts have been manufactured by <a href="Le%20Coq%20Sportif">Le Coq Sportif</a> (1973–1977), <a href="Puma%20SE">Puma</a> (1977–1980), <a href="Le%20Coq%20Sportif">Le Coq Sportif</a> (1980–1984), <a href="Kappa%20%28company%29">Kappa</a> (1985–1989) and <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> (1989–2000) in the past, and by <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> since 2000 (until at least 2019).

In conclusion of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20AFC%20Ajax%20season">2013–14 season</a>, Ajax won the Football shirt of the Year award for their black and rose colored away shirt by adidas. The annual award was presented by Subside Sports, which had previously given the award to <a href="Inter%20Milan">Internazionale</a>, <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> and the <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium national team</a>. It was Ajax's first time winning the award.

On 7 November 2014, it was announced that Ajax had agreed to a four-and-a-half-year contract worth €8 million annually with Dutch cable operating company <a href="Ziggo">Ziggo</a> as the new shirt sponsor for the club. Having extended their contract with AEGON for half a season until December, the club featured "Fonds Gehandicaptensport", a charitable fund for handicapped sports on its away shirts for a six-month period before transitioning to Ziggo in 2015.

<a href="Jong%20Ajax">Jong Ajax</a> ("formerly more commonly known as Ajax 2") is the reserve team of AFC Ajax. The team is composed mostly of professional footballers, who are often recent graduates from the highest youth level (Ajax A1) serving their first professional contract as a reserve, or players who are otherwise unable to play in the first team.

Since 1992, Jong Ajax competed in the <a href="Beloften%20Eredivisie">Beloften Eredivisie</a>, competing against other reserve teams such as <a href="Jong%20PSV">Jong PSV</a>, <a href="FC%20Groningen">Jong FC Groningen</a> or <a href="AZ%20Alkmaar">Jong AZ</a>. They have won the Beloften Eredivisie title a record eight times, as well as the <a href="KNVB%20Reserve%20Cup">KNVB Reserve Cup</a> three times, making them the most successful reserve squad in the Netherlands. By winning the <a href="Beloften%20Eredivisie">Beloften Eredivisie</a> title, Jong Ajax were able to qualify for the actual <a href="KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a>, even advancing to the semi-finals on three occasions. Their best result in the Dutch Cup was under manager <a href="Jan%20Olde%20Riekerink">Jan Olde Riekerink</a> in 2001–02, when a semi-final loss to <a href="FC%20Utrecht">FC Utrecht</a> in a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">Penalty shoot-out</a> after extra time, which saw Utrecht advance, and thus preventing an Ajax vs. Jong Ajax Dutch Cup final.

The 2013–14 season marked the <a href="Eerste%20Divisie">Jupiler League</a> debut of the Ajax reserves' squad, <a href="Jong%20Ajax">Jong Ajax</a>. Previously playing in the <a href="Beloften%20Eredivisie">Beloften Eredivisie</a> (a separate league for reserve teams, not included in the Dutch professional or amateur league structure), players were allowed to move around freely between the reserve team and the first team during the season. This is no longer the case as Jong Ajax now registers and fields a separate squad from that of Ajax first team for the <a href="Eerste%20Divisie">Eerste Divisie</a>, the second tier of professional football in the Netherlands. Their home matches are played at <a href="Sportpark%20De%20Toekomst">Sportpark De Toekomst</a>, except for the occasional match in the <a href="Amsterdam%20Arena">Amsterdam Arena</a>. Now regarded a semi-professional team in their own respect, the only period in which players are able to move between squads are during the transfer windows, unless the player has made less than 15 appearances for the first team, then he is still eligible to appear in both first team and second team matches during the season. Furthermore, the team is not eligible for promotion to the <a href="Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a> or to participate in the <a href="KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a>. Jong Ajax were joined in the Eerste Divisie by <a href="Jong%20FC%20Twente">Jong Twente</a> and <a href="Jong%20PSV">Jong PSV</a>, reserve teams who have also moved from the Beloften Eredivisie to the Eerste Divisie, in place of <a href="VV%20Katwijk">VV Katwijk</a>, <a href="SC%20Veendam">SC Veendam</a> and <a href="AGOVV%20Apeldoorn">AGOVV Apeldoorn</a>, increasing the total number of teams in the Jupiler League from 18 to 20.

Ajax reserve squad Jong Ajax left the <a href="Beloften%20Eredivisie">Beloften Eredivisie</a> in 2013, having held a 21-year tenure in the reserves league, having also won the league title a record eight times. (1994, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2009)

<a href="AFC%20Ajax%20%28amateurs%29">AFC Ajax Amateurs</a>, better known as Ajax Zaterdag is a <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> amateur football club founded 18 March 1900. It is the amateur team of the professional club AFC Ajax, who play their home matches at the <a href="Sportpark%20De%20Toekomst">Sportpark De Toekomst</a> training grounds to a capacity of 5,000. The team was promoted from the <a href="Eerste%20Klasse">Eerste Klasse</a> to the <a href="Hoofdklasse">Hoofdklasse</a> ahead of the 2011–12 season, the league in which they are currently competing. The team has won the <a href="Eerste%20Klasse">Eerste Klasse</a> title twice, as well as the *<a href="KNVB%20District%20Cup">KNVB District Cup West I</a> on two occasions as well.

Furthermore, Ajax Zaterdag have also managed to qualify for the <a href="KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a> on their own accord on three occasions, namely in 2004, 2005 and in 2008, even advancing to the second round before bowing out to <a href="SBV%20Vitesse">Vitesse</a> on 24 September 2008 during their last appearance in the cup tournament.

<a href="AFC%20Ajax%20%28women%29">AFC Ajax Vrouwen</a> ("English: AFC Ajax Women") are the women's team of AFC Ajax, competing in the <a href="BeNe%20League">BeNe League</a>, the highest level of professional football in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. Founded on 18 May 2012, the women's team saw Ajax attracting many of the Netherlands top talents, with International players such as <a href="Anouk%20Hoogendijk">Anouk Hoogendijk</a>, <a href="Daphne%20Koster">Daphne Koster</a> and <a href="Petra%20Hogewoning">Petra Hogewoning</a> joining the Amstedam club on its maiden season in women's professional football. The team won their first piece of silverware when the defeated <a href="PSV/FC%20Eindhoven">PSV/FC Eindhoven</a> 2–1 in the final of the <a href="KNVB%20Women%27s%20Cup">KNVB Women's Cup</a>.

<a href="Ajax%20HVA">Ajax HVA</a> (1922–1972) was the <a href="baseball">baseball</a> team of AFC Ajax founded in 1922, and competing as founding members of the <a href="Honkbal%20Hoofdklasse">Honkbal Hoofdklasse</a>, the top flight of professional baseball in the Netherlands. Ajax won the national baseball title a total of four times (1924, 1928, 1942, 1948) before the club opted to no longer field a baseball team, and to focus solely on football in 1972. Ajax spent a total of 50 years at the top flight of Baseball in the Netherlands from 1922 to 1972. The dissolution of Ajax baseball club resulted in the players finding a new sponsor in a <a href="Mustard%20%28condiment%29">mustard</a> manufacturing company called Luycks, while merging with the Diemen Giants to become the Luycks Giants, thus replacing both former clubs.

"As one of the traditional <a href="Big%20Three%20%28Netherlands%29">big three clubs</a> in the Netherlands, Ajax have amassed a number of intense rivalries over the years. Listed below are the most significant of the rivalries involving Ajax."

<a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> from <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> are Ajax's archrivals. Every year both clubs play the "<a href="De%20Klassieker">De Klassieker</a>" ("The Classic"), a match between the teams from the two largest cities of the Netherlands. During the 1970s, Ajax and Feyenoord were the only two clubs in the Netherlands who were able to clinch national titles, as well as achieve continental and even global success. A meeting between the two clubs became the measure for who was truly the best club in the Netherlands. The "Klassieker" is the most famous of all the rivalries in the Netherlands and the matches are always sold out. The fixture is seen in the public eye as "the graceful and elegant football of Ajax, against the indomitable fighting spirit of Feyenoord"; the confidence of the capital city versus the blue collar mentality of <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>. Matches are known for their tension and violence, both on and off the pitch. Over the years, several violent incidents have taken place involving rival supporters, leading to the current prohibition of away supporters in both stadiums. The lowest point was reached on 23 March 1997, when supporters of both clubs meet on a field near <a href="Beverwijk">Beverwijk</a>, where Ajax-supporter Carlo Picornie was fatally injured, the incident is commonly referred to as the "<a href="Battle%20of%20Beverwijk">Battle of Beverwijk</a>".

<a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a> are also a rival of Ajax, but in terms of tension and rivalry, these matches are not as loaded as the duels with Feyenoord. The rivalry has existed for some time with PSV and stems from various causes, such as the different interpretations of whether current national and international successes of both clubs correlates and the supposed opposition between the <a href="Randstad">Randstad</a> and the province. The matches between these two teams is commonly referred to as "De Topper" ("The Topper"), and involves the two most trophy-laden sides in Dutch football and is essentially a clash of two competing schools of thought in Dutch football. Historically, PSV compete with a workmanlike ethic, preferring a more robust 4–3–1–2 or 4–2–3–1, typically shunning the seductive 4–3–3 approach favoured in Amsterdam. While <a href="Rinus%20Michels">Rinus Michels</a> and <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a> helped to innovate <a href="Total%20Football">Total Football</a> in the sixties and seventies, a different philosophy was honed in <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a> by <a href="Kees%20Rijvers">Kees Rijvers</a> and <a href="Guus%20Hiddink">Guus Hiddink</a> in the late 1970s and '80s. This in turn has created one of the more philosophical rivalries in football, an ideological battleground, which is gradually becoming as heated and intense as the matches Ajax and Feyenoord partake in.

Aside from Feyenoord and PSV, Ajax have several other rivalries, although in most cases the sentiment is mostly felt by the opposition and is more directed towards Ajax, with one of them being <a href="FC%20Utrecht">FC Utrecht</a>. Although the rivalry is more felt on the <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a> side then with Ajax, matchups between the two sides are often quite intense. Both teams have fanatic supporters, and clashes off the pitch are more often the rule than the exception. The same goes for <a href="ADO%20Den%20Haag">ADO Den Haag</a>, with both supporter-groups often getting in conflicts, when ADO-Hooligans set fire to the Supporters home of Ajax, and Ajax-Hooligans subsequently broke into the Supporters home of ADO tensions between the two clubs rose. In 2006 Supporters from both clubs were banned from attending away matches for five years, due to frequent violent outbreaks and clashes.

Further teams who share a rivalry with Ajax include <a href="FC%20Twente">FC Twente</a>, <a href="FC%20Groningen">FC Groningen</a> and <a href="AZ%20Alkmaar">AZ</a>, although the latter is often regarded by Ajax-supporters as the club's "little brother". Being from nearby <a href="Alkmaar">Alkmaar</a>, and with both clubs sharing the same <a href="Province">Province</a>, match-ups between the two sides are commonly known as the "De Noord-Hollandse Derby" ("North Holland Derby") and are often very competitive, intense and loaded fixtures.

Past rivalries include local <a href="Amsterdam%20derby">Amsterdam derbies</a> between Ajax and clubs such as <a href="Blauw-Wit%20Amsterdam">Blauw-Wit</a>, <a href="AFC%20DWS">DWS</a> and <a href="De%20Volewijckers">De Volewijckers</a> (who later merged to become <a href="FC%20Amsterdam">FC Amsterdam</a> in 1972). The tension between the local sides lessened, however, as the division of the clubs through playing in different leagues over time became greater. Years of not competing in the same league resulted in less frequent match-ups, until tensions finally settled between the Amsterdam clubs. The last Amsterdam derby to take place in an official league match was when Ajax defeated FC Amsterdam 5–1, on 19 March 1978.

Ajax are known for having fanatic core supporter-groups, of which <a href="F-side">F-Side</a> and <a href="VAK410">VAK410</a> are the most famous. F-Side were founded on 3 October 1976, and are situated right behind the goal In the <a href="Amsterdam%20ArenA">Amsterdam ArenA</a>, on the southern end of the stadium in rows 125–129. Their name is derived from the group's former location on the F-side of the old <a href="De%20Meer%20Stadion">De Meer Stadion</a>. The F-side supporters are responsible for a big part of the atmosphere in the stadium, but are also known for rioting during and after matches. If in any match Ajax should win the coin toss, the second half of the match Ajax always play towards the south-end of the stadium. VAK410 (English: Row 410) were founded in 2001 and are situated in the Zuidhoek ("South corner") of the stadium on the upper ring in rows 424–425. The group was originally situated on the North-West side of the stadium in row 410, from where it derives its name, until relocating to their current place in the stands in 2008. Members of VAK410 are known to perform various stunts, which include massive banners, to enhance the atmosphere in the stadium. Neither F-Side or VAK410 have seats in their sections of the stadium, and both groups stand for the duration of the match.

Through the official "Football Top 20" of Dutch sports research group "SPORT+MARKT", it was revealed in 2010 that Ajax had approximately 7.1 million supporters throughout Europe. This is slightly more than rivals <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> and <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a> (each 1.6 and 1.3 million, respectively), which put Ajax in 15th place for most supporters in all of Europe. The study also revealed that approximately 39% of the Netherlands were Ajax supporters. Not only does Ajax have a lot of supporters, but several fans attend their matches in European competition, with an average attendance of 48,677 spectators for every international match Ajax played, putting the team at 12th place in Europe for highest attendance, ahead of high-profile clubs such as <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> or <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. It is noteworthy that not all stadiums share the capacity of the Amsterdam Arena.

The <a href="Supportersvereniging%20Ajax">Supporters Club Ajax</a> () is officially the largest Supporters club in the Netherlands with 94,000 members. Founded on 7 May 1992, the supporters club organize big monthly events throughout the Netherlands, and particularly around the official Ajax Open Training Day, which attracts thousands of supporters each year. Furthermore, the Supporters group is responsible for the <a href="Ajax%20Life">Ajax Life</a> website, as well as the <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a> which is issued 20 times a year. In 2006, the <a href="AFCA%20Supportersclub">AFCA Supportersclub</a> was introduced as the club's second official supporters' association, through the merger of the Onafhankelijke Fanclub Ajax (OFA) and the Ajax Supporters Delegatie (ASD). The AFCA Supportersclub has a reported 42,000 members, as well as a former member on the Board of Administration of Ajax, in Ronald Pieloor.

This graph displays the average attendance for home matches of Ajax from 1988–2017, whereby the difference in capacity of the <a href="De%20Meer%20Stadion">De Meer Stadion</a> and the <a href="Amsterdam%20Arena">Amsterdam Arena</a> (est. 1996) is clearly visible.

Historically, Ajax was popularly seen as having "Jewish roots". Although not an official Jewish club like the city's WV-HEDW, Ajax has had a Jewish image since the 1930s when the home stadium was located next to a Jewish neighbourhood of <a href="Amsterdam-Oost">Amsterdam-Oost</a> and opponents saw many supporters walking through the Nieuwmarkt/Waterloopleinbuurt (de Jodenhoek—the "Jews' corner") to get to the stadium. The city of Amsterdam was historically referred to as a <a href="Mokum">Mokum</a> city, Mokum (מקום) being the <a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a> word for "place" or "safe haven", and as <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a> chants and name calling developed and intensified at the old <a href="De%20Meer%20Stadion">De Meer Stadion</a> from frustrated supporters of opposing clubs, Ajax fans (few of whom are actually Jewish) responded by embracing Ajax's "Jewish" identity: calling themselves "super Jews", chanting "Jews, Jews" ("Joden, Joden") at games, and adopting Jewish symbols such as the <a href="Star%20of%20David">Star of David</a> and the <a href="Flag%20of%20Israel">Israeli flag</a>.

This Jewish imagery eventually became a central part of Ajax fans' culture. At one point ringtones of "<a href="Hava%20Nagila">Hava Nagila</a>", a <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> <a href="folk%20song">folk song</a>, could be downloaded from the club's official website. Beginning in the 1980s, fans of Ajax's rivals escalated their <a href="antisemitic">antisemitic</a> rhetoric, chanting slogans like "<a href="Hamas">Hamas</a>, Hamas/Jews to the <a href="gas%20chamber">gas</a>" ("Hamas, hamas, joden aan het gas"), hissing to imitate the flow of gas, giving <a href="Nazi%20salute">Nazi salute</a>s, etc. The eventual result was that many (genuinely) Jewish Ajax fans stopped going to games.

In the 2000s, the club began trying to persuade fans to drop their Jewish image. In 2013, a documentary titled "<a href="Superjews">Superjews</a>" was released by <a href="Omroep%20NTR">NTR</a> and Viewpoint Productions which premiered at the <a href="International%20Documentary%20Film%20Festival%20Amsterdam">International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam</a> (IDFA). The film was directed by Nirit Peled, an <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i living in Amsterdam, and an independent film maker who offers a very personal view into the game, the lore of Ajax and its relation to <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> from both the supporters as well as from a Jewish perspective.

Ajax have a total of 45 honorary club members, from people who have been invested within the club's administrative engagements, to committed players who have excelled in the athletic department. Of those 45 members 40 have since passed away. Five members still remain, having been reduced from eight members after <a href="Piet%20Keizer">Piet Keizer</a> denounced his membership, seven after the passing of <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a>, and six after the passing of <a href="Uri%20Coronel">Uri Coronel</a>.

The Club van 100 is the official list of <a href="Association%20football">Football</a> players who have appeared in one hundred or more official matches for AFC Ajax. The club currently has a total of 150 members with <a href="Daley%20Blind">Daley Blind</a> being the latest addition. The record for league appearances is held by Mr. Ajax himself <a href="Sjaak%20Swart">Sjaak Swart</a>, who appeared in 463 league matches for Ajax 1. There is a beneficiary team called Lucky Ajax, which was initiated by Sjaak Swart. Lucky Ajax participate in at least one match a year, usually in the name of charity, and commonly at football ceremonies to bid farewell to retiring players. One of the prerequisites for playing on Lucky Ajax, which is invitational only, is that you are a member of the Club van 100, having made at least 100 official match appearances for Ajax Amsterdam in the first team of the club.

Lucky Ajax are a beneficiary team that was initiated by Sjaak Swart in the seventies, competing in at least one match a year, usually in the name of charity and/or to bid farewell to retiring former Ajax players. The team is made up of various members of the <a href="Club%20van%20100%20%28AFC%20Ajax%29">Club van 100</a> of Ajax who will come out of retirement for this match to face the Ajax squad that is current of that year.

The name Lucky Ajax is derived from the famous "Lucky Ajax" nickname from how people used to refer to the club when Ajax would either win a match by chance, by a decision of a referee, or by coincidence such as was said to be the case during the infamous "<a href="De%20Mistwedstrijd">Mistwedstrijd</a>" ("Fog Match").

As of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Eredivisie">2007–08 season</a>, no player could wear the number 14 shirt at Ajax after the club decided to retire the shirt out of respect for Johan Cruyff, "the legendary number fourteen". Cruyff himself laughed off the tribute, saying the club had to let its best player play with number 14. Spanish midfielder <a href="Roger%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Junyent">Roger</a> was the last player to wear the number. <a href="Marvin%20Zeegelaar">Marvin Zeegelaar</a> wore the shirt number In preparation for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Eredivisie">2011–12 season</a> in one preseason match, while <a href="Aras%20%C3%96zbiliz">Aras Özbiliz</a> wore the number 14 shirt in one pre-season match ahead of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Eredivisie">2011–12 season</a> as well. The club stated that this was, in fact, not done in error.

Established in 1975 as the <a href="Amsterdam%20Tournament">Amsterdam 700 Tournament</a> to celebrate 700 years of history in the city. The tournament was hosted annually each summer by Ajax until 1992, when the last edition of the original tournament was played. It returned in 1999 with the backing of the International Event Partnership (IEP). Four teams participate in the competition, played in a league format since 1986. Since its return, the tournament has used an unusual point scoring system. As with most league competitions, three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. An additional point, however, is awarded for each goal scored. The system is designed to reward teams that adopt a more attacking style of play. Each entrant plays two matches, with the winner being the club that finishes at the top of the table. The original competition was held at De Meer Stadion, Ajax's home between 1934 and 1996. The Amsterdam Arena has played host to the event since its return until the last edition was played in 2009. Ajax is the most successful team of the tournament, having won it a record ten times, while <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> from <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> were the last team to win the tournament, in 2009.

Each Summer the city of Amsterdam and Ajax invite U-19 teams from various top clubs from around the World to participate in the tournament. Seven teams are invited and play in the competition every year with the ninth edition of the tournament having occurred in 2013. Over the years, clubs such as <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> have had their senior youth teams participate in the tournament. <a href="Cruzeiro%20Esporte%20Clube">Cruzeiro</a> from <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> are the most successful club in the history of the tournament, having won it three times in total, while <a href="Ajax%20Cape%20Town%20F.C.">Ajax Cape Town</a> from <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> are the current cup holders.

Established in 2010, the <a href="AEGON%20Future%20Cup">AEGON Future Cup</a> is an international friendly tournament for Under-17 youth teams, which is organized by AFC Ajax and their main sponsor, the insurance company <a href="Aegon%20N.V.">AEGON</a>.

Arthur Eddington

Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington (28 December 1882 – 22 November 1944) was an English astronomer, physicist, and mathematician of the early 20th century who did his greatest work in <a href="astrophysics">astrophysics</a>. He was also a <a href="Philosophy%20of%20science">philosopher of science</a> and a populariser of science. The <a href="Eddington%20limit">Eddington limit</a>, the natural limit to the <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour.

He is famous for his work concerning the <a href="theory%20of%20relativity">theory of relativity</a>. Eddington wrote a number of articles that announced and explained <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Einstein's</a> theory of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> to the English-speaking world. <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England. He also conducted an expedition to observe the <a href="Solar%20eclipse%20of%20May%2029%2C%201919">Solar eclipse of 29 May 1919</a> that provided one of the earliest confirmations of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.

Eddington was born 28 December 1882 in <a href="Kendal">Kendal</a>, <a href="Westmorland">Westmorland</a> (now <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>), England, the son of <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> parents, Arthur Henry Eddington, headmaster of the Quaker School, and Sarah Ann Shout.

His father taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to Kendal to become headmaster of Stramongate School. He died in the <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> epidemic which swept England in 1884. His mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income. The family moved to <a href="Weston-super-Mare">Weston-super-Mare</a> where at first Stanley (as his mother and sister always called Eddington) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school. The family lived at a house called Varzin, 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare. There is a commemorative plaque on the building explaining Sir Arthur's contribution to science.

In 1893 Eddington entered Brynmelyn School. He proved to be a most capable scholar, particularly in mathematics and English literature. His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">University of Manchester</a>) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year. He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to <a href="physics">physics</a> for the next three years. Eddington was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers, <a href="Arthur%20Schuster">Arthur Schuster</a> and <a href="Horace%20Lamb">Horace Lamb</a>. At Manchester, Eddington lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician J. W. Graham. His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a B.Sc. in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.

Based on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> in 1902. His tutor at Cambridge was <a href="Robert%20Alfred%20Herman">Robert Alfred Herman</a> and in 1904 Eddington became the first ever second-year student to be placed as <a href="Senior%20Wrangler%20%28University%20of%20Cambridge%29">Senior Wrangler</a>. After receiving his M.A. in 1905, he began research on <a href="thermionic%20emission">thermionic emission</a> in the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a>. This did not go well, and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students. This hiatus was brief. Through a recommendation by <a href="E.%20T.%20Whittaker">E. T. Whittaker</a>, his senior colleague at Trinity College, he secured a position at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich where he was to embark on the career in astronomy, a career whose seeds had been sown even as a young child when he would often "try to count the stars".

In January 1906, Eddington was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the <a href="Astronomer%20Royal">Astronomer Royal</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Greenwich%20Observatory">Royal Greenwich Observatory</a>. He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month. He was put to work on a detailed analysis of the <a href="parallax">parallax</a> of <a href="433%20Eros">433 Eros</a> on <a href="photographic%20plate">photographic plate</a>s that had started in 1900. He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the <a href="Smith%27s%20Prize">Smith's Prize</a> in 1907. The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge. In December 1912 <a href="George%20Darwin">George Darwin</a>, son of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, died suddenly and Eddington was promoted to his chair as the <a href="Plumian%20Professor%20of%20Astronomy%20and%20Experimental%20Philosophy">Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy</a> in early 1913. Later that year, <a href="Robert%20Stawell%20Ball">Robert Ball</a>, holder of the theoretical <a href="Lowndean%20Professor%20of%20Astronomy%20and%20Geometry">Lowndean chair</a> also died, and Eddington was named the director of the entire <a href="Cambridge%20Observatory">Cambridge Observatory</a> the next year. In May 1914 he was elected a <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Fellow of the Royal Society</a> and won their <a href="Royal%20Medal">Royal Medal</a> in 1918 and delivered their <a href="Bakerian%20Lecture">Bakerian Lecture</a> in 1926.

Eddington also investigated the interior of <a href="star">star</a>s through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes. He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for <a href="Cepheid%20variables">Cepheid variable stars</a>. He began by extending <a href="Karl%20Schwarzschild">Karl Schwarzschild</a>'s earlier work on radiation pressure in <a href="Lane-Emden%20equation">Emden polytropic models</a>. These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of Eddington's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere. He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior. However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature, <a href="density">density</a> and <a href="pressure">pressure</a> at all points inside a star, and Eddington argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics. <a href="James%20Jeans">James Jeans</a> contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be <a href="Ionization">ionized</a>, but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.

Eddington defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important <a href="mass-luminosity%20relation">mass-luminosity relation</a>. This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as <a href="ideal%20gases">ideal gases</a>. In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy. Jeans and others defended the <a href="Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz%20mechanism">Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism</a>, which was based on classical mechanics, while Eddington speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.

With these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees. In 1924, he discovered the <a href="Main%20sequence">mass-luminosity relation</a> for <a href="star">star</a>s (see Lecchini in <a href="%23External%20links%20and%20references">#External links and references</a> ). Despite some disagreement, Eddington's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution. The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by Michelson in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to Eddington's intuitive, exploratory style. Eddington's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as "The Internal Constitution of the Stars", which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.

Eddington's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and <a href="Edward%20Arthur%20Milne">Edward Arthur Milne</a>. An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in <a href="quantum%20physics">quantum physics</a>, including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars.

The topic of extension of his models precipitated his famous dispute with <a href="Subrahmanyan%20Chandrasekhar">Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</a>, who was then a student at Cambridge. Chandrasekhar's work presaged the discovery of <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that Eddington refused to believe that Chandrasekhar's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world. History clearly proved Eddington wrong, but his motivation remains a matter of some controversy. Chandrasekhar's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays Eddington as rather cruel, dogmatic, and racist. This is at variance with Eddington's character as described by other contemporaries. Eddington's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain away the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Eddington was Secretary of the <a href="Royal%20Astronomical%20Society">Royal Astronomical Society</a>, which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from <a href="Willem%20de%20Sitter">Willem de Sitter</a> regarding Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Eddington was fortunate in being not only one of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity, but owing to his internationalist and pacifist views inspired by his Quaker religious beliefs, one of the few at the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a German physicist. He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain. He and <a href="Astronomer%20Royal">Astronomer Royal</a> <a href="Frank%20Watson%20Dyson">Frank Watson Dyson</a> organized two expeditions to observe a <a href="Solar%20eclipse%20of%20May%2029%2C%201919">solar eclipse in 1919</a> to make the first empirical test of <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Einstein</a>’s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field. In fact, Dyson’s argument for the indispensability of Eddington’s expertise in this test was what prevented Eddington from eventually having to enter military service.

When conscription was introduced in Britain on 2 March 1916, Eddington intended to apply for an exemption as a <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>. Cambridge University authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of Eddington's work being of national interest. In 1918, this was appealed against by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20National%20Service">Ministry of National Service</a>. Before the appeal tribunal in June, Eddington claimed conscientious objector status, which was not recognized and would have ended his exemption in August 1918. A further two hearings took place in June and July, respectively. Eddington's personal statement at the June hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record. <a href="Astronomer%20Royal">Astronomer Royal</a>, <a href="Sir%20Frank%20Dyson">Sir Frank Dyson</a>, supported Eddington at the July hearing with a written statement, emphasising Eddington's essential role in the <a href="Solar%20eclipse%20of%20May%2029%2C%201919">solar eclipse</a> expedition to Principe in May 1919. Eddington made clear his willingness to serve in the <a href="Friends%27%20Ambulance%20Unit">Friends' Ambulance Unit</a>, the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>, or as a harvest labourer. However, the tribunal's decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of Eddington continuing his astronomy work, in particular in preparation for the Principe expedition. The war ended before the end of his exemption.
After the war, Eddington travelled to the island of <a href="Pr%C3%ADncipe">Príncipe</a> off the west coast of Africa to watch the <a href="Solar%20eclipse%20of%20May%2029%2C%201919">solar eclipse of 29 May 1919</a>. During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars (several stars in the <a href="Hyades%20%28star%20cluster%29">Hyades cluster</a> include <a href="Kappa%20Tauri">Kappa Tauri</a> of the constellation <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a>) in the region around the Sun. According to the theory of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, stars with light rays that passed near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field. This effect is noticeable only during eclipses, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the affected stars. Eddington showed that Newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by Einstein.

Eddington's observations published the next year confirmed Einstein's theory, and were hailed at the time as a conclusive proof of general relativity over the Newtonian model. The news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story. Afterward, Eddington embarked on a campaign to popularize relativity and the expedition as landmarks both in scientific development and international scientific relations.

It has been claimed that Eddington's observations were of poor quality, and he had unjustly discounted simultaneous observations at <a href="Sobral%2C%20Brazil">Sobral, Brazil</a>, which appeared closer to the Newtonian model, but a 1979 re-analysis with modern measuring equipment and contemporary software validated Eddington's results and conclusions. The quality of the 1919 results was indeed poor compared to later observations, but was sufficient to persuade contemporary astronomers. The rejection of the results from the Brazil expedition was due to a defect in the telescopes used which, again, was completely accepted and well understood by contemporary astronomers.

Throughout this period, Eddington lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the "Mathematical Theory of Relativity" in 1923, which <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> suggested was "the finest presentation of the subject in any language." He was an early advocate of Einstein's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: <a href="Ludwik%20Silberstein">Ludwik Silberstein</a>, a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>'s (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other). When Eddington refrained from replying, he insisted Arthur not be "so shy", whereupon Eddington replied, "Oh, no! I was wondering who the third one might be!"

Eddington was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models. He had been investigating the instability of the Einstein universe when he learned of both <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Lemaître's</a> 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and Hubble's work on the recession on the spiral nebulae. He felt the <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a> must have played the crucial role in the universe's evolution from an Einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state, and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant's significance and characteristics. In "The Mathematical Theory of Relativity," Eddington interpreted the cosmological constant to mean that the universe is "self-gauging".

During the 1920s until his death, Eddington increasingly concentrated on what he called "fundamental theory" which was intended to be a unification of <a href="Quantum%20mechanics">quantum theory</a>, <a href="theory%20of%20relativity">relativity</a>, cosmology, and <a href="gravitation">gravitation</a>. At first he progressed along "traditional" lines, but turned increasingly to an almost <a href="numerology">numerological</a> analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants.

His basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 10, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the <a href="proton">proton</a> and the charge of the <a href="electron">electron</a> were a "natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe" and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>, also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the <a href="Dirac%20large%20numbers%20hypothesis">Dirac large numbers hypothesis</a>, and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.

A somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the <a href="fine%20structure%20constant">fine structure constant</a>, α. At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1/136 for epistemological reasons. Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the <a href="Degrees%20of%20freedom%20%28physics%20and%20chemistry%29">degrees of freedom</a>, so that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the <a href="Eddington%20number">Eddington number</a>. Wags at the time started calling him "Arthur Adding-one". This change of stance detracted from Eddington's credibility in the physics community. The <a href="http%3A//physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value%3Falphinv%7Csearch_for%3Dfine%2Bstructure%2Bconstant">current measured value</a> is estimated at 1/137.035 999 074(44).

Eddington believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics, which he termed "E-numbers" (representing a certain <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a> – a <a href="Clifford%20algebra">Clifford algebra</a>). These in effect incorporated <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> into a higher-dimensional structure. While his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community, similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a <a href="grand%20unified%20theory">grand unified theory</a>. Moreover, Eddington's emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants, and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them, is nowadays a central concern of physics. In particular, he predicted a number of hydrogen atoms in the Universe 136 × 2, or equivalently the half of the total number of particles protons + electrons. When equalized with the non-dark energy equivalent number of hydrogen atoms (3/10) × Rc/GmH, this corresponds to a Universe radius R = 13.8 Giga light year, a value predicted for years from universal constants using an atomic-cosmic symmetry, and compatible with "c" times the so-called age of the Universe, 13.80(4) Gyr, as determined by the <a href="Planck%20%28spacecraft%29">Planck mission</a> in March 2003.

He did not complete this line of research before his death in 1944; his book "Fundamental Theory" was published posthumously in 1948.

Eddington is credited with devising a measure of a <a href="Cycling">cyclist's</a> long-distance riding achievements. The Eddington number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number E such that the cyclist has cycled E miles on E days. For example, an Eddington number of 70 would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on 70 occasions. Achieving a high Eddington number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning. Eddington's own E-number was 84.

The Eddington number for cycling is analogous to the <a href="h-index">"h"-index</a> that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist.

It should be noted that the Eddington Number for cycling has units (indeed applying it to any physical property will result in E having units). For example, an E of 62 miles means a cyclist has covered 62 or more miles on 62 or more days. However, in units of kilometers the 62 miles becomes 100 km. It is possible that the cyclist, while having covered 100 km on 62 days or more, may not have covered 100 km on 100 days or more. Thus the order of bicyclists may change depending on units used. Using the original miles, one cyclist may have an Eddington number of 60 - 60 miles (97 km) in 55 days, another of 50 (corresponding to 80 km). However, the latter may be a regular on a distance like this and get a km-Eddington of 80, while the former only had those 60 days riding, and thus stays at a km-Eddington of 60.

Sir Arthur Eddington wrote in his book "The Nature of the Physical World" that "The stuff of the world is mind-stuff."
The <a href="idealist">idealist</a> conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.

The first derives directly from current physical theory. Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behaviour of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics. From this, Eddington inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required. The second, and more interesting argument, was based on Eddington's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts. First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness. We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is "mind-stuff." Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported.

But, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material. To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world. However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties. But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.

<a href="Ian%20Barbour">Ian Barbour</a>, in his book Issues in Science and Religion (1966), p. 133, cites Arthur Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World (1928) for a text that argues The <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Heisenberg</a> <a href="Uncertainty%20principle">Uncertainty Principles</a> provides a scientific basis for "the defense of the idea of human freedom" and his Science and the Unseen World (1929) for support of philosophical idealism "the thesis that reality is basically mental".

<a href="Charles%20De%20Koninck">Charles De Koninck</a> points out that Eddington believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase "mind-stuff" to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same "stuff" and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world. As De Koninck quotes Eddington,

Against <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> and others who advocated <a href="determinism">determinism</a>, indeterminism—championed by Eddington—says that a physical object has an <a href="ontology">ontologically</a> undetermined component that is not due to the <a href="epistemology">epistemological</a> limitations of physicists' understanding. The <a href="uncertainty%20principle">uncertainty principle</a> in <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, then, would not necessarily be due to <a href="Hidden%20variable%20theory">hidden variables</a> but to an indeterminism in nature itself.

Eddington wrote a clever parody of "<a href="The%20Rubaiyat%20of%20Omar%20Khayyam">The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</a>", recounting his 1919 solar eclipse experiment. It contained the following <a href="quatrain">quatrain</a>:

During the 1920s and 30s, Eddington gave numerous lectures, interviews, and radio broadcasts on relativity, in addition to his textbook "<a href="List%20of%20publications%20in%20physics%23The%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Relativity">The Mathematical Theory of Relativity</a>", and later, quantum mechanics. Many of these were gathered into books, including "The Nature of the Physical World" and "New Pathways in Science". His skillful use of literary allusions and humour helped make these famously difficult subjects quite accessible.

Eddington's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of Eddington’s clear and entertaining exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics. He argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of modern physics (i.e., relativity and quantum physics) provided new room for personal religious experience and free will. Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions.

He is sometimes misunderstood as having promoted the <a href="infinite%20monkey%20theorem">infinite monkey theorem</a> in his 1928 book "The Nature of the Physical World", with the phrase "If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>". It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a <a href="rhetorical">rhetorical</a> illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term "improbable" is functionally equivalent to "impossible".

His popular writings made him, quite literally, a household name in Great Britain between the world wars.

Eddington died of cancer in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 22 November 1944. His body was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium (Cambridgeshire) on 27 November 1944; the cremated remains were buried in the grave of his mother in the <a href="Ascension%20Parish%20Burial%20Ground">Ascension Parish Burial Ground</a> in Cambridge.

Cambridge University's <a href="North%20West%20Cambridge%20Development">North West Cambridge Development</a> has been named "<a href="Eddington%2C%20Cambridge">Eddington</a>" in his honour.

Apple II

The Apple II is an <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a> <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a>, one of the first highly successful mass-produced <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a> products, designed primarily by <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> (<a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and <a href="Rod%20Holt">Rod Holt</a> developed the <a href="Switched-mode%20power%20supply">switching power supply</a>). It was introduced in 1977 at the <a href="West%20Coast%20Computer%20Faire">West Coast Computer Faire</a> by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by <a href="Apple%20Computer">Apple Computer</a>. It is the first model in a <a href="Apple%20II%20series">series of computers</a> which were produced until <a href="Apple%20IIe">Apple IIe</a> production ceased in November 1993. The Apple II marks Apple's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer market – branded towards American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists. 

Along with the <a href="Commodore%20PET">PET 2001</a> and the <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a>, <a href="Byte%20%28magazine%29">"Byte" magazine</a> referred to these as the "1977 Trinity" of personal computing.
The Apple II had the defining feature of being able to display color graphics, and this capability was the reason why the <a href="Apple%20logo">Apple logo</a> was redesigned to have a spectrum of colors.

By 1976, Steve Jobs had convinced the product designer Jerry Manock (who had formerly worked at Hewlett Packard designing calculators) to create the "shell" for the Apple II – a smooth case inspired by kitchen appliances that would conceal the internal mechanics. The earliest Apple IIs were assembled in <a href="Silicon%20Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, and later in Texas; <a href="printed%20circuit%20board">printed circuit board</a>s were manufactured in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. The first computers went on sale on June 10, 1977 with a <a href="MOS%20Technology%206502">MOS Technology 6502</a> microprocessor running at 1.023 <a href="MHz">MHz</a>, two <a href="Paddle%20%28game%20controller%29">game paddles</a> (no longer bundled as of 1980 because they violated <a href="Title%2047%20CFR%20Part%2015">FCC regulations</a>), 4 kB of <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a>, an <a href="Compact%20Cassette%23Data%20recording">audio cassette</a> interface for loading programs and storing data, and the <a href="Integer%20BASIC">Integer BASIC</a> programming language built into the <a href="read-only%20memory">ROMs</a>. The video controller displays 24 lines by 40 columns of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 20 to 5F) text on the screen, with <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> <a href="composite%20video">composite video</a> output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set by way of a separate <a href="RF%20modulator">RF modulator</a>. The original retail price of the computer was $1,298 (with 4 kB of RAM) and $2,638 (with the maximum 48 kB of RAM). To reflect the computer's <a href="Apple%20II%20graphics">color graphics</a> capability, the Apple logo on the casing has rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. Perhaps most significantly, the Apple II was a catalyst for personal computers across many industries; responsible for opening the doors to software marketed at consumers.

In the May 1977 issue of <a href="Byte%20%28magazine%29">"Byte"</a>, <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> published a detailed description of his design; the article began, "To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use and inexpensive".

The Apple II used a multiplicity of idiosyncratic engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example: 

The text and graphics screens have a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which is reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would allow for the refresh of the dynamic RAM as a side effect, as described above; it had no cost overhead to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline and avoided the need for significant extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color is determined by pixel position and can thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allows for <a href="subpixel">subpixel</a> font rendering since orange and blue pixels appear half a pixel-width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.

The Apple II at first used <a href="data%20cassette">data cassette</a> storage like most other microcomputers of the time. In 1978 the company introduced an external -inch <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a> drive, the <a href="Disk%20II">Disk II</a>, attached via a controller card that plugs into one of the computer's <a href="expansion%20slot">expansion slot</a>s (usually slot 6). The Disk II interface, created by Wozniak, is regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.

The approach taken in the Disk II controller is typical of Wozniak's designs. With a few small-scale logic chips and a cheap PROM (<a href="programmable%20read-only%20memory">programmable read-only memory</a>), he created a functional floppy-disk interface at a fraction of the component cost of standard circuit configurations.

With the Apple I and the Apple II, Wozniak introduced an entirely novel configuration of the microcomputer concept which was immediately adopted as the industry standard, and remains taken for granted to this day—namely the integration of the standard input and output devices (the typewriter-style keyboard and the video display screen) into the computer itself. Until that time, microcomputer devices either had an extremely limited I/O capability—such as perhaps a hex keypad and a 16- or 32-character display, or no built-in user interface at all, following the convention of <a href="mainframe">mainframe</a> and <a href="minicomputers">minicomputers</a> in requiring the connection of an external <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a> unit or <a href="Electronic%20visual%20display">visual display terminal</a> to complete a usable system. The cost of such terminals could easily exceed the price of the computer itself. Wozniak's inclusion of an <a href="RF">RF</a> output which could connect to the aerial socket of a standard domestic television set enabled users to acquire a complete system without incurring the cost of a video monitor.

The Apple II's PCB underwent several revisions as Steve Wozniak made modifications to it. The earliest version was known as Revision 0, and the first 6000 units shipped used it. Later revisions added a color killer circuit to prevent color fringing when the computer was in text mode, as well as modifications to improve the reliability of cassette I/O. Revision 0 Apple IIs powered up in an undefined mode and had garbage on screen, requiring the user to press Reset. This was eliminated on the later board revisions. Revision 0 Apple IIs could display only four colors, but Wozniak was later able to generate 16 in low-res mode.

Original Apple IIs were designed to accommodate either 2104 (4kx1) DRAM or 4116 (16kx1) DRAM and had jumper switches to adjust the RAM size. The early Apple II+ models retained this feature, but after a drop in DRAM prices, Apple redesigned the circuit boards without the jumpers so that only 16k chips were supported. A few months later they started shipping all machines with a full complement of 48k DRAM.

Color on the Apple II series uses a quirk of the <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was added on later by adding a 3.58-MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by black-and-white TV sets. Color is encoded based on the "<a href="phase%20%28waves%29">phase</a>" of this signal in relation to a reference "<a href="color%20burst">color burst</a>" signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into "<a href="pixel">pixel</a>s" on the computer screen, with the possibility of exploiting <a href="composite%20artifact%20colors">composite artifact colors</a>.

The Apple II display provides two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal is turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it can display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Blue and orange are available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offers more colors by compressing more (and narrower) pixels into each subcarrier cycle.

The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode works differently, as it can output a pattern of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These patterns are stored in the character generator ROM and replace the text character bit patterns when the computer is switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode use the same memory region and the same circuitry is used for both.

Rather than a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II has a toggle circuit that can only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) are generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Similar techniques are used for cassette storage: the cassette output works the same as the speaker, and the input is a simple <a href="Zero%20crossing%20threshold%20detector">zero-crossing detector</a> that serves as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM encode and decode data in <a href="frequency-shift%20keying">frequency-shift keying</a> for the cassette.

Initially, the Apple II was shipped with Integer BASIC encoded in the motherboard <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a> chips. Written by Wozniak, the interpreter enabled users to write software applications without needing to purchase additional development utilities. Written with game programmers and hobbyists in mind, the language only supported the encoding of numbers in 16-bit integer format. But limiting numerical values to whole numbers between -32768 and +32767 reduced the machine's attractiveness to business users. Jobs responded by licensing a floating-point version of BASIC from Microsoft which was initially available as a plug-in expansion card. Named <a href="Applesoft%20BASIC">Applesoft BASIC</a>, this more versatile (but slower) variant was more popular with customers, so later models were shipped with it as standard and anyone wanting Integer BASIC had to get that on a language card.

As shipped, the machine incorporated a "monitor" program which supported functions such as displaying and altering the contents of the computer's RAM memory in <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> format, either one byte at a time or in blocks of 256 bytes at once. This feature enabled hackers to write and debug machine code programs without needing further development software.

A 6502 assembler was soon offered on disk, and later the <a href="UCSD">UCSD</a> compiler and operating system for the <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a> language were made available. The Pascal system required a 16k RAM card to be installed in the language card position (expansion slot 0) in addition to the full 48k of motherboard memory.

Wozniak's <a href="open%20architecture">open-architecture</a> design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permit a wide variety of third-party devices, including <a href="Apple%20II%20peripheral%20cards">peripheral cards</a> such as <a href="Apple%20II%20serial%20cards">serial controllers</a>, display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and <a href="Apple%20II%20system%20clocks">realtime clocks</a>. There are plug-in <a href="Apple%20II%20processor%20cards">expansion cards</a> – such as the <a href="Z-80%20SoftCard">Z-80 SoftCard</a> – that permit the Apple to use the <a href="Zilog%20Z80">Z80</a> processor and run programs for the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system, including the <a href="dBase">dBase II</a> database and the <a href="WordStar">WordStar</a> word processor. The Z80 card also allows the connection to a modem and thereby to any networks that the user might have access to. In the early days, these were scarce, but expanded significantly with the development of bulletin board systems. There is also a third-party <a href="Motorola%206809">6809</a> card that allows <a href="OS-9">OS-9</a> Level One to be run. Third-party <a href="Apple%20II%20sound%20cards">sound cards</a> greatly improve audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. <a href="Apple%20II%20accelerators">Apple II accelerator cards</a> double or quadruple the computer's speed.

Jesse Adams Stein wrote, "As the first company to release a 'consumer appliance' micro-computer, Apple Computer offers us a clear view of this shift from a "machine" to an "appliance"." But the company also had "to negotiate the attitudes of its potential buyers, bearing in mind social anxieties about the uptake of new technologies in multiple contexts. The office, the home and the 'office-in-the-home' were implicated in these changing spheres of gender stereotypes and technological development." After seeing a crude, <a href="wire-wrapped">wire-wrapped</a> prototype demonstrated by Wozniak and <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> in November 1976, "Byte" predicted in April 1977 that the Apple II "may be the first product to fully qualify as the 'appliance computer' ... a completed system which is purchased off the retail shelf, taken home, plugged in and used". The computer's color graphics capability especially impressed the magazine. The magazine published a favorable review of the computer in March 1978, concluding, "For the user that wants color graphics, the Apple II is the only practical choice available in the 'appliance' computer class".

"<a href="Personal%20Computer%20World">Personal Computer World</a>" in August 1978 also cited the color capability as a strength, stating that "the prime reason that anyone buys an Apple II must surely be for the colour graphics". While mentioning the "oddity" of the artifact colors that produced output "that is not always what one wishes to do", it noted that "no-one has colour graphics like this at this sort of price". The magazine praised the sophisticated monitor software, user expandability, and comprehensive documentation, and concluded that "the Apple II is a very promising machine" which "would be even more of a temptation were its price slightly lower ... for the moment, colour is an Apple II".

Although it sold well from the launch, the initial market was to hobbyists, games players and computer enthusiasts. Sales expanded exponentially into the business and professional market when the spreadsheet program <a href="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a> was launched in mid-1979. VisiCalc is credited as being the defining "<a href="killer%20app">killer app</a>" in the microcomputer industry.

During the first five years of operations, revenues doubled about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%. During this period the sole products of the company were the Apple II and its peripherals, accessories and software.

Alexis Korner

Alexis Andrew Nicholas Koerner (19 April 1928 – 1 January 1984) was a British <a href="blues">blues</a> musician and radio broadcaster, who has sometimes been referred to as "a founding father of <a href="British%20blues">British blues</a>". A major influence on the sound of the British music scene in the 1960s, Korner was instrumental in bringing together various English blues musicians.

Koerner was born in Paris, to an Austrian Jewish father and a Greek mother. He spent his childhood in France, Switzerland and North Africa and arrived in London in 1940 at the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. One memory of his youth was listening to a record by black pianist <a href="Jimmy%20Yancey">Jimmy Yancey</a> during a German <a href="Strategic%20bombing">air raid</a>. Korner said, "From then on all I wanted to do was play the blues."

After the war, Korner played piano and guitar (his first guitar was built by friend and author Sydney Hopkins, who wrote "<a href="Mister%20God%2C%20This%20Is%20Anna">Mister God, This Is Anna</a>") and in 1949 joined <a href="Chris%20Barber">Chris Barber</a>'s Jazz Band where he met blues harmonica player <a href="Cyril%20Davies">Cyril Davies</a>. They started playing together as a duo, started the influential London Blues and Barrelhouse Club in 1955 and made their first record together in 1957. Korner made his first official record on <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a> DFE 6286 in the company of <a href="Ken%20Colyer">Ken Colyer</a>'s <a href="Skiffle">Skiffle</a> Group. His talent extended to playing <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a> on one of the tracks of this rare British <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a>, recorded in London on 28 July 1955. Korner brought many American blues artists, previously virtually unknown in Britain, to perform.

In 1961, Korner and Davies formed <a href="Blues%20Incorporated">Blues Incorporated</a>, initially a loose-knit group of musicians with a shared love of <a href="electric%20blues">electric blues</a> and <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> music. The group included, at various times, <a href="Charlie%20Watts">Charlie Watts</a>, <a href="Jack%20Bruce">Jack Bruce</a>, <a href="Ginger%20Baker">Ginger Baker</a>, <a href="Long%20John%20Baldry">Long John Baldry</a>, <a href="Graham%20Bond">Graham Bond</a>, <a href="Danny%20Thompson">Danny Thompson</a> and <a href="Dick%20Heckstall-Smith">Dick Heckstall-Smith</a>. It also attracted a wider crowd of mostly younger fans, some of whom occasionally performed with the group, including <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>, <a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a>, <a href="Brian%20Jones">Brian Jones</a>, <a href="Geoff%20Bradford%20%28musician%29">Geoff Bradford</a>, <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a>, <a href="John%20Mayall">John Mayall</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Page">Jimmy Page</a>.

Although Cyril Davies left the group in late 1962, Blues Incorporated continued to record, with Korner at the helm, until 1966. However, by that time its originally stellar line-up (and crowd of followers) had mostly left to start their own bands. "While his one-time acolytes the Rolling Stones and <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a> made the front pages of music magazines all over the world, Korner was relegated to the role of 'elder statesman'."

Although he himself was a blues purist, Korner criticised better-known British blues musicians during the blues boom of the late 1960s for their blind adherence to <a href="Chicago%20blues">Chicago blues</a>, as if the music came in no other form. He liked to surround himself with <a href="jazz">jazz</a> musicians and often performed with a <a href="horn%20section">horn section</a> drawn from a pool that included, among others, saxophone players <a href="Art%20Themen">Art Themen</a>, <a href="Mel%20Collins">Mel Collins</a>, <a href="Dick%20Heckstall-Smith">Dick Heckstall-Smith</a>, <a href="Lol%20Coxhill">Lol Coxhill</a>, <a href="Dick%20Morrissey">Dick Morrissey</a>, <a href="John%20Surman">John Surman</a> and <a href="trombonist">trombonist</a> <a href="Mike%20Zwerin">Mike Zwerin</a>.

In the 1960s Korner began a media career, working initially as a show business interviewer and then on <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a>'s "Five O'Clock Club", a children's TV show. Korner also wrote about blues for the music papers, and continued to maintain his own career as a blues artist, especially in Europe.

On 17 October 1967, Korner interviewed <a href="The%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience">The Jimi Hendrix Experience</a> for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> radio show "<a href="Top%20Gear%20%28radio%20show%29">Top Gear</a>". Some of these tracks, including audio of Korner himself, appear on the Hendrix double-CD "<a href="BBC%20Sessions%20%28The%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience%20album%29">BBC Sessions</a>", including Korner playing slide guitar on "<a href="%28I%27m%20Your%29%20Hoochie%20Coochie%20Man">(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man</a>".

While touring <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> he formed the band New Church with guitarist and singer <a href="Peter%20Thorup">Peter Thorup</a>. They subsequently were one of the support bands at the <a href="Stones%20in%20the%20Park">Rolling Stones Free Concert</a> in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>, London, on 5 July 1969. <a href="Jimmy%20Page">Jimmy Page</a> reportedly found out about a new singer, <a href="Robert%20Plant">Robert Plant</a>, who had been jamming with Korner, who wondered why Plant had not yet been discovered. Plant and Korner were recording an album with Plant on vocals until Page had asked him to join "the New <a href="Yardbirds">Yardbirds</a>", a.k.a. <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>. Only two songs are in circulation from these recordings: "Steal Away" and "Operator". Korner gave one of his last radio interviews to BBC Midlands on the "Record Collectors Show" with Mike Adams and Chris Savory.

In 1970 Korner and Thorup formed a big-band ensemble, <a href="C.%20C.%20S.%20%28pop%20group%29">CCS</a> – short for "The Collective Consciousness Society" – which had several hit singles produced by <a href="Mickie%20Most">Mickie Most</a>, including a version of <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s "<a href="Whole%20Lotta%20Love">Whole Lotta Love</a>", which was used as the theme for BBC's "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>" between 1971 and 1981. Another instrumental called "Brother" was used as the theme to the <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> Top 20/40 when <a href="Tom%20Browne%20%28broadcaster%20and%20actor%29">Tom Browne</a>/<a href="Simon%20Bates">Simon Bates</a> presented the programme in the 1970s. It was also used in the 1990s on Radio Luxembourg for the Top 20 Singles chart. This was the period of Korner's greatest commercial success in the UK.

In 1973, he and Peter Thorup formed another group, Snape, with <a href="Boz%20Burrell">Boz Burrell</a>, <a href="Mel%20Collins">Mel Collins</a>, and <a href="Ian%20Wallace%20%28drummer%29">Ian Wallace</a>, who were previously together in <a href="King%20Crimson">King Crimson</a>. Korner also played on <a href="B.B.%20King">B.B. King</a>'s "In London" album, and cut his own, similar "supersession" album; "Get Off My Cloud", with <a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a>, <a href="Steve%20Marriott">Steve Marriott</a>, <a href="Peter%20Frampton">Peter Frampton</a>, <a href="Nicky%20Hopkins">Nicky Hopkins</a> and members of <a href="Joe%20Cocker">Joe Cocker</a>'s <a href="The%20Grease%20Band">Grease Band</a>. In the mid-1970s, while touring Germany, Korner established an intensive working relationship with bassist <a href="Colin%20Hodgkinson">Colin Hodgkinson</a> who played for the support act <a href="Back%20Door%20%28jazz%20trio%29">Back Door</a>. They would continue to collaborate right up until Korner's death.

In the 1970s Korner's main career was in broadcasting. In 1973 he presented a unique 6-part documentary on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>, "The Rolling Stones Story", and in 1977 he established a Sunday-night blues and soul show on Radio 1, "Alexis Korner's Blues and Soul Show", which ran until 1981. He also used his gravelly voice to great effect as an advertising voice-over artist. In 1978, for Korner's 50th birthday, an all-star concert was held featuring many of his above-mentioned friends, as well as <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="Paul%20Jones%20%28singer%29">Paul Jones</a>, <a href="Chris%20Farlowe">Chris Farlowe</a>, <a href="Zoot%20Money">Zoot Money</a> and others, which was later released as "<a href="The%20Party%20Album%20%28Alexis%20Korner%20album%29">The Party Album</a>", and as a video.

In 1981, Korner joined another "supergroup", <a href="Rocket%2088%20%28band%29">Rocket 88</a>, a project led by <a href="Ian%20Stewart%20%28musician%29">Ian Stewart</a> based on <a href="boogie-woogie">boogie-woogie</a> keyboard players, which featured a <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a> comprising <a href="Jack%20Bruce">Jack Bruce</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Watts">Charlie Watts</a>, among others, as well as a <a href="horn%20section">horn section</a>. They toured Europe and released an album on <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a>. He played in Italy with <a href="Paul%20Jones%20%28singer%29">Paul Jones</a> and the Blues Society of Italian bluesman Guido Toffoletti.


In 1950, Korner married Roberta Melville, daughter of art critic <a href="Robert%20Melville%20%28art%20critic%29">Robert Melville</a>. Korner died of <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> aged 55 years, on 1 January 1984.

Assault gun

An assault gun is a form of <a href="self-propelled%20artillery">self-propelled artillery</a> which utilizes an <a href="infantry%20support%20gun">infantry support gun</a> mounted on a motorized chassis, normally an <a href="armored%20fighting%20vehicle">armored fighting vehicle</a>. Assault guns are designed to provide <a href="direct%20fire">direct fire support</a> for <a href="infantry">infantry</a> attacks, especially against other infantry or <a href="fortified">fortified</a> positions. The term is a literal translation of the German word "Sturmgeschütz", which was applied to the first purpose-built assault gun, the <a href="StuG%20III">StuG III</a>, in 1940.

Historically, the concept of assault guns was very similar to that of the <a href="infantry%20tank">infantry tank</a>, as both were combat vehicles intended to accompany infantry formations into battle. However, during World War II assault guns were more mobile than tanks and could be utilized as both direct and indirect fire artillery. Although they could approximate the firepower of a tank, assault guns mostly fired <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29%23HE-Frag">high explosive</a> shells at relatively low velocities, which were well suited for their role of knocking out hard points such as fortified positions and buildings. They were not intended to be deployed as tank substitutes or dedicated <a href="tank%20destroyer">tank destroyer</a>s. Nevertheless, as the conflict progressed, the increasing proliferation of tanks on the battlefield forced many assault gun units to engage armor in defense of the infantry, and led to armies becoming more dependent on multipurpose designs which combined the traditionally separate roles of an assault gun and a tank destroyer.

German and Soviet assault guns introduced during World War II usually carried their main armament in a fully enclosed <a href="casemate">casemate</a> rather than a <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>. Although this limited the <a href="field%20of%20fire%20%28weaponry%29">field of fire</a> and traverse of the armament, it also had the advantage of a reduced silhouette and simplified the manufacturing process. The United States never developed a purpose-built assault gun during the war, although it did modify preexisting armored fighting vehicles for that role, including the <a href="M4%20Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> and <a href="M3%20Stuart">M5 Stuart</a> tanks and the <a href="M3%20Half-track">M3 Half-track</a>.

The assault gun concept was largely abandoned during the postwar era in favor of tanks or multipurpose tank destroyers attached to infantry formations which were also capable of providing direct fire support as needed. In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and most Western countries, the assault gun ceased to be recognized as a unique niche, with individual examples being classified either as a self-propelled howitzer or a tank. The Soviet Union continued funding development of new assault guns as late as 1967, although few of its postwar designs were adopted in large numbers. In Soviet and other Eastern European armies, the traditional assault gun was primarily superseded by tank destroyers such as the <a href="SU-100">SU-100</a> capable of supporting either infantry or armor.

Assault guns were primarily used during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> by the forces of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Early in the war, the <a href="Germans">Germans</a> began to create makeshift assault guns by mounting their <a href="infantry%20support%20weapon">infantry support weapon</a>s on the bed of a <a href="truck">truck</a> or on obsolete <a href="tank">tank</a>s with the turret removed. Later in the war, both the Germans and the Soviets introduced fully <a href="armoured%20warfare">armoured</a> purpose-built assault guns into their arsenals.

Early on, the Soviets built the <a href="KV-2">KV-2</a>, a variant of the <a href="KV-1%20%28tank%29">KV-1</a> heavy tank with a short-barrelled <a href="152%20mm%20howitzer-gun%20M1937%20%28ML-20%29">152 mm howitzer</a> mounted in an oversized turret. This was not a success in battle, and was replaced with a very successful series of turretless assault guns: the <a href="SU-76">SU-76</a>, <a href="SU-122">SU-122</a>, and the heavy <a href="SU-152">SU-152</a>, which were followed by the <a href="ISU-122">ISU-122</a> and <a href="ISU-152">ISU-152</a> on the new <a href="Iosif%20Stalin%20tank">IS</a> heavy tank <a href="chassis">chassis</a>.

The primary German assault gun was the "<a href="Sturmgesch%C3%BCtz%20III">Sturmgeschütz III</a>" (StuG III). At about the same time (March 1942) as the howitzer-like KwK 37 gun was dropped from the Panzer IV's use, its "Sturmkanone" equivalent in the StuG III up to that time, was likewise replaced with a longer-barreled, high-velocity dual-purpose <a href="7.5%20cm%20KwK%2040">75mm gun</a> that had also been derived from the successful <a href="PaK%2040">PaK 40</a> anti-tank towed artillery piece. blurred the line between assault guns and <a href="tank%20destroyer">tank destroyer</a>s and were the Wehrmacht's most-produced armoured fighting vehicle, at some 9,400 examples. The Germans also built a number of other fully armoured turretless assault guns, including the <a href="StuG%20IV">StuG IV</a>, "<a href="Brummb%C3%A4r">Brummbär</a>" and "<a href="Sturmtiger">Sturmtiger</a>". The latter two were very heavy vehicles, and were built only in small quantities.

<a href="Battalions">Battalions</a> of assault guns, usually StuG IIIs, commonly replaced the intended <a href="panzer">panzer</a> battalion in the German <a href="panzergrenadier">panzergrenadier</a> <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> due to the chronic shortage of tanks, and were sometimes used as makeshifts even in the <a href="panzer%20division">panzer division</a>s. Independent battalions were also deployed as "stiffeners" for <a href="infantry">infantry</a> divisions, and the StuG III's <a href="anti-tank">anti-tank</a> capabilities bolstered dwindling tank numbers on the Eastern and Western fronts.

US and UK forces also deployed vehicles designed for a close support role, but these were conventional tanks whose only significant modification was the replacement of the main gun with a howitzer. Two versions of the American <a href="M4%20Sherman">Sherman tank</a> were armed with the <a href="M101%20howitzer">M4 105 mm howitzer</a>, the M4(105) and the M4A3(105); these were designated assault guns in US usage of the term. The <a href="M8%20Scott">M8 Scott</a>, based on the chassis of the <a href="M5%20Stuart">M5 Stuart</a> light tank, was also an assault cannon and carried a <a href="M116%20howitzer">75 mm short howitzer</a>. The <a href="Churchill%20tank">Churchill</a>, <a href="Cromwell%20tank">Centaur</a> and <a href="Cromwell%20tank">Cromwell</a> tanks were all produced in versions armed with <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2095%20mm%20Howitzer">95 mm howitzers</a>: the Churchill Mark V and Mark VIII, the Centaur Mark IV and the Cromwell Mark VI. Earlier British tanks, such as the <a href="Crusader%20tank">Crusader cruiser tank</a> and the <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda II Infantry tank</a> were produced in versions armed with the <a href="Ordnance%20QF%203-inch%20howitzer">3-inch howitzer</a>; the first versions of the Churchill tank also had this gun in a hull mounting. American <a href="tank%20destroyer">tank destroyer</a> units were often used in the assault gun role for infantry support.

The AVRE version of the Churchill Tank was armed with a <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29%23Spigot%20mortar">Spigot mortar</a> that fired a <a href="High%20explosive">HE</a>-filled projectile (nicknamed the "Flying Dustbin") . Its task was to attack fortified positions such as <a href="bunker">bunker</a>s at close range (see <a href="Hobart%27s%20Funnies">Hobart's Funnies</a>).

In the post-<a href="World%20War%20II">WWII</a> era, vehicles fitting into an "assault gun" category were developed as a light-weight, air-deployable, direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops. Current weapons were either based on <a href="jeep">jeep</a>s or small <a href="Caterpillar%20track">tracked</a> vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at a distinct disadvantage in terms of heavy weapons. The Soviet Union and the United States were the most attracted to the idea of providing this capability to traditionally light airborne forces. Their answers to the problem were similar, with the United States developing the <a href="M56%20Scorpion">M56 Scorpion</a> and the Soviet Union developing the <a href="ASU-57">ASU-57</a>, both essentially air-droppable light anti-tank guns.

The Soviets went on to develop an improved air-droppable assault gun, the <a href="ASU-85">ASU-85</a>, which served through the 1980s, while their <a href="SU-100">SU-100</a> remained in service with Communist countries, including Vietnam and Cuba, years after World War II. The US M56 and another armoured vehicle, the <a href="Ontos">M50 Ontos</a>, were to be the last of the more traditional assault guns in US service. Improvised arrangements such as <a href="M113%20Armored%20Personnel%20Carrier%23Weapons">M113</a> personnel carriers with recoilless rifles were quickly replaced by missile carrier vehicles in the anti-tank role.

The only vehicle with the qualities of an assault gun to be fielded after the removal of the M50 and M56 from service within the US military was the <a href="M551%20Sheridan">M551 Sheridan</a>. The Sheridan's gun was a low-velocity weapon suitable in the assault role, but with the addition of the <a href="Shillelagh%20missile">Shillelagh missile</a> could double in the anti-tank role as well. The Sheridan, however, was not developed as an assault gun but as a light reconnaissance vehicle.

Currently there appears to be a move toward wheeled vehicles fitting a "tank destroyer" or "assault gun" role, such as the <a href="M1128%20Mobile%20Gun%20System">M1128 Mobile Gun System</a> of the <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a>, the <a href="Centauro">Centauro</a> Wheeled Tank Destroyer of the <a href="Italian%20Army">Italian</a> and <a href="Spanish%20Army">Spanish Armies</a>, the Chinese anti-tank gun PTL-02 and ZBL08 assault gun, and the French <a href="AMX%2010%20RC">AMX 10 RC</a> heavy armoured car. While these vehicles might be useful in a direct fire role, none were developed with this specifically in mind, reminiscent of the use of tank destroyers by the US military in the assault gun role during World War II.

Tank destroyer

A tank destroyer or tank hunter is a type of <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured fighting vehicle</a>, armed with a direct-fire artillery <a href="Tank%20gun">gun</a> or missile launcher, with limited operational capacities and designed specifically to engage enemy <a href="tank">tank</a>s.

Tanks are <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured fighting vehicle</a>s designed for <a href="front-line">front-line</a> combat, combining <a href="operational%20mobility">operational mobility</a> and <a href="Military%20tactics">tactical</a> offensive and defensive capabilities; tanks perform all primary tasks of the armoured troops. The tank destroyer on the other hand is specifically designed to take on enemy tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles. Many are based on a <a href="Continuous%20track">tracked</a> tank <a href="chassis">chassis</a>, while others are wheeled.

Since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, gun-armed tank destroyers have fallen out of favor as armies have favored multirole <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a>s. However, lightly armored <a href="Anti-tank%20missile">anti-tank guided missile</a> (ATGM) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank work. The resurgence of <a href="expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary warfare</a> in the first two decades of the 21st century has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles, sometimes called "protected gun systems", which may bear a superficial resemblance to tank destroyers, but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low-intensity operations such as the wars in <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq</a> and <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Afghanistan</a>.

Dedicated anti-tank vehicles made their first major appearance in the Second World War as combatants developed effective armored vehicles and tactics. Some were little more than stopgap solutions, mounting an <a href="anti-tank%20gun">anti-tank gun</a> on a tracked vehicle to give mobility, while others were more sophisticated designs. An example of the development of tank destroyer technology throughout the war are the <a href="Marder%20III">Marder III</a> and <a href="Hetzer">Jagdpanzer 38</a> vehicle, that were very different in spite of being based on the same chassis: Marder was straightforwardly an anti-tank gun on tracks whereas the Jagdpanzer 38 traded some firepower (its <a href="7.5%20cm%20PaK%2039">Pak 39</a>, designed to operate within the confines of a fully armored fighting compartment, fires the same projectiles from a reduced propellant charge compared to Marder's <a href="7.5%20cm%20Pak%2040">Pak 40</a>) for better armor protection and ease of concealment on the battlefield.

Except for most American designs, tank destroyers were all turretless and had fixed or <a href="casemate">casemate</a> superstructures. When a tank destroyer was used against enemy tanks from a defensive position such as by ambush, the common lack of a rotating <a href="Gun%20turret%23Combat%20vehicles">turret</a> was not particularly critical, while the lower silhouette was highly desirable. The turretless design allowed accommodation of a more powerful gun, typically a dedicated anti-tank gun (in lieu of a regular tank's general-purpose <a href="tank%20gun">main gun</a> that fired both anti-tank and high explosive ammunition) that had a longer barrel than could be mounted in a turreted tank on the same chassis. The lack of a turret increased the vehicle's internal volume, allowing for increased ammunition stowage and crew comfort. Eliminating the turret let the vehicle carry thicker armor, and also let this armour be concentrated in the hull. Sometimes there was no armored roof (only a weather cover) to keep the overall weight down to the limit that the chassis could bear. The absence of a turret meant that tank destroyers could be manufactured significantly cheaper, faster, and more easily than the tanks on which they were based, and they found particular favor when production resources were lacking. After hard lessons early in the war, machine guns were mounted for use against infantry, but the limited traverse of the mounting meant that they were still less effective than those used on turreted tanks.

Variants of the Polish <a href="TKS">TKS</a> and <a href="TK-3">TK-3</a> tankettes up-armed with 20 mm gun (23–26 vehicles) were operationally deployed in the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a>. They were used as an anti-tank component of the reconnaissance units.

Due to the quick defeat of France, few French vehicles were built. The Laffly W15 TCC ("Chasseur de char") was an attempt to quickly build a light tank destroyer by mounting a 47 mm SA37 anti-tank gun onto a lightly armored <a href="Laffly%20S15">Laffly W15T</a> artillery tractor. Other French tank destroyers were being developed, including the SOMUA SAu-40, ARL V39 and various ad hoc conversions of the <a href="Lorraine%2037L">Lorraine 37L</a>.

The first <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> tank destroyers were the "<a href="Panzerj%C3%A4ger">Panzerjäger</a>" ("tank hunters"), which mounted an existing anti-tank gun on a convenient chassis for mobility, usually with just a three-sided <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a> for crew protection. For instance, 202 obsolete <a href="Panzer%20I">Panzer I</a> light tanks were modified by removing the turret and were rebuilt as the <a href="Panzerj%C3%A4ger%20I">Panzerjäger I</a> self-propelled <a href="4%2C7cm%20KP%C3%9AV%20vz.%2038">4.7 cm PaK(t)</a>. Similarly, <a href="Panzer%20II">Panzer II</a> tanks were used on the eastern front. Captured Soviet anti-tank guns were mounted on modified Panzer II chassis, producing the <a href="Marder%20II">Marder II</a> self-propelled anti-tank gun. The most common mounting was a German anti-tank gun on the Czech <a href="Panzer%2038%28t%29">Panzer 38(t)</a> chassis to produce the <a href="Marder%20III">Marder III</a>. The Panzer 38(t) chassis was also used to make the <a href="Hetzer">Jagdpanzer 38</a> casemate style tank destroyer. The Panzerjäger series continued up to the equipped <a href="Nashorn">Nashorn</a>.

German tank destroyers based on the <a href="Panzer%20III">Panzer III</a> and later German tanks were unique in that they had more armor than their tank counterparts. One of the more successful German tank destroyers was actually designed as a self-propelled artillery gun, the <a href="Sturmgesch%C3%BCtz%20III">Sturmgeschütz III</a>. Based on the Panzer III tank chassis, the Sturmgeschütz III was originally fitted with a low-velocity gun, and was assigned to the artillery arm for infantry fire support. Later, after encountering Soviet tanks, it was refitted with a comparatively short-barreled high-velocity anti-tank gun, usually with a <a href="muzzle%20brake">muzzle brake</a>, enabling it to function as a tank destroyer. The "Sturmgeschütz III" from its 1938 origin used a new casemate-style superstructure with an integrated design similar to the later "<a href="Jagdpanzer">Jagdpanzer</a>" to completely enclose the crew. It was employed in infantry support and offensive armored operations as well as in the defensive anti-tank role. The StuG III was the most-produced German armored fighting vehicle of any type built during the war years, with some 10,000 examples built from January 1940 through March 1945.

Although the early German "Panzerjäger" carried more effective weapons than the tanks on which they were based, they were generally lacking in protection for the crew, having thinly armored open-topped superstructures. The "open-topped" design format of the "Panzerjäger" vehicles was succeeded by the "Jagdpanzer" '("hunting tanks"), which mounted the gun in true casemate-style superstructures, completely enclosing the crew compartment in armor that was usually integral to the hull. The first of these "Jagdpanzer"s was the 70-ton "Ferdinand" (later renamed "<a href="Elefant">Elefant</a>"), based on the chassis, hulls, and drive systems of ninety-one Porsche <a href="VK%204501%20%28P%29">VK4501 (P)</a> heavy tanks, mounting a long-barreled <a href="8.8%20cm%20Pak%2043">88 mm</a> cannon in an added casemate, more like the earlier "Panzerjägers" had with their added-on armor shielding for the gun crew, but in the "Ferdinand" completely enclosing the gun and firing crew in the added casemate, as the later purpose-built "Jagdpanzers" would. However, the "Ferdinand" was mechanically unreliable and difficult to maneuver, and once all ninety-one unturreted "Porsche Tiger" hulls/drive systems were converted, no more were built. The German Army had more success with the <a href="Jagdpanther">Jagdpanther</a>. Introduced in mid-1944, the Jagdpanther, of which some 415 examples were produced, was considered the best of the casemate-design Jagdpanzer designs. It featured the same powerful PaK 43 88 mm cannon used on the unwieldy "Elefant", now fitted to the chassis of the medium <a href="Panther%20tank">Panther tank</a>, providing greatly improved armor-penetrating capability in a medium-weight vehicle.
Facing an increasingly defensive war, the German Army turned to larger and more powerfully armed Jagdpanzer designs, and in July 1944 the first "<a href="Jagdtiger">Jagdtiger</a>" rolled off the production line; it was the heaviest German armored fighting vehicle to go into active service. The "Jagdtiger" featured a huge <a href="12.8%20cm%20Pak%2044">128 mm PaK 44</a> cannon and heavy armor protection. Only 88 "Jagdtiger" vehicles were produced, barely matching the total number of the earlier Ferdinand/Elefant vehicles. They were first deployed to combat units in September 1944.

The decision of German armored vehicle designers to use a casemate-style superstructure for all tank destroyers had the advantage of a reduced silhouette, allowing the crew to more frequently fire from defilade ambush positions. Such designs were also easier and faster to manufacture and offered good crew protection from artillery fire and shell splinters. However, the lack of a rotating turret limited the gun's traverse to a few degrees. This meant that the driver normally had to turn the entire tank onto its target, a much slower process than simply rotating a powered turret. If the vehicle became immobilized due to engine failure or track damage, it could not rotate its gun to counter opposing tanks, making it highly vulnerable to counterfire. This vulnerability was later exploited by opposing tank forces. Even the largest and most powerful of German tank destroyers were found abandoned on the field after a battle, having been immobilized by one or more hits by high explosive (HE) or armor-piercing (AP) shells to the track or front drive sprocket.

The most famous Italian tank destroyer of the Second World War was technically not a tank destroyer, but self-propelled artillery. The <a href="Semovente%20da%2075/18">Semovente da 75/18</a>, based on the <a href="M13/40">M13/40</a> frame, was developed to support front-line infantry, and therefore has fixed armament: a 75 mm gun in casemate. However, thanks to its low height (185 cm) and the caliber of its gun the 75/18 also had good results in anti-tank combat, fighting against British and American (but not Soviet) units. After the Armistice of 1943, the 75/18 remained in use by German forces until Italy's liberation.

Built on the same frame, the <a href="Semovente%20da%20105/25">Semovente da 105/25</a> was equipped with a 105 mm gun and known as "bassotto" (Italian for <a href="dachshund">dachshund</a>) due to its lower height. As manufacturing began in 1943, the 105/25 was used by German forces. A further development was the <a href="Semovente%20da%2075/46">Semovente da 75/46</a>, which had a longer gun than the 75/18 and inclined armour 100 mm thick, making it similar to <a href="Sturmgesch%C3%BCtz%20III">Sturmgeschütz III</a>. Only 11 of these were manufactured.

Before the Semovente da 75/18, the <a href="Semovente%20da%2047/32">L40</a>, built on an <a href="L6/40">L6/40</a> frame, saw action in Africa and in Russia, but with disappointing results.

As of 2017, Italian forces use the wheeled tank destroyer <a href="B1%20Centauro">Centauro</a>, armed with a 105 or 120 mm gun.

As with the Germans of 1943, most of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> designs mounted anti-tank guns, with limited traverse in casemate-style turretless hulls, in a general design format looking much like the Germans' own "Jagdpanzer" vehicles. The results were smaller, lighter, and simpler to build weapons that could carry larger guns than any contemporary tank, including the King Tiger. The Soviets produced high numbers of the <a href="SU-85">SU-85</a> and <a href="SU-100">SU-100</a> self-propelled guns based on the same chassis as the <a href="T-34">T-34</a> medium tank; the heavier-duty powertrain and hull of the <a href="IS-2">IS-2</a> heavy tank were instead used to produce the heavier-hitting -armed <a href="ISU-122">ISU-122</a> and -armed <a href="ISU-152">ISU-152</a>, both of which had impressive anti-tank capabilities earning each of them the Russian nickname "Zveroboy" ("beast killer") for their ability to destroy German <a href="Tiger%20I%20tank">Tigers</a>, <a href="Panther%20tank">Panthers</a> and <a href="Elefant">Elefant</a>s. The predecessor of the ISU 152 was the <a href="SU-152">SU-152</a>, built on the KV-1s chassis and shared many similarities (including its gun) with the ISU-152. The ISU-152 built as a heavy assault gun, relied on the weight of the shell fired from its M-1937/43 howitzer to defeat tanks. In 1943, the Soviets also shifted all production of light tanks like the <a href="T-70">T-70</a> to much simpler and better-armed <a href="SU-76">SU-76</a> self-propelled guns, which used the same drive train. The SU-76 was originally designed as an anti-tank vehicle, but was soon relegated to the infantry-support role.

<a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> and counterpart <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> designs were very different in conception. U.S. doctrine was based, in light of the <a href="fall%20of%20France">fall of France</a>, on the perceived need to defeat German <a href="blitzkrieg">blitzkrieg</a> tactics, and U.S. units expected to face large numbers of German tanks, attacking on relatively narrow fronts. These were "expected" to break through a thin screen of anti-tank guns, hence the decision that the main anti-tank units—the <a href="Tank%20destroyer%20battalion%20%28United%20States%29">Tank Destroyer (TD) battalions</a>—should be concentrated and very mobile. In actual practice, such German attacks rarely happened. Throughout the war, only one battalion ever fought in an engagement like that originally envisaged (the <a href="601st%20Tank%20Destroyer%20Battalion">601st</a>, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20El%20Guettar">Battle of El Guettar</a>). The Tank Destroyer Command eventually numbered over 100,000 men and 80 battalions each equipped with 36 self-propelled tank destroyers or towed guns.
Only <a href="Shoot-and-scoot">a few shots were expected to be fired from any firing position</a>. Strong reconnaissance elements were provided so that TDs could use pre-arranged firing positions to best advantage. <a href="Flanking%20fire">Flanking fire</a> by TDs was emphasized, both to penetrate thinner enemy side armor, and to reduce the likelihood of accurate enemy return fire.

All American tank destroyers were officially known by exactly the same collective term used for American self-propelled artillery ordnance, "gun motor carriage". The designs were intended to be very mobile and heavily armed. Most of the tank-hull based designs used special open-topped turrets, of a differing design to the original tank it was based on, which was meant to both save weight and to accommodate a larger gun. The earliest expedient design was an <a href="M3%20Half-track">M3 Half-track</a> mounting an M1897 gun in a limited-traverse mount, and called the <a href="M3%20GMC">75 mm Gun Motor Carriage M3</a>. Another, considerably less successful, early design mounted a 37-mm anti-tank gun in the bed of a Dodge 3/4-ton truck - the <a href="M6%20Fargo">37-mm GMC M6</a>. By far the most common US design, and the first that was fully tracked and turreted (which became the American hallmark of World War II "tank destroyer" design) was the <a href="M10%20Tank%20Destroyer">3in Gun Motor Carriage M10</a>, later supplemented by the <a href="M36%20tank%20destroyer">90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36</a> - both based on the <a href="M4%20Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> hull and powertrain - and the <a href="M18%20Hellcat">76 mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 (Hellcat)</a>, based on a unique hull and powertrain design, with a slight visual resemblance to what was used for the later <a href="M24%20Chaffee">M24 Chaffee</a> light tank. The M18 came closest to the US ideal; the vehicle was very fast, small, and mounted a gun in a roofless open turret. The M36 Jackson GMC possessed the only American-origin operational gun that could rival <a href="8.8%20cm%20Pak%2043">the vaunted 88 mm</a> German anti-tank ordnance, the <a href="90%20mm%20Gun%20M1/M2/M3">90 mm M3 gun</a>, and the M36 remained in service well after World War II. The only dedicated American-origin, casemate hull design fighting vehicle of any type built during the war, that resembled the German and Soviet tank destroyers in hull and general gun mounting design, was the experimental <a href="T28%20Super%20Heavy%20Tank">T28 Super Heavy Tank</a>, which mounted a 105 mm T5E1 long-barrel cannon, which had a maximum firing range of 12 miles (20 km), and was originally designed as a self-propelled assault gun to breach Germany's <a href="Siegfried%20Line">Siegfried Line</a> defenses.

Of these tank destroyers, only the gun of the M36 proved effective against the frontal armor of Germans' larger armored vehicles at long range. The open top and light armor made these tank destroyers vulnerable to anything greater than small-arms fire. As the number of German tanks encountered by American forces steadily decreased throughout the war, most battalions were split up and assigned to infantry units as supporting arms, fighting as <a href="assault%20gun">assault gun</a>s or being used essentially as tanks. In this sense they were an alternative to the <a href="Independent%20tank%20battalion">Independent tank battalion</a>s that were attached to various Infantry Divisions.

The expectation that German tanks would be engaged in mass formation was a failed assumption. In reality, German attacks effectively used <a href="combined%20arms">combined arms</a> on the ground, fighting cohesively. American tank destroyer battalions comprised three tank destroyer companies supported by nine security sections. The single-purpose tactics of the tank destroyer battalion failed to account for non-tank threats.

British tanks in the early years of the war, both infantry and cruiser, were (with the exception of the pre-war Matilda I design) equipped with a gun capable of use against contemporary enemy tanks - the 40 mm <a href="Ordnance%20QF%202%20pounder">Ordnance QF 2 pounder</a>. This was replaced with the 57 mm <a href="Ordnance%20QF%206%20pounder">Ordnance QF 6 pounder</a> when that became available. There was extra impetus given to the development of anti-tank weaponry, which culminated in the 76mm <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2017%20pounder">Ordnance QF 17 pounder</a>, widely considered one of the best anti-tank guns of the war.

Towed anti-tank guns were the domain of the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> rather than the <a href="Royal%20Armoured%20Corps">Royal Armoured Corps</a> and vehicles adapted to mount artillery, including anti-tank self-propelled guns such as the <a href="Deacon%20%28artillery%29">Deacon</a> (6pdr on an armoured wheeled truck chassis) and <a href="Archer%20%28tank%20destroyer%29">Archer</a> (17pdr on tracked chassis), were their preserve, as were US-supplied vehicles.

The self-propelled guns that were built in the "tank destroyer" mould came about through the desire to field the QF 17 pounder anti-tank gun and simultaneous lack of suitable standard tanks to carry it. As a result, they were of a somewhat extemporized nature. Mounting the gun on the <a href="Valentine%20tank">Valentine tank</a> chassis in a fixed superstructure gave the <a href="Archer%20%28tank%20destroyer%29">Archer</a>, looking somewhat like the light-chassis German <a href="Marder%20III">Marder III</a> in appearance. The 17 pounder was also used to re-equip the US-supplied <a href="M10%20Tank%20Destroyer">M10 Tank Destroyer</a>, replacing the American 3-inch gun to produce the <a href="17pdr%20SP%20Achilles">17pdr SP Achilles</a>.

While there was a general move to a general purpose gun that was usable against both tanks and in supporting infantry, there was a need to put the 17 pdr into a tank for use against the enemy's heavy tanks. The <a href="Cruiser%20Mk%20VIII%20Challenger">Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger</a> was a project to bring a 17 pdr tank into use to support the <a href="Cromwell%20tank">Cromwell cruiser tank</a>. Delays led to it being outnumbered in use by the <a href="Sherman%20Firefly">Sherman Firefly</a>—but a derivative of Challenger was the more or less open-topped variant "Avenger", which was delayed until post war before entering service. A cut-down 17 pdr - the 77mmHV was used to equip the <a href="Comet%20tank">Comet tank</a> in the last year of the war.

The closest the British came to developing an armored tank destroyer in the vein of the German Jagdpanzers or Soviet ISU series was the Churchill 3-inch Gun Carrier - a <a href="Churchill%20tank">Churchill tank</a> chassis with a boxy superstructure in place of the turret and mounting a <a href="QF%203-inch%2020%20cwt">3-inch anti-aircraft gun</a>. Although a number were ordered, they were not put into service as the immediate threat passed. The design was rejected in favor of developing a 17 pounder armed Cromwell tank variant, ultimately leading to the <a href="Comet%20tank">Comet tank</a>. The <a href="Tortoise%20%28tank%29">Tortoise</a> "heavy assault tank", intended for use in breaking through fixed defensive lines, was well armoured and had a very powerful 32-pounder (94 mm) gun, but did not reach service use.

By 1944, a number of the <a href="Sherman%20tank">Shermans</a> in British use were being converted to <a href="Sherman%20Fireflies">Sherman Fireflies</a> by adding the QF 17 pounder gun. Initially this gave each troop (platoon) of Shermans one powerfully armed tank. By war's end - through the production of more Fireflies and the replacement of Shermans by British tanks - about 50% of Shermans in British service were Fireflies.

During World War 2, the Romanians made some tank destroyers by removing the turrets of some of their tanks and adding them a compartment and a stronger gun that could face the new Soviet tanks that were much stronger than the Romanian ones. One of these tank destroyers was the <a href="TACAM%20T-60">TACAM T-60</a> created on the hull of the Soviet <a href="T-60">T-60</a> light tank by removing its turret and adding a compartment together with a <a href="76%20mm%20divisional%20gun%20M1936%20%28F-22%29">76,2 FL-22 L/51 model 1936</a> gun. Another tank destroyer was the <a href="TACAM%20R-2">TACAM R-2</a> created by removing the turret of the <a href="Panzer%2035%28t%29">R-2</a> light tank (name of the Czechoslovakian LT vz. 35 in the Romanian army) and adding to it a compartment together with a Soviet <a href="76%20mm%20divisional%20gun%20M1942%20%28ZiS-3%29">76.2mm ZiS-3 gun</a>. There were 21 pieces made of which 1 survived and can be found in the National Military Museum, Bucharest. The only turreted tank destroyer made by Romania was the <a href="Renault%20R35%23Romania">Vânătorul de care R-35</a>, created by extending the turret of the French <a href="Renault%20R35">Renault R-35</a> tank and adding to it a 45 mm gun instead of its <a href="Puteaux%20SA%2018">37 mm</a> gun. Another tank destroyer was the <a href="Mare%C5%9Fal%20tank%20destroyer">Mareşal</a>, which is credited with being the inspiration for the German Jagdpanzer 38(t). The first prototypes were made on a modified T-60 hull and were equipped with a <a href="122%20mm%20howitzer%20M1910/30">122 mm Soviet howitzer</a>. Other guns used were a <a href="76%20mm%20divisional%20gun%20M1942%20%28ZiS-3%29">Soviet 76 mm gun</a> and the Romanian <a href="75%20mm%20Re%C8%99i%C8%9Ba%20Model%201943">75 mm DT-UDR 26 Reşiţa</a>. The prototypes and plans were captured by the Soviets after they invaded Romania. Two planned tank destroyers were the <a href="TACAM%20R-1">TACAM R-1</a> and the <a href="TACAM%20T-38">TACAM T-38</a>.

In the face of the Warsaw Pact, a general need for extra firepower was identified. In the late 1960s, West Germany developed the <a href="Kanonenjagdpanzer">Kanonenjagdpanzer</a>, essentially a modernized World War II Jagdpanzer mounting a gun. As Soviet designs became more heavily armored, the gun became ineffective and the Kanonenjagdpanzers were retrofitted for different roles or retired. Some provisions were made for the fitting of a 105 mm cannon, and many of the vehicles were modified to fire <a href="Euromissile%20HOT">HOT</a> or <a href="TOW%20missile">TOW missile</a>s in place of a main gun. These upgraded variants remained in service into the 1990s.

With the development of flexible <a href="anti-tank%20missile">anti-tank missile</a>s, which were capable of installation on almost any vehicle in the 1960s, the concept of the tank destroyer has morphed into light vehicles with missiles. With the weight of <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a>s growing to the forty to seventy-tonne range, airborne forces were unable to deploy reasonable anti-tank forces. The result was a number of attempts to make a light vehicle, including the conventional <a href="ASU-85">ASU-85</a>, the recoilless rifle-armed <a href="Ontos">Ontos</a>, and missile-armed <a href="Malkara%20missile%23FV1620%20Humber%20Hornet">Hornet Malkara</a> armored car and <a href="M551%20Sheridan">Sheridan</a> light assault vehicle. The latest entry into that category is the <a href="2S25">2S25 Sprut-SD</a>, armed with a current-issue 125 mm tank gun that is also capable of launching missiles like the <a href="9M119%20Svir">9M119 Svir</a>.

Many forces' <a href="infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">infantry fighting vehicle</a>s (IFV) carry <a href="anti-tank%20missile">anti-tank missile</a>s in every infantry platoon, and <a href="attack%20helicopter">attack helicopter</a>s have also added anti-tank capability to the modern battlefield. But there are still dedicated anti-tank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, and ones intended for <a href="Airborne%20forces">airborne</a> use.
There have also been dedicated anti-tank vehicles built on ordinary <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armored personnel carrier</a> or <a href="armored%20car%20%28military%29">armored car</a> chassis. Examples include the U.S. <a href="M901%20ITV">M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle)</a> and the <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> <a href="NM142">NM142</a>, both on an <a href="M113%20armored%20personnel%20carrier">M113</a> chassis, several <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet</a> ATGM launchers based on the <a href="BRDM">BRDM</a> reconnaissance car, the British <a href="FV438%20Swingfire">FV438 Swingfire</a> and <a href="FV102%20Striker">FV102 Striker</a> and the <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="Raketenjagdpanzer">Raketenjagdpanzer</a> series built on the chassis of the <a href="HS%2030">HS 30</a> and <a href="Marder%20%28IFV%29">Marder</a> IFV.

A <a href="United%20States%20Army">US Army</a> combined arms battalion has two infantry companies with TOW missile-armed <a href="M2%20Bradley">Bradley IFVs</a> and can bring a large concentration of accurate and lethal fire to bear on an attacking enemy unit that uses AFVs. They can be complemented by mobile units of AH-64 Apache Helicopters armed with Hellfire antitank missiles.
Missile carrying vehicles however are referred to as <a href="anti-tank%20missile%20carriers">anti-tank missile carriers</a> instead of tank destroyers.

Some gun-armed tank destroyers remain in use. <a href="China">China</a> has developed the tracked <a href="Type%2089%20%28Tank%20Destroyer%29">PTZ89</a> and the wheeled <a href="PTL02">PTL02</a> tank destroyers. PTZ89 is armed with a smoothbore cannon while PTL02, developed by NORINCO for the PLA's new light (rapid reaction) mechanized infantry divisions, carries a one (a version armed with a 105 mm rifled gun is available for export). PTL02 is built on the 6×6 wheeled chassis of the <a href="WZ551">WZ551</a> APC.

<a href="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a> use the Italian-built <a href="Centauro">Centauro</a>, a wheeled tank destroyer with a cannon. The gun-armed tank destroyer might be revived in the US Army as the <a href="Stryker">Stryker</a>, more specifically, the <a href="M1128%20Mobile%20Gun%20System">M1128 Mobile Gun System</a>—a Stryker variant armed with a cannon with remote control and autoloading capabilities. Originally, the Canadian Forces considered replacing their aging <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a> tanks with the Stryker Mobile Gun System. But with increased use of <a href="Improvised%20explosive%20device">IEDs</a> capable of destroying Strykers by insurgent forces, they opted instead to purchase the <a href="Leopard%202">Leopard 2</a> tank.

Armored car (military)

A military armored (or armoured) car is a lightweight wheeled <a href="armored%20fighting%20vehicle">armored fighting vehicle</a>, historically employed for <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>, <a href="internal%20security">internal security</a>, armed escort, and other subordinate battlefield tasks. With the gradual decline of mounted <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>, armored cars were developed for carrying out duties formerly assigned to horsemen. Following the invention of the <a href="tank">tank</a>, the armored car remained popular due to its comparatively simplified maintenance and low production cost. It also found favor with several <a href="Colonial%20troops">colonial armies</a> as a cheaper weapon for use in underdeveloped regions. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, most armored cars were engineered for reconnaissance and passive observation, while others were devoted to communications tasks. Some equipped with heavier armament could even substitute for tracked combat vehicles in favorable conditions—such as pursuit or flanking maneuvers during the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>.

Since World War II the traditional functions of the armored car have been occasionally combined with that of the <a href="armored%20personnel%20carrier">armored personnel carrier</a>, resulting in such multipurpose designs as the <a href="BTR-40">BTR-40</a> or the <a href="Cadillac%20Gage%20Commando">Cadillac Gage Commando</a>. Postwar advances in recoil control technology have also made it possible for a few armored cars, including the <a href="B1%20Centauro">B1 Centauro</a>, the <a href="AMX-10RC">AMX-10RC</a> and <a href="EE-9%20Cascavel">EE-9 Cascavel</a>, to carry large cannon capable of threatening many tanks.

During the Middle Ages, <a href="war%20wagon">war wagon</a>s covered with steel plate, and crewed by men armed with primitive <a href="hand%20cannon">hand cannon</a>, <a href="flail">flail</a>s and <a href="musket">musket</a>s, were used by the <a href="Hussite">Hussite</a> rebels in Bohemia. These were deployed in formations where the horses and oxen were at the centre, and the surrounding wagons were chained together as protection from enemy cavalry. Similar wagons were used by the English army of <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a>, and by the <a href="Chinese%20Empire">Chinese Empire</a>.

With the invention of the <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>, Victorian inventors designed prototype self-propelled armored vehicles for use in sieges, although none were deployed in combat. <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>' short story <a href="The%20Land%20Ironclads">The Land Ironclads</a> provides a fictionalised account of their use.

The <a href="Motor%20Scout">Motor Scout</a> was designed and built by British inventor <a href="Frederick%20Richard%20Simms">F.R. Simms</a> in 1898. It was the first armed petrol engine-powered vehicle ever built. The vehicle was a <a href="De%20Dion-Bouton">De Dion-Bouton</a> <a href="Quadracycle">quadricycle</a> with a mounted <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim machine gun</a> on the front bar. An iron shield in front of the car protected the driver.

Another early armed car was invented by <a href="Royal%20Page%20Davidson">Royal Page Davidson</a> at <a href="Northwestern%20Military%20and%20Naval%20Academy">Northwestern Military and Naval Academy</a> in 1898 with the <a href="Davidson-Duryea%20gun%20carriage">Davidson-Duryea gun carriage</a> and the later <a href="Davidson%20Automobile%20Battery%20armored%20car">Davidson Automobile Battery armored car</a>.

However, these were not 'armored cars' as the term is understood today, as they provided little or no protection for their crews from enemy fire. They were also, by virtue of their small capacity engines, less efficient than the cavalry and horse-drawn guns that they were intended to complement.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the first military armored vehicles were manufactured, by adding armor and weapons to existing vehicles.
The first armored car was the <a href="Motor%20War%20Car">Simms' Motor War Car</a>, designed by <a href="Frederick%20Richard%20Simms">F.R. Simms</a> and built by <a href="Vickers%23Vickers%2C%20Sons%20%26amp%3B%20Maxim">Vickers, Sons & Maxim</a> of <a href="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow</a> on a special <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a>-built <a href="Daimler%20Company">Daimler</a> chassis with a <a href="Daimler%20Motoren%20Gesellschaft">German-built Daimler</a> motor in 1899. and a single prototype was ordered in April 1899 The prototype was finished in 1902, too late to be used during the <a href="Boer%20War">Boer War</a>.

The vehicle had Vickers armour 6 mm thick and was powered by a four-cylinder 3.3-litre 16-<a href="Horsepower">hp</a> Cannstatt Daimler engine, giving it a maximum speed around . The armament, consisting of two <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim gun</a>s, was carried in two turrets with 360° traverse. It had a crew of four. Simms' Motor War Car was presented at <a href="the%20Crystal%20Palace">the Crystal Palace</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, in April 1902.
Another early armored car of the period was the French <a href="Charron%2C%20Girardot%20et%20Voigt%201902">Charron, Girardot et Voigt 1902</a>, presented at the "Salon de l'Automobile et du cycle" in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, on 8 March 1902. The vehicle was equipped with a <a href="Hotchkiss%20machine%20gun">Hotchkiss machine gun</a>, and with 7 mm armour for the gunner.

One of the first operational armoured cars with four wheel (4x4) drive and fully enclosed rotating turret, was the <a href="Austro-Daimler%20Panzerwagen">Austro-Daimler Panzerwagen</a> built by <a href="Austro-Daimler">Austro-Daimler</a> in 1904. It was armoured with 3-3.5 mm thick curved plates over the body (drive space and engine) and had a 4mm thick dome-shaped rotating turret that housed one or two machine-guns. It had a 4-cylinder 35 hp 4.4 litre engine giving it average cross country performance. Of note, both the driver and co-driver had adjustable seats enabling them to raise them to see out of the roof of the drive compartment as needed. 

The Italians used armored cars during the <a href="Italo-Turkish%20War">Italo-Turkish War</a>. A great variety of armored cars appeared on both sides during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and these were used in various ways.

Generally, the armored cars were used by more or less independent car commanders. However, sometimes they were used in larger units up to squadron size. The cars were primarily armed with light machine guns, but larger units usually employed a few cars with heavier guns. As air power became a factor, armored cars offered a mobile platform for antiaircraft guns.
The first effective use of an armored vehicle in combat was achieved by the <a href="Belgian%20Army">Belgian Army</a> in August–September 1914. They had placed <a href="John%20Cockerill%20%28company%29">Cockerill</a> armour plating and a <a href="Hotchkiss%20machine%20gun">Hotchkiss machine gun</a> on <a href="Minerva%20Armored%20Car">Minerva Armored Car</a>s. Their successes in the early days of the war convinced the Belgian GHQ to create a <a href="Belgian%20Expeditionary%20Corps%20in%20Russia">Corps of Armoured Cars</a>, who would be sent to fight on the Eastern front once the western front immobilized after the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yser">Battle of the Yser</a>.
The <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> dispatched aircraft to Dunkirk to defend the UK from Zeppelins. The officers' cars followed them and these began to be used to rescue downed reconnaissance pilots in the battle areas. They mounted machine guns on them and as these excursions became increasingly dangerous, they improvised boiler plate armoring on the vehicles provided by a local shipbuilder. In London <a href="Murray%20Sueter">Murray Sueter</a> ordered "fighting cars" based on Rolls-Royce, Talbot and Wolseley chassis. By the time <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Armoured%20Car">Rolls-Royce Armoured Car</a>s arrived in December 1914, the mobile period on the Western Front was already over. As described below, they had a fascinating birth and long and interesting service.

More tactically important was the development of formed units of armored cars, such as the <a href="Canadian%20Automobile%20Machine%20Gun%20Brigade">Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade</a>, which was the first fully mechanized unit in the history of the British Army. The brigade was established on September 2, 1914 in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, as Automobile Machine Gun Brigade No. 1 by <a href="Raymond%20Brutinel">Brigadier-General Raymond Brutinel</a>. The Brigade was originally equipped with 8 armored Autocars mounting 2 machine guns. By 1918 Brutinel's force consisted of two Motor Machine Gun Brigades (each of five gun batteries containing eight weapons apiece). The brigade, and its armored cars, provided yeoman service in many battles, notably at Amiens.

The Rolls-Royce Armoured Car was famously proposed, developed, and utilised by the <a href="Hugh%20Grosvenor%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Westminster">2nd Duke of Westminster</a>. He took a squadron of these cars to France in time to make a noted contribution to the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a>, and thereafter the cars with their master were sent to the Middle East to play a part in the British campaign in <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Palestine</a> and elsewhere. These cars appear in the memoirs of numerous officers of the BEF during the earlier stages of the Great War - their ducal master often being described in an almost piratical style.
The British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> was equipped with <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Armoured%20Car">Rolls-Royce Armoured Car</a>s and Morris tenders. Some of these vehicles were among the last of a consignment of ex-<a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> armored cars that had been serving in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> since 1915. In September 1940 a section of the No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment Company was detached to <a href="Archibald%20Wavell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Wavell">General Wavell’s</a> ground forces during the first offensive against the Italians in Egypt. It is said that these armored cars became ‘the eyes and ears of Wavell’. During the actions in the October of that year the Company was employed on convoy escort tasks, airfield defense, fighting reconnaissance patrols and screening operations.

During the <a href="Anglo-Iraqi%20War">Anglo-Iraqi War</a>, some of the units located in the <a href="British%20Mandate%20of%20Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a> were sent to Iraq and drove Fordson armored cars. "Fordson" armored cars were Rolls-Royce armored cars which received new chassis from a <a href="Fordson">Fordson</a> truck in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

Since the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> did not mention armored cars, Germany began developing them early. By the start of the new war, the German army possessed some highly effective reconnaissance vehicles, such as the "<a href="Schwerer%20Panzersp%C3%A4hwagen">Schwerer Panzerspähwagen</a>".

The Soviet <a href="BA-64">BA-64</a> was influenced by a captured "<a href="Leichter%20Panzersp%C3%A4hwagen">Leichter Panzerspähwagen</a>" before it was first tested in January 1942.

In the second half of the war, the American <a href="M8%20Greyhound">M8 Greyhound</a> and the British <a href="Daimler%20Armoured%20Car">Daimler Armoured Car</a>s featured turrets mounting light guns (40 mm or less). As with other wartime armored cars, their reconnaissance roles emphasized greater speed and stealth than a tracked vehicle could provide, so their limited armor, armament and off-road capabilities were seen as acceptable compromises.

A military armored car is a type of <a href="armored%20fighting%20vehicle">armored fighting vehicle</a> having <a href="wheel">wheel</a>s (from four to ten large, off-road wheels) instead of <a href="Caterpillar%20track">tracks</a>, and usually light <a href="vehicle%20armor">armor</a>. Armored cars are typically less expensive and on roads have better speed and range than tracked military vehicles. They do however have less mobility as they have less off-road capabilities because of the higher ground pressure. They also have less obstacle climbing capabilities than tracked vehicles. Wheels are more vulnerable to enemy fire than tracks, they have a higher signature and in most cases less armor than comparable tracked vehicles. As a result, they are not intended for heavy fighting; their normal use is for <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>, command, control, and communications, or for use against lightly armed insurgents or rioters. Only some are intended to enter close combat, often accompanying convoys to protect soft-skinned vehicles.

Light armored cars, such as the British <a href="Ferret%20armoured%20car">Ferret</a> are armed with just a machine gun. Heavier vehicles are armed with <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a> or a small tank gun. The heaviest armored cars, such as the German, World War II era <a href="SdKfz%20234">SdKfz 234</a> or the modern, US <a href="M1128%20Mobile%20Gun%20System">M1128 Mobile Gun System</a>, mount the same guns that arm medium tanks.
Armored cars are popular for peacekeeping or internal security duties. Their appearance is less confrontational and threatening than tanks, and their size and maneuverability is said to be more compatible with tight urban spaces designed for wheeled vehicles. However, they do have a larger turning radius compared to tracked vehicles which can turn on the spot and their tires are vulnerable and are less capable in climbing and crushing obstacles. Further, when there is true combat they are easily outgunned and lightly armored. The threatening appearance of a tank is often enough to keep an opponent from attacking, whereas a less threatening vehicle such as an armored car is more likely to be attacked.

Many modern forces now have their dedicated armored car designs, to exploit the advantages noted above. Examples would be the <a href="M1117%20Armored%20Security%20Vehicle">M1117 Armored Security Vehicle</a> of the USA or <a href="Alvis%20Saladin">Alvis Saladin</a> of the post-World War II era in the United Kingdom.

Alternatively, civilian vehicles may be modified into improvised armored cars in "ad hoc" fashion. Many militias and irregular forces adapt civilian vehicles into AFVs (armored fighting vehicles) and troop carriers, and in some regional conflicts these <a href="technical%20%28fighting%20vehicle%29">"technicals"</a> are the only combat vehicles present. On occasion, even the soldiers of national militaries are forced to adapt their <a href="Gun%20truck">civilian-type vehicles</a> for combat use, often using <a href="Improvised%20vehicle%20armour">improvised armor</a> and scrounged weapons.

Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon

An anti-aircraft vehicle, also known as a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) or self-propelled air defense system (SPAD), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft capability</a>. The <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> equivalent of "SPAAG" is "ZSU", for "zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka", ("anti-aircraft self-propelled mount").

Specific weapon systems used include <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a>s, larger guns, or <a href="missile">missile</a>s, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles (e.g. the <a href="Pantsir-S1">Pantsir-S1</a>). Platforms used include both <a href="truck">truck</a>s and heavier <a href="combat%20vehicle">combat vehicle</a>s such as <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">APCs</a> and <a href="tank">tank</a>s, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment.

Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing <a href="gun%20turret">turret</a> with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. Today, <a href="missile">missile</a>s (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns.

Anti-aircraft machine guns have long been mounted on trucks, and these were quite common during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. A predecessor of the WWII German "88" anti-aircraft gun, the WWI German 77 mm anti-aircraft gun, was truck-mounted and used to great effect against British tanks.

The British <a href="QF%203%20inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3 inch 20 cwt</a> was mounted on trucks for use on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>.

Between the two World Wars the United Kingdom developed the <a href="Birch%20gun">Birch gun</a>, a general purpose artillery piece on an armoured tracked chassis capable of maintaining formation with their current tanks over terrain. The gun could be elevated for anti-aircraft use.

Vickers Armstrong also developed a SPAAG based on the chassis of the Mk.E 6-ton light tank/Dragon Medium Mark IV tractor, mounting a Vickers QF-1 "Pom-Pom" gun of 40 mm. About 26 were sold to <a href="Siam">Siam</a> and saw action as infantry support guns and AA guns during the <a href="Franco-Thai%20war">Franco-Thai war</a> (1940-1941) along with 30 Vickers Mk.E Type B 6-ton tanks. This was probably the first tracked SPAAG manufactured in series. Later the British also developed a version of the <a href="Light%20Tank%20Mark%20VI">Mk.VI Light Tank</a> armed with four machine guns that was known as Light Tank AA Mk.I. And also a twin 15 mm version based on the Light Tank Mk.V was built.

Among early pre-war pioneers of self-propelled AA guns were the Germans. By the time of the war, they fielded the SdKfz 10/4 and 6/2, cargo halftracks mounting single 20 mm or 37 mm AA guns (respectively). Later in the war similar German halftracks mounted <a href="Flakvierling">quadruple 20 mm weapons</a>.

Larger guns followed on larger trucks, but these mountings generally required off-truck setup in order to unlimber the stabilizing legs these guns needed. One exception to this rule was the Italian <a href="Cannone%20da%2090/53">Cannone da 90/53</a> which was highly effective when mounted on trucks, a fit known as the ""autocannoni da 90/53"". The 90/53 was a feared weapon, notably in the anti-tank role, but only a few hundred had been produced by the time of the armistice in 1943.

Other nations tended to work on truck chassis. Starting in 1941, the British developed the "en <a href="portee">portee</a>" method of mounting an anti-tank gun (initially a <a href="2%20pounder">2 pounder</a>) on a truck. This was to prevent the weapon from being damaged by long-distance towing across rough, stony deserts, and it was intended only to be a carrying method, with the gun unloaded for firing. However, crews tended to fire their weapons from their vehicles for the mobility this method provided, with consequent casualties. 
This undoubtedly inspired their Morris C9/B (officially the "Carrier, SP, 4x4, 40 mm AA"), a Bofors 40 mm AA gun mounted on a chassis derived from the <a href="Morris%20C8">Morris "Quad"</a> Field Artillery Tractor truck. Similar types, based on 3-ton lorries, were produced in Britain, Canada and Australia, and together formed the most numerous self-propelled AA guns in British service.

The U.S. Army brought truck-towed <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm">Bofors 40 mm</a> AA guns along with truck-mounted units fitted with mechanized turrets when they sailed, first for Great Britain and then onto France. The turrets carried four .50 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns, which were designed to be adjusted to converge at the single point where enemy aircraft were expected to appear at low altitude in conduction of strafing runs directed at large infantry and field artillery units.

Interest in mobile AA turned to heavier vehicles with the mass and stability needed to easily train weapons of all sizes. Probably the desire, particularly in German service, for anti-aircraft vehicles to be armoured for their own protection also assisted this trend.

The concept of an armored SPAAG was pioneered by <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> by producing the <a href="40M%20Nimrod">40M Nimrod</a> based on the <a href="Luftv%C3%A4rnskanonvagn%20L-62%20Anti%20II">Luftvärnskanonvagn L-62 Anti II</a> license acquired from <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. <a href="Germany">Germany</a> followed later with their ""Flakpanzer"" series. German World War II SPAAGs include the <a href="M%C3%B6belwagen">Möbelwagen</a>, <a href="Wirbelwind">Wirbelwind</a>, <a href="Ostwind">Ostwind</a> and <a href="Kugelblitz">Kugelblitz</a>. Other forces followed with designs of their own, notably the American M16 created by mounting <a href="M45%20Quadmount">quadruple M2HB Browning machine guns</a> on a <a href="M3%20Half-track">M3 Half-track</a>.

The British developed their own SPAAGs throughout the war mounting multiple machine guns and light cannon on various tank and armoured car chassis and by 1943, the <a href="Crusader%20tank">Crusader AA tanks</a>, which mounted the <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm">Bofors 40 mm</a> gun or two-three <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm cannon</a>. Although used during the Normandy landings, by that point German aircraft were contained by the Allies own air forces and they were largely unneeded.

The introduction of <a href="jet%20engine">jet engine</a>s and the subsequent rough doubling of aircraft speeds greatly reduced the effectiveness of the SPAAG against attack aircraft. A typical SPAAG round might have a muzzle velocity on the order of and might take as long as two to three seconds to reach a target at its maximum range. An aircraft flying at is moving at a rate of about . This means the aircraft will have moved hundreds of meters during the flight time of the shells, greatly complicating the aiming problem to the point where close passes were essentially impossible to aim using manual gunsights. This speed also allowed the aircraft to rapidly fly out of range of the guns; even if the aircraft passes directly over the SPAAG, it would be within its firing radius for under 30 seconds.

SPAAG development continued through the early 1950s with ever-larger guns, improving the range and allowing the engagement to take place at longer distances where the crossing angle was smaller and aiming was easier. Examples including the 40 mm U.S. <a href="M42%20Duster">M42 Duster</a> and the 57 mm <a href="Soviet">Soviet</a> <a href="ZSU-57-2">ZSU-57-2</a>. However, both were essentially obsolete before they entered service, and found employment solely in the ground-support role. The M42 was introduced to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> to counter an expected North Vietnamese air offensive, but when this failed to materialize it was used as an effective direct-fire weapon. The ZSU-57 found similar use in the <a href="Yugoslav%20Wars">Yugoslav Wars</a>, where its high-angle fire was useful in the mountainous terrain.

By the late 1950s the US Army had given up on the SPAAG concept, considering all gun-based weapons to be useless against modern aircraft. This belief was generally held by many forces, and the anti-aircraft role turned almost exclusively to missile systems. The Soviet Union remained an outlier, beginning development of a new SPAAG in 1957, which emerged as the <a href="ZSU-23-4">ZSU-23-4</a> in 1965. This system included search-and-track radars, fire control, and automatic gun-laying, greatly increasing its effectiveness against modern targets. The ZSU-23 proved very effective when used in concert with SAMs; the presence of SAMs forced aircraft to fly low to avoid their radars, placing them within range of the ZSUs.

The success of the ZSU-23 led to a resurgence of SPAAG development. This was also prompted by the introduction of <a href="attack%20helicopter">attack helicopter</a>s in the 1970s, which could hide behind terrain and then "pop up" for an attack lasting only a few tens of seconds; missiles were ineffective at low altitudes, while the helicopters would often be within range of the guns for a rapid counterattack. Notable among these later systems is the <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer%20Gepard">Gepard</a>, the first western SPAAG to offer performance equal to or better than the ZSU. This system was widely copied in various <a href="NATO">NATO</a> forces. 

SPAAG development continues, with many modern examples often combining both guns and short-range missiles. Examples include the Soviet/Russian <a href="Tunguska-M1">Tunguska-M1</a>, which supplanted the ZSU-23 in service, newer versions of the Gepard, the Chinese <a href="Type%2095%20SPAAA">Type 95 SPAAA</a> , and the British <a href="Marksman%20anti-aircraft%20system">Marksman turret</a>, which can be used on a wide variety of platforms.

AZ Alkmaar

Alkmaar Zaanstreek (), better known as AZ Alkmaar or simply AZ (), is a Dutch professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club from <a href="Alkmaar">Alkmaar</a> and the <a href="Zaanstreek">Zaanstreek</a>. The club plays in the <a href="Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a>, the highest professional football league in the Netherlands, and hosts home matches at the <a href="AFAS%20Stadion">AFAS Stadion</a>.

AZ has won the Eredivisie twice, in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Eredivisie">1980–81</a> and <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Eredivisie">2008–09</a>. In the same season as their first league title, they also reached the <a href="1981%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">UEFA Cup Final</a>, which they lost to <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. In addition, the team has won the <a href="KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a> on four occasions.

AZ was founded on 10 May 1967 as AZ '67, the result of a merger of Alkmaar '54 and FC Zaanstreek. FC Zaanstreek was formed in 1964, continuing the professional adventure of the <a href="Koog%20aan%20de%20Zaan">Kooger</a> Football Club (). KFC had been founded in 1910, had nearly become National Champion in 1934 through a narrow loss to <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> in the finals, and had been professional since 1955.

In 1964, the brothers Cees and Klaas Molenaar, former players for KFC and owners of a growing appliance store chain, sought to create a powerful football team in Zaanstreek by merging the two local professional teams: KFC and .

After this merger failed, they successfully merged KFC (now "FC Zaanstreek") with Alkmaar '54; the team would be based in Alkmaar. Partially through the hiring of expensive foreign players, the new club soon acquired large debts.

Fortunately, in 1972, the Molenaar brothers bailed it out and invested heavily in the club, to the point that AZ '67 were successful in the late 1970s and early '80s, regularly playing European football from 1977 to 1982 while also winning three <a href="KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a>s over that period.

After four close league campaigns, AZ finally became <a href="Eredivisie">Dutch champions</a> in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Eredivisie">1981</a>, becoming the only team other than the "big three" of Ajax, <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> and <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a> to do so in a 44-year period spanning from 1965 to 2009 (when AZ once again won the league title). They won the title with overwhelming power, winning 27 of 34 matches and only losing once while scoring a club record 101 goals and conceding just 30. That same season, AZ reached the <a href="1981%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">final of the UEFA Cup</a>, losing 5–4 on aggregate to <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. The next year, in the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a>, they lost in the second round 3–2 on aggregate to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>.

<a href="Georg%20Ke%C3%9Fler">Georg Keßler</a> was AZ's manager over most of these years (1978–82), while star players included: <a href="Kees%20Kist">Kees Kist</a>, the club's highest ever goalscorer with 212 goals and the first ever Dutchman to win the <a href="European%20Golden%20Shoe">European Golden Boot</a> in 1979 when he scored 34 goals in a season; <a href="Jan%20Peters%20%28footballer%29">Jan Peters</a>, who played 120 matches for AZ during this period scoring 30 goals from midfield; and <a href="Hugo%20Hovenkamp">Hugo Hovenkamp</a>, who played 239 matches in defence for AZ from 1975–83, as well as receiving 31 caps for the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands national team</a> from 1977–1983 and playing each match in <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201980">UEFA Euro 1980</a> while an AZ player. Additional stars included <a href="John%20Metgod">John Metgod</a>, who spent six years at AZ playing 195 matches as a defender, scoring 26 goals including a goal against Ipswich Town in the final of the UEFA Cup. Like Hovenkamp, Metgod was also included in the Dutch squad for Euro 1980. Meanwhile, Danish forward <a href="Kristen%20Nygaard%20%28footballer%29">Kristen Nygaard</a> spent ten years at AZ, scoring 104 goals in 363 matches between 1972 and 1982.

The club deteriorated after Klaas Molenaar left the club in 1985 (Cees died in 1979). AZ was relegated in 1988 from the <a href="Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a>.

The involvement of businessman Dirk Scheringa in the mid-1990s marked the revival of the club as AZ returned to the Eredivisie in 1998.

After a 22-year hiatus from European football, AZ appeared in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup">2004–05 UEFA Cup</a>, advancing to the semi-finals. The second leg of the semi-final against <a href="Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal">Sporting Clube de Portugal</a> had a heart-breaking conclusion when Sporting scored in the 122nd minute, two minutes into stoppage time, to reach an aggregate score of 4–4. Sporting advanced to the <a href="2005%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> via the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>. In the same season, AZ finished third in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a>, thus also qualifying for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">subsequent season's UEFA Cup</a>. These were great achievements for the club which does not have a similar sized fanbase relative to Eredivisie and European rivals; AZ's home ground until the 2006–07 season, the <a href="Alkmaarderhout">Alkmaarderhout</a>, had a capacity of only 8,390.

In the summer of 2006, the club moved to a new 17,000 capacity stadium, <a href="AZ%20Stadion">AZ Stadion</a>.

Despite playing strongly for the majority of the 2006–07 season, AZ's season ended in disappointment. First, entering the last matchday of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Eredivisie">2006–07 Eredivisie</a> season, AZ led PSV and Ajax on goal difference at the top of the league table, but ended up third after losing their last match against the eventually-relegated, bottom-of-the-table <a href="S.B.V.%20Excelsior">Excelsior</a>, who played with ten men for 80 minutes. Additionally, AZ then lost the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20KNVB%20Cup%23Final">KNVB Cup final</a> to Ajax 8–7 after a penalty shoot-out, while also falling to Ajax over two play-off matches for participation in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>. After the season, key players like <a href="Tim%20de%20Cler">Tim de Cler</a>, <a href="Danny%20Koevermans">Danny Koevermans</a> and <a href="Shota%20Arveladze">Shota Arveladze</a> left the team.
A remarkable run ended in the 2007–08 season: after AZ lost a group stage match against <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> (3–2) in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, the club's unbeaten run of 32 home matches in European competitions – lasting from 1977 to 2007 – ended. AZ had a poor season, suffering elimination in the first round of the KNVB Cup and the group stage of the UEFA Cup, as well as finishing the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Eredivisie">2007–08 Eredivisie</a> in 11th place. Towards the latter stages of the season, in March 2008, AZ manager <a href="Louis%20van%20Gaal">Louis van Gaal</a> had initially tendered his resignation, but after protests the players and directors, he rescinded his resignation.

The <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Eredivisie">2008–09 season</a> had an unpromising start after two opening defeats against <a href="NAC%20Breda">NAC Breda</a> and <a href="ADO%20Den%20Haag">ADO Den Haag</a>. However, starting with a 1–0 victory over defending league champions PSV, AZ did not lose a match in its next 28 matches, including a run of 11-straight matches where AZ did not concede an opposition goal. Three weeks before the end of the season, AZ became Eredivisie champions, edging nearest title rivals <a href="FC%20Twente">Twente</a> and Ajax comfortably.

Being league champions, AZ qualified for the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> for the second time, but only took four points from six matches and finished bottom of their group.

For the 2009–10 season, <a href="Ronald%20Koeman">Ronald Koeman</a> succeeded Louis van Gaal, who had departed to manage <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> after leading AZ to the championship. Koeman was officially hired on 17 May 2009, but on 5 December, AZ announced he was no longer in charge of the club after losing 7 of his first 16 matches. Former <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> and <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">Zenit Saint Petersburg</a> manager <a href="Dick%20Advocaat">Dick Advocaat</a> took over for the remainder of the season. Under Advocaat, AZ achieved solid results and secured European football for the next season.

For the 2010–11 season, AZ appointed <a href="Gertjan%20Verbeek">Gertjan Verbeek</a> as its new manager. They finished the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Eredivisie">2010–11 Eredivisie</a> in fourth place, thus securing <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League football</a> for the next season, while in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a>, AZ reached the last eight, where they were beaten by rivals Ajax by a 1–0 scoreline. AZ also finished third in their <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> group, thus failing to qualifying for the competition's knockout round.

In the 2011–12 season, AZ finished fourth in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a>, though performed significantly better in cup competitions, reaching the semi-finals in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a> (losing to <a href="Heracles%20Almelo">Heracles</a> after extra time) and the quarter-finals in the Europa League. In the latter, the club ultimately lost to <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> after having defeated <a href="Udinese%20Calcio">Udinese</a>, <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>, <a href="Malm%C3%B6%20FF">Malmö FF</a>, <a href="FK%20Austria%20Wien">Austria Wien</a>, <a href="FC%20Metalist%20Kharkiv">Metalist Kharkiv</a>, <a href="Aalesunds%20FK">Aalesund</a> and <a href="FK%20Baumit%20Jablonec">Baumit Jablonec</a> to reach that stage.

On 21 December 2011, during the quarter-finals of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20KNVB%20Cup">2011–12 KNVB Cup</a>, a 19-year-old Ajax fan invaded the <a href="Amsterdam%20Arena">Amsterdam Arena</a> pitch in the 36th minute with Ajax winning 1–0, attacking AZ goalkeeper <a href="Esteban%20Alvarado">Esteban Alvarado</a>. The fan slipped and Alvarado kicked the fan twice, prompting the referee to issue the goalkeeper a red card. Following this, AZ manager Gertjan Verbeek ordered his players to leave the pitch for the dressing room in protest. The match was later played on 19 January 2012, with Alvarado's red card rescinded; AZ won 3–2.

The 2012–13 season started in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20qualifying%20phase%20and%20play-off%20round">Europa League</a> with a qualifying play-off round against <a href="Guus%20Hiddink">Guus Hiddink</a>'s <a href="FC%20Anzhi%20Makhachkala">Anzhi Makhachkala</a>. AZ was hammered 6–0 on aggregate. Disappointingly, AZ finished tenth in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Eredivisie">2012–13 Eredivisie</a>, although the club won the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20KNVB%20Cup">2012–13 KNVB Cup</a> after defeating PSV 2–1 in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20KNVB%20Cup%23Final">final</a>. As cup winners, AZ automatically qualified for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2013–14 Europa League</a>.

In September 2013, just one day after emphatically beating PSV, at the time the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Eredivisie">league leaders</a>, Verbeek was dismissed as first team manager by the club due to "a lack of chemistry" between management and players. He was replaced by Dick Advocaat for the remainder of the season until a permanent replacement could be found. Advocaat took AZ to the semi-finals of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20KNVB%20Cup">KNVB Cup</a>, the quarter-finals of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> and eighth in the league, ultimately losing to <a href="FC%20Groningen">Groningen</a> in the Europa League play-off final round (their 58th match of the season, a club record).

The <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Eredivisie">2014–15 season</a> began with a new manager, former <a href="SC%20Heerenveen">Heerenveen</a> manager and Ajax great <a href="Marco%20van%20Basten">Marco van Basten</a>. However, after just three matches into the season, Van Basten resigned as manager to become assistant manager under <a href="Alex%20Pastoor">Alex Pastoor</a>, citing heavy stress as the main reason. Pastoor was the interim manager during two matches under Van Basten's absence and received the official title on 16 September, but contract negotiations failed and he left the club just two days later. A week later, <a href="John%20van%20den%20Brom">John van den Brom</a> was appointed manager. Under Van den Brom, AZ quickly rose up to the sub-top, eventually finished the season in third place, surpassing Feyenoord on the final season's matchday and qualifying for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2015–16 Europa League</a>.

The <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Eredivisie">2015–16 Eredivisie</a> started with AZ selling most of its first-team players from the previous season during the summer transfer period. As a response, AZ bought players from other Dutch clubs, notably <a href="Vincent%20Janssen">Vincent Janssen</a> from <a href="Almere%20City%20FC">Almere City</a>, <a href="Alireza%20Jahanbakhsh">Alireza Jahanbakhsh</a> from <a href="N.E.C.%20%28football%20club%29">NEC</a> and <a href="Ben%20Rienstra">Ben Rienstra</a> from <a href="PEC%20Zwolle">PEC Zwolle</a>. In December, it was announced free agent <a href="Ron%20Vlaar">Ron Vlaar</a> signed a contract until the end of the season after training with the club for a few weeks prior. Vlaar quickly became team captain and helped lift AZ from tenth place to a fourth-place finish in the league. Along this rise, new signing Vincent Janssen scored 27 goals for the club, earning him the Eredivisie top goalscorer title. In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20KNVB%20Cup">2015–16 KNVB Cup</a>, AZ made it to the semi-finals, losing 3–1 to Feyenoord. AZ won the first two qualification rounds to qualify for the 2015–16 Europa League group stage, but finished last in their group.

At the start of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Eredivisie">2016–17 Eredivisie</a>, AZ sold last season's performer Vincent Janssen to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and long-time midfielder <a href="Markus%20Henriksen">Markus Henriksen</a> to <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a>. In the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2016–17 Europa League</a>, AZ finished second in Group D, surviving the group stage for the third time in five seasons.

AZ play its home matches at the <a href="AFAS%20Stadion">AFAS Stadion</a>, located in the southern part of the city of Alkmaar. The stadium, which is directly owned by the club, was opened in 2006 and replaced the old <a href="Alkmaarderhout">Alkmaarderhout</a> venue as the <a href="DSB%20Bank">DSB Stadion</a>. The stadium currently has a capacity of 17,023. During its design stages, the name Victorie Stadion was frequently used, referring to the <a href="Eighty%20Years%27%20War">Dutch War of Independence</a>, the phrase ""<a href="Siege%20of%20Alkmaar">In Alkmaar begint de victorie</a>" (Victory begins in Alkmaar)" in particular. Until now, this name has not been officially in use, the board instead opting for sponsorship deals because of financial motives. However, to this day, the name maintains a good share of support among the fans.

In order to further increase revenue, AZ's board of directors decided to expand the capacity of the new stadium to at least 30,000 somewhere in the future. The extension will be realised by constructing a second tier to three of the four stands. The main stand with all technical areas, VIP and sponsor and media facilities will remain in place. These plans, however, were put on hold after the DSB bankruptcy and there are no current plans to increase the capacity.

In October 2009, sponsor <a href="DSB%20Bank">DSB Bank</a> was declared bankrupt. The stadium name temporarily changed from DSB Stadion to AZ Stadion, as it was considered undesirable that the stadium was linked with a non-existent bank. In February 2010, a new main sponsor was found in construction works service provider BUKO, based in <a href="Beverwijk">Beverwijk</a>.

A year later, in the 2010–11 season, <a href="AFAS%20Erp%20Software">AFAS Erp Software</a> took over as official shirt sponsor, also taking over duties as stadium sponsor. The current external name of the ground is the AFAS Stadion.

<doc id="2296" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296" title="Adrenal gland">
Adrenal gland

The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are <a href="endocrine%20gland">endocrine gland</a>s that produce a variety of hormones including <a href="adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and the steroids <a href="aldosterone">aldosterone</a> and <a href="cortisol">cortisol</a>. They are found above the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s. Each gland has an outer <a href="adrenal%20cortex">cortex</a> which produces <a href="steroid%20hormone">steroid hormone</a>s and an inner <a href="Adrenal%20medulla">medulla</a>. The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones: <a href="zona%20glomerulosa">zona glomerulosa</a>, the <a href="zona%20fasciculata">zona fasciculata</a> and the <a href="zona%20reticularis">zona reticularis</a>.

The adrenal cortex produces three main types of <a href="steroid%20hormone">steroid hormone</a>s: <a href="mineralocorticoid">mineralocorticoid</a>s, <a href="glucocorticoid">glucocorticoid</a>s, and <a href="androgen">androgen</a>s. Mineralocorticoids (such as <a href="aldosterone">aldosterone</a>) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and <a href="osmoregulation">electrolyte balance</a>. The glucocorticoids <a href="cortisol">cortisol</a> and <a href="corticosterone">corticosterone</a> are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> and <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the <a href="gonad">gonad</a>s and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called <a href="Steroid%23Steroidogenesis">steroidogenesis</a>, and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells. The medulla produces the <a href="catecholamine">catecholamine</a>s <a href="adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and <a href="noradrenaline">noradrenaline</a>, which function to produce a <a href="Fight-or-flight%20response%20%28in%20humans%29">rapid response</a> throughout the body in <a href="Stress%20%28biology%29">stress</a> situations.

A number of <a href="endocrine%20disease">endocrine disease</a>s involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. Overproduction of cortisol leads to <a href="Cushing%27s%20syndrome">Cushing's syndrome</a>, whereas insufficient production is associated with <a href="Addison%27s%20disease">Addison's disease</a>. <a href="Congenital%20adrenal%20hyperplasia">Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</a> is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of <a href="neoplasm">tumors</a> can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a> when searching for other diseases.
The adrenal glands are located on both sides of the body in the <a href="retroperitoneum">retroperitoneum</a>, above and slightly <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23medial%20and%20lateral">medial</a> to the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s. In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar and somewhat larger. The adrenal glands measure approximately 3.0 cm in width, 5.0 cm in length, and up to 1.0 cm in thickness. Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10 grams. The glands are yellowish in colour.

The adrenal glands are surrounded by a <a href="adipose%20capsule%20of%20kidney">fatty capsule</a> and lie within the <a href="renal%20fascia">renal fascia</a>, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a> separates the glands from the kidneys. The adrenal glands are directly below the <a href="thoracic%20diaphragm">diaphragm</a>, and are attached to the <a href="crura%20of%20the%20diaphragm">crura of the diaphragm</a> by the renal fascia.

Each adrenal gland has two distinct parts, each with a unique function, the outer <a href="adrenal%20cortex">adrenal cortex</a> and the inner <a href="adrenal%20medulla">medulla</a>, both of which produce hormones.

The adrenal cortex is the outermost layer of the adrenal gland. Within the cortex are three layers, called "zones". When <a href="Histology">viewed under a microscope</a> each layer has a distinct appearance, and each has a different function. The <a href="adrenal%20cortex">adrenal cortex</a> is devoted to production of <a href="hormone">hormone</a>s, namely <a href="aldosterone">aldosterone</a>, <a href="cortisol">cortisol</a>, and <a href="androgen">androgen</a>s.

The outermost layer of the adrenal cortex is the <a href="zona%20glomerulosa">zona glomerulosa</a>. It lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the gland. Cells in this layer form oval groups, separated by <a href="trabeculae">thin strands</a> of connective tissue from the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide <a href="capillary">capillaries</a>.

This layer is the main site for production of <a href="aldosterone">aldosterone</a>, a <a href="mineralocorticoid">mineralocorticoid</a>, by the action of the enzyme <a href="aldosterone%20synthase">aldosterone synthase</a>. Aldosterone plays an important role in the long-term <a href="regulation%20of%20blood%20pressure">regulation of blood pressure</a>.

The <a href="zona%20fasciculata">zona fasciculata</a> is situated between the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis. Cells in this layer are responsible for producing <a href="glucocorticoid">glucocorticoid</a>s such as <a href="cortisol">cortisol</a>. It is the largest of the three layers, accounting for nearly 80% of the volume of the cortex. In the zona fasciculata, cells are arranged in columns radially oriented towards the medulla. Cells contain numerous lipid droplets, abundant <a href="Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> and a complex <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum%23smooth%20endoplasmic%20reticulum">smooth endoplasmic reticulum</a>.

The innermost cortical layer, the <a href="zona%20reticularis">zona reticularis</a>, lies directly adjacent to the medulla. It produces <a href="androgen">androgen</a>s, mainly <a href="dehydroepiandrosterone">dehydroepiandrosterone</a> (DHEA), <a href="DHEA%20sulfate">DHEA sulfate</a> (DHEA-S), and <a href="androstenedione">androstenedione</a> (the precursor to <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a>) in humans. Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue. The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown <a href="lipofuscin">lipofuscin</a> pigment.

The <a href="adrenal%20medulla">adrenal medulla</a> is at the centre of each adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex. The <a href="chromaffin%20cell">chromaffin cell</a>s of the medulla are the body's main source of the <a href="catecholamine">catecholamine</a>s adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.

The adrenal medulla is driven by the <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic nervous system</a> via <a href="preganglionic%20fiber">preganglionic fiber</a>s originating in the <a href="thoracic%20spinal%20cord">thoracic spinal cord</a>, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by <a href="preganglionic%20nerve%20fibers">preganglionic nerve fibers</a>, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized <a href="sympathetic%20ganglion">sympathetic ganglion</a>. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.

The adrenal glands have one of the greatest blood supply rates per gram of tissue of any organ: up to 60 <a href="arteriole">small arteries</a> may enter each gland. Three arteries usually supply each adrenal gland:
These blood vessels supply a network of small arteries within the capsule of the adrenal glands. Thin strands of the capsule enter the glands, carrying blood to them.

<a href="Vein">Venous blood</a> is drained from the glands by the <a href="suprarenal%20veins">suprarenal veins</a>, usually one for each gland:

The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is an unusual type of blood vessel. Its structure is different from the other veins in that the <a href="smooth%20muscle">smooth muscle</a> in its <a href="tunica%20media">tunica media</a> (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.

The adrenal glands may not develop at all, or may be fused in the midline behind the <a href="aorta">aorta</a>. These are associated with other <a href="congenital%20abnormality">congenital abnormalities</a>, such as failure of the kidneys to develop, or fused kidneys. The gland may develop with a partial or complete absence of the cortex, or may develop in an unusual location.

The adrenal gland secretes a number of different hormones which are metabolised by <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s either within the gland or in other parts of the body. These hormones are involved in a number of essential biological functions.

<a href="Corticosteroid">Corticosteroid</a>s are a group of steroid hormones produced from the cortex of the adrenal gland, from which they are named. Corticosteroids are named according to their actions:

The adrenal gland produces <a href="aldosterone">aldosterone</a>, a <a href="mineralocorticoid">mineralocorticoid</a>, which is important in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and <a href="blood%20volume">blood volume</a>. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the <a href="distal%20convoluted%20tubule">distal convoluted tubule</a>s and the <a href="Collecting%20duct%20system">collecting ducts</a> by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal <a href="glomerular%20filtration%20rate">glomerular filtration rate</a>s. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. <a href="Angiotensin%20II">Angiotensin II</a> and extracellular <a href="potassium">potassium</a> are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a>. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.

<a href="Cortisol">Cortisol</a> is the main <a href="glucocorticoid">glucocorticoid</a> in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by <a href="corticosterone">corticosterone</a> instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of <a href="glucose">glucose</a>. This is the result of an increase in the mobilization of <a href="amino%20acids">amino acids</a> from protein and the stimulation of <a href="Gluconeogenesis">synthesis of glucose</a> from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of <a href="free%20fatty%20acids">free fatty acids</a>, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent <a href="anti-inflammatory">anti-inflammatory</a> effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of <a href="osteoblast">osteoblast</a>s to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the <a href="Human%20gastrointestinal%20tract">gastrointestinal tract</a>.

The adrenal gland secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to <a href="adrenocorticotropic%20hormone">adrenocorticotropic hormone</a> (ACTH) from the <a href="anterior%20pituitary">anterior pituitary</a>. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest in the early morning and lowest in the evening as a result of the <a href="circadian%20rhythm">circadian rhythm</a> of ACTH secretion. <a href="Cortisone">Cortisone</a> is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme <a href="11-Beta%20hydroxysteroid%20dehydrogenase">11β-HSD</a> on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.


All <a href="corticosteroid">corticosteroid</a> hormones share <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> as a common precursor. Therefore, the first step in <a href="Steroid%23Steroidogenesis">steroidogenesis</a> is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as <a href="cholesterol%20esters">cholesterol esters</a> within <a href="low%20density%20lipoprotein">low density lipoprotein</a>s (LDL). LDL enters the cells through <a href="receptor-mediated%20endocytosis">receptor-mediated endocytosis</a>. The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a>. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the <a href="lysosome">lysosome</a>, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.

The initial part of conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones involves a number of enzymes of the <a href="cytochrome%20P450">cytochrome P450</a> family that are located in the inner membrane of <a href="Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a>. Transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner membrane is facilitated by <a href="steroidogenic%20acute%20regulatory%20protein">steroidogenic acute regulatory protein</a> and is the rate-limiting step of steroid synthesis.

The layers of the adrenal gland differ by function, with each layer having distinct enzymes that produce different hormones from a common precursor. The first enzymatic step in the production of all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms <a href="pregnenolone">pregnenolone</a> as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme <a href="P450scc">P450scc</a>, also known as "cholesterol desmolase". After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and <a href="Microsome">microsomal</a> P450s and <a href="hydroxysteroid%20dehydrogenase">hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase</a>s. Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones. Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. For example, the most common form of <a href="congenital%20adrenal%20hyperplasia">congenital adrenal hyperplasia</a> develops as a result of deficiency of <a href="21-hydroxylase">21-hydroxylase</a>, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.


Glucocorticoids are under the regulatory influence of the <a href="HPA%20axis">hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis</a>. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by <a href="adrenocorticotropic%20hormone">adrenocorticotropic hormone</a> (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the <a href="anterior%20pituitary">anterior pituitary</a>. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated by the presence of <a href="corticotropin-releasing%20hormone">corticotropin-releasing hormone</a> (CRH), which is released by neurons of the <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a>. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis is an example of a negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the <a href="inflammatory%20response">inflammatory response</a>.

Mineralocorticoid secretion is regulated mainly by the <a href="renin%E2%80%93angiotensin%E2%80%93aldosterone%20system">renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system</a> (RAAS), the concentration of <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, and to a lesser extent the concentration of ACTH. Sensors of blood pressure in the <a href="juxtaglomerular%20apparatus">juxtaglomerular apparatus</a> of the kidneys release the enzyme <a href="renin">renin</a> into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of <a href="angiotensin%20II">angiotensin II</a>. <a href="Angiotensin%20receptor">Angiotensin receptor</a>s in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of <a href="aldosterone">aldosterone</a>.

Primarily referred to in the United States as <a href="Epinephrine">Epinephrine</a> and <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a>,
<a href="Adrenaline">Adrenaline</a> and <a href="noradrenaline">noradrenaline</a> are <a href="catecholamine">catecholamine</a>s, water-soluble <a href="organic%20compound">compounds</a> that have a structure made of a <a href="catechol">catechol</a> group and an <a href="amine%20group">amine group</a>. The adrenal glands are responsible for most of the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at <a href="adrenoreceptor">adrenoreceptor</a>s throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the <a href="fight%20or%20flight%20response">fight or flight response</a>, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels in many parts of the body.

Catecholamines are produced in chromaffin cells in the medulla of the adrenal gland, from <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a>, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a> in the liver. The enzyme <a href="tyrosine%20hydroxylase">tyrosine hydroxylase</a> converts tyrosine to <a href="L-DOPA">L-DOPA</a> in the first step of catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a> before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a>, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme <a href="phenylethanolamine%20N-methyltransferase">phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase</a> (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.

Catecholamine release is stimulated by the activation of the <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic nervous system</a>. <a href="Splanchnic%20nerves">Splanchnic nerves</a> of the <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic nervous system</a> innervate the medulla of the adrenal gland. When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of <a href="calcium%20channel">calcium channel</a>s in the cell membrane.

Cells in <a href="zona%20reticularis">zona reticularis</a> of the adrenal glands produce male sex hormones, or <a href="androgen">androgen</a>s, the most important of which is <a href="Dehydroepiandrosterone">DHEA</a>. In general, these hormones do not have an overall effect in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> and <a href="Dihydrotestosterone">DHT</a> or to <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a>s (female sex hormones) in the <a href="gonad">gonad</a>s, acting in this way as a <a href="metabolic%20intermediate">metabolic intermediate</a>.

The <a href="human%20genome">human genome</a> includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes and 70% of these <a href="Gene%20expression">genes are expressed</a> in the normal, adult adrenal glands. Only some 250 genes are more specifically expressed in the adrenal glands compared to other organs and tissues. The adrenal gland specific genes with highest level of expression include members of the <a href="cytochrome%20P450">cytochrome P450</a> superfamily of enzymes. Corresponding proteins are expressed in the different compartments of the adrenal gland, such as <a href="CYP11A1">CYP11A1</a>, <a href="HSD3B2">HSD3B2</a> and <a href="FDX1">FDX1</a> involved in <a href="steroid%20hormone">steroid hormone</a> synthesis and expressed in cortical cell layers, and <a href="Phenylethanolamine%20N-methyltransferase">PNMT</a> and <a href="Dopamine%20beta-hydroxylase">DBH</a> involved in <a href="noradrenalin">noradrenalin</a> and <a href="Epinephrine">adrenalin</a> synthesis and expressed in the medulla.

The adrenal glands are composed of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the <a href="adrenal%20medulla">adrenal medulla</a>, which produces <a href="adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and <a href="noradrenaline">noradrenaline</a> and releases them into the bloodstream, as part of the <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic nervous system</a>. Surrounding the medulla is the <a href="adrenal%20cortex">cortex</a>, which produces a variety of <a href="steroid%20hormone">steroid hormone</a>s. These tissues come from different <a href="Human%20embryogenesis">embryological</a> precursors and have distinct <a href="prenatal%20development">prenatal development</a> paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from <a href="mesoderm">mesoderm</a>, whereas the medulla is derived from the <a href="neural%20crest">neural crest</a>, which is of <a href="ectoderm">ectoderm</a>al origin.

The adrenal glands in a newborn baby are much larger as a proportion of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four times the size of the kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.

Adrenal cortex tissue is derived from the <a href="intermediate%20mesoderm">intermediate mesoderm</a>. It first appears 33 days after <a href="fertilisation">fertilisation</a>, shows <a href="Steroid%23Steroidogenesis">steroid hormone production</a> capabilities by the eighth week and undergoes rapid growth during the first trimester of pregnancy. The fetal adrenal cortex is different from its adult counterpart, as it is composed of two distinct zones: the inner "fetal" zone, which carries most of the hormone-producing activity, and the outer "definitive" zone, which is in a <a href="cell%20proliferation">proliferative</a> phase. The fetal zone produces large amounts of adrenal <a href="androgen">androgen</a>s (male sex hormones) that are used by the <a href="placenta">placenta</a> for <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a> biosynthesis. Cortical development of the adrenal gland is regulated mostly by <a href="Adrenocorticotropic%20hormone">ACTH</a>, a hormone produced by the <a href="pituitary%20gland">pituitary gland</a> that stimulates <a href="cortisol">cortisol</a> synthesis. During midgestation, the fetal zone occupies most of the cortical volume and produces 100–200 mg/day of <a href="DHEA-S">DHEA-S</a>, an <a href="androgen">androgen</a> and precursor of both androgens and <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a>s (female sex hormones). Adrenal hormones, especially <a href="glucocorticoid">glucocorticoid</a>s such as cortisol, are essential for prenatal development of organs, particularly for the maturation of the <a href="lung">lung</a>s. The adrenal gland decreases in size after birth because of the rapid disappearance of the fetal zone, with a corresponding decrease in androgen secretion.

During early childhood androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but several years before puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids <a href="dehydroepiandrosterone">DHEA</a> and <a href="dehydroepiandrosterone%20sulfate">DHEA-S</a>. These changes are part of a process called <a href="adrenarche">adrenarche</a>, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of <a href="Adrenocorticotropic%20hormone">ACTH</a> or <a href="gonadotropin">gonadotropin</a>s and correlates with a progressive thickening of the <a href="zona%20reticularis">zona reticularis</a> layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.

The adrenal medulla is derived from <a href="neural%20crest">neural crest cells</a>, which come from the <a href="ectoderm">ectoderm</a> layer of the <a href="embryo">embryo</a>. These cells <a href="cell%20migration">migrate</a> from their initial position and aggregate in the vicinity of the <a href="dorsal%20aorta">dorsal aorta</a>, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as <a href="Bone%20morphogenetic%20protein">BMP</a>s. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic nervous system</a>. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called <a href="chromaffin%20cells">chromaffin cells</a> because they contain granules that stain with <a href="chromium">chromium</a> salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. <a href="Glucocorticoid">Glucocorticoid</a>s produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that <a href="Bone%20morphogenetic%20protein%204">BMP-4</a> secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.

The normal function of the adrenal gland may be impaired by conditions such as infections, tumors, genetic disorders and <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>s, or as a <a href="side%20effect">side effect</a> of medical therapy. These disorders affect the gland either directly (as with infections or autoimmune diseases) or as a result of the dysregulation of hormone production (as in some types of <a href="Cushing%27s%20syndrome">Cushing's syndrome</a>) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms.

<a href="Cushing%27s%20syndrome">Cushing's syndrome</a> is the manifestation of glucocorticoid excess. It can be the result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the <a href="HPA%20axis">HPA axis</a> or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into <a href="Adrenocorticotropic%20hormone">ACTH</a>-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of <a href="endogeny">endogenous</a> Cushing's syndrome is a <a href="pituitary%20adenoma">pituitary adenoma</a> which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (<a href="hirsutism">hirsutism</a>), <a href="osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a>, depression and, most distinctively, <a href="striae">stretch marks</a> in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.

When the zona glomerulosa produces excess <a href="aldosterone">aldosterone</a>, the result is <a href="primary%20aldosteronism">primary aldosteronism</a>. Causes for this condition are bilateral <a href="hyperplasia">hyperplasia</a> (excessive tissue growth) of the glands, or aldosterone-producing <a href="adenoma">adenoma</a>s (a condition called <a href="Conn%27s%20syndrome">Conn's syndrome</a>). Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a> imbalance, increasing <a href="potassium">potassium</a> depletion and <a href="sodium">sodium</a> retention.

Adrenal insufficiency (the deficiency of <a href="glucocorticoid">glucocorticoid</a>s) occurs in about 5 in 10,000 in the general population. Diseases classified as "primary adrenal insufficiency" (including <a href="Addison%27s%20disease">Addison's disease</a> and genetic causes) directly affect the adrenal cortex. If a problem that affects the <a href="hypothalamict-pituitary-adrenal%20axis">hypothalamict-pituitary-adrenal axis</a> arises outside the gland, it is a "secondary adrenal insufficiency".

Addison's disease refers to primary hypoadrenalism, which is a deficiency in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an <a href="autoimmunity">autoimmune</a> condition, in which the body produces <a href="Antibody">antibodies</a> against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is <a href="hyperpigmentation">hyperpigmentation</a> of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.

A complication seen in untreated Addison's disease and other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the <a href="adrenal%20crisis">adrenal crisis</a>, a <a href="medical%20emergency">medical emergency</a> in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in <a href="hypovolemic%20shock">hypovolemic shock</a> and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to <a href="stupor">stupor</a> and <a href="coma">coma</a>. The management of adrenal crises includes the application of <a href="hydrocortisone">hydrocortisone</a> injections.

In secondary adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the <a href="hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal%20axis">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</a> leads to decreased stimulation of the adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, the most common cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of <a href="adrenocorticotropic%20hormone">adrenocorticotropic hormone</a> (ACTH) by the <a href="pituitary%20gland">pituitary gland</a>. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of <a href="mineralocorticoid">mineralocorticoid</a>s, which are under regulation of the <a href="renin-angiotensin%20system">renin-angiotensin system</a> instead.

<a href="Congenital%20adrenal%20hyperplasia">Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</a> is a <a href="congenital%20disease">congenital disease</a> in which <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s of enzymes that produce steroid hormones result in a glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the <a href="HPA%20axis">HPA axis</a>. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of <a href="corticotropin-releasing%20hormone">CRH</a> and <a href="Adrenocorticotropic%20hormone">ACTH</a>, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to <a href="21-hydroxylase">21-hydroxylase</a> deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not <a href="androgen">androgen</a>s. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous <a href="genitalia">genitalia</a> and <a href="secondary%20sex%20characteristic">secondary sex characteristic</a>s.

Adrenal tumors are commonly found as <a href="incidentaloma">incidentaloma</a>s, unexpected <a href="asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> tumors <a href="incidental%20findings">found</a> during <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a>. They are seen in around 3.4% of <a href="X-ray%20computed%20tomography">CT scans</a>, and in most cases they are benign <a href="Adrenocortical%20adenoma">adenoma</a>s. <a href="Adrenal%20carcinoma">Adrenal carcinoma</a>s are very rare, with an <a href="incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">incidence</a> of 1 case per million per year.

<a href="Pheochromocytomas">Pheochromocytomas</a> are tumors of the adrenal medulla that arise from <a href="chromaffin%20cell">chromaffin cell</a>s. They can produce a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety and <a href="palpitation">palpitation</a>s. Common signs include <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a> and <a href="tachycardia">tachycardia</a>. Surgery, especially adrenal <a href="laparoscopy">laparoscopy</a>, is the most common treatment for small pheochromocytomas.

<a href="Bartolomeo%20Eustachi">Bartolomeo Eustachi</a>, an Italian anatomist, is credited with the first description of the adrenal glands in 1563-4. However, these publications were part of the <a href="papal%20library">papal library</a> and did not receive public attention, which was first received with <a href="Caspar%20Bartholin%20the%20Elder">Caspar Bartholin the Elder</a>'s illustrations in 1611.

The adrenal glands are named for their location relative to the kidneys. The term "adrenal" comes from "ad-" (Latin, "near") and "renes" (Latin, "kidney"). Similarly, "suprarenal", as termed by <a href="Jean%20Riolan%20the%20Younger">Jean Riolan the Younger</a> in 1629, is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "<a href="%3Awikt%3Asupra-">supra</a>" () and "<a href="%3Awikt%3Arenes">renes</a>" (). The suprarenal nature of the glands was not truly accepted until the 19th century, as anatomists clarified the ductless nature of the glands and their likely secretory role – prior to this, there was some debate as to whether the glands were indeed suprarenal or part of the kidney.

One of the most recognized works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 with the publication of "On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule", by the English physician <a href="Thomas%20Addison">Thomas Addison</a>. In his monography, Addison described what the French physician <a href="Georges%20Phillipe%20Trousseau">George Trousseau</a> would later name <a href="Addison%27s%20disease">Addison's disease</a>, an eponym still used today for a condition of <a href="adrenal%20insufficiency">adrenal insufficiency</a> and its related clinical manifestations. In 1894, English physiologists <a href="George%20Oliver%20%28physician%29">George Oliver</a> and <a href="Edward%20Albert%20Sharpey-Schafer">Edward Schafer</a> studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their <a href="antihypotensive%20agent">pressor</a> effects. In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from the adrenal cortex to treat Addison's disease. <a href="Edward%20Calvin%20Kendall">Edward Calvin Kendall</a>, <a href="Philip%20Hench">Philip Hench</a> and <a href="Tadeusz%20Reichstein">Tadeusz Reichstein</a> were then awarded the 1950 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the adrenal hormones.

<doc id="2303" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303" title="Aramaic language">
Aramaic language

Aramaic (אַרָמָיָא "Arāmāyā", , ) is a language or group of languages belonging to the <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic subfamily</a> of the <a href="Afroasiatic%20languages">Afroasiatic language family</a>. More specifically, it is part of the <a href="Northwest%20Semitic%20languages">Northwest Semitic group</a>, which also includes the <a href="Canaanite%20languages">Canaanite languages</a> such as <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> and <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician</a>. The <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet">Aramaic alphabet</a> was widely adopted for other languages and is ancestral to the <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Syriac%20alphabet">Syriac</a> and <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a>s.

During its approximately 3100 years of written history, Aramaic has served variously as a language of administration of empires and as a language of divine worship, religious study and as the spoken tongue of a number of <a href="Semitic%20people">Semitic people</a>s from the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>.

Historically, Aramaic was the language of Aramean tribes, a Semitic peoples of the region around between the Levant and the northern Euphrates valley. By around 1000 BC, the Arameans had a string of kingdoms in what is now part of western <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. Aramaic rose to prominence under the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">Neo-Assyrians</a> (911–605 BC), under whose influence Aramaic became a prestige language and its use spread throughout most of <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. At its height, variants of Aramaic were spoken in all over what is today <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, south east and south central <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, north west <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="Palestinian%20territories">Palestinian territories</a>, <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> and parts of <a href="Eastern%20Arabia">Eastern Arabia</a> and Northern Arabia. Major literary compositions in Aramaic include parts of the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>, the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Daniel">pageRank.Book of Daniel</a> and the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ezra">pageRank.Book of Ezra</a>.

The scribes of the Neo-Assyrian bureaucracy had also used Aramaic, and this practice—together with other administrative practices—was subsequently inherited by the succeeding <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Neo-Babylonians</a> (605–539 BC), and the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemeninds</a> (539–323 BC). Mediated by scribes that had been trained in the language, highly standardized "written" Aramaic (in its Achaemenid form called <a href="Imperial%20Aramaic">Imperial Aramaic</a>) progressively also become the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of trade and commerce throughout the Achaemenid territories, which extended as far east as the Indus valley. (That use of "written" Aramaic subsequently led to the adoption of <a href="Aramaic%20script">Aramaic script</a> and as <a href="logograms">logograms</a> some Aramaic vocabulary in <a href="Pahlavi%20scripts">the written forms</a> of several <a href="Middle%20Iranian%20languages">Middle Iranian languages</a>, including those of <a href="Parthian%20language">Parthia</a>, <a href="Middle%20Persian">Persia</a>, <a href="Sogdian%20language">Sogdiana</a>, and <a href="Khwarezmian%20language">Chorasmia</a>).

Aramaic's long history and diverse and widespread use has led to the development of many divergent varieties, which are sometimes considered <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s, though they have become distinct enough over time that they are now sometimes considered as separate <a href="language">language</a>s. Therefore, there is not one singular, static Aramaic language; each time and place rather has had its own variation. The more widely spoken <a href="Eastern%20Aramaic">Eastern Aramaic</a> and <a href="Mandaic%20language">Mandaic</a> forms is today largely restricted to northern Iraq, north east Syria, north west Iran and south east Turkey, whilst the severely endangered <a href="Western%20Aramaic">Western Aramaic</a> is spoken by small communities in north western Syria and Israel. 

Certain dialects of Aramaic are also retained as a <a href="Sacred%20language">liturgical language</a> by certain religious communities. One of those liturgical dialects is <a href="Mandaic%20language">Mandaic</a>, which besides being a living variant of Aramaic is also the liturgical language of <a href="Mandaeism">Mandaeism</a>. Significantly more widespread is <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a>, the liturgical language of <a href="Syriac%20Christianity">Syriac Christianity</a>, in particular the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a>, the <a href="Chaldean%20Catholic%20Church">Chaldean Catholic Church</a>, the <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a>, the <a href="Assyrian%20Pentecostal%20Church">Assyrian Pentecostal Church</a>, <a href="Assyrian%20Evangelical%20Church">Assyrian Evangelical Church</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Ancient Church of the East</a>, <a href="Syriac%20Catholic%20Church">Syriac Catholic Church</a>, the <a href="Maronite%20Church">Maronite Church</a>, and the <a href="Saint%20Thomas%20Christian%20Churches">Indian Saint Thomas Christian Churches</a>. Syriac was also the liturgical language of several now-extinct <a href="gnosticism">gnostic</a> faiths, such as <a href="Manichaeism">Manichaeism</a>.

<a href="Neo-Aramaic%20languages">Neo-Aramaic languages</a> are still spoken today as a <a href="first%20language">first language</a> by many communities of <a href="Syriac%20Christian">Syriac Christian</a>s, <a href="Jews">Jews</a>, and <a href="Mandaeans">Mandaeans</a> of <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a>, most numerously by <a href="Assyrian%20Christians">Assyrian Christians</a> with numbers of fluent speakers among <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian people</a> ranging from approximately 575,000 to 1,000,000, with the main languages being <a href="Assyrian%20Neo-Aramaic">Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</a> (235,000 speakers), <a href="Chaldean%20Neo-Aramaic">Chaldean Neo-Aramaic</a> (216,000 speakers) and <a href="Turoyo%20language">Surayt/Turoyo</a> (112,000 to 450,000 speakers), together with a number of smaller closely related languages with no more than 5,000 to 10,000 speakers between them. They have retained use of the once dominant lingua franca despite subsequent <a href="language%20shift">language shift</a>s experienced throughout the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. The Aramaic languages are now considered <a href="endangered%20language">endangered</a>.

"Aram" is used as a proper name of several people in the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> (Hebrew Bible) including descendants of Shem (Genesis 10:22), Nahor (Genesis 22:21), and Jacob (1 Chronicles 7:34).

Ancient <a href="Aram%20%28biblical%20region%29">Aram</a>, bordering northern Israel and now called Syria, is considered the linguistic epicenter of Aramaic, the language of the <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a> who settled the area during the Bronze Age circa 3500 BC. The language is often mistakenly considered to have originated within Assyria (Iraq). In fact, <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a> carried their language and writing into Mesopotamia by voluntary migration, by forced exile of conquering armies, and by nomadic <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>n invasions of Babylonia during the period from 1200 to 1000 BC.

Interestingly, the Christian <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, for which the constituent texts are largely written in <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a>, translates the word "Hebrew" as "Aramaic". The Hellenized Jewish community of Alexandria instead translated "Aramaic" to "the Syrian tongue".

During the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">Neo-Assyrian</a> and <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Neo-Babylonian Empire</a>s, <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a>, the native speakers of Aramaic, began to settle in greater numbers, at first in <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, and later in <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> (<a href="Upper%20Mesopotamia">Upper Mesopotamia</a>, modern-day northern <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, northeast <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, northwest <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and south eastern <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> (what was Armenia at the time). The influx eventually resulted in the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">Neo-Assyrian Empire</a> (911–605 BC) adopting an <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a>-influenced <a href="Old%20Aramaic%20language%23Imperial%20Aramaic">Imperial Aramaic</a> as the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of its empire. This policy was continued by the short-lived <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Neo-Babylonian Empire</a> and <a href="Medes">Medes</a>, and all three empires became operationally bilingual in written sources, with Aramaic used alongside Akkadian. The <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> (539–323 BC) continued this tradition, and the extensive influence of these empires led to Aramaic gradually becoming the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of most of western Asia, the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. 

Beginning with the rise of the <a href="Rashidun%20Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate</a> in the late 7th century, Arabic gradually replaced Aramaic as the lingua franca of the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. However, Aramaic remains a spoken, literary, and liturgical language for local Christians and also some <a href="Jews">Jews</a>. Aramaic also continues to be spoken by the Assyrians of Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and northwest Iran, with diaspora communities in <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and southern <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. The <a href="Mandaeans">Mandaeans</a> also continue to use <a href="Mandaic%20language">Mandaic Aramaic</a> as a liturgical language, although most now speak Arabic as their <a href="first%20language">first language</a>. There are still also a small number of first-language speakers of <a href="Western%20Aramaic%20languages">Western Aramaic varieties</a> in isolated villages in western Syria.

The turbulence of the last two centuries (particularly the <a href="Assyrian%20genocide">Assyrian genocide</a>) has seen speakers of first-language and literary Aramaic dispersed throughout the world. However, there are a number of sizable Assyrian towns in northern Iraq such as <a href="Alqosh">Alqosh</a>, <a href="Bakhdida">Bakhdida</a>, <a href="Bartella">Bartella</a>, <a href="Tesqopa">Tesqopa</a>, and <a href="Tel%20Keppe">Tel Keppe</a>, and numerous small villages, where Aramaic is still the main spoken language, and many large cities in this region also have Assyrian Aramaic-speaking communities, particularly <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a>, <a href="Erbil">Erbil</a>, <a href="Kirkuk">Kirkuk</a>, <a href="Dohuk">Dohuk</a>, and <a href="al-Hasakah">al-Hasakah</a>. Aramaic is also experiencing a revival among <a href="Maronites%20in%20Israel">Maronites in Israel</a> in <a href="Jish">Jish</a>.

Aramaic is often spoken of as a single language, but is in reality a group of related languages. Some Aramaic languages differ more from each other than the Romance languages do among themselves. Its long history, extensive literature, and use by different religious communities are all factors in the diversification of the language. Some Aramaic dialects are mutually intelligible, whereas others are not, not unlike the situation with modern <a href="varieties%20of%20Arabic">varieties of Arabic</a>. Some Aramaic languages are known under different names; for example, <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> is particularly used to describe the <a href="Eastern%20Aramaic%20languages">Eastern Aramaic variety</a> used in Christian ethnic communities in Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, and northwestern Iran, and <a href="Saint%20Thomas%20Christians">Saint Thomas Christians</a> in India. Most dialects can be described as either "Eastern" or "Western", the dividing line being roughly the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, or slightly west of it. It is also helpful to draw a distinction between those Aramaic languages that are modern living languages (often called "Neo-Aramaic"), those that are still in use as literary languages, and those that are extinct and are only of interest to scholars. Although there are some exceptions to this rule, this classification gives "Modern", "Middle", and "Old" periods, alongside "Eastern" and "Western" areas, to distinguish between the various languages and dialects that are Aramaic.

The earliest Aramaic alphabet was based on the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician alphabet</a>. In time, Aramaic developed its distinctive "square" style. The ancient Israelites and other peoples of <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> adopted this alphabet for writing their own languages. Thus, it is better known as the <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew alphabet</a> today. This is the writing system used in <a href="Biblical%20Aramaic">Biblical Aramaic</a> and other Jewish writing in Aramaic. The other main writing system used for Aramaic was developed by Christian communities: a cursive form known as the <a href="Syriac%20alphabet">Syriac alphabet</a>. A highly modified form of the Aramaic alphabet, the <a href="Mandaic%20alphabet">Mandaic alphabet</a>, is used by the <a href="Mandaeism">Mandaeans</a>.

In addition to these writing systems, certain derivatives of the Aramaic alphabet were used in ancient times by particular groups: the <a href="Nabataean%20alphabet">Nabataean alphabet</a> in <a href="Petra">Petra</a> and the <a href="Palmyrene%20alphabet">Palmyrene alphabet</a> in <a href="Palmyra">Palmyra</a>. In modern times, <a href="Turoyo%20language">Turoyo</a> (see <a href="%23Modern%20Eastern%20Aramaic">below</a>) has sometimes been written in a <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>.

The history of Aramaic is broken down into three broad periods:

This classification is based on that used by Klaus Beyer.

The term "Old Aramaic" is used to describe the varieties of the language from its first known use until the point roughly marked by the rise of the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a> (224 AD), dominating the influential, eastern dialect region. As such, the term covers over thirteen centuries of the development of Aramaic. This vast time span includes all Aramaic that is now effectively extinct.

The central phase in the development of Old Aramaic was its official use by the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> (500–330 BC). The period before this, dubbed "Ancient Aramaic", saw the development of the language from being spoken in Aramaean city-states to become a major means of communication in diplomacy and trade throughout <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, local vernaculars became increasingly prominent, fanning the divergence of an Aramaic <a href="dialect%20continuum">dialect continuum</a> and the development of differing written standards.

"Ancient Aramaic" refers to the earliest known period of the language, from its origin until it becomes the lingua franca of the <a href="Fertile%20Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a>. It was the language of the Aramean city-states of <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, <a href="Hama">Hama</a>th and <a href="Arpad%2C%20Syria">Arpad</a>.
There are inscriptions that evidence the earliest use of the language, dating from the 10th century BC. These inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The alphabet of Aramaic at this early period seems to be based on the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician alphabet</a>, and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that, in time, a more refined alphabet, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. Due to increasing Aramean migration eastward, the Western periphery of Assyria became bilingual in Akkadian and Aramean at least as early as the mid-9th century BC. As the Neo-Assyrian Empire conquered Aramean lands west of the Euphrates, <a href="Tiglath-Pileser%20III">Tiglath-Pileser III</a> made Aramaic the Empire's second official language, and it eventually supplanted Akkadian completely.

From 700 BC, the language began to spread in all directions, but lost much of its unity. Different dialects emerged in Assyria, Babylonia, the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Around 600 BC, Adon, a <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>ite king, used Aramaic to write to an Egyptian <a href="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a>.

"Chaldee" or "Chaldean Aramaic" used to be common terms for the Aramaic of the Chaldean dynasty of <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>. It was used to describe <a href="Biblical%20Aramaic">Biblical Aramaic</a>, which was, however, written in a later style. It is not to be confused with the modern language <a href="Chaldean%20Neo-Aramaic">Chaldean Neo-Aramaic</a>.

Around 500 BC, following the Achaemenid conquest of Mesopotamia under <a href="Darius%20I">Darius I</a>, Aramaic (as had been used in that region) was adopted by the conquerors as the "vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed Official Aramaic or <a href="Old%20Aramaic%20language%23Imperial%20Aramaic">Imperial Aramaic</a>, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did". In 1955, Richard Frye questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an "official language", noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language. Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the lingua franca of the Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought.

Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect, and the inevitable influence of <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> gave the language a new clarity and robust flexibility. For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (in 331 BC), Imperial Aramaic – or near enough for it to be recognisable – would remain an influence on the various native <a href="Iranian%20languages">Iranian languages</a>. Aramaic script and – as ideograms – Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the <a href="Pahlavi%20scripts">Pahlavi scripts</a>.

One of the largest collections of Imperial Aramaic texts is that of the <a href="Persepolis">Persepolis</a> fortification tablets, which number about five hundred. Many of the extant documents witnessing to this form of Aramaic come from <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and <a href="Elephantine">Elephantine</a> in particular (see <a href="Elephantine%20papyri">Elephantine papyri</a>). Of them, the best known is the "<a href="Story%20of%20Ahikar">Story of Ahikar</a>", a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Proverbs">pageRank.Book of Proverbs</a>. Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loan word from a local language.

A group of thirty Aramaic documents from <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a> have been discovered, and an analysis was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BC Achaemenid administration of Bactria and <a href="Sogdia">Sogdia</a>.

The conquest by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> did not destroy the unity of Aramaic language and literature immediately. Aramaic that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the 5th century BC can be found right up to the early 2nd century BC. The <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucids</a> imposed <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> in the administration of <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> from the start of their rule. In the 3rd century BC, Greek overtook Aramaic as the common language in Egypt and Syria. However, a post-Achaemenid Aramaic continued to flourish from <a href="Iudaea%20Province">Judaea</a>, Assyria, Mesopotamia, through the Syrian Desert and into northern <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabia</a>.

<a href="Biblical%20Aramaic">Biblical Aramaic</a> is the Aramaic found in four discrete sections of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>:
Biblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. It is theorized that some Biblical Aramaic material originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. According to <a href="historical%20criticism">historical criticism</a>, defiant Jewish propaganda shaped Aramaic <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Daniel">Daniel</a> during <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> rule. These stories might have existed as oral traditions at their earliest stage. This might be one factor that led to differing collections of Daniel in the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> and the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a>, which presents a lightly <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>-influenced Aramaic.

Under the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official language of <a href="Hasmonean">Hasmonaean</a> Judaea (142–37 BC). It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the <a href="Qumran">Qumran</a> texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major <a href="Targum">Targum</a>s, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the <a href="Mishnah">Mishnah</a> and <a href="Tosefta">Tosefta</a>, although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.

Babylonian <a href="Targum">Targum</a>ic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the <a href="Targum%20Onkelos">Targum Onqelos</a> and <a href="Targum%20Jonathan">Targum Jonathan</a>, the "official" targums. The original, Hasmonaean targums had reached Babylon sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.

Galilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of <a href="Galilee">Galilee</a>. The Hasmonaean targums reached Galilee in the 2nd century AD, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was not considered an authoritative work by other communities, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended. From the 11th century AD onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.

Babylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the 3rd century AD onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the 12th century, all Jewish private documents are in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps because many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.

<a href="Nabataean%20Aramaic">Nabataean Aramaic</a> is the language of the Arameo-Arab kingdom of <a href="Petra">Petra</a>. The kingdom ("c." 200 BC–106 AD) covered the east bank of the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>, the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a> and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to <a href="Ancient%20North%20Arabian">Old North Arabic</a>. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: "l" is often turned into "n", and there are a few Arabic loanwords. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries AD The language is written in a <a href="cursive">cursive</a> script that is the precursor to the modern <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a>. The number of Arabic loanwords increases through the centuries, until, in the 4th century, Nabataean merges seamlessly with <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>.

Palmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the <a href="Syriac%20Christians">Syriac</a> city state of <a href="Palmyra">Palmyra</a> in the Syrian Desert from 44 BC to 274 AD. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive <a href="Syriac%20alphabet">Estrangela</a>. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a much lesser degree.

The use of "written" Aramaic in the Achaemenid bureaucracy also precipitated the adoption of Aramaic(-derived) scripts to render a number of <a href="Middle%20Iranian">Middle Iranian</a> languages. Moreover, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, continued to written as Aramaic "words" even when writing Middle Iranian languages. In time, in Iranian usage, these Aramaic "words" became disassociated from the Aramaic language and came to be understood as "signs" (i.e. <a href="logograms">logograms</a>), much like the symbol '&' is read as "and" in English and the original Latin "et" is now no longer obvious. Under the early 3rd-century BCE <a href="Arsacid%20Empire">Parthians Arsacids</a>, whose government used Greek but whose native language was <a href="Parthian%20language">Parthian</a>, the Parthian language and its Aramaic-derived writing system both gained prestige. This in turn also led to the adoption of the name '<a href="Pahlavi%20scripts">pahlavi</a>' (< "parthawi", "of the Parthians") for that writing system. The <a href="Sassanid%20empire">Persian Sassanids</a>, who succeeded the Parthian Arsacids in the mid-3rd century CE, subsequently inherited/adopted the Parthian-mediated Aramaic-derived writing system for their own Middle Iranian ethnolect as well. That particular Middle Iranian dialect, <a href="Middle%20Persian">Middle Persian</a>, i.e. the language of Persia proper, subsequently also became a prestige language. Following the conquest of the Sassanids by the Arabs in the 7th-century, the Aramaic-derived writing system was replaced by Arabic script in all but <a href="Middle%20Persian%20literature">Zoroastrian usage</a>, which continued to use the name 'pahlavi' for the Aramaic-derived writing system and went on to create the bulk of all Middle Iranian literature in that writing system.

The dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside these, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, these regional dialects became written languages in the 2nd century BC. These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic, and shows a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.

In the East, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. The written form of <a href="Mandaic%20language">Mandaic</a>, the language of the <a href="Mandaeism">Mandaean</a> religion, was descended from the Arsacid chancery script.

In the kingdom of <a href="Osroene">Osroene</a>, centred on <a href="Edessa%2C%20Mesopotamia">Edessa</a> and founded in 132 BC, the regional dialect became the official language: Old <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a>. On the upper reaches of the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a>, East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from <a href="Hatra">Hatra</a>, <a href="Assur">Assur</a> and the <a href="Tur%20Abdin">Tur Abdin</a>. <a href="Tatian">Tatian</a>, the author of the gospel harmony the <a href="Diatessaron">Diatessaron</a> came from Assyria, and perhaps wrote his work (172 AD) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (from "c." 70 AD). This everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.

The western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Aramaic came to coexist with Canaanite dialects, eventually completely displacing <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician</a> in the first century BC and <a href="Hebrew%20language%23Aramaic%20displaces%20Hebrew%20as%20a%20spoken%20language">Hebrew</a> around the turn of the fourth century AD.

The form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of <a href="Caesarea%20Philippi">Caesarea Philippi</a>. This is the dialect of the oldest manuscript of the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Enoch">pageRank.Book of Enoch</a> ("c." 170 BC). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean into the second century AD. Old Judean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> and receipts from <a href="Qumran">Qumran</a>. <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>' first, non-extant edition of his "<a href="The%20Jewish%20War">The Jewish War</a>" was written in Old Judean.

The Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the first century AD by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see <a href="Peshitta">Peshitta</a>).

It is generally believed by Christian scholars that in the first century, Jews in <a href="Judea%20%28Roman%20province%29">Judea</a> primarily spoke Aramaic with a decreasing number using <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> as their first language, though many learned Hebrew as a liturgical language. Additionally, <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a> was the lingua franca of the Middle East in trade, among the Hellenized classes (much like French in the 18th,19th and 20th centuries in Europe), and in the Roman administration. <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, the language of the Roman army and higher levels of administration, had almost no impact on the linguistic landscape.

In addition to the formal, literary dialects of Aramaic based on <a href="Hasmonean%20dynasty">Hasmonean</a> and Babylonian, there were a number of colloquial Aramaic dialects. Seven <a href="Western%20Aramaic%20languages">Western Aramaic varieties</a> were spoken in the vicinity of Judea in <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judean was the prominent dialect of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and Judaea. The region of <a href="Ein%20Gedi">Ein Gedi</a> was the Southeast Judaean dialect. <a href="Samaria">Samaria</a> had its distinctive <a href="Samaritan%20Aramaic%20language">Samaritan Aramaic</a>, where the consonants "<a href="he%20%28letter%29">he</a>", "" and "‘<a href="ayin">ayin</a>" all became pronounced as "<a href="aleph">aleph</a>". Galilean Aramaic, the dialect of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> and the <a href="Anti-Lebanon%20Mountains">Anti-Lebanon Mountains</a>, Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>, the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.

The three languages influenced one another, especially Hebrew and Aramaic. Hebrew words entered Jewish Aramaic (mostly technical religious words but also everyday words like עץ ' "wood"). Conversely, Aramaic words entered Hebrew (not only Aramaic words like "māmmôn" "wealth" but Aramaic ways of using words like making Hebrew ראוי "rā’ûi", "seen" mean "worthy" in the sense of "seemly", which is a calque of Aramaic ' meaning "seen" and "worthy").

The Greek of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> often preserves non-Greek semiticisms, including transliterations of <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic</a> words:

The 2004 film "<a href="The%20Passion%20of%20the%20Christ">The Passion of the Christ</a>" used Aramaic for much of its dialogue, specially reconstructed by a scholar, William Fulco, S.J. Where the appropriate words (in first century Aramaic) were no longer known, he used the Aramaic of Daniel, fourth-century Syriac and Hebrew as the basis for his work.

The 3rd century AD is taken as the threshold between Old and Middle Aramaic. During that century, the nature of the various Aramaic languages and dialects begins to change. The descendants of Imperial Aramaic ceased to be living languages, and the eastern and western regional languages began to form vital, new literatures. Unlike many of the dialects of Old Aramaic, much is known about the vocabulary and grammar of Middle Aramaic.

Only two of the Old Eastern Aramaic languages continued into this period. In the north of the region, Old Syriac moved into Middle Syriac. In the south, Jewish Old Babylonian became Jewish Middle Babylonian. The post-Achaemenid, Arsacid dialect became the background of the new <a href="Mandaic%20language">Mandaic language</a>.

Syriac (also "Middle Syriac") is the classical, literary, liturgical and often spoken language of <a href="Syriac%20Christianity">Syriac Christianity</a> to this day, particularly the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a>, <a href="Chaldean%20Catholic%20Church">Chaldean Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Ancient Church of the East</a>, <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a> and <a href="Saint%20Thomas%20Christians">Saint Thomas Christians</a>. It originated in fifth century BC <a href="Achaemenid%20Assyria">Achaemenid Assyria</a>, but its golden age was the fourth to sixth centuries. This period began with the translation of the Bible into the language: the <a href="Peshitta">Peshitta</a> and the masterful prose and poetry of <a href="Ephrem%20the%20Syrian">Ephrem the Syrian</a>. Middle Syriac became the language of those opposed to the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> leadership of the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20East">Church of the East</a>. Missionary activity by Assyrian and <a href="Nestorianism">Nestorian Christians</a> led to the spread of Syriac from Mesopotamia and <a href="Iran">Persia</a>, into <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">India</a> and <a href="China">China</a>.

Jewish Middle Babylonian is the language employed by Jewish writers in Babylonia between the fourth and the eleventh century. It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> (which was completed in the seventh century) and of post-Talmudic <a href="Geonim">Geonic</a> literature, which are the most important cultural products of Babylonian Judaism. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of <a href="incantation%20bowl">incantation bowl</a>s written in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic.

The <a href="Mandaic%20language">Mandaic language</a>, spoken by the <a href="Mandaeans">Mandaeans</a> of <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, is a sister dialect to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, though it is both linguistically and culturally distinct. Classical Mandaic is the language in which the Mandaean's <a href="gnosticism">gnostic</a> religious literature was composed. It is characterized by a highly phonetic orthography.

The dialects of Old Western Aramaic continued with Jewish Middle Palestinian (in <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew "square script"</a>), <a href="Samaritan%20Aramaic">Samaritan Aramaic</a> (in the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">old Hebrew script</a>) and Christian Palestinian (in cursive <a href="Syriac%20alphabet">Syriac script</a>). Of these three, only Jewish Middle Palestinian continued as a written language.

In 135, after the <a href="Bar%20Kokhba%20revolt">Bar Kokhba revolt</a>, many <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish leaders, expelled from <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, moved to <a href="Galilee">Galilee</a>. The Galilean dialect thus rose from obscurity to become the standard among Jews in the west. This dialect was spoken not only in Galilee, but also in the surrounding parts. It is the linguistic setting for the <a href="Jerusalem%20Talmud">Jerusalem Talmud</a> (completed in the 5th century), Palestinian <a href="targum">targum</a>im (Jewish Aramaic versions of scripture), and <a href="midrash">midrash</a>im (biblical commentaries and teaching). The standard <a href="niqqud">vowel pointing</a> for the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, the Tiberian system (7th century), was developed by speakers of the Galilean dialect of Jewish Middle Palestinian. Classical Hebrew vocalisation, therefore, in representing the Hebrew of this period, probably reflects the contemporary pronunciation of this Aramaic dialect.

<a href="Middle%20Judaean%20Aramaic">Middle Judaean</a>, the descendant of <a href="Old%20Judaean%20Aramaic">Old Judaean</a>, was no longer the dominant dialect, and was used only in southern Judaea (the variant Engedi dialect continued throughout this period). Likewise, <a href="Middle%20East%20Jordanian%20Aramaic">Middle East Jordanian</a> continues as a minor dialect from <a href="Old%20East%20Jordanian%20Aramaic">Old East Jordanian</a>. The inscriptions in the synagogue at <a href="Dura-Europos">Dura-Europos</a> are either in Middle East Jordanian or Middle Judaean.

The <a href="Samaritan%20Aramaic%20language">Samaritan Aramaic</a> is earliest attested by the documentary tradition of the <a href="Samaritans">Samaritans</a> that can be dated back to the fourth century. Its modern pronunciation is based on the form used in the tenth century.

Sometimes referred to as "Melkite Aramaic", it is the language of Western-Aramaic-speaking Christians. It is evidenced from the 5th–6th century, but probably existed two centuries earlier. The language itself comes from Old Christian Palestinian Aramaic, but its writing conventions were based on early <a href="Middle%20Syriac">Middle Syriac</a>, and it was heavily influenced by <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>. For example, the name Jesus, although ישוע "Yešua’" in Jewish Aramaic, and "Išo" in Syriac, is written "Yesûs" (a transliteration of the Greek form) in Christian Palestinian.

As the <a href="Western%20Aramaic">Western Aramaic</a> languages of the Levant and Lebanon have become nearly extinct in non-liturgical usage, the most prolific speakers of Aramaic dialects today are predominantly ethnic <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a> Eastern Neo-Aramaic speakers, the most numerous being the <a href="Northeast%20Neo-Aramaic">Northeast Neo-Aramaic speakers</a> of Mesopotamia. This includes speakers of <a href="Assyrian%20Neo-Aramaic">Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</a> (235,000 speakers), <a href="Chaldean%20Neo-Aramaic">Chaldean Neo-Aramaic</a> (216,000 speakers), and <a href="Turoyo%20language">Turoyo (Surayt)</a> (112,000 to 450,000 speakers). Having largely lived in remote areas as insulated communities for over a millennium, the remaining modern speakers of Aramaic dialects, such as the Assyrians, and the <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a>, escaped the linguistic pressures experienced by others during the large-scale <a href="language%20shift">language shift</a>s that saw the proliferation of other tongues among those who previously did not speak them, most recently the <a href="Arabization">Arabization</a> of the Middle East and North Africa by <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> beginning with the <a href="early%20Muslim%20conquests">early Muslim conquests</a> of the seventh century.

Another Eastern Aramaic language, Neo-Mandaean, is spoken by the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran. They number some 50,000–75,000 people, but it is believed the Mandaic language may now be spoken fluently by as few as 6000 people, with other Mandaeans having varying degrees of knowledge.

Modern Eastern Aramaic exists in a wide variety of dialects and languages. There is significant difference between the Aramaic spoken by Jews, Christians, and Mandaeans.

The Christian varieties are often called Modern Syriac (or Neo-Syriac, particularly when referring to their literature), being deeply influenced by the literary and liturgical language of Middle Syriac. However, they also have roots in numerous, previously unwritten, local Aramaic varieties, and are not purely the direct descendants of the language of <a href="Ephrem%20the%20Syrian">Ephrem the Syrian</a>. The varieties are not all mutually intelligible. The principal Christian varieties are <a href="Assyrian%20Neo-Aramaic">Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</a> and <a href="Chaldean%20Neo-Aramaic">Chaldean Neo-Aramaic</a>, both used by the ethnic <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrians</a> of Iraq, southeast Turkey, Iran, and northeast Syria.

The <a href="Judeo-Aramaic%20languages">Judeo-Aramaic languages</a> are now mostly spoken in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, and most are facing extinction. The Jewish varieties that have come from communities that once lived between <a href="Lake%20Urmia">Lake Urmia</a> and <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a> are not all mutually intelligible. In some places, for example <a href="Urmia">Urmia</a>, Assyrian Christians and Jews speak mutually unintelligible varieties of Modern Eastern Aramaic in the same place. In others, the <a href="Nineveh%20plains">Nineveh plains</a> around Mosul for example, the varieties of these two ethnic communities are similar enough to allow conversation.

Modern <a href="Central%20Neo-Aramaic">Central Neo-Aramaic</a>, being in between Western Neo-Aramaic and Eastern Neo-Aramaic) is generally represented by Turoyo, the language of the Assyrians of <a href="Tur%20Abdin">Tur Abdin</a>. A related language, <a href="Mlahs%C3%B4%20language">Mlahsô</a>, has recently become extinct.

Mandaeans living in the <a href="Khuzestan%20Province">Khuzestan Province</a> of Iran and scattered throughout Iraq, speak Modern Mandaic. It is quite distinct from any other Aramaic variety.

Central Neo-Aramaic consists of <a href="Turoyo">Turoyo</a> and the recently extinct <a href="Mlahs%C3%B4">Mlahsô</a>.

Very little remains of Western Aramaic. It is still spoken in the villages of <a href="Ma%27loula">Ma'loula</a>, <a href="al-Sarkha%20%28Bakhah%29">al-Sarkha (Bakhah)</a>, and <a href="Jubb%27adin">Jubb'adin</a> on <a href="Syria">Syria</a>'s side of the <a href="Anti-Lebanon%20Mountains">Anti-Lebanon Mountains</a>, as well as by some people who migrated from these villages, to <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> and other larger towns of Syria. All these speakers of Modern Western Aramaic are fluent in Arabic, which has now become the main language in these villages. <a href="Jewish%20Palestinian%20Aramaic">Jewish Palestinian Aramaic</a> and <a href="Samaritan%20Aramaic">Samaritan Aramaic</a> are preserved in liturgical and literary usage.

Each dialect of Aramaic has its own distinctive pronunciation, and it would not be feasible here to go into all these properties. Aramaic has a phonological palette of 25 to 40 distinct phonemes. Some modern Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of "emphatic" consonants, and some have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>, <a href="Azerbaijani%20language">Azerbaijani</a>, <a href="Kurdish%20languages">Kurdish</a>, <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> and <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>.

As with most Semitic languages, Aramaic can be thought of as having three basic sets of vowels:
These vowel groups are relatively stable, but the exact articulation of any individual is most dependent on its consonantal setting.

The open vowel is an open near-front unrounded vowel ("short" "a", somewhat like the first vowel in the English "batter", ). It usually has a back counterpart ("long" "a", like the "a" in "father", , or even tending to the vowel in "caught", ), and a front counterpart ("short" "e", like the vowel in "head", ). There is much correspondence between these vowels between dialects. There is some evidence that Middle Babylonian dialects did not distinguish between the short "a" and short "e". In West Syriac dialects, and possibly Middle Galilean, the long "a" became the "o" sound. The open "e" and back "a" are often indicated in writing by the use of the letters א "alaph" (a <a href="glottal%20stop">glottal stop</a>) or ה "he" (like the English "h").

The close front vowel is the "long" "i" (like the vowel in "need", ). It has a slightly more open counterpart, the "long" "e", as in the final vowel of "café" (). Both of these have shorter counterparts, which tend to be pronounced slightly more open. Thus, the short close "e" corresponds with the open "e" in some dialects. The close front vowels usually use the consonant י "y" as a <a href="mater%20lectionis">mater lectionis</a>.

The close back vowel is the "long" "u" (like the vowel in "school", ). It has a more open counterpart, the "long" "o", like the vowel in "low" (). There are shorter, and thus more open, counterparts to each of these, with the short close "o" sometimes corresponding with the long open "a". The close back vowels often use the consonant ו "w" to indicate their quality.

Two basic <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s exist: an open vowel followed by י "y" ("ay"), and an open vowel followed by ו "w" ("aw"). These were originally full diphthongs, but many dialects have converted them to "e" and "o" respectively.

The so-called "emphatic" consonants (see the next section) cause all vowels to become mid-centralised.

The various alphabets used for writing Aramaic languages have twenty-two letters (all of which are consonants). Some of these letters, though, can stand for two or three different sounds (usually a <a href="stop%20consonant">stop</a> and a <a href="fricative%20consonant">fricative</a> at the same point of articulation). Aramaic classically uses a series of lightly contrasted plosives and fricatives:
Each member of a certain pair is written with the same letter of the alphabet in most writing systems (that is, "p" and "f" are written with the same letter), and are near <a href="allophone">allophone</a>s.

A distinguishing feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) is the presence of "emphatic" consonants. These are consonants that are pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted, with varying degrees of <a href="pharyngealization">pharyngealization</a> and <a href="Velar%20consonant">velarization</a>. Using their alphabetic names, these emphatics are:
Ancient Aramaic may have had a larger series of emphatics, and some Neo-Aramaic languages definitely do. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.

Overlapping with the set of emphatics are the "guttural" consonants. They include ח Ḥêṯ and ע ʽAyn from the emphatic set, and add א ʼĀlap̄ (a <a href="glottal%20stop">glottal stop</a>) and ה Hê (as the English "h").

Aramaic classically has a set of four <a href="sibilant">sibilant</a>s (ancient Aramaic may have had six):

In addition to these sets, Aramaic has the <a href="nasal%20consonant">nasal consonant</a>s מ "m" and נ "n", and the <a href="approximant%20consonant">approximants</a> ר "r" (usually an <a href="Dental%2C%20alveolar%20and%20postalveolar%20trills">alveolar trill</a>), ל "l", י "y" and ו "w".

Six broad features of sound change can be seen as dialect differentials:

As with other Semitic languages, Aramaic <a href="morphology%20%28linguistics%29">morphology</a> (the way words are formed) is based on the consonantal <a href="Semitic%20root">root</a>. The root generally consists of two or three consonants and has a basic meaning, for example, כת״ב "k-t-b" has the meaning of 'writing'. This is then modified by the addition of vowels and other consonants to create different nuances of the basic meaning:

Aramaic nouns and adjectives are inflected to show "gender", "number" and "state".

Aramaic has two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. The feminine absolute singular is often marked by the ending ה- "-â".

Nouns can be either singular or plural, but an additional "dual" number exists for nouns that usually come in pairs. The dual number gradually disappeared from Aramaic over time and has little influence in Middle and Modern Aramaic.

Aramaic nouns and adjectives can exist in one of three states. To a certain extent, these states correspond to the role of articles and cases in the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European languages</a>:

Whereas other <a href="Northwest%20Semitic%20languages">Northwest Semitic languages</a>, like Hebrew, have the absolute and construct states, the emphatic/determined state is a unique feature to Aramaic. <a href="Inflection">Case endings</a>, as in <a href="Ugaritic%20grammar%23Case">Ugaritic</a>, probably existed in a very early stage of the language, and glimpses of them can be seen in a few compound proper names. However, as most of those cases were expressed by short final vowels, they were never written, and the few characteristic long vowels of the masculine plural accusative and genitive are not clearly evidenced in inscriptions. Often, the <a href="Object%20%28grammar%29">direct object</a> is marked by a prefixed -ל "l-" (the <a href="preposition%20and%20postposition">preposition</a> "to") if it is definite.

Adjectives agree with their nouns in number and gender but agree in state only if used attributively. Predicative adjectives are in the absolute state regardless of the state of their noun (a <a href="copula%20%28linguistics%29">copula</a> may or may not be written). Thus, an attributive adjective to an emphatic noun, as in the phrase "the good king", is written also in the emphatic state מלכא טבא "malkâ ṭāḇâ"—king[emph.] good[emph.]. In comparison, the predicative adjective, as in the phrase "the king is good", is written in the absolute state מלכא טב "malkâ ṭāḇ"—king[emph.] good[abs.].

The final א- "-â" in a number of these suffixes is written with the letter <a href="aleph">aleph</a>. However, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the letter <a href="he%20%28letter%29">he</a> for the feminine absolute singular. Likewise, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the Hebrew masculine absolute singular suffix ים- "-îm" instead of ין- "-în". The masculine determined plural suffix, יא- "-ayyâ", has an alternative version, "-ê". The alternative is sometimes called the "gentilic plural" for its prominent use in ethnonyms (יהודיא "yəhûḏāyê", 'the Jews', for example). This alternative plural is written with the letter <a href="aleph">aleph</a>, and came to be the only plural for nouns and adjectives of this type in Syriac and some other varieties of Aramaic. The masculine construct plural, "-ê", is written with <a href="yodh">yodh</a>. In Syriac and some other variants this ending is <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>ized to "-ai".

Possessive phrases in Aramaic can either be made with the construct state or by linking two nouns with the relative particle -[ד[י "d[î]-". As the use of the construct state almost disappears from the Middle Aramaic period on, the latter method became the main way of making possessive phrases.
For example, the various forms of possessive phrases (for "the handwriting of the queen") are:
In Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common. In Biblical Aramaic, the last form is virtually absent.

The Aramaic verb has gradually evolved in time and place, varying between varieties of the language. Verb forms are marked for <a href="grammatical%20person">person</a> (first, second or third), <a href="grammatical%20number">number</a> (singular or plural), <a href="grammatical%20gender">gender</a> (masculine or feminine), <a href="grammatical%20tense">tense</a> (perfect or imperfect), <a href="grammatical%20mood">mood</a> (indicative, imperative, jussive or infinitive) and <a href="voice%20%28grammar%29">voice</a> (active, reflexive or passive). Aramaic also employs a system of <a href="grammatical%20conjugation">conjugation</a>s, or verbal stems, to mark intensive and extensive developments in the lexical meaning of verbs.

Aramaic has two proper <a href="grammatical%20tense">tenses</a>: <a href="perfective%20aspect">perfect</a> and <a href="imperfective%20aspect">imperfect</a>. These were originally <a href="grammatical%20aspect">aspectual</a>, but developed into something more like a <a href="preterite">preterite</a> and <a href="future%20tense">future</a>. The perfect is <a href="Markedness">unmarked</a>, while the imperfect uses various <a href="prefix">preformative</a>s that vary according to person, number and gender. In both tenses the third-person singular masculine is the unmarked form from which others are derived by addition of <a href="Suffix">afformative</a>s (and preformatives in the imperfect). In the chart below (on the root כת״ב K-T-B, meaning "to write"), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is <a href="Syriac%20language">Classical Syriac</a>.

Like other Semitic languages, Aramaic employs a number of <a href="Derived%20stem">derived verb stems</a>, to extend the lexical coverage of verbs. The basic form of the verb is called the "ground stem", or "G-stem". Following the tradition of mediaeval Arabic grammarians, it is more often called the Pə‘al פעל (also written Pe‘al), using the form of the <a href="Semitic%20root">Semitic root</a> פע״ל P-‘-L, meaning "to do". This stem carries the basic lexical meaning of the verb.

By doubling of the second radical, or root letter, the D-stem or פעל Pa‘‘el is formed. This is often an intensive development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, "qəṭal" means "he killed", whereas "qaṭṭel" means "he slew". The precise relationship in meaning between the two stems differs for every verb.

A <a href="preformative">preformative</a>, which can be -ה "ha-", -א "a-" or -ש "ša-", creates the C-stem or variously the Hap̄‘el, Ap̄‘el or Šap̄‘el (also spelt הפעל Haph‘el, אפעל Aph‘el and שפעל Shaph‘el). This is often an extensive or causative development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, טעה "ṭə‘â" means "he went astray", whereas אטעי "aṭ‘î" means "he deceived". The Šap̄‘el שפעל is the least common variant of the C-stem. Because this variant is standard in Akkadian, it is possible that its use in Aramaic represents loanwords from that language. The difference between the variants הפעל Hap̄‘el and אפעל Ap̄‘el appears to be the gradual dropping of the initial ה "h" sound in later Old Aramaic. This is noted by the respelling of the older <a href="he%20%28letter%29">he</a> preformative with א <a href="aleph">aleph</a>.

These three conjugations are supplemented with three further derived stems, produced by the preformative -הת "hiṯ-" or -את "eṯ-". The loss of the initial ה "h" sound occurs similarly to that in the form above. These three derived stems are the Gt-stem, התפעל Hiṯpə‘el or אתפעל Eṯpə‘el (also written Hithpe‘el or Ethpe‘el), the Dt-stem, התפעּל Hiṯpa‘‘al or אתפעּל Eṯpa‘‘al (also written Hithpa‘‘al or Ethpa‘‘al), and the Ct-stem, התהפעל Hiṯhap̄‘al, אתּפעל Ettap̄‘al, השתפעל Hištap̄‘al or אשתפעל Eštap̄‘al (also written Hithhaph‘al, Ettaph‘al, Hishtaph‘al or Eshtaph‘al). Their meaning is usually <a href="reflexive%20verb">reflexive</a>, but later became <a href="passive%20voice">passive</a>. However, as with other stems, actual meaning differs from verb to verb.

Not all verbs utilise all of these conjugations, and, in some, the G-stem is not used. In the chart below (on the root כת״ב K-T-B, meaning "to write"), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is <a href="Syriac%20language">Classical Syriac</a>.

Aramaic also has two proper <a href="grammatical%20tense">tenses</a>: the perfect and the imperfect. In Imperial Aramaic, the <a href="participle">participle</a> began to be used for a <a href="historical%20present">historical present</a>. Perhaps under influence from other languages, Middle Aramaic developed a system of composite tenses (combinations of forms of the verb with pronouns or an <a href="auxiliary%20verb">auxiliary verb</a>), allowing for narrative that is more vivid. The syntax of Aramaic (the way sentences are put together) usually follows the order verb–subject–object (VSO). Imperial (Persian) Aramaic, however, tended to follow a S-O-V pattern (similar to Akkadian), which was the result of Persian syntactic influence.

The World's first Aramaic language <a href="word%20processor">word processing software</a> was developed in 1986–1987 in <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> by information technology professional <a href="Sunil%20Sivanand">Sunil Sivanand</a> (1953– ), who is now Managing Director and Chief Technology Architect at Acette. Sunil Sivanand did most of the character generation and programming work on a first generation, twin disk drive <a href="IBM%20Personal%20Computer">IBM Personal Computer</a>. The project was sponsored by <a href="Daniel%20Benjamin">Daniel Benjamin</a>, who was a patron of a group of individuals working worldwide to preserve and revive the Aramaic language.

Saint Titus

Titus (; ) was an early Christian missionary and church leader, a companion and disciple of <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a>, mentioned in several of the <a href="Pauline%20epistles">Pauline epistles</a> including the <a href="Epistle%20to%20Titus">Epistle to Titus</a>. He is believed to be a Gentile converted to Christianity by Paul and, according to tradition, he was consecrated as Bishop of the Island of <a href="Crete">Crete</a>.

Titus brought a fundraising letter from Paul to <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>, to collect for the poor in Jerusalem. Later, on Crete, Titus appointed <a href="presbyter">presbyter</a>s (elders) in every city and remained there into his old age, dying in <a href="Gortyna">Gortyna</a>, near the city of Candia (modern <a href="Heraklion">Heraklion</a>).

Titus was a Greek, apparently from <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>, who is said to have studied Greek philosophy and poetry in his early years. He seems to have been converted by Paul, whereupon he served as Paul's secretary and interpreter. In the year 49, Titus accompanied Paul to the council held at Jerusalem, on the subject of the <a href="Moses">Mosaic</a> rites. Although Paul had consented to the circumcision of <a href="Saint%20Timothy">Timothy</a>, in order to render his ministry acceptable among the Jews, he would not allow the same in regard to Titus, so as not to seem in agreement with those who would require it for <a href="Gentile">Gentile</a> converts.

Towards the close of the year 56, Paul, as he himself departed from Asia, sent Titus from <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> to <a href="Corinth%2C%20Greece">Corinth</a>, with full commission to remedy the fallout precipitated by Timothy's delivery of 1 Corinthians and Paul's "Painful Visit", particularly a significant personal offense and challenge to Paul's authority by one unnamed individual. During this journey, Titus served as the courier for what is commonly known as the "Severe Letter", a Pauline missive that has been lost but is referred to in 2 Corinthians.

After success on this mission, Titus journeyed north and met Paul in <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonia</a>. There the apostle, overjoyed by Titus' success, wrote 2 Corinthians. Titus then returned to Corinth with a larger entourage, carrying 2 Corinthians with him. Paul joined Titus in Corinth later. From Corinth, Paul then sent Titus to organize the collections of alms for the Christians at Jerusalem. Titus was therefore a troubleshooter, peacemaker, administrator, and missionary.

Early church tradition holds that Paul, after his release from his first imprisonment in Rome, stopped at the island of Crete to preach. Due to the needs of other churches, requiring his presence elsewhere, he ordained his disciple Titus as bishop of that island, and left him to finish the work he had started. Chrysostom says that this is an indication of the esteem St. Paul held for Titus.

Paul summoned Titus from Crete to join him at Nicopolis in Epirus. Later, Titus traveled to <a href="Early%20centers%20of%20Christianity%23Salona">Dalmatia</a>. The <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> does not record his death.

It has been argued that the name "Titus" in 2 Corinthians and Galatians is nothing more than an informal name used by Timothy, implied already by the fact that even though both are said to be long-term close companions of Paul, they never appear in common scenes. The theory proposes that a number of passages—1 Cor. 4:17, 16.10; 2 Cor. 2:13, 7:6, 13–14, 12:18; and Acts 19.22—all refer to the same journey of a single individual, Titus-Timothy. <a href="2%20Timothy">2 Timothy</a> seems to dispute this, by claiming that Titus has gone to Dalmatia (). The fact that Paul made a point of circumcising Timothy () but refused to circumcise Titus () indicates that they are different men.

The feast day of Titus was not included in the <a href="Tridentine%20Calendar">Tridentine Calendar</a>. When added in 1854, it was assigned to 6 February. In 1969, the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> assigned the feast to 26 January so as to celebrate the two disciples of Paul, Titus and Timothy, the day after the feast of the <a href="Conversion%20of%20St.%20Paul">Conversion of St. Paul</a>. The <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20America">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a> celebrates these two, together with <a href="Silas">Silas</a>, on the same date. The <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Church</a> commemorates him on 25 August and on 4 January.

His relics, now consisting of only his skull, are venerated in the Church of St. Titus, <a href="Heraklion">Heraklion</a>, Crete, to which it was returned in 1966<ref name="The Orthodox Messenger, v. 8(7/8), July/Aug 1997"><a href="http%3A//www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/titus.htm">The Orthodox Messenger, v. 8(7/8), July/Aug 1997</a></ref> after being removed to Venice during the Turkish occupation.

St. Titus is the patron saint of the United States Army Chaplain Corps. The Corps has established the Order of Titus Award, described by the Department of Defense:

Actinide

The actinide or actinoid (<a href="Chemical%20nomenclature">IUPAC nomenclature</a>) series encompasses the 15 metallic <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s with <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>s from 89 to 103, <a href="actinium">actinium</a> through <a href="lawrencium">lawrencium</a>.

Strictly speaking, both <a href="actinium">actinium</a> and <a href="lawrencium">lawrencium</a> have been labeled as <a href="group%203%20element">group 3 element</a>s, but both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the actinide elements. Actinium is the more often omitted of the two, because its placement as a group 3 element is somewhat more common in texts and for semantic reasons: since "actinide" means "like actinium", it has been argued that actinium cannot logically be an actinide, even though IUPAC acknowledges its inclusion based on common usage.

The actinide series derives its name from the first element in the series, actinium. The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the actinides are <a href="f-block">f-block</a> elements, with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a>, although actinium and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element. In comparison with the <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s, also mostly <a href="f-block">f-block</a> elements, the actinides show much more variable <a href="valence%20%28chemistry%29">valence</a>. They all have very large <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic</a> and <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic radii</a> and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position.

All actinides are <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a> and release energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="thorium">thorium</a>, and synthetically produced <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> are the most abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s and <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and <a href="americium">americium</a> is used in the <a href="ionization%20chamber">ionization chamber</a>s of most modern <a href="smoke%20detector">smoke detector</a>s.

Of the actinides, <a href="Primordial%20nuclide">primordial</a> <a href="thorium">thorium</a> and <a href="uranium">uranium</a> occur naturally in substantial quantities. The radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of <a href="actinium">actinium</a> and <a href="protactinium">protactinium</a>, and atoms of <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a> and plutonium are occasionally produced from <a href="Nuclear%20transmutation">transmutation</a> reactions in <a href="uranium%20ore">uranium ore</a>s. The other actinides are purely <a href="synthetic%20element">synthetic element</a>s. Nuclear weapons tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the <a href="natural%20environment">environment</a>; analysis of debris from a 1952 <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a> explosion showed the presence of americium, curium, berkelium, californium, <a href="einsteinium">einsteinium</a> and <a href="fermium">fermium</a>.

In presentations of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table, with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a> or <a href="lutetium">lutetium</a>, and either <a href="actinium">actinium</a> or <a href="lawrencium">lawrencium</a>, respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between <a href="barium">barium</a> and <a href="hafnium">hafnium</a>, and <a href="radium">radium</a> and <a href="rutherfordium">rutherfordium</a>, respectively. This convention is entirely a matter of <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a> and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods).

Like the <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s, the actinides form a family of elements with similar properties. Within the actinides, there are two overlapping groups: <a href="transuranium%20element">transuranium element</a>s, which follow uranium in the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>—and <a href="Transuranium%20element">transplutonium element</a>s, which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for <a href="promethium">promethium</a>) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. The majority of them do not even occur in nature, and of those that do, only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities. The most abundant, or easily synthesized actinides are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and curium.

The existence of transuranium elements was suggested by <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> based on his experiments in 1934. However, even though four actinides were known by that time, it was not yet understood that they formed a family similar to lanthanides. The prevailing view that dominated early research into transuranics was that they were regular elements in the 7th period, with thorium, protactinium and uranium corresponding to 6th-period <a href="hafnium">hafnium</a>, <a href="tantalum">tantalum</a> and <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>, respectively. Synthesis of transuranics gradually undermined this point of view. By 1944 an observation that curium failed to exhibit oxidation states above 4 (whereas its supposed 6th period homolog, <a href="platinum">platinum</a>, can reach oxidation state of 6) prompted <a href="Glenn%20Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a> to formulate a so-called "actinide hypothesis". Studies of known actinides and discoveries of further transuranic elements provided more data in support of this point of view, but the phrase "actinide hypothesis" (the implication being that a "hypothesis" is something that has not been decisively proven) remained in active use by scientists through the late 1950s.

At present, there are two major methods of producing <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s of <a href="Transuranium%20element">transplutonium elements</a>: (1) irradiation of the lighter elements with either <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s or (2) accelerated charged particles. The first method is most important for applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.

In 1962–1966, there were attempts in the United States to produce transplutonium isotopes using a series of six <a href="Underground%20nuclear%20testing">underground nuclear explosions</a>. Small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products, but no isotopes with <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> greater than 257 could be detected, despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long <a href="half-life">half-lives</a> of <a href="Alpha%20decay">α-decay</a>. This <a href="inobservation">inobservation</a> was attributed to <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> owing to the large speed of the products and to other decay channels, such as neutron emission and <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a>.

Uranium and thorium were the first actinides <a href="discovery%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">discovered</a>. Uranium was identified in 1789 by the German chemist <a href="Martin%20Heinrich%20Klaproth">Martin Heinrich Klaproth</a> in <a href="Uraninite">pitchblende</a> ore. He named it after the planet <a href="Uranus%20%28planet%29">Uranus</a>, which had been discovered only eight years earlier. Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely <a href="sodium%20diuranate">sodium diuranate</a>) by dissolving <a href="pitchblende">pitchblende</a> in <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> and neutralizing the solution with <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a>. He then reduced the obtained yellow powder with charcoal, and extracted a black substance that he mistook for metal. Only 60 years later, the French scientist <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne-Melchior%20P%C3%A9ligot">Eugène-Melchior Péligot</a> identified it as uranium oxide. He also isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating <a href="uranium%20tetrachloride">uranium tetrachloride</a> with metallic <a href="potassium">potassium</a>. The <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> of uranium was then calculated as 120, but <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> in 1872 corrected it to 240 using his periodicity laws. This value was confirmed experimentally in 1882 by K. Zimmerman.

<a href="Thorium%20oxide">Thorium oxide</a> was discovered by <a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a> in the mineral, which was found in Norway (1827). <a href="J%C3%B6ns%20Jacob%20Berzelius">Jöns Jacob Berzelius</a> characterized this material in more detail by in 1828. By reduction of thorium tetrachloride with potassium, he isolated the metal and named it thorium after the <a href="norse%20mythology">Norse god</a> of thunder and lightning <a href="Thor">Thor</a>. The same isolation method was later used by Péligot for uranium.

Actinium was discovered in 1899 by <a href="Andr%C3%A9-Louis%20Debierne">André-Louis Debierne</a>, an assistant of <a href="Marie%20Curie">Marie Curie</a>, in the pitchblende waste left after removal of radium and polonium. He described the substance (in 1899) as similar to <a href="titanium">titanium</a> and (in 1900) as similar to thorium. The discovery of actinium by Debierne was however questioned in 1971 and 2000, arguing that Debierne's publications in 1904 contradicted his earlier work of 1899–1900. This view instead credits the 1902 work of <a href="Friedrich%20Oskar%20Giesel">Friedrich Oskar Giesel</a>, who discovered a radioactive element named "emanium" that behaved similarly to lanthanum. The name actinium comes from the Greek "aktis, aktinos" (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. This metal was discovered not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products. Owing to the close similarity of actinium and lanthanum and low abundance, pure actinium could only be produced in 1950. The term actinide was probably introduced by <a href="Victor%20Goldschmidt">Victor Goldschmidt</a> in 1937.

<a href="Protactinium">Protactinium</a> was possibly isolated in 1900 by <a href="William%20Crookes">William Crookes</a>. It was first identified in 1913, when <a href="Kasimir%20Fajans">Kasimir Fajans</a> and Oswald Helmuth Göhring encountered the short-lived isotope Pa (half-life 1.17 minutes) during their studies of the U decay. They named the new element "brevium" (from Latin "brevis" meaning brief); the name was changed to "protoactinium" (from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> πρῶτος + ἀκτίς meaning "first beam element") in 1918 when two groups of scientists, led by the Austrian <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> of Germany and <a href="Frederick%20Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a> and John Cranston of Great Britain, independently discovered the much longer-lived Pa. The name was shortened to "protactinium" in 1949. This element was little characterized until 1960, when A. G. Maddock and his co-workers in the U.K. isolated 130 grams of protactinium from 60 tonnes of waste left after extraction of uranium from its ore.

Neptunium (named for the planet <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>, the next <a href="planet">planet</a> out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was discovered by <a href="Edwin%20McMillan">Edwin McMillan</a> and <a href="Philip%20H.%20Abelson">Philip H. Abelson</a> in 1940 in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>. They produced the Np isotope (half-life = 2.4 days) by bombarding uranium with slow <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s. It was the first <a href="transuranium%20element">transuranium element</a> produced synthetically.

Transuranium elements do not occur in sizeable quantities in nature and are commonly synthesized via <a href="nuclear%20reaction">nuclear reaction</a>s conducted with nuclear reactors. For example, under irradiation with reactor neutrons, <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> partially converts to <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>:

Arthur Miller

Arthur Asher Miller (October 17, 1915 – February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist, and figure in twentieth-century <a href="Theater%20of%20the%20United%20States">American theater</a>. Among his most popular plays are "<a href="All%20My%20Sons">All My Sons</a>" (1947), "<a href="Death%20of%20a%20Salesman">Death of a Salesman</a>" (1949), "<a href="The%20Crucible">The Crucible</a>" (1953) and "<a href="A%20View%20from%20the%20Bridge">A View from the Bridge</a>" (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a>s and was most noted for his work on "<a href="The%20Misfits%20%28film%29">The Misfits</a>" (1961). The drama "Death of a Salesman" has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside "<a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night">Long Day's Journey into Night</a>" and "<a href="A%20Streetcar%20Named%20Desire">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>".

Miller was often in the public eye, particularly during the late 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. During this time, he was awarded the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Drama">Pulitzer Prize for Drama</a>; testified before the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>; and was married to <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>. In 1980, Miller received the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Literary%20Award">St. Louis Literary Award</a> from the <a href="Saint%20Louis%20University">Saint Louis University</a> Library Associates. He received the <a href="Prince%20of%20Asturias%20Award">Prince of Asturias Award</a> and the Praemium Imperiale prize in 2002 and the <a href="Jerusalem%20Prize">Jerusalem Prize</a> in 2003, as well as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Lifetime Achievement Award.

Miller was born on October 17, 1915, in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>, in the New York City borough of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, the second of three children of Augusta (Barnett) and Isidore Miller. Miller was of <a href="Polish%20Jews">Polish Jewish</a> descent. His father was born in <a href="Radomy%C5%9Bl%20Wielki">Radomyśl Wielki</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia%20and%20Lodomeria">Galicia</a> (then part of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, now <a href="Poland">Poland</a>), and his mother was a native of New York whose parents also arrived from that town. Isidore owned a women's clothing manufacturing business employing 400 people. He became a wealthy and respected man in the community. The family, including his younger sister <a href="Joan%20Copeland">Joan Copeland</a>, lived on West <a href="110th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">110th Street</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, owned a summer house in <a href="Far%20Rockaway%2C%20Queens">Far Rockaway, Queens</a>, and employed a chauffeur. In the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>, the family lost almost everything and moved to <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Brooklyn">Gravesend, Brooklyn</a>. As a teenager, Miller delivered bread every morning before school to help the family. After graduating in 1932 from <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20High%20School%20%28Brooklyn%29">Abraham Lincoln High School</a>, he worked at several menial jobs to pay for his college tuition.

At the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, Miller first majored in journalism and worked for the student paper, the "<a href="Michigan%20Daily">Michigan Daily</a>". It was during this time that he wrote his first play, "<a href="No%20Villain">No Villain</a>". Miller switched his major to English, and subsequently won the <a href="Hopwood%20Award">Avery Hopwood Award</a> for "No Villain." The award brought him his first recognition and led him to begin to consider that he could have a career as a playwright. Miller enrolled in a playwriting seminar taught by the influential <a href="Kenneth%20Thorpe%20Rowe">Professor Kenneth Rowe</a>, who instructed him in his early forays into playwriting; Rowe emphasized how a play is built in order to achieve its intended effect, or what Miller called "the dynamics of play construction". Rowe provided realistic feedback along with much-needed encouragement, and became a lifelong friend. Miller retained strong ties to his alma mater throughout the rest of his life, establishing the university's Arthur Miller Award in 1985 and Arthur Miller Award for Dramatic Writing in 1999, and lending his name to the Arthur Miller Theatre in 2000. In 1937, Miller wrote "<a href="Honors%20at%20Dawn">Honors at Dawn</a>," which also received the Avery Hopwood Award.
After his graduation in 1938, he joined the <a href="Federal%20Theatre%20Project">Federal Theatre Project</a>, a <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> agency established to provide jobs in the theater. He chose the theater project despite the more lucrative offer to work as a scriptwriter for <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>. However, <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>, worried about possible Communist infiltration, closed the project in 1939. Miller began working in the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> while continuing to write <a href="radio%20plays">radio plays</a>, some of which were broadcast on <a href="CBS%20Radio">CBS</a>.

In 1940, Miller married Mary Grace Slattery. The couple had two children, Jane and Robert (born May 31, 1947). Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high-school <a href="American%20football">football</a> injury to his left kneecap.
1940 was also the year his first play was produced; "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Had%20All%20the%20Luck">The Man Who Had All the Luck</a>" won the Theatre Guild's National Award. The play closed after four performances with disastrous reviews.

In 1947, Miller's play "<a href="All%20My%20Sons">All My Sons</a>", the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> (earning him his first <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>, <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Author">for Best Author</a>) and his reputation as a playwright was established. Years later, in a 1994 interview with <a href="Ron%20Rifkin">Ron Rifkin</a>, Miller said that most contemporary critics regarded "<a href="All%20My%20Sons">All My Sons</a>" as "a very depressing play in a time of great optimism" and that positive reviews from <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" had saved it from failure.

In 1948, Miller built a small studio in <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Connecticut">Roxbury, Connecticut</a>. There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of "<a href="Death%20of%20a%20Salesman">Death of a Salesman</a>". Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play, one of the classics of world theater. "Death of a Salesman" premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the <a href="Morosco%20Theatre">Morosco Theatre</a>, directed by <a href="Elia%20Kazan">Elia Kazan</a>, and starring <a href="Lee%20J.%20Cobb">Lee J. Cobb</a> as <a href="Willy%20Loman">Willy Loman</a>, <a href="Mildred%20Dunnock">Mildred Dunnock</a> as Linda, <a href="Arthur%20Kennedy">Arthur Kennedy</a> as Biff, and <a href="Cameron%20Mitchell%20%28actor%29">Cameron Mitchell</a> as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Author">Tony Award for Best Author</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20Drama%20Critics%27%20Circle">New York Drama Circle Critics' Award</a>, and the <a href="1949%20Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times.

In 1949, Miller exchanged letters with <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a> regarding Miller's production of "All My Sons". O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, he wrote a letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of "Death of a Salesman". O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a> made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, which never occurred.

In 1955, a <a href="One-act%20play">one-act version</a> of Miller's <a href="Verse%20drama%20and%20dramatic%20verse">verse drama</a> "<a href="A%20View%20from%20the%20Bridge">A View from the Bridge</a>" opened on Broadway in a joint bill with one of Miller's lesser-known plays, "<a href="A%20Memory%20of%20Two%20Mondays">A Memory of Two Mondays</a>". The following year, Miller revised "A View from the Bridge" as a two-act <a href="prose">prose</a> drama, which <a href="Peter%20Brook">Peter Brook</a> directed in London. A French-Italian co-production "<a href="A%20View%20from%20the%20Bridge%20%28film%29">Vu du pont</a>", based on the play, was released in 1962.

In June 1956, Miller left his first wife, Mary Slattery, whom he married in 1940, and married film star <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>. They had met in 1951, had a brief affair, and remained in contact since. Monroe had just turned 30 when they married, and having never had a real family of her own, was eager to join the family of her new husband.

Monroe began to reconsider her career and the fact that trying to manage it made her feel helpless. She admitted to Miller, "I hate Hollywood. I don't want it anymore. I want to live quietly in the country and just be there when you need me. I can't fight for myself anymore."

She converted to Judaism to "express her loyalty and get close to both Miller and his parents", writes biographer Jeffrey Meyers. Monroe told her close friend, <a href="Susan%20Strasberg">Susan Strasberg</a>: "I can identify with the Jews. Everybody's always out to get them, no matter what they do, like me." Soon after she converted, Egypt banned all of her movies.

Away from Hollywood and the culture of celebrity, Monroe's life became more normal; she began cooking, keeping house and giving Miller more attention and affection than he had been used to. His children, aged twelve and nine, adored her and were reluctant to return to their mother when the weekend was over. As she was also fond of older people, she got along well with his parents, and the feeling was mutual.

Later that year, Miller was subpoenaed by the <a href="HUAC">HUAC</a>, and Monroe accompanied him. In her personal notes, she wrote about her worries during this period:
Miller began work on writing the screenplay for "<a href="The%20Misfits%20%28film%29">The Misfits</a>" in 1960, directed by <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a> and starring Monroe. But it was during the filming that Miller and Monroe's relationship hit difficulties, and he later said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life. Monroe was taking drugs to help her sleep and more drugs to help her wake up, which caused her to arrive on the set late and then have trouble remembering her lines. Huston was unaware that Miller and Monroe were having problems in their private life. He recalled later, "I was impertinent enough to say to Arthur that to allow her to take drugs of any kind was criminal and utterly irresponsible. Shortly after that I realized that she wouldn't listen to Arthur at all; he had no say over her actions."

Shortly before the film's premiere in 1961, Miller and Monroe divorced after their five years of marriage. Nineteen months later, Monroe died of a likely drug overdose. Huston, who had also directed her in her first major role in "<a href="The%20Asphalt%20Jungle">The Asphalt Jungle</a>" in 1950, and who had seen her rise to stardom, put the blame for her death on her doctors as opposed to the stresses of being a star: "The girl was an addict of sleeping pills and she was made so by the God-damn doctors. It had nothing to do with the Hollywood set-up."

Miller later married photographer <a href="Inge%20Morath">Inge Morath</a> in February 1962. She had worked as a photographer documenting the production of "The Misfits". The first of their two children, <a href="Rebecca%20Miller">Rebecca</a>, was born September 15, 1962. Their son, Daniel, was born with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a> in November 1966; he was institutionalized and excluded from the Millers' personal life at Arthur's insistence. The couple remained together until Inge's death in 2002. Arthur Miller's son-in-law, actor <a href="Daniel%20Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a>, is said to have visited Daniel frequently, and to have persuaded Arthur Miller to reunite with him.

In 1952, <a href="Elia%20Kazan">Elia Kazan</a> appeared before the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC). Kazan named eight members of the Group Theatre, including <a href="Clifford%20Odets">Clifford Odets</a>, <a href="Paula%20Strasberg">Paula Strasberg</a>, <a href="Lillian%20Hellman">Lillian Hellman</a>, <a href="J.%20Edward%20Bromberg">J. Edward Bromberg</a>, and <a href="John%20Garfield">John Garfield</a>, who in recent years had been fellow members of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party</a>.

After speaking with Kazan about his testimony, Miller traveled to <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem, Massachusetts</a> to research the <a href="Salem%20witch%20trials">witch trials of 1692</a>. "<a href="The%20Crucible">The Crucible</a>", in which Miller likened the situation with the House Un-American Activities Committee to the witch hunt in Salem in 1692, opened at the Beck Theatre on Broadway on January 22, 1953. Though widely considered only somewhat successful at the time of its release, today "<a href="The%20Crucible">The Crucible</a>" is Miller's most frequently produced work throughout the world. It was adapted into an <a href="The%20Crucible%20%28opera%29">opera</a> by <a href="Robert%20Ward%20%28composer%29">Robert Ward</a> in 1961.

Miller and Kazan were close friends throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, but after Kazan's testimony to the HUAC, the pair's friendship ended, and they did not speak to each other for the next ten years. The HUAC took an interest in Miller himself not long after "The Crucible" opened, denying him a passport to attend the play's London opening in 1954. Kazan defended his own actions through his film "<a href="On%20the%20Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a>", in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss.

When Miller applied in 1956 for a routine renewal of his passport, the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> used this opportunity to <a href="subpoena">subpoena</a> him to appear before the committee. Before appearing, Miller asked the committee not to ask him to name names, to which the chairman, <a href="Francis%20E.%20Walter">Francis E. Walter</a> (D-PA) agreed.
When Miller attended the hearing, to which Monroe accompanied him, risking her own career, he gave the committee a detailed account of his political activities. Reneging on the chairman's promise, the committee demanded the names of friends and colleagues who had participated in similar activities. Miller refused to comply, saying "I could not use the name of another person and bring trouble on him." As a result, a judge found Miller guilty of <a href="contempt%20of%20Congress">contempt of Congress</a> in May 1957. Miller was sentenced to a fine and a prison sentence, blacklisted, and disallowed a US passport. In 1958, his conviction was overturned by the court of appeals, which ruled that Miller had been misled by the chairman of the HUAC.

Miller's experience with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became very interested in the highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. "<a href="City%20Confidential">City Confidential</a>", an <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20Network">A&E Network</a> series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.

In 1964 "<a href="After%20the%20Fall%20%28play%29">After the Fall</a>" was produced, and is said to be a deeply personal view of Miller's experiences during his marriage to Monroe. The play reunited Miller with his former friend Kazan: they collaborated on both the script and the direction. "After the Fall" opened on January 23, 1964, at the ANTA Theatre in <a href="Washington%20Square%20Park">Washington Square Park</a> amid a flurry of publicity and outrage at putting a Monroe-like character, called Maggie, on stage. Robert Brustein, in a review in the "New Republic", called "After the Fall" "a three and one half hour breach of taste, a confessional autobiography of embarrassing explicitness . . . there is a misogynistic strain in the play which the author does not seem to recognize. . . . He has created a shameless piece of tabloid gossip, an act of exhibitionism which makes us all voyeurs, . . . a wretched piece of dramatic writing." That same year, Miller produced "<a href="Incident%20at%20Vichy">Incident at Vichy</a>". In 1965, Miller was elected the first American president of <a href="PEN%20International">PEN International</a>, a position which he held for four years. A year later, Miller organized the 1966 PEN congress in New York City. Miller also wrote the penetrating family drama, "<a href="The%20Price%20%28play%29">The Price</a>", produced in 1968. It was Miller's most successful play since "Death of a Salesman."

In 1969, Miller's works were banned in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> after he campaigned for the freedom of dissident writers. Throughout the 1970s, Miller spent much of his time experimenting with the theatre, producing one-act plays such as "Fame" and "The Reason Why", and traveling with his wife, producing "In The Country" and "Chinese Encounters" with her. Both his 1972 comedy "<a href="The%20Creation%20of%20the%20World%20and%20Other%20Business">The Creation of the World and Other Business</a>" and its musical adaptation, "<a href="Up%20from%20Paradise">Up from Paradise</a>", were critical and commercial failures.

Miller was an unusually articulate commentator on his own work. In 1978 he published a collection of his "Theater Essays", edited by Robert A. Martin and with a foreword by Miller. Highlights of the collection included Miller's introduction to his "Collected Plays", his reflections on the theory of tragedy, comments on the McCarthy Era, and pieces arguing for a publicly supported theater. Reviewing this collection in the "Chicago Tribune," <a href="Studs%20Terkel">Studs Terkel</a> remarked, "in reading [the "Theater Essays"]...you are exhilaratingly aware of a social critic, as well as a playwright, who knows what he's talking about."

In 1983, Miller traveled to China to produce and direct "Death of a Salesman" at the People's Art Theatre in Beijing. The play was a success in China and in 1984, "Salesman in Beijing," a book about Miller's experiences in Beijing, was published. Around the same time, "Death of a Salesman" was made into a TV movie starring <a href="Dustin%20Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a> as Willy Loman. Shown on CBS, it attracted 25 million viewers. In late 1987, Miller's autobiographical work,
"Timebends", was published. Before it was published, it was well known that Miller would not talk about Monroe in interviews; in "Timebends" Miller talks about his experiences with Monroe in detail.

During the early-mid 1990s, Miller wrote three new plays: "<a href="The%20Ride%20Down%20Mt.%20Morgan">The Ride Down Mt. Morgan</a>" (1991), "<a href="The%20Last%20Yankee">The Last Yankee</a>" (1992), and "<a href="Broken%20Glass%20%28play%29">Broken Glass</a>" (1994). In 1996, <a href="The%20Crucible%20%281996%20film%29">a film</a> of "The Crucible" starring <a href="Daniel%20Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a>, <a href="Paul%20Scofield">Paul Scofield</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Davison">Bruce Davison</a>, and <a href="Winona%20Ryder">Winona Ryder</a> opened. Miller spent much of 1996 working on the screenplay to the film.

"<a href="Mr.%20Peters%27%20Connections">Mr. Peters' Connections</a>" was staged <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> in 1998, and "Death of a Salesman" was revived on Broadway in 1999 to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. The play, once again, was a large critical success, winning a Tony Award for best revival of a play.

In 1993, he was awarded the <a href="National%20Medal%20of%20Arts">National Medal of Arts</a>. Miller was honored with the <a href="PEN/Laura%20Pels%20International%20Foundation%20for%20Theater%20Award">PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award</a> for a Master American Dramatist in 1998. In 2001 the <a href="National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Humanities">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> (NEH) selected Miller for the <a href="Jefferson%20Lecture">Jefferson Lecture</a>, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the <a href="humanities">humanities</a>. Miller's lecture was entitled "On Politics and the Art of Acting."
Miller's lecture analyzed political events (including the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">U.S. presidential election of 2000</a>)
in terms of the "arts of performance," and it drew attacks from some conservatives such as <a href="Jay%20Nordlinger">Jay Nordlinger</a>, who called it "a disgrace,"

In 1999, Miller was awarded <a href="The%20Dorothy%20and%20Lillian%20Gish%20Prize">The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize</a>, one of the richest prizes in the arts, given annually to "a man or woman who has made an outstanding contribution to the beauty of the world and to mankind's enjoyment and understanding of life." In 2001, Miller received the National pageRank.Book Foundation's <a href="http%3A//www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_amiller.html">Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters</a>. On May 1, 2002, Miller was awarded Spain's <a href="Principe%20de%20Asturias%20Prize%20for%20Literature">Principe de Asturias Prize for Literature</a> as "the undisputed master of modern drama." Later that year, Ingeborg Morath died of <a href="lymphatic%20cancer">lymphatic cancer</a> at the age of 78. The following year Miller won the <a href="Jerusalem%20Prize">Jerusalem Prize</a>.

In December 2004, 89-year-old Miller announced that he had been in love with 34-year-old <a href="Minimalism">minimalist painter</a> Agnes Barley and had been living with her at his Connecticut farm since 2002, and that they intended to marry. Within hours of her father's death, <a href="Rebecca%20Miller">Rebecca Miller</a> ordered Barley to vacate the premises, having consistently opposed the relationship. Miller's final play, "<a href="Finishing%20the%20Picture">Finishing the Picture</a>", opened at the <a href="Goodman%20Theatre">Goodman Theatre</a>, Chicago, in the fall of 2004, with one character said to be based on Barley. It was reported to be based on his experience during the filming "The Misfits", though Miller insisted the play is a work of fiction with independent characters that were no more than composite shadows of history.

Miller died of <a href="bladder%20cancer">bladder cancer</a> and <a href="congestive%20heart%20failure">congestive heart failure</a>, at his home in <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Connecticut">Roxbury, Connecticut</a>. He had been in hospice care at his sister's apartment in New York since his release from hospital the previous month. He died on the evening of February 10, 2005 (the 56th anniversary of the Broadway debut of "Death of a Salesman"), aged 89, surrounded by Barley, family and friends. He is interred at Roxbury Center Cemetery in Roxbury.

Arthur Miller's career as a writer spanned over seven decades, and at the time of his death, Miller was considered to be one of the greatest dramatists of the twentieth century. After his death, many respected actors, directors, and producers paid tribute to Miller, some calling him the last great practitioner of the American stage, and Broadway theatres darkened their lights in a show of respect.
Miller's alma mater, the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, opened the Arthur Miller Theatre in March 2007. As per his express wish, it is the only theatre in the world that bears Miller's name.

Other notable arrangements for Miller's legacy are that his letters, notes, drafts and other papers are housed at the <a href="Harry%20Ransom%20Humanities%20Research%20Center">Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center</a> at The University of Texas at Austin.

Arthur Miller is also a member of the <a href="American%20Theater%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Theater Hall of Fame</a>. He was inducted in 1979.

In 1993 he received the Four Freedom Award for Freedom of Speech






Miller successfully synthesized diverse dramatic styles and movements in the belief that a play should embody a delicate balance between the individual and society, between the singular personality and the polity, and between the separate and collective elements of life. He thought himself a writer of social plays with a strong emphasis on moral problems in American society and often questioned psychological causes of behavior. He also built on the realist tradition of Henrik Ibsen in his exploration of the individual's conflict with society but also borrowed Symbolist and expressionist techniques from Bertolt Brecht and others. Some critics attempt to interpret his work from either an exclusively political or an exclusively psychological standpoint but fail to pierce the social veil that Miller creates in his work. Miller often stressed that society made his characters what they are and how it dictated all of their fears and choices.

While Miller comes under criticism for his reputation, most critics note him as a dramatist of the family. One of his greatest strengths is his penetrating insight into familial relationships. Often, Miller positions his characters are living in service of their family. The conventions of the family play, such as patterns, setting, and style of representation were set canonically by <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a>, <a href="Tennessee%20Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>, and Miller. In these plays, white men are privileged with their family and social responsibility; typically, these men are lower class. Miller maintained that family relationships and families must be immersed in social context.

Miller is known for the consciousness of the characters in his play. In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility. Some strong examples of characters who portray this struggle between their conscious and their social responsibility are Joe Keller in <a href="All%20My%20Sons">All My Sons</a> and John Proctor in <a href="The%20Crucible">The Crucible</a>. Miller often creates consequences for characters who ignore or violate their social responsibilities.

Miller's determination to deal with the eternal themes of life, death and human purpose is one of his most prominent themes across his works. This theme spans from Willy Loman's dedication to providing for his family and his inherent belief that his death would leave a legacy, to John Proctor's willingness to die to preserve his name. Nearly all of Miller's protagonists struggle with the mark they leave on life and what it means to die.

In "Death of a Salesman" – originally entitled “The Inside of His Head” – Miller brilliantly solves the problem of revealing his main character's inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself. Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. "Death of a Salesman" seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.

Willy Loman desperately wants to believe that he has succeeded, that he is “well liked” as a great salesman, a fine father, and a devoted husband. That he has not really attracted the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him from the beginning of the play. Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the insurance will finally provide for his family.

Eddie Carbone is the central character in "<a href="A%20View%20from%20the%20Bridge">A View From The Bridge</a>" and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antagonist. He is a longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice, and his 17-year-old niece, Catherine. When his family from Italy, Rodolpho and Marco, migrate illegally and begin to live with him, the small world that he operates in is disrupted. Eddie becomes conflicted and ultimately self-destructive over his sexual attraction to his niece and her involvement with one of his Italian tenants. His character arc culminates as he becomes an informer to the immigration authorities which leads to a confrontation with one of his tenants. Marco labels him as an informer and Eddie perceives this as a permanent blemish on his good name. This confrontation ultimately leads to his death, leaving Eddie as one of Miller's examples of tragic figures.

John Proctor is the protagonist of one of Miller's most controversial works, "<a href="The%20Crucible">The Crucible</a>". He is a faithful farmer who lives by a strict moral code that he violates by succumbing to an affair with a young girl, Abigail, who serves in his home. After Proctor rejects her, Abigail spitefully accuses John's wife of witchcraft, involving him in a string of affairs that challenge his beliefs and convictions. In his attempts to save his wife, he is convicted of witchcraft as well, and will only be acquitted if he confesses to his crime and signs his name to a piece of paper. Proctor is a strong, vital man in the prime of his life both in his confession of witchcraft and the subsequent passion with which he defends his name at the cost of his life.

Critics have long admired the playwright's suspenseful handling of the Keller family's burden in the play "<a href="All%20My%20Sons">All My Sons</a>". The critical character in this work is Joe Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash. Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime. Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations. He argues that he never believed that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake because it would have driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to “make something” for his family, his highest priority. Joe's irresponsibility is exposed through his son's questioning of his very humanity. Joe's suicide results from the tremendous guilt and self-awareness that arises during the play.

Maggie is a character that appears in Arthur Miller's partially autobiographical play, "<a href="After%20the%20Fall%20%28play%29">After the Fall</a>". She is both one of his most criticised and controversial characters, and one of his most famous ones. She is a thinly veiled version of Marilyn Monroe, Miller's former wife, and thus her suicide attempts after her and Quentin's divorce, and her depression is from reality. This is one of the reasons that reviews upon its first release were generally negative, owing to the similarities between fact and fiction. However, academic scholars find her to be one of the best, if not the best, of Miller's creations, as the play presents readers with a superb portrait of a woman facing a mental crisis. It also shows Monroe in comparison to the reasons for her marriage to Miller- for example, the fact that Miller took her seriously, and was ready to treat her as more than just an object, like everybody else. Miller also highlights his own feelings after Monroe's death by showing Quentin's, and his regret that he had been unable to save her from herself.

<a href="Christopher%20Bigsby">Christopher Bigsby</a> wrote "Arthur Miller: The Definitive Biography" based on boxes of papers Miller made available to him before his death in 2005. The book was published in November 2008, and is reported to reveal unpublished works in which Miller "bitterly attack[ed] the injustices of American racism long before it was taken up by the civil rights movement".

In his book "Trinity of Passion", author <a href="Alan%20M.%20Wald">Alan M. Wald</a> conjectures that Miller was "a member of a writer's unit of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party</a> around 1946," using the pseudonym Matt Wayne, and editing a drama column in the magazine "<a href="The%20New%20Masses">The New Masses</a>".

Two months after Miller died <a href="Peter%20O%27Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> called him a "bore" and <a href="Roger%20Kimball">Roger Kimball</a> went on record saying that Miller's artistic accomplishments were meager.

The Arthur Miller Foundation was founded to honor the legacy of Miller and his New York City Public School Education. The mission of the foundation is: "Promoting increased access and equity to theater arts education in our schools and increasing the number of students receiving theater arts education as an integral part of their academic curriculum." Other initiatives include certification of new theater teachers and their placement in public schools; increasing the number of theater teachers in the system from the current estimate of 180 teachers in 1800 schools; supporting professional development of all certified theater teachers; providing teaching artists, cultural partners, physical spaces, and theater ticket allocations for students. The foundation's primary purpose is to provide arts education in the New York City school system. The current chancellor of the foundation is Carmen Farina, a large proponent of the <a href="Common%20Core%20State%20Standards%20Initiative">Common Core State Standards Initiative</a>. Alec Baldwin, Ellen Barkin, Katori Hall, Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, Tony Kushner, Michael Mayer, Jim McElhinney, Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson, Lynn Nottage, David O. Russell, Liev Schreiber all serve on the Master Arts Council. Son-in-law Daniel Day-Lewis serves on the current board of directors.

The foundation celebrated Miller's 100th birthday with a one-night-only performance of Miller's seminal works in November 2015.

The Arthur Miller Foundation currently supports a pilot program in theater and film at the public school Quest to Learn in partnership with the Institute of Play. The model is being used as an in-school elective theater class and lab. The objective is to create a sustainable theater education model to disseminate to teachers at professional development workshops.

Anton Diabelli

Anton (or Antonio) Diabelli (5 September 17817 April 1858) was an <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n <a href="music">music</a> publisher, editor and <a href="composer">composer</a>. Best known in his time as a publisher, he is most familiar today as the composer of the <a href="waltz">waltz</a> on which <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> wrote his set of thirty-three "<a href="Diabelli%20Variations">Diabelli Variations</a>".

Diabelli was born in <a href="Mattsee">Mattsee</a> near <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>, then in the <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Salzburg">Archbishopric of Salzburg</a>. A musical child, he sang in the <a href="boys%27%20choir">boys' choir</a> at <a href="Salzburg%20Cathedral">Salzburg Cathedral</a> where he is believed to have taken music lessons with <a href="Michael%20Haydn">Michael Haydn</a>. By the age of 19 Diabelli had already composed several important compositions including six masses.

Diabelli was trained to enter the <a href="priest">priest</a>hood and in 1800 joined the monastery at Raitenhaslach, <a href="Electorate%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. He remained there until 1803, when Bavaria closed all its monasteries.

In 1803 Diabelli moved to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and began teaching <a href="piano">piano</a> and <a href="classical%20guitar">guitar</a> and found work as a proofreader for a music publisher. During this period he learned the music publishing business while continuing to compose. In 1809 he composed his comic opera, "Adam in der Klemme." In 1817 he started a music publishing business and in 1818 he formed a partnership with <a href="Pietro%20Cappi">Pietro Cappi</a> to create the music publishing firm of Cappi & Diabelli.

Cappi & Diabelli became well known by <a href="arrangement">arranging</a> popular pieces so they could be played by amateurs at home. A master of promotion, Diabelli selected widely-accessible music such as famous opera tune arrangements, dance music and popular new comic theatre songs.

The firm soon established a reputation in more serious music circles by championing the works of <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>. Diabelli recognized the composer's potential and became the first to publish Schubert's work with "<a href="Der%20Erlk%C3%B6nig">Der Erlkönig</a>" in 1821. Diabelli's firm continued to publish Schubert's work until 1823 when an argument between Cappi and Schubert terminated their business. The following year Diabelli and Cappi parted ways, Diabelli launching a new publishing house, Diabelli & Co., in 1824. Following Schubert's early death in 1828 Diabelli purchased a large portion of the composer's massive musical estate from Schubert's brother <a href="Ferdinand%20Schubert">Ferdinand</a>. As Schubert had hundreds of unpublished works, Diabelli's firm was able to publish "new" Schubert works for more than 30 years after the composer's death.

Diabelli's publishing house expanded throughout his life, before he retired in 1851, leaving it under the control of <a href="Carl%20Anton%20Spina">Carl Anton Spina</a>. When Diabelli died in 1858 Spina continued to run the firm and published much music by <a href="Johann%20Strauss%20II">Johann Strauss II</a> and <a href="Josef%20Strauss">Josef Strauss</a>. In 1872 the firm was taken over by <a href="Friedrich%20Schreiber">Friedrich Schreiber</a> and in 1876 it merged with the firm of <a href="August%20Cranz">August Cranz</a> who bought the company in 1879 and ran it under his name.

Diabelli died in Vienna at the age of 76.

Diabelli produced a number of well-known works as a composer, including an <a href="operetta">operetta</a> called "Adam in der Klemme", several <a href="mass%20%28music%29">mass</a>es, <a href="song">song</a>s and numerous piano and classical guitar pieces. Numerically his guitar pieces form the largest part of his works. His pieces for <a href="piano%20four%20hands">piano four hands</a> are popular.

Diabelli's composition "Pleasures of Youth: Six Sonatinas" is a collection of six <a href="sonatina">sonatina</a>s depicting a struggle between unknown opposing forces. This is suggested by the sharp and frequent change in dynamics from "<a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">forte</a>" to "<a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">piano</a>". When "forte" is indicated the pianist is meant to evoke a sense of wickedness, thus depicting the antagonist. In contrast the markings of "piano" represent the protagonist.

The composition for which Diabelli is now best known was actually written as part of an adventuring story. In 1819, as a promotional idea, he decided to try to publish a volume of <a href="variation%20%28music%29">variation</a>s on a "patriotic" waltz he had penned expressly for this purpose, with one variation by every important Austrian composer living at the time, as well as several significant non-Austrians. The combined contributions would be published in an anthology called "<a href="Vaterl%C3%A4ndischer%20K%C3%BCnstlerverein">Vaterländischer Künstlerverein</a>". Fifty-one composers responded with pieces, including Beethoven, Schubert, Archduke Rudolph of Austria, F.X. Wolfgang Mozart (jun.), Moritz Count von Dietrichstein, Heinrich Eduard Josef Baron von Lannoy, Ignaz Franz Baron von Mosel, <a href="Carl%20Czerny">Carl Czerny</a>, <a href="Johann%20Nepomuk%20Hummel">Johann Nepomuk Hummel</a>, <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Ignaz Moscheles</a>, and the eight-year-old <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> (although it seems Liszt was not invited personally, but his teacher Czerny arranged for him to be involved). Czerny was also enlisted to write a <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a>. Beethoven, however, instead of providing just one variation, provided 33, and his formed Part I of "Vaterländischer Künstlerverein". They constitute what is generally regarded as one of the greatest of Beethoven's piano pieces and as the greatest set of variations of their time, and are generally known simply as the "<a href="Diabelli%20Variations">Diabelli Variations</a>", Op. 120. The other 50 variations were published as Part II of "Vaterländischer Künstlerverein".

A <a href="sonatina">sonatina</a> of Diabelli's, presumably Sonatina in F major, Op. 168, No. 1 (I: Moderato cantabile), provides the title and a motif for the French <a href="novella">novella</a> "<a href="Moderato%20Cantabile">Moderato Cantabile</a>" by <a href="Marguerite%20Duras">Marguerite Duras</a>.

Anita Faye Hill (born July 30, 1956) is an American attorney and academic. She is a University Professor of Social Policy, Law, and Women's Studies at <a href="Brandeis%20University">Brandeis University</a> and a faculty member of Brandeis' <a href="Heller%20School%20for%20Social%20Policy%20and%20Management">Heller School for Social Policy and Management</a>. She became a national figure in 1991 when she accused U.S. Supreme Court nominee <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a>, her boss at the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Education">United States Department of Education</a> and the <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>, of <a href="sexual%20harassment">sexual harassment</a>.

Hill was born in <a href="Lone%20Tree%2C%20Oklahoma">Lone Tree, Oklahoma</a>, the youngest of the 13 children of Albert and Erma Hill, who were farmers. Her family came from Arkansas, where her great-grandparents and her maternal grandfather, Henry Eliot, were born into slavery. Hill was raised in the <a href="Baptists">Baptist</a> faith.

After graduating as <a href="valedictorian">valedictorian</a> from Morris High School, Oklahoma she enrolled at <a href="Oklahoma%20State%20University">Oklahoma State University</a>, receiving a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a> with honors in psychology in 1977. She went on to <a href="Yale%20Law%20School">Yale Law School</a>, obtaining her <a href="Juris%20Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> degree with honors in 1980.

She was admitted to the District of Columbia <a href="Bar%20association">Bar</a> in 1980 and began her law career as an associate with the <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> firm of Wald, Harkrader & Ross. In 1981, she became an attorney-adviser to <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a> who was then the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education's <a href="Office%20for%20Civil%20Rights">Office for Civil Rights</a>. When Thomas became chairman of the U.S. <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) in 1982, Hill went along to serve as his assistant, leaving the job in 1983.

Hill then became an assistant professor at the <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical Christian</a> <a href="O.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BW.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCoburn%20School%20of%20Law">O. W. Coburn School of Law</a> at <a href="Oral%20Roberts%20University">Oral Roberts University</a> where she taught from 1983 to 1986. In 1986, she joined the faculty at the <a href="University%20of%20Oklahoma%20College%20of%20Law">University of Oklahoma College of Law</a> where she taught commercial law and contracts.

In 1991, President <a href="George%20H.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BW.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> nominated <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a>, by then a federal <a href="United%20States%20courts%20of%20appeals">Circuit Judge</a>, to succeed retiring Associate Justice <a href="Thurgood%20Marshall">Thurgood Marshall</a> on the Supreme Court. Senate hearings on his <a href="Appointment%20and%20confirmation%20to%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">confirmation</a> were initially completed with Thomas's good character being presented as a primary qualification for the high court because he had only been a judge for slightly more than one year. There had been little organized opposition to Thomas's nomination, and his confirmation seemed assured until a report of a private interview of Hill by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> was leaked to the press. The hearings were then reopened, and Hill was called to publicly testify. Hill said in the October 1991 televised hearings that Thomas had sexually harassed her while he was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the EEOC. When questioned on why she followed Thomas to the second job after he had already allegedly harassed her, she said working in a reputable position within the civil rights field had been her ambition. The position was appealing enough to inhibit her to go back into private practice with her previous firm. She only realized later in her life that this ambitious venture was a poor judgment and also explained that "at that time, it appeared that the sexual overtures ... had ended."

According to Hill, during her two years of employment as Thomas's assistant, Thomas had asked her out socially many times, and after she refused, he used work situations to discuss sexual subjects. "He spoke about...such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes," she said, adding that on several occasions Thomas graphically described "his own sexual prowess" and the details of his anatomy. Hill also recounted an instance in which Thomas examined a can of Coke on his desk and asked, "Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?" During court session, Republican Senator <a href="Orrin%20Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a> implied that "Hill was working in tandem with "slick lawyers" and interest groups bent on destroying Thomas' chances to join the court". Thomas said he considered Hill a friend whom he had helped at every turn, so when accusations of harassment came from her they were particularly hurtful and he said, "I lost the belief that if I did my best, all would work out."

Four female witnesses reportedly waited in the wings to support Hill's credibility, but they were not called, due to what the "<a href="Los%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BAngeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" described as a private, compromise deal between Republicans and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> Chair, Democrat <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a>. According to "Time" magazine, one of the witnesses, Angela Wright, may not have been considered credible on the issue of sexual harassment because she had been fired from the EEOC by Thomas.

Hill agreed to take a <a href="polygraph">polygraph</a> test. While senators and other authorities noted that polygraph results cannot be relied upon and are inadmissible in courts, Hill's results did support her statements. Thomas did not take a polygraph test. He made a vehement and complete denial, saying that he was being subjected to a "high-tech lynching for uppity blacks" by white liberals who were seeking to block a black conservative from taking a seat on the Supreme Court. After extensive debate, the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> confirmed Thomas to the Supreme Court by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin since the 19th century.

Thomas's supporters questioned Hill's credibility, claiming she was delusional or had been spurned, leading her to seek revenge. They cited the time delay of ten years between the alleged behavior by Thomas and Hill's accusations, and noted that Hill had followed Thomas to a second job and later had personal contacts with Thomas, including giving him a ride to an airport—behavior which they said would be inexplicable if Hill's allegations were true. Hill countered that she had come forward because she felt an obligation to share information on the character and actions of a person who was being considered for the Supreme Court. She testified that after leaving the EEOC, she had had two "inconsequential" phone conversations with Thomas, and had seen him personally on two occasions, once to get a job reference and the second time when he made a public appearance in Oklahoma where she was teaching.

Doubts about the veracity of Hill's 1991 testimony persisted long after Thomas took his seat on the Court. They were furthered by "<a href="American%20Spectator">American Spectator</a>" writer <a href="David%20Brock">David Brock</a> in his 1993 book "<a href="The%20Real%20Anita%20Hill">The Real Anita Hill</a>", though he later recanted the claims he had made, described in his book as "character assassination," and apologized to Hill. After interviewing a number of women who alleged that Thomas had frequently subjected them to sexually explicit remarks, "Wall Street Journal" reporters <a href="Jane%20Mayer">Jane Mayer</a> and <a href="Jill%20Abramson">Jill Abramson</a> wrote a book which concluded that Thomas had lied during his confirmation process. <a href="Richard%20Lacayo">Richard Lacayo</a> in his 1994 review of the book for "Time" magazine remarked, however, that "Their book doesn't quite nail that conclusion." In 2007, Kevin , a coauthor of another book on Thomas, remarked that what happened between Thomas and Hill was "ultimately unknowable" by others, but that it was clear that "one of them lied, period." Writing in 2007, Neil Lewis of "The New York Times" remarked that, "To this day, each side in the epic he-said, she-said dispute has its unmovable believers."

In 2007, Thomas published his autobiography, "My Grandfather's Son", in which he revisited the controversy, calling Hill his "most traitorous adversary" and saying that pro-choice liberals, who feared that he would vote to overturn "<a href="Roe%20v.%20Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>" if he were seated on the Supreme Court, used the scandal against him. He described Hill as touchy and apt to overreact, and her work at the EEOC as mediocre. He acknowledged that three other former EEOC employees had backed Hill's story, but said they had all left the agency on bad terms. He also wrote that Hill "was a left-winger who'd never expressed any religious sentiments whatsoever...and the only reason why she'd held a job in the Reagan administration was because I'd given it to her." Hill denied the accusations in an <a href="op-ed">op-ed</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" saying she would not "stand by silently and allow [Justice Thomas], in his anger, to reinvent me".

In October 2010, Thomas's wife <a href="Virginia%20Thomas">Virginia</a>, a conservative activist, left a voicemail at Hill's office asking that Hill apologize for her 1991 testimony. Hill initially believed the call was a hoax and referred the matter to the Brandeis University campus police who alerted the FBI. After being informed that the call was indeed from Virginia Thomas, Hill told the media that she did not believe the message was meant to be conciliatory and said, "I testified truthfully about my experience and I stand by that testimony." Virginia Thomas responded that the call had been intended as an "<a href="Olive%20branch%23Modern%20usage">olive branch</a>".

Shortly after the Thomas confirmation hearings, President George H. W. Bush dropped his opposition to a bill giving harassment victims the right to seek federal damage awards, back pay and reinstatement, and the law was passed by Congress. One year later, harassment complaints filed with the EEOC were up 50 percent and public opinion had shifted in Hill's favor. Private companies also started training programs to deter sexual harassment. When journalist Cinny Kennard asked Hill in 1991 if she would testify against Thomas all over again, Hill answered, "I'm not sure if I could have lived with myself if I had answered those questions any differently."

The manner in which the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee challenged and dismissed Hill's accusations of sexual harassment angered women politicians and lawyers. According to D.C. Congressional Delegate <a href="Eleanor%20Holmes%20Norton">Eleanor Holmes Norton</a>, Hill's treatment by the panel also said to be a contributing factor to the large number of women elected to Congress in 1992, "women clearly went to the polls with the notion in mind that you had to have more women in Congress", she said. In their anthology, "All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave", editors <a href="Gloria%20T.%20Hull">Gloria T. Hull</a>, <a href="Patricia%20Bell-Scott">Patricia Bell-Scott</a>, and <a href="Barbara%20Smith">Barbara Smith</a> described black feminists mobilizing "a remarkable national response to the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy.

In 1992, a feminist group began a nationwide fundraising campaign and then obtained matching state funds to endow a professorship at the University of Oklahoma Law School in honor of Hill. Conservative Oklahoma state legislators reacted by demanding Hill's resignation from the university, then introducing a bill to prohibit the university from accepting donations from out-of-state residents, and finally attempting to pass legislation to close down the law school. Elmer Zinn Million, a local activist and organized protester who was caught up by the zeal compared Hill to the assassin of President Kennedy. He was known as the "one-armed man" by the "Oklahoma Observer". Certain officials at the university attempted to revoke Hill's tenure. After five years of pressure, Hill resigned. The University of Oklahoma Law School defunded the Anita F. Hill professorship in May 1999, without the position having ever been filled.

Hill accepted a position as a visiting scholar at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> in January, 1997, but soon joined the faculty of Brandeis University—first at the Women's Studies Program, later moving to the <a href="Heller%20School%20for%20Social%20Policy%20and%20Management">Heller School for Social Policy and Management</a>. In 2011, she also took a counsel position with the Civil Rights & Employment Practice group of the plaintiffs' law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll.

Over the years, Hill has provided commentary on gender and race issues on national television programs, including "<a href="60%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BMinutes">60 Minutes</a>", "<a href="Face%20the%20Nation">Face the Nation</a>" and "<a href="Meet%20the%20Press">Meet the Press</a>". She has been a speaker on the topic of commercial law as well as race and women's rights. She is also the author of articles that have been published in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" and has contributed to many scholarly and legal publications in the areas of <a href="international%20commercial%20law">international commercial law</a>, <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>, and <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a>.

In 1995 Hill co-edited "Race, Gender and Power in America: The Legacy of the Hill-Thomas Hearings" with Emma Coleman Jordan. In 1997 Hill published her autobiography, "Speaking Truth to Power", in which she chronicled her role in the Clarence Thomas confirmation controversy and wrote that creating a better society had been a motivating force in her life. She contributed the piece "The Nature of the Beast: Sexual Harassment" to the 2003 anthology "", edited by <a href="Robin%20Morgan">Robin Morgan</a>. In 2011 Hill published her second book, "Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home", which focuses on the sub-prime lending crisis that resulted in the foreclosure of many homes owned by African-Americans. She calls for a new understanding about the importance of a home and its place in the <a href="American%20Dream">American Dream</a>. On March 26, 2015, the Brandeis Board of Trustees unanimously voted to recognize Hill with a promotion to Private University Professor of Social Policy, Law, and Women's Studies.

In 1999, <a href="Ernest%20Dickerson">Ernest Dickerson</a> directed "<a href="Strange%20Justice">Strange Justice</a>", a film based on Anita vs. Clarence Thomas controversy. Her case also inspired the 1994 "<a href="Law%20%26amp%3B%20Order">Law & Order</a>" episode "<a href="Law%20%26amp%3B%20Order%20%28season%205%29">Virtue</a>", about a young lawyer who feels pressured to sleep with her supervisor at her law firm. Hill was the subject of the 2013 documentary film "Anita" by director <a href="Freida%20Lee%20Mock">Freida Lee Mock</a>, which chronicles her experience during the Clarence Thomas scandal. Hill was portrayed by actress <a href="Kerry%20Washington">Kerry Washington</a> in the 2016 <a href="HBO">HBO</a> film "<a href="Confirmation%20%28film%29">Confirmation</a>".
Hill is mentioned in the 1992 <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a> song "<a href="Youth%20Against%20Fascism">Youth Against Fascism</a>". The Clarence Thomas scandal is mentioned in the 1994 "<a href="Rugrats">Rugrats</a>" episode "Mommy's Little Assets."

On October 20, 1998, Anita Hill published the book "Speaking Truth to Power". Throughout much of the book she gives details on her side of the sexual harassment controversy, and her professional relationship with <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a>. Aside from that, she also provides a glimpse of what her personal life was like all the way from her childhood days growing up in <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> to her position as a law professor.

In 2011, Hill’s second book, "Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home" was published . She discusses the relationship between the home and the American Dream. She also exposes the inequalities within gender and race and home ownership. She argues that inclusive democracy is more important than debates about legal rights. She uses her own history and history of other African American women such as Nannie Helen Burroughs, in order to strengthen her argument for reimagining equality altogether.

In 1994, she wrote a tribute to Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court Justice who preceded Clarence Thomas, titled "A Tribute to Thurgood Marshall: A Man Who Broke with Tradition on Issues of Race and Gender""." She notes Thurgood’s contributions to the principles of equality as a judge and how his work has affected the lives of African Americans, specifically African American women.

Anita F. Hill became a proponent for women’s rights and feminism. This can be seen through the chapter she wrote in the book "Women and leadership: the state of play and strategies for change". She wrote about women judges and why, in her opinion, they play such a large role in balancing the judicial system. She argues that since women and men have different life experiences, ways of thinking, and histories, both are needed for a balanced court system. She writes that in order for the best law system to be created in the United States, all people need the ability to be represented.

In 2005, Hill was selected as a <a href="Fletcher%20Foundation">Fletcher Foundation</a> Fellow. In 2008 she was awarded the Louis P. and Evelyn Smith First Amendment Award by the <a href="Ford%20Hall%20Forum">Ford Hall Forum</a>. She also serves on the Board of Trustees for <a href="Southern%20Vermont%20College">Southern Vermont College</a> in <a href="Bennington%2C%20Vermont">Bennington, Vermont</a>. Her opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 is listed as #69 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank). She was inducted into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame in 1993. On January 7, 2017, Hill was inducted as an honorary member of <a href="Zeta%20Phi%20Beta">Zeta Phi Beta</a> sorority at their National Executive Board Meeting in Dallas, Texas.

Audio file format

An audio file format is a <a href="file%20format">file format</a> for storing <a href="digital%20audio">digital audio</a> data on a <a href="computer">computer</a> system. The bit layout of the audio data (excluding metadata) is called the <a href="audio%20coding%20format">audio coding format</a> and can be uncompressed, or <a href="audio%20compression%20%28data%29">compressed</a> to reduce the file size, often using <a href="lossy%20compression">lossy compression</a>. The data can be a raw <a href="bitstream">bitstream</a> in an audio coding format, but it is usually embedded in a <a href="container%20format%20%28digital%29">container format</a> or an audio data format with defined storage layer.

It is important to distinguish between the <a href="audio%20coding%20format">audio coding format</a>, the <a href="Container%20format%20%28digital%29">container</a> containing the raw audio data, and an <a href="audio%20codec">audio codec</a>. A codec performs the encoding and decoding of the raw audio data while this encoded data is (usually) stored in a container file. Although most audio file formats support only one type of audio coding data (created with an <a href="audio%20codec">audio coder</a>), a multimedia container format (as <a href="Matroska">Matroska</a> or <a href="Audio%20Video%20Interleave">AVI</a>) may support multiple types of audio and video data.

There are three major groups of audio file formats:


One major uncompressed audio format, <a href="Pulse-code%20modulation">LPCM</a>, is the same variety of PCM as used in <a href="Compact%20Disc%20Digital%20Audio">Compact Disc Digital Audio</a> and is the format most commonly accepted by low level audio <a href="API">API</a>s and <a href="Digital-to-analog%20converter">D/A converter</a> hardware. Although LPCM can be stored on a computer as a <a href="raw%20audio%20format">raw audio format</a>, it is usually stored in a codice_4 file on <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> or in a codice_5 file on <a href="macOS">macOS</a>. The AIFF format is based on the <a href="Interchange%20File%20Format">Interchange File Format</a> (IFF), and the WAV format is based on the similar <a href="RIFF%20%28File%20format%29">Resource Interchange File Format</a> (RIFF). WAV and AIFF are designed to store a wide variety of audio formats, lossless and lossy; they just add a small, <a href="metadata">metadata</a>-containing header before the audio data to declare the format of the audio data, such as LPCM with a particular <a href="sampling%20%28signal%20processing%29">sample rate</a>, <a href="audio%20bit%20depth">bit depth</a>, <a href="endianness">endianness</a> and number of <a href="audio%20channel">channels</a>. Since WAV and AIFF are widely supported and can store LPCM, they are suitable file formats for storing and archiving an original recording.

<a href="Broadcast%20Wave%20Format">BWF</a> (Broadcast Wave Format) is a standard audio format created by the <a href="European%20Broadcasting%20Union">European Broadcasting Union</a> as a successor to WAV. Among other enhancements, BWF allows more robust <a href="metadata">metadata</a> to be stored in the file. See "<a href="Broadcast%20Wave%20Format">European Broadcasting Union: Specification of the Broadcast Wave Format</a>" (EBU Technical document 3285, July 1997). This is the primary recording format used in many professional audio workstations in the television and film industry. BWF files include a standardized <a href="timestamp">timestamp</a> reference which allows for easy synchronization with a separate picture element. Stand-alone, file based, multi-track recorders from AETA, Sound Devices, Zaxcom, HHB Communications Ltd, <a href="Fostex">Fostex</a>, Nagra, Aaton, and <a href="TASCAM">TASCAM</a> all use BWF as their preferred format.

A lossless compressed format stores data in less space without losing any information. The original, uncompressed data can be recreated from the compressed version.

Uncompressed audio formats encode both sound and silence with the same number of bits per unit of time. Encoding an uncompressed minute of absolute silence produces a file of the same size as encoding an uncompressed minute of music. In a lossless compressed format, however, the music would occupy a smaller file than an uncompressed format and the silence would take up almost no space at all.

Lossless compression formats include the common <a href="FLAC">FLAC</a>, <a href="WavPack">WavPack</a>, <a href="Monkey%27s%20Audio">Monkey's Audio</a>, <a href="Apple%20Lossless">ALAC</a> (Apple Lossless). They provide a compression ratio of about 2:1 (i.e. their files take up half the space of PCM). Development in lossless compression formats aims to reduce processing time while maintaining a good compression ratio.

Lossy compression enables even greater reductions in file size by removing some of the audio information and simplifying the data. This of course results in a reduction in audio quality, but a variety of techniques are used, mainly by exploiting <a href="psychoacoustics">psychoacoustics</a>, to remove the parts of the sound that have the least effect on perceived quality, and to minimize the amount of audible noise added during the process. The popular <a href="MP3">MP3 format</a> is probably the best-known example, but the <a href="Advanced%20Audio%20Coding">AAC format</a> found on the iTunes Music Store is also common. Most formats offer a range of degrees of compression, generally measured in <a href="bit%20rate">bit rate</a>. The lower the rate, the smaller the file and the more significant the quality loss.

Area 51

The <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> facility commonly known as Area 51 is a highly classified remote detachment of <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Edwards Air Force Base</a>, within the <a href="Nevada%20Test%20and%20Training%20Range">Nevada Test and Training Range</a>. According to the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA), the correct names for the facility are Homey Airport and Groom Lake, though the name "Area 51" was used in a CIA document from the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. The facility has also been referred to as "Dreamland" and "Paradise Ranch", among other <a href="nickname">nickname</a>s. The <a href="special%20use%20airspace">special use airspace</a> around the field is referred to as <a href="Exclusion%20zone">Restricted Area</a> 4808 North (R-4808N).

The base's current primary purpose is publicly unknown; however, based on historical evidence, it most likely supports the development and testing of <a href="experimental%20aircraft">experimental aircraft</a> and weapons systems (<a href="black%20project">black project</a>s). The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the frequent subject of <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theories</a> and a central component to <a href="unidentified%20flying%20object">unidentified flying object</a> (UFO) folklore. Although the base has never been declared a secret base, all research and occurrences in Area 51 are <a href="Top%20Secret/Sensitive%20Compartmented%20Information">Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information</a> (TS/SCI). On 25 June 2013, following a <a href="Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) request filed in 2005, the CIA publicly acknowledged the existence of the base for the first time, declassifying documents detailing the history and purpose of Area 51.

Area 51 is located in the southern portion of <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> in the western United States, north-northwest of <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>. Situated at its center, on the southern shore of <a href="Groom%20Lake%20%28salt%20flat%29">Groom Lake</a>, is a large <a href="military%20airfield">military airfield</a>. The site was acquired by the United States Air Force in 1955, primarily for the <a href="flight%20test">flight test</a>ing of the <a href="Lockheed%20U-2">Lockheed U-2</a> aircraft. The area around Area 51, including the small town of <a href="Rachel%2C%20Nevada">Rachel</a> on the "<a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%20375">Extraterrestrial Highway</a>", is a popular tourist destination.

The original rectangular base of is now part of the so-called "Groom box", a rectangular area measuring , of restricted airspace. The area is connected to the internal <a href="Nevada%20Test%20Site">Nevada Test Site</a> (NTS) road network, with paved roads leading south to <a href="Mercury%2C%20Nevada">Mercury</a> and west to Yucca Flat. Leading northeast from the lake, the wide and well-maintained Groom Lake Road runs through a pass in the Jumbled Hills. The road formerly led to mines in the Groom basin, but has been improved since their closure. Its winding course runs past a security checkpoint, but the restricted area around the base extends further east. After leaving the restricted area, Groom Lake Road descends eastward to the floor of the <a href="Tikaboo%20Valley">Tikaboo Valley</a>, passing the dirt-road entrances to several small ranches, before converging with <a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%20375">State Route 375, the "Extraterrestrial Highway"</a>, south of <a href="Rachel%2C%20Nevada">Rachel</a>.

Area 51 shares a border with the <a href="Yucca%20Flat">Yucca Flat</a> region of the Nevada Test Site, the location of 739 of the 928 nuclear tests conducted by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> at NTS. The <a href="Yucca%20Mountain%20nuclear%20waste%20repository">Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository</a> is southwest of Groom Lake.

<a href="Groom%20Lake%20%28salt%20flat%29">Groom Lake</a> is a <a href="Salt%20pan%20%28geology%29">salt flat</a> in <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (KXTA) on the north of the Area 51 <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">USAF</a> military installation. The lake at elevation is approximately from north to south and from east to west at its widest point. Located within the namesake Groom Lake Valley portion of the <a href="Tonopah%20Basin">Tonopah Basin</a>, the lake is south of <a href="Rachel%2C%20Nevada">Rachel, Nevada</a>.

The origin of the Area 51 name is unclear. The most accepted comes from a grid numbering system of the area by the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC); while Area 51 is not part of this system, it is adjacent to Area 15. Another explanation is that 51 was used because it was unlikely that the AEC would use the number.

Lead and silver were discovered in the southern part of the Groom Range in 1864, and the <a href="England">English</a> "Groome Lead Mines Limited" company financed the Conception Mines in the 1870s, giving the district its name (nearby mines included Maria, Willow and White Lake). The interests in Groom were acquired by J. B. Osborne and partners and patented in 1876, and his son acquired the interests in the 1890s. Claims were incorporated as two 1916 companies with mining continuing until 1918 and resuming after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> until the early 1950s.

The airfield on the Groom Lake site began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field, and consisted of two unpaved 5000-foot runways aligned NE/SW, NW/SE .

The Groom Lake test facility was established in April 1955 by the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) for "Project Aquatone", the development of the <a href="Lockheed%20U-2">Lockheed U-2</a> strategic reconnaissance aircraft.

As part of the project, the director, <a href="Richard%20M.%20Bissell%2C%20Jr.">Richard M. Bissell, Jr.</a>, understood that, given the extreme secrecy enveloping the project, the flight test and pilot training programs could not be conducted at <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Edwards Air Force Base</a> or Lockheed's Palmdale facility. A search for a suitable testing site for the U-2 was conducted under the same extreme security as the rest of the project.

He notified Lockheed, who sent an inspection team out to Groom Lake. According to Lockheed's U-2 designer <a href="Kelly%20Johnson%20%28engineer%29">Kelly Johnson</a>: 

The lakebed made an ideal strip from which they could test aircraft, and the Emigrant Valley's mountain ranges and the NTS perimeter, about north of Las Vegas, protected the test site from visitors. The CIA asked the AEC to acquire the land, designated "Area 51" on the map, and add it to the Nevada Test Site.

Johnson named the area "Paradise Ranch" to encourage workers to move to a place that the CIA's official history of the U-2 project would later describe as "the new facility in the middle of nowhere"; the name became shortened to "the Ranch". On 4 May 1955, a survey team arrived at Groom Lake and laid out a , north-south runway on the southwest corner of the lakebed and designated a site for a base support facility. "The Ranch", also known as Site II, initially consisted of little more than a few shelters, workshops and trailer homes in which to house its small team. In a little over three months, the base consisted of a single, paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and rudimentary accommodations for test personnel. The base's few amenities included a movie theatre and volleyball court. Additionally, there was a mess hall, several water wells, and fuel storage tanks. By July 1955, CIA, Air Force, and Lockheed personnel began arriving. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955 from Burbank on a <a href="C-124%20Globemaster%20II">C-124 Globemaster II</a> cargo plane, accompanied by Lockheed technicians on a <a href="Douglas%20DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a>. Regular <a href="Military%20Air%20Transport%20Service">Military Air Transport Service</a> flights were set up between Area 51 and Lockheed's <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a> offices. To preserve secrecy, personnel flew to Nevada on Monday mornings and returned to California on Friday evenings.

Project OXCART established in August 1959 for "antiradar studies, aerodynamic structural tests, and engineering designs [and] all later work on the" <a href="Lockheed%20A-12">Lockheed A-12</a> included testing at Groom Lake, which before improvements for OXCART had inadequate facilities: buildings for only 150 people, a asphalt runway, and limited fuel, hangar, and shop space. Selected for its seclusion and climate, Groom Lake had received a new official name "Area 51" when A-12 test facility construction began in September 1960, including a new runway to replace the existing runway (completed by 15 November 1960 with "expansion joints parallel to the direction of aircraft roll" to limit vibration.)

Four years of "Project 51" construction began on 1 October 1960 by Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) with double-shift construction schedules. The contractor upgraded base facilities and built a new runway (14/32) diagonally across the southwest corner of the lakebed. An Archimedes curve approximately two miles across was marked on the dry lake so that an A-12 pilot approaching the end of the overrun could abort to the <a href="dry%20lake">playa</a> instead of plunging the aircraft into the <a href="sagebrush%20steppe">sagebrush</a>. Area 51 pilots called it "The Hook". For crosswind landings two unpaved airstrips (runways 9/27 and 03/21) were marked on the dry lakebed.

By August 1961, construction of the essential facilities was completed (3 surplus <a href="United%20States%20Navy">Navy</a> hangars were erected on the base's north side—hangars 4, 5, and 6.) A fourth, Hangar 7, was new construction. The original U-2 hangars were converted to maintenance and machine shops. Facilities in the main cantonment area included workshops and buildings for storage and administration, a commissary, control tower, fire station, and housing. The Navy also contributed more than 130 surplus Babbitt duplex housing units for long-term occupancy facilities. Older buildings were repaired, and additional facilities were constructed as necessary. A reservoir pond, surrounded by trees, served as a recreational area one mile north of the base. Other recreational facilities included a gymnasium, movie theatre, and a baseball diamond. A permanent aircraft fuel tank farm was constructed by early 1962 for the special <a href="JP-7">JP-7</a> fuel required by the A-12. Seven tanks were constructed, with a total capacity of 1,320,000 gallons.

For the arrival of OXCART; security was enhanced and the small civilian mine in the Groom basin was closed. In January 1962, the <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) expanded the restricted airspace in the vicinity of Groom Lake. The lakebed became the center of a 600-square-mile addition to restricted area R-4808N.

The CIA facility received eight USAF <a href="F-101%20Voodoo">F-101 Voodoo</a>s for training, two <a href="T-33%20Shooting%20Star">T-33 Shooting Star</a> trainers for proficiency flying, a <a href="C-130%20Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a> for cargo transport, a U-3A for administrative purposes, a helicopter for search and rescue, and a <a href="Cessna%20180">Cessna 180</a> for liaison use; and Lockheed provided an <a href="F-104%20Starfighter">F-104 Starfighter</a> for use as a <a href="chase%20plane">chase plane</a>.

The first A-12 test aircraft was covertly trucked from Burbank on 26 February 1962, arrived at Groom Lake on 28 February, was assembled, and made its first flight 26 April 1962 when the base had over 1,000 personnel. Initially, all not connected with a test were herded into the mess hall before each takeoff. This was soon dropped as it disrupted activities and was impractical with the large number of flights. The closed airspace above Groom Lake was within the <a href="Nellis%20Air%20Force%20Range">Nellis Air Force Range</a> airspace, and pilots saw the A-12 20–30 times (at least one signed a secrecy agreement.).

Groom was also the site of the first <a href="Lockheed%20D-21">Lockheed D-21</a> <a href="unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">drone</a> test flight on 22 December 1964 (not launched until 5 March 1966). By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA operated "1129th Special Activities Squadron".

Although it was decided on 10 January 1967 to phase out the CIA A-12 program, A-12s at Groom Lake occasionally deployed to <a href="Kadena%20AB">Kadena AB</a>, Okinawa, for Project Black Shield in 1967 (the 9 A-12s were stored at Palmdale in June 1968 and the 1129th SAS was inactivated.)

Following the loss of <a href="Gary%20Powers">Gary Powers</a>' <a href="Lockheed%20U-2">U-2</a> over the Soviet Union, there were several discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. Although Kelly Johnson had come to support the idea of drone reconnaissance, he opposed the development of an A-12 drone, contending that the aircraft was too large and complex for such a conversion. However, the Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The Air Force interest seems to have moved the CIA to take action, the project designated "Q-12". By October 1963, the drone's design had been finalized. At the same time, the Q-12 underwent a name change. To separate it from the other A-12-based projects, it was renamed the "D-21". (The "12" was reversed to "21"). "Tagboard" was the project's code name.

The first D-21 was completed in the spring of 1964 by Lockheed. After four more months of checkouts and static tests, the aircraft was shipped to Groom Lake and reassembled. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the "M-21". When the D-21/M-21 reached the launch point, the first step would be to blow off the D-21's inlet and exhaust covers. With the D-21/M-21 at the correct speed and altitude, the LCO would start the ramjet and the other systems of the D-21. With the D-21's systems activated and running, and the launch aircraft at the correct point, the M-21 would begin a slight pushover, the LCO would push a final button, and the D-21 would come off the pylon".

Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. Captive flights showed unforeseen aerodynamic difficulties. By late January 1966, more than a year after the first captive flight, everything seemed ready. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight, with the D-21 flying 120 miles with limited fuel. A second D-12 flight was successful in April 1966 with the drone flying 1,200 miles, reaching Mach 3.3 and 90,000 feet. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21, on a planned checkout flight suffered from a non-start of the drone after its separation, causing it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. The two crewmen ejected and landed in the ocean 150 miles offshore. One crew member was picked up by a helicopter, but the other, having survived the aircraft breakup and ejection, drowned when sea water entered his pressure suit. Kelly Johnson personally cancelled the entire program, having had serious doubts from the start of the feasibility. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and rather than scrapping the whole effort, Johnson again proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a <a href="Boeing%20B-52%20Stratofortress">B-52H</a> bomber.

By late summer of 1967, the modification work to both the D-21 (now designated D-21B) and the B-52Hs were complete. The test program could now resume. The test missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. The first D-21B to be flown was Article 501, the prototype. The first attempt was made on 28 September 1967, and ended in complete failure. As the B-52 was flying toward the launch point, the D-21B fell off the pylon. The B-52H gave a sharp lurch as the drone fell free. The booster fired and was "quite a sight from the ground". The failure was traced to a stripped nut on the forward right attachment point on the pylon. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. However, the fact is that the resumptions of D-21 tests took place against a changing reconnaissance background. The A-12 had finally been allowed to deploy, and the <a href="Lockheed%20SR-71%20Blackbird">SR-71</a> was soon to replace it. At the same time, new developments in reconnaissance satellite technology were nearing operation. Up to this point, the limited number of satellites available restricted coverage to the Soviet Union. A new generation of reconnaissance satellites could soon cover targets anywhere in the world. The satellites' resolution would be comparable to that of aircraft, but without the slightest political risk. Time was running out for the Tagboard.

Several more test flights, including two over <a href="China">China</a>, were made from <a href="Beale%20AFB">Beale AFB</a>, California, in 1969 and 1970, to varying degrees of success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program. The remaining drones were transferred by a C-5A and placed in dead storage. The tooling used to build the D-21Bs was ordered destroyed. Like the A-12 Oxcart, the D-21B Tagboard drones remained a Black airplane, even in retirement. Their existence was not suspected until August 1976, when the first group was placed in storage at the <a href="Davis-Monthan%20AFB">Davis-Monthan AFB</a> <a href="Military%20Storage%20and%20Disposition%20Center">Military Storage and Disposition Center</a>. A second group arrived in 1977. They were labeled "GTD-21Bs" (GT stood for ground training).

Davis-Monthan is an open base, with public tours of the storage area at the time, so the odd-looking drones were soon spotted and photos began appearing in magazines. Speculation about the D-21Bs circulated within aviation circles for years, and it was not until 1982 that details of the Tagboard program were released. However, it was not until 1993 that the B-52/D-21B program was made public. That same year, the surviving D-21Bs were released to museums.

During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, one of the missions carried out by the United States was the test and evaluation of captured <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, and for several decades, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. Under the "HAVE DOUGHNUT", "HAVE DRILL" and "HAVE FERRY" programs, the first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters.

This was not a new mission, as testing of foreign technology by the USAF began during World War II. After the war, testing of acquired foreign technology was performed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC, which became very influential during the Korean War), under the direct command of the Air Materiel Control Department. In 1961 ATIC became the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), and was reassigned to <a href="Air%20Force%20Systems%20Command">Air Force Systems Command</a>. ATIC personnel were sent anywhere where foreign aircraft could be found.

The focus of <a href="Air%20Force%20Systems%20Command">Air Force Systems Command</a> limited the use of the fighter as a tool with which to train the <a href="front%20line">front line</a> tactical fighter pilots. Air Force Systems Command recruited its pilots from the <a href="Air%20Force%20Flight%20Test%20Center">Air Force Flight Test Center</a> at <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Edwards Air Force Base</a>, California, who were usually graduates from various test pilot schools. <a href="Tactical%20Air%20Command">Tactical Air Command</a> selected its pilots primarily from the ranks of the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Weapons%20School">Weapons School</a> graduates.

In August 1966, <a href="Iraqi%20Air%20Force">Iraqi Air Force</a> fighter pilot Captain <a href="Munir%20Redfa">Munir Redfa</a> <a href="List%20of%20Cold%20War%20pilot%20defections%23Iraq">defected</a>, flying his <a href="MiG-21">MiG-21</a> to <a href="Israel">Israel</a> after being ordered to attack Iraqi Kurd villages with napalm. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake within a month to study. In 1968 the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as "Have Doughnut" in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy's Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet made aircraft in simulated air combat training. Because U.S. possession of the Soviet MiG-21 was, itself, secret, it was tested at Groom Lake. A joint Air Force-Navy team was assembled for a series of dogfight tests.

Comparisons between the F-4 and the MiG-21 indicated that, on the surface, they were evenly matched. But air combat was not just about technology. In the final analysis, it was the skill of the man in the cockpit. The Have Doughnut tests showed this most strongly. When the Navy or Air Force pilots flew the MiG-21, the results were a draw; the F-4 would win some fights, the MiG-21 would win others. There were no clear advantages. The problem was not with the planes, but with the pilots flying them. The pilots would not fly either plane to its limits. One of the Navy pilots was Marland W. "Doc" Townsend, then commander of VF-121, the F-4 training squadron at NAS Miramar. He was an engineer and a Korean War veteran and had flown almost every navy aircraft. When he flew against the MiG-21, he would outmaneuver it every time. The Air Force pilots would not go vertical in the MiG-21. The Have Doughnut project officer was Tom Cassidy, a pilot with VX-4, the Navy's Air Development Squadron at Point Mugu. He had been watching as Townsend "waxed" the air force MiG-21 pilots. Cassidy climbed into the MiG-21 and went up against Townsend's F-4. This time the result was far different. Cassidy was willing to fight in the vertical, flying the plane to the point where it was buffeting, just above the stall. Cassidy was able to get on the F-4's tail. After the flight, they realized the MiG-21 turned better than the F-4 at lower speeds. The key was for the F-4 to keep its speed up. What had happened in the sky above Groom Lake was remarkable. An F-4 had defeated the MiG-21; the weakness of the Soviet plane had been found. Further test flights confirmed what was learned. It was also clear that the MiG-21 was a formidable enemy. United States pilots would have to fly much better than they had been to beat it. This would require a special school to teach advanced air combat techniques.

On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, took off in a pair of <a href="MiG-17">MiG-17</a>Fs on a training mission. They lost their way and, believing they were over Lebanon, landed at the Beset Landing Field in northern Israel. (One version has it that they were led astray by an Arabic-speaking Israeli). Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers so that they could be identified in DOD standard flight logs. As in the earlier program, a small group of Air Force and Navy pilots conducted mock dogfights with the MiG-17s. Selected instructors from the Navy's Top Gun school at <a href="NAS%20Miramar">NAS Miramar</a>, California, were chosen to fly against the MiGs for familiarization purposes. Very soon, the MiG-17's shortcomings became clear. It had an extremely simple, even crude, control system which lacked the power-boosted controls of American aircraft. The F-4's twin engines were so powerful it could accelerate out of range of the MiG-17's guns in thirty seconds. It was important for the F-4 to keep its distance from the MiG-17. As long as the F-4 was one and a half miles from the MiG-17, it was outside the reach of the Soviet fighter's guns, but the MiG was within reach of the F-4's missiles.

The data from the Have Doughnut and Have Drill tests were provided to the newly formed <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Fighter%20Weapons%20School">Top Gun</a> school at <a href="NAS%20Miramar">NAS Miramar</a>. By 1970, the Have Drill program was expanded; a few selected fleet F-4 crews were given the chance to fight the MiGs. The most important result of Project Have Drill is that no Navy pilot who flew in the project defeated the MiG-17 Fresco in the first engagement. The Have Drill dogfights were by invitation only. The other pilots based at Nellis Air Force Base were not to know about the U.S.-operated MiGs. To prevent any sightings, the airspace above the Groom Lake range was closed. On aeronautical maps, the exercise area was marked in red ink. The forbidden zone became known as "Red Square".

During the remainder of the Vietnam War, the Navy kill ratio climbed to 8.33 to 1. In contrast, the Air Force rate improved only slightly to 2.83 to 1. The reason for this difference was Top Gun. The Navy had revitalized its air combat training, while the Air Force had stayed stagnant. Most of the Navy MiG kills were by Top Gun graduates.

In May 1973, Project "Have Idea" was formed which took over from the older Have Doughnut, Have Ferry and Have Drill projects and the project was transferred to the <a href="Tonopah%20Test%20Range%20Airport">Tonopah Test Range Airport</a>. At Tonopah testing of foreign technology aircraft continued and expanded throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. This involved testing Soviet tracking and missile control radar systems. A complex of actual and replica Soviet-type threat systems began to grow around "Slater Lake", a mile northwest of the main base, along with an acquired Soviet "Barlock" search radar placed at <a href="Tonopah%20Air%20Force%20Station">Tonopah Air Force Station</a>. They were arranged to simulate a Soviet-style air defense complex.

The Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. Mr. Sam Mitchell, the last CIA commander of Area 51, relinquished command to USAF Lt. Col. Larry D. McClain.

The <a href="Lockheed%20Have%20Blue">Lockheed Have Blue</a> prototype stealth fighter (a smaller proof-of-concept model of the <a href="F-117%20Nighthawk">F-117 Nighthawk</a>) first flew at Groom in December 1977.

In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation's Advanced Development Projects. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full Scale Development (FSD) prototype "79–780", designated YF-117A. At 6:05 am on 18 June 1981 Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A "79–780"' off the runway of Area 51.

Meanwhile, <a href="Tactical%20Air%20Command">Tactical Air Command</a> (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability. That organization became the 4450th Tactical Group (Initially designated "A Unit"), which officially activated on 15 October 1979 at <a href="Nellis%20AFB">Nellis AFB</a>, Nevada, although the group was physically located at Area 51. The 4450th TG also operated the A-7D Corsair II as a surrogate trainer for the F-117A, and these operations continued until 15 October 1982 under the guise of an avionics test mission.

Flying squadrons of the 4450th TG were the 4450th Tactical Squadron (Initially designated "I Unit") activated on 11 June 1981, and 4451st Tactical Squadron (Initially designated "P Unit") on 15 January 1983. The 4450th TS, stationed at Area 51, was the first F-117A squadron, while the 4451st TS was stationed at Nellis AFB and was equipped with <a href="A-7D%20Corsair%20II">A-7D Corsair II</a>s painted in a dark motif, tail coded "LV". Lockheed test pilots put the YF-117 through its early paces. A-7Ds was used for pilot training before any F-117A's had been delivered by Lockheed to Area 51, later the A-7D's were used for F-117A chase testing and other weapon tests at the Nellis Range.

15 October 1982 is important to the program because on that date Major Alton C. Whitley, Jr. became the first USAF 4450th TG pilot to fly the F-117A.

Although ideal for testing, Area 51 was not a suitable location for an operational group, so a new covert base had to be established for F-117 operations.
<a href="Tonopah%20Test%20Range%20Airport">Tonopah Test Range Airport</a> was selected for operations of the first USAF F-117 unit, the <a href="4450th%20Tactical%20Group">4450th Tactical Group</a> (TG). From October 1979, the Tonopah Airport base was reconstructed and expanded. The 6,000 ft runway was lengthened to 10,000 ft. Taxiways, a concrete apron, a large maintenance hangar, and a propane storage tank were added.

By early 1982, four more YF-117A airplanes were operating out of the southern end of the base, known as the "Southend" or "Baja Groom Lake". After finding a large scorpion in their offices, the testing team (Designated "R Unit") adopted it as their mascot and dubbed themselves the "Baja Scorpions". Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued at Area 51 until mid-1981, when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. The F-117s were moved to and from Area 51 by C-5 under the cloak of darkness, in order to maintain program security. This meant that the aircraft had to be defueled, disassembled, cradled, and then loaded aboard the C-5 at night, flown to Lockheed, and unloaded at night before the real work could begin. Of course, this meant that the reverse actions had to occur at the end of the depot work before the aircraft could be reassembled, flight-tested, and redelivered, again under the cover of darkness. In addition to flight-testing, Groom performed radar profiling, F-117 weapons testing, and was the location for training of the first group of frontline USAF F-117 pilots.

While the "Baja Scorpions" were working on the F-117, there was also another group at work in secrecy, known as "the Whalers" working on Tacit Blue. A <a href="fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a> technology demonstration aircraft with curved surfaces and composite material, to evade radar, it was a prototype, and never went into production. Nevertheless, this strange-looking aircraft was responsible for many of the <a href="stealth%20technology">stealth technology</a> advances that were used on several other aircraft designs, and had a direct influence on the B-2; with first flight of <a href="Tacit%20Blue">Tacit Blue</a> being performed on February 5, 1982, by <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20Corporation">Northrop Grumman</a> test pilot, <a href="Richard%20G.%20Thomas">Richard G. Thomas</a>.

Production FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG.

On 17 May 1982, the move of the 4450th TG from Groom Lake to Tonopah was initiated, with the final components of the move completed in early 1983. Production FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG at Tonopah.
The R-Unit was inactivated on 30 May 1989. Upon inactivation, the unit was reformed as Detachment 1, <a href="57th%20Fighter%20Weapons%20Wing">57th Fighter Weapons Wing</a> (FWW). In 1990 the last F-117A ("843") was delivered from Lockheed. After completion of acceptance flights at Area 51 of this last new F-117A aircraft, the flight test squadron continued flight test duties of refurbished aircraft after modifications by Lockheed. In February/March 1992 the test unit moved from Area 51 to the USAF Palmdale <a href="Plant%2042">Plant 42</a> and was integrated with the <a href="Air%20Force%20Systems%20Command">Air Force Systems Command</a> <a href="6510th%20Test%20Squadron">6510th Test Squadron</a>. Some testing, especially RCS verification and other classified activity was still conducted at Area 51 throughout the operational lifetime of the F-117. The recently inactivated (2008) <a href="410th%20Flight%20Test%20Squadron">410th Flight Test Squadron</a> traces its roots, if not its formal lineage to the 4450th TG R-unit.

Since the F-117 became operational in 1983, operations at Groom Lake have continued. The base and its associated runway system were expanded, including expansion of housing and support facilities. In 1995, the federal government expanded the exclusionary area around the base to include nearby mountains that had hitherto afforded the only decent overlook of the base, prohibiting access to of land formerly administered by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a>. On October 22, 2015 a federal judge signed an order giving land that belonged to a Nevada family since the 1870s to the United States Air Force for expanding Area 51. According to the judge, the land that overlooked the base was taken to address security and safety concerns connected with their training and testing.

The amount of information the United States government has been willing to provide regarding Area 51 has generally been minimal. The area surrounding the lake is permanently off-limits to both civilian and normal military air traffic. Security clearances are checked regularly; cameras and weaponry are not allowed. Even military pilots training in the NAFR risk disciplinary action if they stray into the exclusionary "box" surrounding Groom's airspace. Surveillance is supplemented using buried motion sensors. Area 51 is a common destination for <a href="Janet%20%28airline%29">Janet</a>, the "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" name of a small fleet of passenger aircraft operated on behalf of the United States Air Force to transport military personnel, primarily from <a href="McCarran%20International%20Airport">McCarran International Airport</a>.

The USGS topographic map for the area only shows the long-disused Groom Mine. A civil aviation chart published by the <a href="Nevada%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Nevada Department of Transportation</a> shows a large restricted area, defined as part of the Nellis restricted airspace. The National Atlas page showing federal lands in Nevada shows the area as lying within the Nellis Air Force Base. Higher resolution (and more recent) images from other satellite imagery providers (including Russian providers and the <a href="IKONOS">IKONOS</a>) are commercially available. These show the runway markings, base facilities, aircraft, and vehicles.

When documents that mention the <a href="Nevada%20Test%20Site">Nevada Test Site</a> (NTS) and operations at Groom are declassified, mentions of Area 51 and Groom Lake are routinely redacted. One exception is a 1967 memo from CIA director <a href="Richard%20Helms">Richard Helms</a> regarding the deployment of three <a href="Lockheed%20A-12">OXCART</a> aircraft from Groom to <a href="Kadena%20Air%20Base">Kadena Air Base</a> to perform reconnaissance over <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>. Although most mentions of OXCART's home base are redacted in this document, as is a map showing the aircraft's route from there to Okinawa, the redactor appears to have missed one mention: page 15 (page 17 in the PDF), section No. 2 ends "Three OXCART aircraft and the necessary task force personnel will be deployed from Area 51 to Kadena."

On 25 June 2013, CIA released an official history of the <a href="Lockheed%20U-2">U-2</a> and OXCART projects that officially acknowledged the existence of Area 51. The release was in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted in 2005 by Jeffrey T. Richelson of <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a>'s <a href="National%20Security%20Archives">National Security Archives</a>, and contain numerous references to Area 51 and Groom Lake, along with a map of the area.

In 1994, five unnamed civilian contractors and the widows of contractors Walter Kasza and Robert Frost sued the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">USAF</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Their suit, in which they were represented by <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a> law professor <a href="Jonathan%20Turley">Jonathan Turley</a>, alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. <a href="biopsy">Biopsies</a> taken from the complainants were analyzed by <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a> <a href="biochemistry">biochemists</a>, who found high levels of <a href="Polychlorinated%20dibenzodioxins">dioxin</a>, <a href="dibenzofuran">dibenzofuran</a>, and <a href="trichloroethylene">trichloroethylene</a> in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the <a href="Resource%20Conservation%20and%20Recovery%20Act">Resource Conservation and Recovery Act</a> (which governs handling of dangerous materials). They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman <a href="Lee%20H.%20Hamilton">Lee H. Hamilton</a>, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" reporter <a href="Lesley%20Stahl">Lesley Stahl</a>, "The Air Force is classifying all information about Area 51 in order to protect themselves from a lawsuit."

Citing the <a href="State%20Secrets%20Privilege">State Secrets Privilege</a>, the government petitioned trial judge U.S. District Judge Philip Pro (of the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Nevada">United States District Court for the District of Nevada</a> in Las Vegas) to disallow disclosure of classified documents or examination of secret witnesses, alleging this would expose classified information and threaten national security. When Judge Pro rejected the government's argument, <a href="Bill%20Clinton">President Bill Clinton</a> issued a <a href="Presidential%20Determination">Presidential Determination</a>, exempting what it called, "The Air Force's Operating Location Near Groom Lake, Nevada" from environmental disclosure laws. Consequently, Pro dismissed the suit due to lack of evidence. Turley appealed to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a>, on the grounds that the government was abusing its power to classify material. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Air%20Force">Secretary of the Air Force</a> <a href="Sheila%20E.%20Widnall">Sheila E. Widnall</a> filed a brief that stated that disclosures of the materials present in the air and water near Groom "can reveal military operational capabilities or the nature and scope of classified operations." The Ninth Circuit rejected Turley's appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear it, putting an end to the complainants' case.

The <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> continues to annually issue a determination continuing the Groom exception. This, and similarly tacit wording used in other government communications, is the only formal recognition the U.S. Government has ever given that Groom Lake is more than simply another part of the Nellis complex.

An unclassified memo on the safe handling of <a href="F-117%20Nighthawk">F-117 Nighthawk</a> material was posted on an Air Force web site in 2005. This discussed the same materials for which the complainants had requested information (information the government had claimed was classified). The memo was removed shortly after journalists became aware of it.

In December 2007, airline pilots noticed that the base had appeared in their aircraft navigation systems' latest <a href="Jeppesen">Jeppesen</a> database revision with the <a href="ICAO">ICAO</a> airport identifier code of KXTA and listed as "Homey Airport". The probably inadvertent release of the airport data led to advice by the <a href="Aircraft%20Owners%20and%20Pilots%20Association">Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association</a> (AOPA) that student pilots should be explicitly warned about KXTA, not to consider it as a waypoint or destination for any flight even though it now appears in public navigation databases.

Signage around the base perimeter advises that deadly force is authorized against trespassers.

In January 2006, space historian <a href="Dwayne%20A.%20Day">Dwayne A. Day</a> published an article in online aerospace magazine "<a href="The%20Space%20Review">The Space Review</a>" titled "Astronauts and Area 51: the Skylab Incident". The article was based on a memo written in 1974 to <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a> director <a href="William%20Colby">William Colby</a> by an unknown CIA official. The memo reported that astronauts on board <a href="Skylab%204">Skylab 4</a> had, as part of a larger program, inadvertently photographed a location of which the memo said:

Although the name of the location was obscured, the context led Day to believe that the subject was Groom Lake. As Day noted:

The memo details debate between federal agencies regarding whether the images should be classified, with <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> agencies arguing that it should, and <a href="NASA">NASA</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a> arguing against classification. The memo itself questions the legality of unclassified images to be retroactively classified.

Remarks on the memo, handwritten apparently by DCI (<a href="Director%20of%20Central%20Intelligence">Director of Central Intelligence</a>) Colby himself, read:

The declassified documents do not disclose the outcome of discussions regarding the Skylab imagery. The behind-the-scenes debate proved moot as the photograph appeared in the <a href="Center%20for%20Earth%20Resources%20Observation%20and%20Science">Federal Government's Archive of Satellite Imagery</a> along with the remaining Skylab 4 photographs, with no record of anyone noticing until Day identified it in 2007.

Other satellite imagery is also available, including images that show what appears to be <a href="F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a> aircraft stationed on the base.

Its secretive nature and undoubted connection to classified aircraft research, together with reports of unusual phenomena, have led Area 51 to become a focus of modern <a href="Unidentified%20flying%20object">UFO</a> and other <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theories</a>. Some of the activities mentioned in such theories at Area 51 include:
Many of the hypotheses concern underground facilities at Groom or at <a href="Papoose%20Lake">Papoose Lake</a> (also known as "S-4 location"), south, and include claims of a transcontinental underground railroad system, a disappearing airstrip (nicknamed the "Cheshire Airstrip", after <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s <a href="Cheshire%20cat">Cheshire cat</a>) which briefly appears when water is sprayed onto its camouflaged asphalt, and engineering based on alien technology. Publicly available satellite imagery, however, reveals clearly visible landing strips at Groom Dry Lake, but not at Papoose Lake.

In the mid-1950s, civilian aircraft flew under 20,000 feet while military aircraft flew under 40,000 feet. Once the U-2 began flying at above 60,000 feet, an unexpected side effect was an increasing number of UFO sighting reports. Sightings occurred most often during early evenings hours, when airline pilots flying west saw the U-2's silver wings reflect the setting sun, giving the aircraft a "fiery" appearance. Many sighting reports came to the Air Force's <a href="Project%20Blue%20Book">Project Blue pageRank.Book</a>, which investigated UFO sightings, through air-traffic controllers and letters to the government. The project checked U-2 and later OXCART flight records to eliminate the majority of UFO reports it received during the late 1950s and 1960s, although it could not reveal to the letter writers the truth behind what they saw. Similarly, veterans of experimental projects such as OXCART and <a href="NERVA">NERVA</a> at Area 51 agree that their work (including 2,850 OXCART test flights alone) inadvertently prompted many of the UFO sightings and other rumors:

They believe that the rumors helped maintain secrecy over Area 51's actual operations. While the veterans deny the existence of a vast underground railroad system, many of Area 51's operations did (and presumably still do) occur underground.

Several people have claimed knowledge of events supporting Area 51 conspiracy theories. These have included <a href="Bob%20Lazar">Bob Lazar</a>, who claimed in 1989 that he had worked at Area 51's "Sector Four (S-4)", said to be located underground inside the <a href="Papoose%20Range">Papoose Range</a> near <a href="Papoose%20Lake">Papoose Lake</a>. Lazar has stated he was contracted to work with alien spacecraft that the U.S. government had in its possession.

Similarly, the 1996 documentary "Dreamland" directed by <a href="Bruce%20Burgess">Bruce Burgess</a> included an interview with a 71-year-old mechanical engineer who claimed to be a former employee at Area 51 during the 1950s. His claims included that he had worked on a "flying disc simulator" which had been based on a disc originating from a crashed extraterrestrial craft and was used to train US Pilots. He also claimed to have worked with an extraterrestrial being named "J-Rod" and described as a "telepathic translator".

In 2004, Dan Burisch (pseudonym of Dan Crain) claimed to have worked on cloning alien viruses at Area 51, also alongside the alien named "J-Rod". Burisch's scholarly credentials are the subject of much debate, as he was apparently working as a Las Vegas parole officer in 1989 while also earning a PhD at <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York">State University of New York</a> (SUNY).

Novels, films, television programs, and other fictional portrayals of Area 51 describe it—or a fictional counterpart—as a haven for <a href="extraterrestrials">extraterrestrials</a>, <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a>, and <a href="Conspiracy%20theory">sinister conspiracies</a>, often linking it with the <a href="Roswell%20UFO%20incident">Roswell UFO incident</a>.

Audio signal processing

Audio signal processing or audio processing is the intentional alteration of <a href="audio%20signal">audio signal</a>s often through an audio effect or <a href="effects%20unit">effects unit</a>. As audio signals may be electronically represented in either <a href="Digital%20signal%20%28signal%20processing%29">digital</a> or <a href="analog%20signal">analog</a> format, <a href="signal%20processing">signal processing</a> may occur in either domain. Analog processors operate directly on the electrical signal, while digital processors operate mathematically on the digital representation of that signal.

Audio signals are electronic representations of <a href="sound%20wave">sound wave</a>s—<a href="longitudinal%20wave">longitudinal wave</a>s which travel through air, consisting of compressions and rarefactions. The energy contained in audio signals is typically measured in <a href="decibel">decibel</a>s. Audio processing was necessary for early <a href="radio%20broadcasting">radio broadcasting</a>, as there were many problems with studio to transmitter links.

"Analog" indicates something that is mathematically represented by a set of <a href="Continuous%20function">continuous</a> values; for example, the analog clock uses constantly moving hands on a physical clock face, where moving the hands directly alters the information that clock is providing. Thus, an analog signal is one represented by a continuous stream of data, in this case along an electrical circuit in the form of voltage, current or charge changes "(compare with digital signals below)". Analog signal processing (ASP) then involves physically altering the continuous signal by changing the voltage or current or charge via various electrical means.

Historically, before the advent of widespread <a href="digital%20technology">digital technology</a>, ASP was the only method by which to manipulate a signal. Since that time, as computers and software became more advanced, digital signal processing has become the method of choice.

A digital representation expresses the <a href="sound%20pressure">pressure</a> wave-form as a sequence of symbols, usually <a href="Binary%20numeral%20system">binary</a> numbers. This permits signal processing using <a href="Digital%20electronics">digital circuits</a> such as <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>s and <a href="computer">computer</a>s. Although such a conversion can be prone to loss, most modern audio systems use this approach as the techniques of digital signal processing are much more powerful and efficient than analog domain signal processing.

Processing methods and application areas include <a href="audio%20storage">storage</a>, <a href="audio%20level%20compression">level compression</a>, <a href="audio%20data%20compression">data compression</a>, <a href="transmission%20%28telecom%29">transmission</a>, enhancement (e.g., <a href="Equalization%20%28audio%29">equalization</a>, <a href="audio%20filter">filtering</a>, <a href="noise%20cancellation">noise cancellation</a>, <a href="Echo%20%28phenomenon%29">echo</a> or <a href="reverb">reverb</a> removal or addition, etc.)

Traditionally the most important audio processing (in audio broadcasting) takes place just before the transmitter. Studio audio processing is limited in the modern era due to digital audio systems (<a href="mixing%20console">mixers</a>, routers) being pervasive in the studio.

In audio broadcasting, the audio processor must

Audio unprocessed by reverb and delay is metaphorically referred to as "dry", while processed audio is referred to as "wet".

<doc id="2323" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323" title="Amdahl's law">
Amdahl's law

In <a href="computer%20architecture">computer architecture</a>, Amdahl's law (or Amdahl's argument) is a formula which gives the theoretical <a href="speedup">speedup</a> in <a href="latency%20%28engineering%29">latency</a> of the execution of a task at fixed <a href="workload">workload</a> that can be expected of a system whose resources are improved. It is named after computer scientist <a href="Gene%20Amdahl">Gene Amdahl</a>, and was presented at the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Information%20Processing%20Societies">AFIPS</a> Spring Joint Computer Conference in 1967.

Amdahl's law is often used in <a href="parallel%20computing">parallel computing</a> to predict the theoretical speedup when using multiple processors. For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular part of the program which takes one hour to execute cannot be parallelized, while the remaining 19 hours () of execution time can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors are devoted to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical one hour. Hence, the theoretical speedup is limited to at most 20 times (). For this reason, parallel computing with many processors is useful only for highly parallelizable programs.

Amdahl's law can be formulated in the following way:
where

Furthermore,

shows that the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task increases with the improvement of the resources of the system and that regardless of the magnitude of the improvement, the theoretical speedup is always limited by the part of the task that cannot benefit from the improvement.

Amdahl's law applies only to the cases where the problem size is fixed. In practice, as more computing resources become available, they tend to get used on larger problems (larger datasets), and the time spent in the parallelizable part often grows much faster than the inherently serial work. In this case, <a href="Gustafson%27s%20law">Gustafson's law</a> gives a less pessimistic and more realistic assessment of the parallel performance.

A task executed by a system whose resources are improved compared to an initial similar system can be split up into two parts:


An example is a computer program that processes files from disk. A part of that program may scan the directory of the disk and create a list of files internally in memory. After that, another part of the program passes each file to a separate <a href="Thread%20%28computing%29">thread</a> for processing. The part that scans the directory and creates the file list cannot be sped up on a parallel computer, but the part that processes the files can.

The execution time of the whole task before the improvement of the resources of the system is denoted as formula_3. It includes the execution time of the part that would not benefit from the improvement of the resources and the execution time of the one that would benefit from it. The fraction of the execution time of the task that would benefit from the improvement of the resources is denoted by formula_4. The one concerning the part that would not benefit from it is therefore . Then:

It is the execution of the part that benefits from the improvement of the resources that is accelerated by the factor formula_6 after the improvement of the resources. Consequently, the execution time of the part that does not benefit from it remains the same, while the part that benefits from it becomes:

The theoretical execution time formula_8 of the whole task after the improvement of the resources is then:

Amdahl's law gives the theoretical <a href="speedup">speedup</a> in <a href="Latency%20%28engineering%29">latency</a> of the execution of the whole task "at fixed workload formula_10", which yields

If 30% of the execution time may be the subject of a speedup, "p" will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the affected part twice as fast, "s" will be 2. Amdahl's law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be:

For example, assume that we are given a serial task which is split into four consecutive parts, whose percentages of execution time are , , , and respectively. Then we are told that the 1st part is not sped up, so , while the 2nd part is sped up 5 times, so , the 3rd part is sped up 20 times, so , and the 4th part is sped up 1.6 times, so . By using Amdahl's law, the overall speedup is
Notice how the 20 times and 5 times speedup on the 2nd and 3rd parts respectively don't have much effect on the overall speedup when the 4th part (48% of the execution time) is accelerated by only 1.6 times.

For example, with a serial program in two parts "A" and "B" for which and ,

Therefore, making part "A" to run 2 times faster is better than making part "B" to run 5 times faster. The percentage improvement in speed can be calculated as


Amdahl's law is often conflated with the <a href="law%20of%20diminishing%20returns">law of diminishing returns</a>, whereas only a special case of applying Amdahl's law demonstrates law of diminishing returns. If one picks optimally (in terms of the achieved speedup) what to improve, then one will see monotonically decreasing improvements as one improves. If, however, one picks non-optimally, after improving a sub-optimal component and moving on to improve a more optimal component, one can see an increase in the return. Note that it is often rational to improve a system in an order that is "non-optimal" in this sense, given that some improvements are more difficult or require larger development time than others.

Amdahl's law does represent the law of diminishing returns if on considering what sort of return one gets by adding more processors to a machine, if one is running a fixed-size computation that will use all available processors to their capacity. Each new processor added to the system will add less usable power than the previous one. Each time one doubles the number of processors the speedup ratio will diminish, as the total throughput heads toward the limit of 1/(1 − "p").

This analysis neglects other potential bottlenecks such as <a href="memory%20bandwidth">memory bandwidth</a> and I/O bandwidth. If these resources do not scale with the number of processors, then merely adding processors provides even lower returns. 

An implication of Amdahl's law is that to speedup real applications which have both serial and parallel portions, <a href="heterogeneous%20computing">heterogeneous computing</a> techniques are required. For example, a CPU-GPU heterogeneous processor may provide higher performance and energy efficiency than a CPU-only or GPU-only processor.

Ayahuasca

Ayahuasca (; ), or iowaska, or yagé ( or ), is an <a href="entheogen">entheogen</a>ic brew made out of "<a href="Banisteriopsis%20caapi">Banisteriopsis caapi</a>" vine and other ingredients. The brew is used as a <a href="Traditional%20medicine">traditional spiritual medicine</a> in ceremonies among the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Peru">Indigenous peoples</a> of the <a href="Amazon%20basin">Amazon basin</a>.

It has been reported that some psychoactive effects can be felt from consuming the ayahuasca vine alone. The hallucinogen DMT will be digested in the stomach and remain inactive without the inclusion of a <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">monoamine oxidase inhibitor</a> (MAOI) such as "Banisteriopsis caapi". Therefore, a combination of both a MAOI-containing plant and DMT-containing substance is necessary for full hallucinogenic effects. The resulting brew is known by a number of different names (see <a href="%23Nomenclature">below</a>).

Ayahuasca is known by many names throughout Northern South America and <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>.

"Ayahuasca" is the <a href="hispanicized">hispanicized</a> style spelling of a word in the <a href="Quechua%20languages">Quechua languages</a>, which are spoken in the <a href="Andean%20states">Andean states</a> of <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, and <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>. Speakers of Quechua languages or of the <a href="Aymara%20language">Aymara language</a> may prefer the spelling "ayawaska". This word refers both to the <a href="liana">liana</a> "<a href="Banisteriopsis%20caapi">Banisteriopsis caapi</a>", and to the brew prepared from it. In the Quechua languages, "aya" means "spirit, soul", "corpse, dead body", and "waska" means "rope" and "woody vine", "liana". The word "ayahuasca" has been variously translated as "liana of the soul", "liana of the dead", and "spirit liana".

In Brazil, the brew and the liana are informally called either caapi or cipó; the latter is the Portuguese word for <a href="liana">liana</a> (or woody climbing vine). In the <a href="Uni%C3%A3o%20do%20Vegetal">União do Vegetal</a> of Brazil, an organised spiritual tradition in which people drink ayahuasca, the brew is prepared exclusively from "B. caapi" and "P. viridis". Adherents of União do Vegetal call this brew hoasca or vegetal.

The <a href="Achuar%20people">Achuar people</a> and <a href="Shuar%20people">Shuar people</a> of Ecuador and Peru call it natem, whereas the <a href="Sharanahua%20peoples">Sharanahua peoples</a> of Peru call it shori.

In the 16th century, Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal first encountered indigenous South Americans using ayahuasca; their earliest reports described it as "the work of the devil". In the 20th century, the active chemical constituent of "B. caapi" was named "<a href="telepathine">telepathine</a>", but it was found to be identical to a chemical already isolated from "Peganum harmala" and was given the name <a href="harmaline">harmaline</a>. Beat writer William Burroughs read a paper by <a href="Richard%20Evans%20Schultes">Richard Evans Schultes</a> on the subject and while traveling through South America in the early 1950s sought out "yagé" in the hopes that it could relieve or cure <a href="opiate">opiate</a> <a href="Substance%20use%20disorder">addiction</a> (see "<a href="The%20Yage%20Letters">The Yage Letters</a>"). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in "True Hallucinations". <a href="Dennis%20McKenna">Dennis McKenna</a> later studied pharmacology, <a href="botany">botany</a>, and <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> of ayahuasca and <a href="oo-koo-he">oo-koo-he</a>, which became the subject of his master's thesis.

<a href="Richard%20Evans%20Schultes">Richard Evans Schultes</a> allowed for <a href="Claudio%20Naranjo">Claudio Naranjo</a> to make a special journey by canoe up the Amazon River to study yage with the South American Indians. He brought back samples of this drug and published the first scientific description of the effects of its active alkaloids.

In <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, a number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged, the most famous of them being <a href="Santo%20Daime">Santo Daime</a> and the <a href="Uni%C3%A3o%20do%20Vegetal">União do Vegetal</a> (or UDV), usually in an <a href="Spiritism">animistic</a> context that may be shamanistic or, more often (as with Santo Daime and the UDV), integrated with <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Both Santo Daime and União do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world. Similarly, the US and Europe have started to see new religious groups develop in relation to increased ayahuasca use. Some Westerners have teamed up with shamans in the Amazon rainforest regions, forming ayahuasca healing retreats that claim to be able to cure mental and physical illness and allow communication with the spirit world.

In recent years, the brew has been popularized by <a href="Wade%20Davis%20%28anthropologist%29">Wade Davis</a> ("<a href="One%20River">One River</a>)," English novelist <a href="Martin%20J.%20Goodman">Martin Goodman</a> in "I Was Carlos Castaneda", Chilean novelist <a href="Isabel%20Allende">Isabel Allende</a>, writer <a href="Kira%20Salak">Kira Salak</a>, author Jeremy Narby ("The Cosmic Serpent"), author <a href="Jay%20Griffiths">Jay Griffiths</a> (""), and radio personality <a href="Robin%20Quivers">Robin Quivers</a>. It was also key to the plot of Season 18, Episode 18, "Spellbound" of .<a href="https%3A//allthingslawandorder.blogspot.com/2017/05/law-order-svu-spellbound-recap-review.html"></a>

Sections of "Banisteriopsis caapi" vine are <a href="Maceration%20%28food%29">macerated</a> and boiled alone or with leaves from any of a number of other plants, including "<a href="Psychotria%20viridis">Psychotria viridis</a>" ("chacruna") or "<a href="Diplopterys%20cabrerana">Diplopterys cabrerana</a>" (also known as "chaliponga" and "chacropanga"). The resulting brew may contain the powerful <a href="psychedelic%20drug">psychedelic drug</a> <a href="Dimethyltryptamine">DMT</a> and <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">MAO inhibiting</a> <a href="harmala%20alkaloid">harmala alkaloid</a>s, which are necessary to make the DMT orally active. The traditional making of ayahuasca follows a ritual process that requires the user to pick the lower chacruna leaf at sunrise then say a prayer. The vine must be "cleaned meticulously with wooden spoons" and pounded "with wooden mallets until it's fibre." 

Brews can also be made with no DMT-containing plants; "Psychotria viridis" being substituted by plants such as "<a href="Justicia%20pectoralis">Justicia pectoralis</a>", "<a href="Brugmansia">Brugmansia</a>", or sacred tobacco, also known as "mapacho" (<a href="Nicotiana%20rustica">Nicotiana rustica</a>), or sometimes left out with no replacement. This brew varies radically from one batch to the next, both in potency and psychoactive effect, based mainly on the skill of the shaman or brewer, as well as other admixtures sometimes added and the intent of the ceremony. Natural variations in plant alkaloid content and profiles also affect the final concentration of alkaloids in the brew, and the physical act of cooking may also serve to modify the alkaloid profile of <a href="harmala">harmala</a> alkaloids.

Ayahuasca is used largely as a treasured <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>. People who work with ayahuasca in non-traditional contexts often align themselves with the philosophies and cosmologies associated with ayahuasca <a href="shamanism">shamanism</a>, as practiced among <a href="indigenous%20people">indigenous people</a>s like the <a href="Urarina">Urarina</a> of the <a href="Peruvian%20Amazon">Peruvian Amazon</a>. While non-native users know of the spiritual applications of ayahuasca, a less well-known traditional usage focuses on the medicinal properties of ayahuasca. When used for its medicinal purposes, ayahuasca affects the human consciousness for fewer than six hours, beginning half an hour after consumption and peaking after two hours. Ayahuasca also has cardiovascular effects, moderately increasing both heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. In some cases, individuals experience significant psychological stress during the experience. It is for this reason that extreme caution should be taken with those who may be at risk of heart disease.

The psychedelic effects of ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation, the mixing of sensory modalities, and psychological introspection that may lead to great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties are important (known as "la purga" or "the purge"). The intense <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a> and occasional <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a> it induces can clear the body of worms and other tropical <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s, and harmala alkaloids themselves have been shown to be <a href="anthelmintic">anthelmintic</a>. Thus, this action is twofold; a direct action on the parasites by these harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine in ayahuasca) works to kill the parasites, and parasites are expelled through the increased intestinal motility that is caused by these alkaloids.

Dietary taboos are often associated with the use of ayahuasca. In the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self – abstaining from spicy and heavily-seasoned foods, excess fat, salt, caffeine, acidic foods (such as citrus) and sex before, after, or during a ceremony. A diet low in <a href="Tyramine%23Occurrence">foods containing tyramine</a> has been recommended, as the speculative interaction of <a href="tyramine">tyramine</a> and MAOIs could lead to a <a href="hypertensive%20crisis">hypertensive crisis</a>. However, evidence indicates that <a href="harmala%20alkaloids">harmala alkaloids</a> act only on <a href="Monoamine%20oxidase%20A">MAO-A</a>, in a reversible way similar to <a href="moclobemide">moclobemide</a> (an antidepressant that does not require dietary restrictions). Dietary restrictions are not used by the highly urban Brazilian ayahuasca church <a href="Uni%C3%A3o%20do%20Vegetal">União do Vegetal</a>, suggesting the risk is much lower than perceived and probably non-existent.

<a href="shamanism">Shamans</a> and experienced users of ayahuasca advise against consuming ayahuasca when not in the presence of one or several well-trained shamans.

In some areas, there are purported brujos (Spanish for 'Sorcerers') who masquerade as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink ayahuasca in their presence. Shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile.

Traditional ayahuasca brews are usually made with "Banisteriopsis caapi" as an <a href="MAOI">MAOI</a>, although <a href="dimethyltryptamine">dimethyltryptamine</a> sources and other admixtures vary from region to region. There are several <a href="Banisteriopsis%20caapi%23Types%20of%20vine">varieties of caapi</a>, often known as different "colors", with varying effects, potencies, and uses.

Common admixtures with their associated ceremonial values and spirits:


In the late 20th century, the practice of ayahuasca drinking began spreading to <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and elsewhere. The first ayahuasca churches, affiliated with the <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian <a href="Santo%20Daime">Santo Daime</a>, were established in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. A legal case was filed against two of the Church's leaders, <a href="Hans%20Bogers">Hans Bogers</a> (one of the original founders of the Dutch Santo Daime community) and <a href="Geraldine%20Fijneman">Geraldine Fijneman</a> (the head of the <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> Santo Daime community). Bogers and Fijneman were charged with distributing a <a href="controlled%20substance">controlled substance</a> (DMT); however, the prosecution was unable to prove that the use of ayahuasca by members of the Santo Daime constituted a sufficient threat to public health and order such that it warranted denying their rights to <a href="religious%20freedom">religious freedom</a> under <a href="ECHR%23Article%209%20-%20conscience%20and%20religion">ECHR Article 9</a>. The 2001 verdict of the Amsterdam district court is an important precedent. Since then groups that are not affiliated to the Santo Daime have used ayahuasca, and a number of different "styles" have been developed, including non-religious approaches.

In modern Europe and North America, ayahuasca analogs are often prepared using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, seeds of the <a href="Syrian%20rue">Syrian rue</a> plant can be used as a substitute for the ayahuasca vine, and the DMT-rich "<a href="Mimosa%20hostilis">Mimosa hostilis</a>" is used in place of "<a href="chacruna">chacruna</a>". Australia has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>".

The name "ayahuasca" specifically refers to a botanical decoction that contains "Banisteriopsis caapi". A synthetic version, known as <a href="pharmahuasca">pharmahuasca</a>, is a combination of an appropriate MAOI and typically DMT. In this usage, the DMT is generally considered the main psychoactive active ingredient, while the MAOI merely preserves the psychoactivity of orally ingested DMT, which would otherwise be destroyed in the gut before it could be absorbed in the body. In contrast, traditionally among Amazonian tribes, the B.Caapi vine is considered to be the "spirit" of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper, and guide to the otherworldly realms.

Brews similar to ayahuasca may be prepared using several plants not traditionally used in South America:

DMT admixtures:

MAOI admixtures:

<a href="Harmala%20alkaloid">Harmala alkaloid</a>s are MAO-inhibiting <a href="beta-Carboline">"beta"-carboline</a>s. The three most studied harmala alkaloids in the "B. caapi" vine are <a href="harmine">harmine</a>, <a href="harmaline">harmaline</a> and <a href="tetrahydroharmine">tetrahydroharmine</a>. Harmine and harmaline are <a href="Monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor%23Selectivity">selective</a> and <a href="Monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor%23Reversibility">reversible</a> inhibitors of <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20A">monoamine oxidase A</a> (MAO-A), while tetrahydroharmine is a weak <a href="serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a> (SRI).

This inhibition of MAO-A allows <a href="Dimethyltryptamine">DMT</a> to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine, and eventually cross the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a> (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without <a href="Reversible%20inhibitor%20of%20monoamine%20oxidase%20A">RIMA</a>s or the non-selective, nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibition by drugs like <a href="phenelzine">phenelzine</a> and <a href="tranylcypromine">tranylcypromine</a>, DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.

Individual <a href="polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphisms</a> in the <a href="CYP2D6">cytochrome P450-2D6 enzyme</a> affect the ability of individuals to metabolize harmine. Some natural tolerance to habitual use of ayahuasca (roughly once weekly) may develop through <a href="upregulation">upregulation</a> of the serotonergic system. A phase 1 pharmacokinetic study on ayahuasca (as Hoasca) with 15 volunteers was conducted in 1993, during the Hoasca Project. A review of the Hoasca Project has been published.

People who have consumed ayahuasca report having <a href="Spirituality">spiritual</a> revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the <a href="universe">universe</a> as well as deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can. This is viewed by many as a spiritual awakening and what is often described as a rebirth. In addition, it is often reported that individuals feel they gain access to higher spiritual <a href="dimension">dimension</a>s and make contact with various spiritual or extra-dimensional beings who can act as guides or healers.

Author Don Jose Campos claims that people may experience profound positive life changes subsequent to consuming ayahuasca. Vomiting can follow ayahuasca ingestion; this purging is considered by many <a href="Shamanism">shamans</a> and experienced users of ayahuasca to be an essential part of the experience, as it represents the release of negative energy and emotions built up over the course of one's life. Others report purging in the form of <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, and hot/cold flashes.

The ingestion of ayahuasca can also cause significant, but temporary, emotional and psychological distress. Excessive use can lead to <a href="serotonin%20syndrome">serotonin syndrome</a>, with symptoms such as tremors, diarrhea, <a href="autonomic%20instability">autonomic instability</a>, <a href="hyperthermia">hyperthermia</a>, sweating, muscle spasms and possible death. Long-term negative effects are not known. A few deaths due to participation in the consumption of ayahuasca have been reported. Some of the deaths may have been due to unscreened preexisting heart conditions, interaction with drugs, such as <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s, recreational drugs, caffeine, or nicotine, or any of the various additional plants that are frequently added to brews.

Research developed by the <a href="Beckley%20Foundation">Beckley Foundation</a> suggests ayahuasca intake can lead to significant increases in mindfulness abilities and that ayahuasca can promote neurogenesis (the growth of new brain cells) <a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>.

Internationally, DMT is a Schedule I drug under the <a href="Convention%20on%20Psychotropic%20Substances">Convention on Psychotropic Substances</a>. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing it are not subject to international control:

The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. . . . Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principals, <a href="mescaline">mescaline</a>, <a href="N%2CN-Dimethyltryptamine">DMT</a>, and <a href="psilocin">psilocin</a>.
A <a href="fax">fax</a> from the Secretary of the <a href="International%20Narcotics%20Control%20Board">International Narcotics Control Board</a> (INCB) to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health sent in 2001 goes on to state that "Consequently, preparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca, are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention."

Despite the INCB's 2001 affirmation that ayahuasca is not subject to drug control by international convention, in its 2010 Annual Report the Board recommended that governments consider controlling (i.e. criminalizing) ayahuasca at the national level. This recommendation by the INCB has been criticized as an attempt by the Board to overstep its legitimate mandate and as establishing a reason for governments to violate the human rights (i.e., religious freedom) of ceremonial ayahuasca drinkers.

The legal status in the United States of DMT-containing plants is somewhat questionable. Ayahuasca plants and preparations are legal, as they contain no scheduled chemicals. However, brews made using DMT containing plants are illegal since DMT is a Schedule I drug. That said, some people are challenging this, using arguments similar to those used by peyotist religious sects, such as the <a href="Native%20American%20Church">Native American Church</a>. A court case allowing the <a href="Uni%C3%A3o%20do%20Vegetal">União do Vegetal</a> to import and use the tea for religious purposes in the United States, "<a href="Gonzales%20v.%20O%20Centro%20Espirita%20Beneficente%20Uniao%20do%20Vegetal">Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal</a>", was heard by the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> on November 1, 2005; the decision, released February 21, 2006, allows the UDV to use the tea in its ceremonies pursuant to the <a href="Religious%20Freedom%20Restoration%20Act">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a>. In a similar case an Ashland, Oregon-based Santo Daime church sued for their right to import and consume ayahuasca tea. In March 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Panner ruled in favor of the Santo Daime, acknowledging its protection from prosecution under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

Religious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, which concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.

In France, <a href="Santo%20Daime">Santo Daime</a> won a court case allowing them to use the tea in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled. Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared "stupéfiants", or narcotic schedule I substances, making the tea and its ingredients illegal to use or possess.

Ayahuasca has also stirred debate regarding intellectual property protection of traditional knowledge. In 1986 the US Patent and Trademarks Office allowed the granting of a patent on the ayahuasca vine B. Caapi. It allowed this patent based on the assumption that ayahuasca's properties had not been previously described in writing. Several public interest groups, including the "Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin" (COICA) and the "Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment (Amazon Coalition)" objected. In 1999 they brought a legal challenge to this patent which had granted a private US citizen "ownership" of the knowledge of a plant that is well-known and sacred to many indigenous peoples of the Amazon, and used by them in religious and healing ceremonies.

Later that year the PTO issued a decision rejecting the patent, on the basis that the petitioners' arguments that the plant was not "distinctive or novel" were valid. However, the decision did not acknowledge the argument that the plant's religious or cultural values prohibited a patent. In 2001, after an appeal by the patent holder, the US Patent Office reinstated the patent. The law at the time did not allow a third party such as COICA to participate in that part of the reexamination process. The patent, held by US entrepreneur Loren Miller, expired in 2003.

There have been several reports from people who claim that they have developed various mental health issues, including psychosis, PTSD and <a href="Depersonalization/Derealization%20disorder">DPD</a>, as a result of consuming ayahuasca (or its psychoactive component, DMT). The website ayahuasca-risks.org was set up to educate people about the risks of ayahuasca given the increasing number of people searching for ayahuasca retreats on Google.

Abbe number

In <a href="optics">optics</a> and <a href="lens%20design">lens design</a>, the Abbe number, also known as the V-number or constringence of a <a href="Transparency%20%28optics%29">transparent</a> material, is a measure of the material's <a href="dispersion%20%28optics%29">dispersion</a> (variation of <a href="refractive">refractive</a> index versus wavelength), with high values of "V" indicating low dispersion. It is named after <a href="Ernst%20Abbe">Ernst Abbe</a> (1840–1905), the German physicist who defined it.
The Abbe number, "V", of a material is defined as

where "n", "n" and "n" are the refractive indices of the material at the wavelengths of the <a href="Fraunhofer%20lines">Fraunhofer</a> D-, F- and C- <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s (589.3 <a href="nanometre">nm</a>, 486.1 nm and 656.3 nm respectively). 

Abbe numbers are used to classify <a href="glass">glass</a> and other optical materials in terms of their chromaticity. For example, the higher dispersion <a href="flint%20glass">flint glass</a>es have "V" < 55 whereas the lower dispersion <a href="crown%20glass%20%28optics%29">crown glass</a>es have larger Abbe numbers. Values of "V" range from below 25 for very dense flint glasses, around 34 for <a href="polycarbonate">polycarbonate</a> plastics, up to 65 for common crown glasses, and 75 to 85 for some fluorite and phosphate crown glasses. 

Abbe numbers are used in the design of <a href="achromatic%20lens">achromatic lens</a>es, as their "reciprocal" is proportional to dispersion (slope of refractive index versus wavelength) in the wavelength region where the human eye is most sensitive (see graph). For different wavelength regions, or for higher precision in characterizing a system's chromaticity (such as in the design of <a href="apochromat">apochromat</a>s), the full dispersion relation (refractive index as a function of wavelength) is used.

An Abbe diagram, also called 'the glass veil', is produced by plotting the Abbe number "V" of a material versus its refractive index "n". Glasses can then be categorised and selected according to their positions on the diagram. This can be a letter-number code, as used in the <a href="Schott%20Glass">Schott Glass</a> catalogue, or a 6-digit <a href="glass%20code">glass code</a>.

Glasses' Abbe numbers, along with their mean refractive indices, are used in the calculation of the required <a href="refractive%20power">refractive power</a>s of the elements of <a href="achromatic%20lenses">achromatic lenses</a> in order to cancel <a href="chromatic%20aberration">chromatic aberration</a> to first order. Note that these two parameters which enter into the equations for design of achromatic doublets are exactly what is plotted on an Abbe diagram.

Due to the difficulty and inconvenience in producing sodium and hydrogen lines, alternate definitions of the Abbe number are often substituted (<a href="ISO">ISO</a> 7944). Rather than the standard definition, above, using the refractive index variation between the F and C <a href="Fraunhofer%20lines%23Naming">hydrogen lines</a>, an alternative measure using the subscript "e"
takes the difference between the refractive indices of the blue and red cadmium lines at 480.0 nm and 643.8 nm (with "n" referring to the wavelength of the mercury e-line, 546.073 nm). Other definitions can similarly be employed; the following table lists standard wavelengths at which n is commonly determined, including the standard subscripts employed.

<doc id="2333" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333" title="Ablative case">
Ablative case

The ablative case (sometimes <a href="list%20of%20glossing%20abbreviations">abbreviated</a> ) is a <a href="grammatical%20case">grammatical case</a> for nouns, pronouns and adjectives in the <a href="grammar">grammar</a> of various languages; it is sometimes used to express motion away from something, among other uses. The word "ablative" derives from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "ablatus", the (irregular) perfect passive participle of "auferre" "to carry away". There is no ablative case in modern <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a> such as <a href="German%20language">German</a>, nor in ancient Greek.

The ablative case in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> ("[casus] ablativus") appears in various grammatical constructions, including following various prepositions, in an <a href="Latin%20grammar%23Ablative%20absolute">ablative absolute</a> clause, and adverbially. The ablative case was derived from three <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> cases: ablative (from), instrumental (with), and locative (in/at).

In <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>, there was no ablative case; some of its functions were taken by the <a href="genitive%20case">genitive</a> and others by the dative; the genitive had functions belonging to the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> genitive and ablative cases. The genitive case with the prepositions ἀπό "apó" "away from" and ἐκ/ἐξ "ek/ex" "out of" is an example.

<a href="German%20language">German</a> does not have an ablative case (but exceptionally, Latin ablative case-forms were used from the 17th to the 19th century after some <a href="preposition%20and%20postposition">prepositions</a>, for example after "von" in "von dem Nomine": ablative of the Latin loanword "Nomen"). Grammarians at that time, such as <a href="Justus%20Georg%20Schottel">Justus Georg Schottel</a>, <a href="Kaspar%20von%20Stieler">Kaspar von Stieler</a> ("der Spate"), Johann Balthasar von Antesperg and <a href="Johann%20Christoph%20Gottsched">Johann Christoph Gottsched</a>, listed an ablative case (as the sixth case after nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and vocative) for German words. They arbitrarily considered the dative case after some prepositions to be an ablative, as in "von dem Mann[e]" ("from the man" or "of the man") and "mit dem Mann[e]" ("with the man"), while they considered the dative case after other prepositions or without a preposition as "dem Mann[e]" to be a dative.

There is some confusion in German culture about the Latin ablative and the German dative.

As in Ancient Greek, the functions of the ablative case in the Serbo-Croatian language are performed by the genitive case. Of the three forms of genitive in <a href="Serbo-Croatian%20language">Serbo-Croatian</a> (partitive, possessive and ablative), the noun in the ablative genitive marks the origin of something: departure or detachment from it.

The ablative case is found in <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a>; it is the fifth case, "rasa rjedhore".

In <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, the ablative case is the fifth case ("pañcamī") and has a similar function to that in Latin. It is bound up with a special semantic condition, "apādāna" (अपादान) in <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. In fact, the fifth case (ablative) is the typical morphological realization of "apādāna" (<a href="P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini">Pāṇini</a> 2.3.28).

Sanskrit nouns in this case often refer to a subject "out of" which or "from" whom something (an action, an object) has arisen or occurred: "patram vṛkṣāt patati" "the leaf falls from the tree".

It is also used for nouns in several other senses, as for actions occurring "because of" or "without" a certain noun, indicating distance or direction. When it appears with a comparative adjective, ("śreṣṭhatamam," "the best"), the ablative is used to refer to what the adjective is comparing: "better than X".

The modern <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a> ablative has different markers for each main dialect, both originating from <a href="Classical%20Armenian">Classical Armenian</a>. The <a href="Western%20Armenian">Western Armenian</a> affix -է "-ē" (definite -էն "-ēn") derives from the classical singular; the <a href="Eastern%20Armenian">Eastern Armenian</a> affix -ից "-ic’" (both indefinite and definite) derives from the classical plural. For both dialects, those affixes are singular, with the corresponding plurals being -(ն)երէ(ն) "-(n)erē(n)" and -(ն)երից "-(n)eric’".

The ablative case has several uses.Its principal function is to show "motion away" from a location, point in space or time:

It also shows the agent when it is used with the passive voice of the verb:

It is also used for comparative statements in colloquial Armenian (including infinitives and participles):

Finally, it governs certain postpositions:

In <a href="Finnish%20language">Finnish</a>, the ablative case is the sixth of the locative cases with the meaning "from, off, of": "pöytä – pöydältä" "table – off from the table". It is an outer locative case, used like the <a href="adessive">adessive</a> and <a href="allative">allative</a> cases, to denote both being on top of something and "being around the place" (as opposed to the inner locative case, the <a href="elative%20case">elative</a>, which means "from out of" or "from the inside of"). With the locative, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it.

The Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate start times ("kymmeneltä" "at ten") as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions.

The Finnish ablative has the ending "-lta" or "-ltä", depending on <a href="vowel%20harmony">vowel harmony</a>.







The ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe movement away from, as well as a concept, object, act or event originating from an object, person, location or entity. For example, one walking away from a friend who gave him a gift could say the following: 

When used to describe movement away from a location, the case may only refer to movement from "the general vicnity" of the location and not from inside of it. Thus, "a postától jövök" would mean one had been standing "next to" the post office before, not inside the building.

When the case is used to refer to the origin of a possible act or event, the act/event may be implied while not explicitly stated, such as "Meg foglak védeni a rablótól": I will defend you from the robber. 

The application of <a href="vowel%20harmony">vowel harmony</a> gives two different suffixes: "-tól" and "-től". These are applied to back-vowel and front-vowel words, respectively.

The ablative in <a href="Azerbaijani%20language">Azeri</a> ("") is expressed through the suffixes "-dan" or "-dən":

Ev - evdən
<br>"House - from/off the house"

Aparmaq - aparmaqdan
<br>"To carry - from/off carrying"

The ablative in <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> ("-den hali" or "ayrılma hali") is expressed through the suffixes "-den", "-dan", "-ten" or "-tan":

Ev - evden
<br>"House - from/off the house"

At - attan
<br>"Horse - from/off the horse"

Taşımak - taşımaktan
<br>"To carry - from/off carrying"

Ses - sesten
<br>"Sound/volume - from/off sound/volume"

In some situations simple ablative can have a "because of" meaning, in these situations ablative can be optionally followed by "dolayı" (because of) preposition.

Yüksek sesten (dolayı) rahatsız oldum. / "I was uneasy because of high volume. "

Adamic language

The Adamic language is, according to <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> tradition (as recorded in the "<a href="midrash">midrash</a>im") and some <a href="Christians">Christians</a>, the language spoken by <a href="Adam">Adam</a> (and possibly <a href="Eve">Eve</a>) in the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a>. It is variously interpreted as either the language used by <a href="God">God</a> to address Adam (the <a href="divine%20language">divine language</a>), or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things (including Eve), as in .

Traditional Jewish exegesis such as <a href="Midrash">Midrash</a> (<a href="Genesis%20Rabbah">Genesis Rabbah</a> 38) says that Adam spoke <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> because the names he gives Eve – ""Isha"" (<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Genesis">pageRank.Book of Genesis</a> 2:23) and ""Chava"" (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew. By contrast, <a href="Kabbalism">Kabbalism</a> assumed an "eternal Torah" which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew. Thus, <a href="Abulafia">Abulafia</a> in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in Paradise had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.

Eco (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of Adam was preserved by Adam's descendants until the <a href="confusion%20of%20tongues">confusion of tongues</a> (Genesis 11:1–9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).

<a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a> addresses the topic in his "<a href="De%20Vulgari%20Eloquentia">De Vulgari Eloquentia</a>". He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable. He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to Eve, addressing the serpent, and not to Adam.

In his "<a href="Divina%20Commedia">Divina Commedia</a>", however, Dante changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of Adam. This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes ("Paradiso" XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, "<a href="El%20%28god%29">El</a>", must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as "<a href="Close%20front%20unrounded%20vowel">I</a>".

Elizabethan scholar <a href="John%20Dee">John Dee</a> makes references to an <a href="occult">occult</a> or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of <a href="spirit%20medium">spirit medium</a> <a href="Edward%20Kelley">Edward Kelley</a>. Dee's journals did not describe the language as "<a href="Enochian">Enochian</a>", instead preferring "Angelical", the "Celestial Speech", the "Language of Angels", the "First Language of God-Christ", the "Holy Language", or "Adamical" because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to Dee's assertion that the <a href="Biblical%20Patriarch">Biblical Patriarch</a> <a href="Enoch%20%28ancestor%20of%20Noah%29">Enoch</a> had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

<a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a>, founder of the <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">Latter Day Saint movement</a>, in his <a href="Joseph%20Smith%20Translation%20of%20the%20Bible">revision of the Bible</a>, declared the Adamic language to have been "pure and undefiled". Some <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saints">Latter Day Saints</a> believe it to be the language of <a href="God">God</a>. <a href="Glossolalia">Glossolalia</a>, or speaking in tongues, was commonplace in the early years of the movement, and it was commonly believed that the incomprehensible language spoken during these incidents was the language of Adam though this belief seems to have never been formally or officially adopted.

Some other early Latter Day Saint leaders, including <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a>, <a href="Orson%20Pratt">Orson Pratt</a>, and <a href="Elizabeth%20Ann%20Whitney">Elizabeth Ann Whitney</a>, claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language by <a href="revelation%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">revelation</a>. Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language is the "pure language" spoken of by <a href="Zephaniah">Zephaniah</a> and that it will be restored as the universal language of humankind at the end of the world.

<a href="Apostle%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Apostle</a> <a href="Orson%20Pratt">Orson Pratt</a> declared that "Ahman", part of the name of the settlement "<a href="Adam-ondi-Ahman">Adam-ondi-Ahman</a>" in <a href="Daviess%20County%2C%20Missouri">Daviess County, Missouri</a>, was the name of God in the Adamic language. An 1832 handwritten page from the <a href="Joseph%20Smith%20Papers">Joseph Smith Papers</a>, titled "A Sample of the Pure Language", and reportedly dictated by Smith to "Br. Johnson", asserts that the name of God is "Awmen".

The Latter Day Saint <a href="Endowment%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">endowment</a> <a href="prayer%20circle">prayer circle</a> once included use of the words "Pay Lay Ale". These untranslated words are no longer used in <a href="Temple%20%28LDS%20Church%29">temple</a> <a href="Ordinance%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">ordinances</a> and have been replaced by an English version, "O God, hear the words of my mouth". Some believe that the "Pay Lay Ale" sentence is derived from the Hebrew phrase "pe le-El" (), "mouth to God".

Other words thought by some Latter Day Saints to derive from the Adamic language include "<a href="Deseret%20%28Book%20of%20Mormon%29">deseret</a>" ("honey bee"), see <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ether">Ether</a> <a href="http%3A//scriptures.lds.org/en/ether/2/3%233">2:3</a> and "Ahman" ("God") see <a href="Doctrine%20and%20Covenants">Doctrine and Covenants</a> <a href="http%3A//scriptures.lds.org/en/doctrineandcovenants/78/20%2320">78:20</a>

Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny

Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny () is a political-satirical <a href="opera">opera</a> composed by <a href="Kurt%20Weill">Kurt Weill</a> to a German <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>. It was first performed on 9 March <a href="1930%20in%20music%23Opera">1930</a> at the in Leipzig.

The libretto was mainly written in early 1927 and the music was finished in the spring of 1929, although both text and music were partly revised by the authors later. An early by-product, however, was the "<a href="Mahagonny-Songspiel">Mahagonny-Songspiel</a>", sometimes known as "Das kleine Mahagonny", a concert work for voices and small orchestra commissioned by the Deutsche Kammermusik Festival in <a href="Baden-Baden">Baden-Baden</a> and premiered there on 18 July 1927. The ten numbers, which include the "Alabama Song" and "Benares Song", were duly incorporated into the full opera. The opera had its premiere in Leipzig in March 1930 and played in Berlin in December of the following year. The opera was banned by the <a href="Nazism">Nazis</a> in 1933 and did not have a significant production until the 1960s.

Weill's score uses a number of styles, including <a href="ragtime">rag-time</a>, <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and formal <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>, notably in the "<a href="Alabama%20Song">Alabama Song</a>" (covered by multiple artists, notably <a href="Ute%20Lemper">Ute Lemper</a>, <a href="The%20Doors">The Doors</a> and <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>).

The lyrics for the "Alabama Song" and another song, the "Benares Song" are in English (albeit specifically <a href="Idiosyncrasy">idiosyncratic</a> English) and are performed in that language even when the opera is performed in its original (<a href="German%20language">German</a>) language. The name of the city itself is a mix between the English and German word for <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a>, "Mahagoni".

It has played in opera houses around the world. Never achieving the popularity of Weill and Brecht's "<a href="The%20Threepenny%20Opera">The Threepenny Opera</a>," "Mahagonny" is still considered a work of stature with a haunting score. Herbert Lindenberger in his book "Opera in History", for example, views "Mahagonny" alongside Schoenberg's "<a href="Moses%20und%20Aron">Moses und Aron</a>" as indicative of the two poles of modernist opera.

Following the Leipzig premiere, the opera was presented in Berlin in December 1931 at the <a href="Theater%20am%20Schiffbauerdamm">Theater am Schiffbauerdamm</a> conducted by <a href="Alexander%20von%20Zemlinsky">Alexander von Zemlinsky</a> with <a href="Lotte%20Lenya">Lotte Lenya</a> as Jenny, Trude Hesterberg as Begbick, and Harald Paulsen as Jimmy. Another production was presented in January 1934 in Copenhagen at the Det ny Teater. Other productions within Europe waited until the end of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, some notable ones being in January 1963 in London at <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Opera">Sadler's Wells Opera</a> conducted by <a href="Colin%20Davis">Colin Davis</a> and in Berlin in September 1977 by the <a href="Komische%20Oper%20Berlin">Komische Oper</a>.

It was not presented in the United States until 1970, when a short-lived April production at the Phyllis Anderson Theatre off Broadway starred <a href="Barbara%20Harris%20%28actress%29">Barbara Harris</a> as Jenny, <a href="Frank%20Porretta">Frank Porretta</a> as Jimmy, and <a href="Estelle%20Parsons">Estelle Parsons</a> as Begbick. It was then presented in Boston in 1973 under the direction of Sarah Caldwell.

A full version was presented at the <a href="Yale%20Repertory%20Theatre">Yale Repertory Theatre</a> in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1974, with <a href="Gilbert%20Price">Gilbert Price</a> as Jimmy and Stephanie Cotsirilos as Jenny. <a href="Kurt%20Kasznar">Kurt Kasznar</a> played Moses. The libretto was performed in an original translation by Michael Feingold; the production was directed by Alvin Epstein. In October 1978, Yale presented a "chamber version" adapted and directed by Keith Hack, with <a href="John%20Glover%20%28actor%29">John Glover</a> as Jimmy and <a href="June%20Gable">June Gable</a> as Begbick. <a href="Mark%20Lynn-Baker">Mark Lynn-Baker</a> played Fatty; <a href="Michael%20Gross%20%28actor%29">Michael Gross</a> was Trinity Moses. In November 1979, "Mahagonny" debuted at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> in a <a href="John%20Dexter">John Dexter</a> production conducted by <a href="James%20Levine">James Levine</a>. The cast included <a href="Teresa%20Stratas">Teresa Stratas</a> as Jenny, <a href="Astrid%20Varnay">Astrid Varnay</a> as Begbick, <a href="Richard%20Cassilly">Richard Cassilly</a> as Jimmy, <a href="Cornell%20MacNeil">Cornell MacNeil</a> as Moses, <a href="Ragnar%20Ulfung">Ragnar Ulfung</a> as Fatty and <a href="Paul%20Plishka">Paul Plishka</a> as Joe. The production was televised in 1979 and was released on DVD in 2010.

The <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Opera">Los Angeles Opera</a> presented the opera in September 1989 under conductor <a href="Kent%20Nagano">Kent Nagano</a> and with a <a href="Jonathan%20Miller">Jonathan Miller</a> production. Other notable productions in Europe from the 1980s included the March 1986 presentation by the <a href="Scottish%20Opera">Scottish Opera</a> in Glasgow; a June 1990 production in Florence by the <a href="Maggio%20Musicale%20Fiorentino">Maggio Musicale Fiorentino</a>. In October 1995 and 1997, the <a href="Paris%20Opera">Paris Opera</a> staged by <a href="Graham%20Vick">Graham Vick</a>, under the baton of <a href="Jeffrey%20Tate">Jeffrey Tate</a> starring <a href="Marie%20McLaughlin">Marie McLaughlin</a> as Jenny, <a href="Felicity%20Palmer">Felicity Palmer</a> (1995) and Kathryn Harries (1997) as Begbick, and Kim Begley (1995)/Peter Straka (1997) as Jimmy. 

The July 1998 <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a> production featured <a href="Catherine%20Malfitano">Catherine Malfitano</a> as Jenny, <a href="Gwyneth%20Jones%20%28soprano%29">Gwyneth Jones</a> as Begbick, and <a href="Jerry%20Hadley">Jerry Hadley</a> as Jimmy. The <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Vienna State Opera</a> added it to its repertoire in January 2012 in a production by <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Deschamps">Jérôme Deschamps</a> conducted by <a href="Ingo%20Metzmacher">Ingo Metzmacher</a> starring <a href="Christopher%20Ventris">Christopher Ventris</a> as Jimmy and <a href="Angelika%20Kirchschlager">Angelika Kirchschlager</a> as Jenny, notably casting young mezzo-soprano <a href="Elisabeth%20Kulman">Elisabeth Kulman</a> as Begbick, breaking the tradition of having a veteran soprano (like Varnay or Jones) or musical theater singer (like <a href="Patti%20LuPone">Patti LuPone</a>) perform the role.

Productions within the US have included those in November 1998 by the <a href="Lyric%20Opera%20of%20Chicago">Lyric Opera of Chicago</a> directed by <a href="David%20Alden">David Alden</a>. Catherine Malfitano repeated her role as Jenny, while <a href="Felicity%20Palmer">Felicity Palmer</a> sang Begbick, and Kim Begley sang the role of Jimmy.

In 2014 it was performed using an alternate libretto as a "wrestling opera" at the Oakland Metro by the performers of <a href="Hoodslam">Hoodslam</a>.

"Scene 1: A desolate no-man's land"

A truck breaks down. Three fugitives from justice get out and find themselves in the city of Mahagonny: Fatty the Bookkeeper, Trinity Moses, and Leocadia Begbick. Because the federal agents pursuing them will not search this far north, and they are in a good location to attract ships coming south from the Alaskan gold fields, Begbick decides that they can profit by staying where they are and founding a pleasure city, where men can have fun, because there is nothing else in the world to rely on.
"Scene 2"

The news of Mahagonny spreads quickly, and sharks from all over flock to the bait, including the whore Jenny Smith, who is seen, with six other girls, singing the "<a href="Alabama%20Song">Alabama Song</a>", in which she waves goodbye to her home and sets out in pursuit of whiskey, dollars and pretty boys.

"Scene 3"

In the big cities, where men lead boring, purposeless lives, Fatty and Moses spread the gospel of Mahagonny, city of gold, among the disillusioned.

"Scene 4"

Four Alaskan Lumberjacks who have shared hard times together in the timberlands and made their fortunes set off together for Mahagonny. Jimmy Mahoney and his three friends – Jacob Schmidt, Bank Account Billy, and Alaska Wolf Joe – sing of the pleasures awaiting them in "Off to Mahagonny", they look forward to the peace and pleasure they will find there.

"Scene 5"

The four friends arrive in Mahagonny, only to find other disappointed travelers already leaving. Begbick, well-informed about their personal tastes, marks down her prices, but for the penurious Billy they still seem too high. Jimmy impatiently calls for the girls of Mahagonny to show themselves, so he can make a choice. Begbick suggests Jenny as the right girl for Jack, who finds her rates too high. She pleads with Jack to reconsider ("Havana Song"), which arouses Jim's interest, and he chooses her. Jenny and the girls sing a tribute to "the Jimmys from Alaska."

"Scene 6"

Jimmy and Jenny get to know one another as she asks him to define the terms of their contact: Does he wish her to wear her hair up or down, to wear fancy underwear or none at all? "What is your wish?" asks Jim, but Jenny evades answering.

"Scene 7"

Begbick, Fatty and Moses meet to discuss the pleasure city's financial crisis: People are leaving in droves, and the price of whiskey is sinking rapidly. Begbick suggests going back to civilization, but Fatty reminds her that the federal agents have been inquiring for her in nearby Pensacola. Money would solve everything, declares Begbick, and she decides to soak the four new arrivals for all they've got.

"Scene 8"

Jimmy, restless, attempts to leave Mahagonny, because he misses the wife he left in Alaska.

"Scene 9"

In front of the Rich Man's Hotel, Jimmy and the others sit lazily as a pianist plays <a href="Tekla%20B%C4%85darzewska-Baranowska">Tekla Bądarzewska</a>'s "A Maiden's Prayer". With growing anger, Jimmy sings of how his hard work and suffering in Alaska have led only to this. Drawing a knife, he shouts for Begbick, while his friends try to disarm him and the other men call to have him thrown out. Calm again, he tells Begbick that Mahagonny can never make people happy: it has too much peace and quiet.

"Scene 10"

As if in answer to Jimmy's complaint, the city is threatened by a typhoon. Everyone sings in horror of the destruction awaiting them.

"Scene 11"

Tensely, people watch for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, if not for the pleasure of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.

"Scene 12"

Magically, the hurricane bypasses Mahagonny, and the people sing in awe of their miraculous rescue. This confirms Begbick's belief in the philosophy of "Do what you want," and she proceeds to put it into effect.
"Scene 13 At the renovated "Do It" tavern."

The men sing of the four pleasures of life: Eating, Lovemaking, Fighting and Drinking. First comes eating: To kitschy cafe music, Jimmy's friend Jacob gorges until he keels over and dies. The men sing a chorale over his body, saluting "a man without fear".

"Scene 14: Loving."

While Begbick collects money and issues tips on behavior, Moses placates the impatient men queuing to make love to Jenny and the other whores. The men sing the "Mandalay Song", warning that love does not last forever, and urging those ahead of them to make it snappy.

"Scene 15: Fighting."

The men flock to see a boxing match between Trinity Moses and Jim's friend Alaska Wolf Joe. While most of the men, including the ever-cautious Billy, bet on the burly Moses, Jim, out of friendship, bets heavily on Joe. The match is manifestly unfair; Moses not only wins but kills Joe in knocking him out.

"Scene 16: Drinking."

In an effort to shake off the gloom of Joe's death, Jimmy invites everyone to have a drink on him. The men sing "Life in Mahagonny", describing how one could live in the city for only five dollars a day, but those who wanted to have fun always needed more. Jim, increasingly drunk, dreams of sailing back to Alaska. He takes down a curtain rod for a mast and climbs on the pool table, pretending it is a ship; Jenny and Billy play along. Jimmy is abruptly sobered up when Begbick demands payment for the whiskey as well as for the damage to her property. Totally broke, he turns in a panic to Jenny, who explains her refusal to help him out in the song "Make your own bed" – an adaptation of the ideas he proclaimed at the end of act 1. Jim is led off in chains as the chorus, singing another stanza of "Life in Mahagonny", returns to its pastimes. Trinity Moses assures the crowd that Jimmy will pay for his crimes with his life.

"Scene 17"

At night, Jim alone and chained to a lamppost, sings a plea for the sun not to rise on the day of his impending trial.

"Scene 18: In the courtroom"

Moses, like a carnival barker, sells tickets to the trials. He serves as prosecutor, Fatty as defense attorney, Begbick as judge. First comes the case of Toby Higgins, accused of premeditated murder for the purpose of testing an old revolver. Fatty invites the injured party to rise, but no one does so, since the dead do not speak. Toby bribes all three, and as a result, Begbick dismisses the case. Next Jimmy's case is called. Chained, he is led in by Billy, from whom he tries to borrow money; Billy of course refuses, despite Jim's plea to remember their time together in Alaska. In virtually the same speech he used to attack Higgins, Moses excoriates him for not paying his bills, for seducing Jenny (who presents herself as a plaintiff) to commit a "carnal act" with him for money, and for inciting the crowd with "an illegal joyous song" on the night of the typhoon. Billy, with the chorus's support, counters that, in committing the latter act, Jimmy discovered the laws by which Mahagonny lives. Moses argues that Jim hastened his friend Joe's death in a prizefight by betting on him, and Billy counters by asking who actually killed Joe. Moses does not reply. But there is no answer for the main count against him. Jim gets short sentences for his lesser crimes, but for having no money, he is sentenced to death. Begbick, Fatty and Moses, rising to identify themselves as the injured parties, proclaim "in the whole human race / there is no greater criminal / than a man without money". As Jim is led off to await execution, everyone sings the "Benares Song", in which they long for that exotic city "where the sun is shining." But Benares has been destroyed by an earthquake. "Where shall we go?" they ask.

"Scene 19: At the gallows"

Jim says a tender goodbye to Jenny, who, dressed in white, declares herself his widow. He surrenders her to Billy, his last remaining companion from Alaska. When he tries to delay the execution by reminding the people of Mahagonny that God exists, they play out for him, under Moses' direction, the story of "God in Mahagonny", in which the Almighty condemns the town and is overthrown by its citizens, who declare that they can not be sent to Hell because they are already in Hell. Jim, chastened, asks only for a glass of water, but is refused even this as Moses gives the signal for the trap to be sprung.

"Scene 20"

A caption advises that, after Jim's death, increasing hostility among the city's various factions has caused the destruction of Mahagonny. To a potpourri of themes from earlier in the opera, groups of protesters are seen on the march, in conflict with one another, while the city burns in the background. Jenny and the whores carry Jim's clothing and accessories like sacred relics; Billy and several men carry his coffin. In a new theme, they and the others declare, "Nothing you can do will help a dead man". Begbick, Fatty and Moses appear with placards of their own, joining the entire company in its march and declaring "Nothing will help him or us or you now," as the opera ends in chaos.




To an extent, "Mahagonny" is an opera that satirizes operas. Brecht said that "[i]t attacks the society that needs operas of such a sort" and Weill said that it "pays conscious tribute to the irrationality of the operatic form". Both thought operas had become too full of ritual and bereft of substance, and "Mahagonny" in part sought to deflate the pompous arrogance of traditional opera. With this aim, many traditional operatic themes are subverted and made grotesque; love becomes a commodity, the "<a href="deus%20ex%20machina">deus ex machina</a>" tells everyone to go to hell, the law is run by criminals, etc. A traditional opera theme is true love, but in Mahagonny the closest such thing is the love between Jimmy and the prostitute Jenny. Furthermore, when given the choice to pay off Jimmy's debt and save his life, she tearfully regrets that while she loves him and will miss him dearly, she cannot part with her money. This commodification of love is brought to a grotesque apex after the hurricane spares Mahagonny; the residents now feel free to do what they want, and naturally they want to love. Consequently, in act 2 scene 3, the largely male population take turns having sex with the prostitutes. In contrast to the supposed theme of love, the scene portrays a perverse form of love; the prostitutes are carted around like giant slabs of meat and the "love" is regimented by the queue of men each waiting impatiently for his own turn. The "Mandalay Song" also heightens the ongoing tension. At no point is the music entirely tonal, and while the tune is seemingly jazzy and carefree, the tonalities betray an uneasiness about the whole business. In "Mahagonny", operatic love is mutated from a grand aspiration to a mere commodity.

Another trope of operas is the "<a href="deus%20ex%20machina">deus ex machina</a>", in which the protagonist is saved at the last minute by divine intervention. This is a useful technique to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In "Mahagonny", though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a "deus ex machina"; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems just in time for the end of the opera, but "Mahagonny"'s god does not. He does not even acknowledge that Jimmy is tied up and ready to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.

Mahagonny as a city was also intended to be a parable of <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a> stripped of its veneer of bourgeois respectability, as it "arose to meet the needs and desires of the people, and it was these same needs and desires that brought about its destruction". Ultimately, this was also intended as a commentary on the state of Weimar Germany; underneath that facade of prosperity and happiness, lay corruption and savagery. Under Brecht's (and to some extent Weill's) Marxist-influenced view of capitalism, it is created to provide people the goods and services they need, but it does so at the expense of reducing everything to a mere commodity. Furthermore, since obtaining wealth in capitalism is a cutthroat enterprise, the powerful are no better than a gang of bandits, and the law in turn is run by such thugs.

The city of Mahagonny embodies many of these characteristics. Mahagonny was originally created to provide people with useful services; the gold prospectors wanted a relaxation spot, and the three criminals needed to stay there. However, this led to the commodification of everything the tourists desired, especially love. In the end, nobody could buy true happiness; Alaska Wolf Joe and Jacob Schmidt died, the city is burning down, and Jimmy declared before his death that "[t]he happiness I bought was no happiness". His death was also ordered by the court of law, which was run by the three criminals. To make matters even more farcical, they let a murderer bribe his way to freedom while Jimmy is sentenced to death for petty crimes. The parallels between the events of "Mahagonny" and the Marxist view of capitalism are clear.

To make the comparison more obvious, the opera is set in a pseudo-Wild West America, with Mahagonny itself placed somewhere far from the rest of civilization. America was the land of unbridled capitalism, the frontier just as much so. The only difference is that bourgeois civility and civilization has yet to occupy the frontier, and thus there is no hiding the nature of capitalism beneath the facade of gentlemanly conduct. In "Mahagonny", the characters are prostitutes, lumberjacks, criminals, and the like. Not one of them comes from the moneyed class, and yet the same system of exploitation was set up, but in a more naked manner. Instead of seducing a woman's love with power and influence, the residents of Mahagonny pay for a prostitute. But in "Mahagonny", poverty is not just a condition the poor bring upon themselves, but a crime to be punished. Thus, Brecht and Weill tried to display capitalism as the meatgrinder they believed it to be.

Though Kurt Weill was not a vocal proponent of the "<a href="Gebrauchsmusik">Gebrauchsmusik</a>" movement in Germany, many of his works, including the music for "Mahagonny", share many of its characteristics. Loosely defined, "Gebrauchsmusik" is the idea that music can be more than just pure music. For example, music that accompanies a silent film is perfectly respectable, so long as it is done well. Also, simple music to be performed by amateurs is also acceptable. Weill's musical setting of "Mahagonny" exemplifies many of these characteristics. In the first place, this is music composed for the stage and not for the concert hall, and Weill intentionally chose that so. He wished to make his music speak out to as many people as possible, so throughout his career his mostly wrote music for the stage, and all the while in Europe he was considered a real composer and not just some hack pandering to the playwright to make a living.

For example, in act 1, scene 2, the scenario is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; just a simple solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The music is not some baroque contrapuntal scheme, nor is it a Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music is very easy to listen to. This music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, it is not surprising that the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.

Elsewhere Weill uses other such non-classical instruments as the accordion, and he uses other popular influences, including those of his native Germany. The most enduring feature of "Gebrauchsmusik" in "Mahagonny", however, are the tunes. This reflects Weill's greatest desire to create simple music that would go straight to the heart of the audience. Many of the songs in "Mahagonny" are very simple and accessible. The "<a href="Alabama%20Song">Alabama Song</a>", for example, can be picked up absentmindedly and hummed. And while it seems carefree, something seems wrong with it, despite or perhaps because of its simplicity.

Since Mahagonny was co-produced by Brecht, there is a prominent display of the "<a href="Verfremdungseffekt">Verfremdungseffekt</a>", often translated as the "alienation effect". Brecht and Weill wished to replace the old dramatic theater and its emphasis on emotions with <a href="epic%20theatre">epic theatre</a> and its emphasis on reason. In the case of Brecht, it was more as a didactic tool for communist philosophy, but for Weill, it was more of a social scheme, a way to get people involved and thinking. The general scheme was to shake up people's preconceived notions and make them think about what is happening on stage, or to emotionally distance the audience from the action thus making logical evaluation of the play's events easier. Brecht and Weill used different methods to achieve this effect.

One of the most noticeable methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions at the beginning of most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on what is going on in the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.

Weill also contributed greatly to the "Verfremdungseffekt" by his music. Often the music would intentionally be unsuited for the onstage action, preventing the audience from getting carried away by the onstage emotion. For example, in act 2, scene 13, the hurricane has spared Mahagonny, and the people feel free to do whatever makes them happy. For Jacob Schmidt, this means eating a lot. He sings of how he has not had his fill yet with such lines as "Not enough by half! / I may eat myself for supper." And yet, the music betrays the seeming unbridled ecstasy of Jacob; he is singing to a discordant melody, and the accordion accompaniment sounds stark and rather macabre. The intention is that the audience realizes that all this is very wrong; Jacob claims to be having a great time, but the music suggests all may not be well, thus the audience needs to pay attention and think about what is really going on. To further this point, Jacob then dies and the chorus sings of how happy he was while dragging out his corpse. This last twist of welcoming death is unexpected and contributes to the alienation.

Another example of "Verfremdungseffekt" in the music is in the "Alabama Song". This time, instead of the music sounding deeply disturbing compared to the stage action, it is the reverse. When the "Alabama Song" first appears, the women are going to Mahagonny. The second time the song appears is near the end of the opera, after Jimmy has been executed. Mahagonny is in decline, and there are street protests. The entire stage is singing about how rotten the world and man are, when all of a sudden Jenny and the prostitutes come walking through singing the "Alabama Song", a total departure from the previous mood. What is more, they are carrying Jimmy's corpse through the stage. The music refuses to set and keep the audience in a particular mood, and the conflict between the lighthearted "Alabama Song" and the imagery of the funeral procession is confusing. This tension serves to distance the audience from the action, even at an exceptionally powerful moment of the opera, giving the audience one last chance to digest all the contradictions and perversions of Mahagonny.

The 2005 movie "<a href="Manderlay">Manderlay</a>", directed by <a href="Lars%20von%20Trier">Lars von Trier</a>, contains several references to the plot of "Mahagonny". The most notable of these is the threat of a hurricane approaching the city during the first act. Von Trier's earlier movie "<a href="Dogville">Dogville</a>", to which Manderlay is a sequel, was for a large part based on a song from Brecht's "Threepenny Opera" ("Pirate Jenny"). In the brothel scene in act 2 of "Mahagonny", the choir sings a "Song von Mandelay". The play "Happy End" (1929) by <a href="Elisabeth%20Hauptmann">Elisabeth Hauptmann</a>, Brecht and Weill, also contains a song called "Der Song von Mandelay", which uses the same refrain as in the brothel scene of "Mahagonny". Brecht's use of the name Mandelay/Mandalay was inspired by <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s poem "<a href="Mandalay%20%28poem%29">Mandalay</a>".

Avery Hopwood

James Avery Hopwood (May 28, 1882 – July 1, 1928) was an American playwright of the <a href="Jazz%20Age">Jazz Age</a>. He had four plays running simultaneously on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in 1920.

Hopwood was born to James and Jule Hopwood on May 28, 1882, in <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>. He graduated from Cleveland's <a href="West%20High%20School%20%28Cleveland%29">West High School</a> in 1900. In 1901, he began attending the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> in <a href="Ann%20Arbor">Ann Arbor</a>. However, his family experienced financial difficulties, so for his sophomore year he transferred to <a href="Adelbert%20College">Adelbert College</a>. He returned to the University of Michigan in the fall of 1903, and graduated <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a> in 1905.

Hopwood started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, "Clothes" (1906), produced on Broadway. He became known as "The Playboy Playwright" and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqué at the time. One play, "<a href="The%20Demi-Virgin">The Demi-Virgin</a>" in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, "Stripping Cupid", where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie. The case was dismissed.

His many plays included "Nobody's Widow" (1910), starring Blanche Bates; "<a href="Fair%20and%20Warmer">Fair and Warmer</a>" (1915), starring Madge Kennedy (filmed in 1919); "<a href="The%20Gold%20Diggers%20%28play%29">The Gold Diggers</a>" (1919), starring Ina Claire (filmed in 1923 as "<a href="The%20Gold%20Diggers%20%281923%20film%29">The Gold Diggers</a>", in 1928 as "<a href="Gold%20Diggers%20of%20Broadway">Gold Diggers of Broadway</a>" and also as "<a href="Gold%20Diggers%20of%201933">Gold Diggers of 1933</a>"); "<a href="Ladies%27%20Night%20%28play%29">Ladies' Night</a>", 1920, starring <a href="Charlie%20Ruggles">Charlie Ruggles</a> (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play "<a href="The%20Bat%20%28play%29">The Bat</a>" (with <a href="Mary%20Roberts%20Rinehart">Mary Roberts Rinehart</a>), 1920 (filmed in 1926 as "<a href="The%20Bat%20%281926%20film%29">The Bat</a>", in 1930 as "<a href="The%20Bat%20Whispers">The Bat Whispers</a>," and in 1959 as "<a href="The%20Bat%20%281959%20film%29">The Bat</a>"); "<a href="Getting%20Gertie%27s%20Garter%20%28play%29">Getting Gertie's Garter</a>" (with <a href="Wilson%20Collison">Wilson Collison</a>), 1921, starring <a href="Hazel%20Dawn">Hazel Dawn</a> (filmed in 1927 and 1945); "<a href="The%20Demi-Virgin">The Demi-Virgin</a>", 1921, also starring Dawn; "The Alarm Clock", 1923; "The Best People" (with David Gray), 1924 (filmed in <a href="The%20Best%20People">1925</a> and as "<a href="Fast%20and%20Loose%20%281930%20film%29">Fast and Loose</a>" in 1930), the song-farce "Naughty Cinderella", 1925, starring <a href="Irene%20Bordoni">Irene Bordoni</a> and "The Garden of Eden" in 1927 (filmed in 1928 as "<a href="The%20Garden%20of%20Eden%20%281928%20film%29">The Garden of Eden</a>").

Hopwood was asked to write the third act of Mary Roberts Rinehart's play "The Bat". Hopwood collaborated with Rinehart to then work on the last act of the play in Sewickley and sometimes in New York.

The early sound film "The Bat Whispers" played an influence on Bob Kane's <a href="Batman">Batman</a> because the inspiration for Batman's costume came from the "mysterious Bat" character portrayed in the movie from 1930.

In 1906, Hopwood was introduced to writer and photographer <a href="Carl%20Van%20Vechten">Carl Van Vechten</a>. The two became close friends and were sometimes sexual partners. In the 1920s Hopwood had a tumultuous and abusive romantic relationship with fellow Cleveland-born playwright John Floyd. Although Hopwood announced to the press in 1924 that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer <a href="Rosa%20Rolanda">Rosa Rolanda</a>, Van Vechten confirmed in later years that it was a publicity stunt. Rolanda would later marry caricaturist <a href="Miguel%20Covarrubias">Miguel Covarrubias</a>.

On July 1, 1928, while swimming at <a href="Juan-les-Pins">Juan-les-Pins</a> on the French Riviera, Hopwood had a heart attack and died. He was buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland. His mother, Jule Hopwood, inherited a large trust from him, but he had not made arrangements for the disposition of other items, including literary rights. While she was working through the legal issues with his estate, Jule Hopwood fell ill and died on March 1, 1929. She was buried next to her son.

Hopwood's plays were very successful commercially, but did not have the lasting literary significance he hoped to achieve.

The terms of Hopwood's will left a substantial portion of his estate to his alma mater, the University of Michigan for the establishment of the <a href="Hopwood%20Award">Avery Hopwood and Jule Hopwood Creative Writing Awards</a>. The bequest stipulated: "It is especially desired that students competing for prizes shall be allowed the widest possible latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall be especially encouraged." Famous Hopwood award winners include <a href="Robert%20Hayden">Robert Hayden</a>, <a href="Marge%20Piercy">Marge Piercy</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a>, <a href="Betty%20Smith">Betty Smith</a>, <a href="Lawrence%20Kasdan">Lawrence Kasdan</a>, <a href="John%20Ciardi">John Ciardi</a>, <a href="Mary%20Gaitskill">Mary Gaitskill</a>, <a href="Edmund%20White">Edmund White</a>, <a href="Nancy%20Willard">Nancy Willard</a>, <a href="Frank%20O%E2%80%99Hara">Frank O’Hara</a>, and <a href="Steve%20Hamilton%20%28author%29">Steve Hamilton</a>.

Throughout his life, Hopwood worked on a novel that he hoped would "expose" the strictures the commercial theater machine imposed on playwrights, but the manuscript was never published. Jack Sharrar recovered the manuscript for this novel in 1982 during his research for "Avery Hopwood, His Life and Plays". The novel was published in July 2011 as "The Great Bordello".

Antipope Felix II

Antipope Felix II, an <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> of Rome, was installed as Pope in 355 AD after the <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Emperor</a> <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a> banished the reigning Pope, <a href="Pope%20Liberius">Liberius</a>, for refusing to subscribe to a sentence of condemnation against <a href="Athanasius">Saint Athanasius</a>.

In May 357 AD the Roman laity, which had remained faithful to Liberius, demanded that Constantius, who was on a visit to Rome, should recall Liberius. The Emperor planned to have Felix and Liberius rule jointly, but when Liberius returned Felix was forced to retire to Porto, near Rome, where, after making an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself again in Rome, he died on 22 November 365 AD.

This Felix was later confused with a Roman martyr named Felix, with the result that he was included in lists of the Popes as Felix II and that the succeeding Popes of the same name (<a href="Pope%20Felix%20III">Pope Felix III</a> and <a href="Pope%20Felix%20IV">Pope Felix IV</a>) were given wrong numerals, as was <a href="Antipope%20Felix%20V">Antipope Felix V</a>.

The <a href="Catholic%20Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a> (1909) called this confusion a "distortion of the true facts" and suggested that it arose because the "Liber Pontificalis", which at this point may be registering a reliable tradition, says that this Felix built a church on the <a href="Via%20Aurelia">Via Aurelia</a>, which is where the Roman martyr of an earlier date was buried. However, a more recent source says that of the martyr Felix nothing is known except his name, that he was a martyr, and that he was buried in the cemetery on the <a href="Via%20Portuensis">Via Portuensis</a> that bears his name.

The Catholic Encyclopedia remarked that "the real story of the antipope was lost and he obtained in local Roman history the status of a saint and a confessor. As such he appears in the Roman Martyrology on 29 July." At that time (1909) the Roman Martyrology had the following text: This entry was based on what the Catholic Encyclopedia called later legends that confound the relative positions of Felix and Liberius. More recent editions of the Roman Martyrology have instead: 

The <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> of the Roman martyr Felix is 29 July. The antipope Felix died, as stated above, on a 22 November, and his death was not a martyr's, occurring when the <a href="Peace%20of%20the%20Church">Peace of Constantine</a> had been in force for half a century.

As well as the Roman Martyrology, the <a href="Roman%20Missal">Roman Missal</a> identified the Saint Felix of 29 July with the antipope. This identification, still found in the 1920 typical edition, does not appear in the 1962 typical edition. To judge by the Marietti printing of 1952, which omits the numeral "II" and the word "Papae", the correction had already been made by then. One Catholic writer excuses this by saying that the antipope "himself did refuse to accept Arianism, and so his feast has been kept in the past on [29 July]".

This group also includes some related compounds with neutral and even weakly <a href="acid">acid</a>ic properties. Some synthetic compounds of similar structure are also termed alkaloids. In addition to <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, alkaloids may also contain <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and, more rarely, other elements such as <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, <a href="bromine">bromine</a>, and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>.

Alkaloids are produced by a large variety of organisms including <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="fungus">fungi</a>, <a href="plant">plant</a>s, and <a href="animal">animal</a>s. They can be purified from crude extracts of these organisms by <a href="acid-base%20extraction">acid-base extraction</a>. Alkaloids have a wide range of <a href="pharmacology">pharmacological</a> activities including <a href="antimalarial%20medication">antimalarial</a> ("e.g." <a href="quinine">quinine</a>), <a href="asthma">antiasthma</a> ("e.g." <a href="ephedrine">ephedrine</a>), <a href="chemotherapy">anticancer</a> ("e.g." <a href="omacetaxine%20mepesuccinate">homoharringtonine</a>), <a href="cholinomimetic">cholinomimetic</a> ("e.g." <a href="galantamine">galantamine</a>), <a href="vasodilation">vasodilatory</a> ("e.g." <a href="vincamine">vincamine</a>), <a href="Antiarrhythmic%20agent">antiarrhythmic</a> ("e.g." <a href="quinidine">quinidine</a>), <a href="analgesic">analgesic</a> ("e.g." <a href="morphine">morphine</a>), <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> ("e.g." <a href="chelerythrine">chelerythrine</a>), and <a href="anti-diabetic">antihyperglycemic</a> activities ("e.g." <a href="piperine">piperine</a>). Many have found use in <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional</a> or <a href="Pharmaceutical%20drug">modern medicine</a>, or as starting points for <a href="drug%20discovery">drug discovery</a>. Other alkaloids possess <a href="psychoactive%20drug">psychotropic</a> ("e.g." <a href="psilocin">psilocin</a>) and <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a> activities ("e.g." <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>, <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a>, <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a>, <a href="theobromine">theobromine</a>), and have been used in <a href="entheogenic">entheogenic</a> rituals or as <a href="recreational%20drug">recreational drug</a>s. Alkaloids can be <a href="toxicity">toxic</a> too ("e.g." <a href="atropine">atropine</a>, <a href="tubocurarine">tubocurarine</a>). Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly evoke a <a href="Bitter%20%28taste%29%23Bitterness">bitter taste</a>.

The boundary between alkaloids and other nitrogen-containing natural compounds is not clear-cut. Compounds like <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s, <a href="protein">protein</a>s, <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s, <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>, <a href="amine">amine</a>s, and <a href="antibiotics">antibiotics</a> are usually not called alkaloids. Natural compounds containing nitrogen in the <a href="Alicyclic%20compound">exocyclic</a> position (<a href="mescaline">mescaline</a>, <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>, <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a>, etc.) are usually classified as <a href="amine">amine</a>s rather than as alkaloids. Some authors, however, consider alkaloids a special case of amines.

The name "alkaloids" () was introduced in 1819 by the German chemist , and is derived from late Latin root ' (which, in turn, comes from the Arabic "al-qalwī" – "ashes of plants") and the suffix ' – "like". However, the term came into wide use only after the publication of a review article by Oscar Jacobsen in the chemical dictionary of <a href="Albert%20Ladenburg">Albert Ladenburg</a> in the 1880s.

There is no unique method of naming alkaloids. Many individual names are formed by adding the suffix "ine" to the species or genus name. For example, <a href="atropine">atropine</a> is isolated from the plant "<a href="Atropa%20belladonna">Atropa belladonna</a>", <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a> is obtained from the seed of <a href="Strychnine%20tree">Strychnine tree</a> ("Strychnos nux-vomica" L.). If several alkaloids are extracted from one plant then their names often contain suffixes "idine", "anine", "aline", "inine" etc. There are also at least 86 alkaloids whose names contain the root "vin" because they are extracted from "<a href="vinca">vinca</a>" plants such as "Vinca rosea" ("<a href="Catharanthus%20roseus">Catharanthus roseus</a>"); these are called <a href="vinca%20alkaloid">"vinca" alkaloids</a>.

Alkaloid-containing plants have been used by humans since ancient times for therapeutic and recreational purposes. For example, medicinal plants have been known in the <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> at least around 2000 BC. The "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" of <a href="Homer">Homer</a> referred to a gift given to Helen by the Egyptian queen, a drug bringing oblivion. It is believed that the gift was an opium-containing drug. A Chinese book on houseplants written in 1st–3rd centuries BC mentioned a medical use of <a href="Ephedra">Ephedra</a> and <a href="Opium%20poppy">opium poppies</a>. Also, <a href="coca">coca</a> leaves have been used by <a href="South%20America">South America</a>n Indians since ancient times.

<a href="Extracts">Extracts</a> from plants containing toxic alkaloids, such as <a href="aconitine">aconitine</a> and <a href="tubocurarine">tubocurarine</a>, were used since antiquity for poisoning arrows.

Studies of alkaloids began in the 19th century. In 1804, the German chemist <a href="Friedrich%20Sert%C3%BCrner">Friedrich Sertürner</a> isolated from opium a "soporific principle" (), which he called "morphium" in honor of <a href="Morpheus%20%28mythology%29">Morpheus</a>, the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> god of dreams; in German and some other Central-European languages, this is still the name of the drug. The term "morphine", used in English and French, was given by the French physicist <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Gay-Lussac">Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac</a>.

A significant contribution to the chemistry of alkaloids in the early years of its development was made by the French researchers <a href="Pierre%20Joseph%20Pelletier">Pierre Joseph Pelletier</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Bienaim%C3%A9%20Caventou">Joseph Bienaimé Caventou</a>, who discovered <a href="quinine">quinine</a> (1820) and <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a> (1818). Several other alkaloids were discovered around that time, including <a href="xanthine">xanthine</a> (1817), <a href="atropine">atropine</a> (1819), <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a> (1820), <a href="coniine">coniine</a> (1827), <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a> (1828), <a href="colchicine">colchicine</a> (1833), <a href="sparteine">sparteine</a> (1851), and <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> (1860).

The first complete synthesis of an alkaloid was achieved in 1886 by the German chemist <a href="Albert%20Ladenburg">Albert Ladenburg</a>. He produced <a href="coniine">coniine</a> by reacting 2-methylpyridine with <a href="acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a> and reducing the resulting 2-propenyl pyridine with <a href="sodium">sodium</a>. The development of the chemistry of alkaloids was accelerated by the emergence of <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> and <a href="Chromatography">chromatographic</a> methods in the 20th century, so that by 2008 more than 12,000 alkaloids had been identified.

Compared with most other classes of natural compounds, alkaloids are characterized by a great structural diversity and there is no uniform classification of alkaloids. First classification methods have historically combined alkaloids by the common natural source, "e.g.", a certain type of plants. This classification was justified by the lack of knowledge about the chemical structure of alkaloids and is now considered obsolete.

More recent classifications are based on similarity of the carbon skeleton ("e.g.", <a href="indole">indole</a>-, <a href="isoquinoline">isoquinoline</a>-, and <a href="pyridine">pyridine</a>-like) or biochemical precursor (<a href="ornithine">ornithine</a>, <a href="lysine">lysine</a>, <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a>, <a href="tryptophan">tryptophan</a>, etc.). However, they require compromises in borderline cases; for example, <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a> contains a pyridine fragment from <a href="nicotinamide">nicotinamide</a> and <a href="pyrrolidine">pyrrolidine</a> part from ornithine and therefore can be assigned to both classes.

Alkaloids are often divided into the following major groups:


Some alkaloids do not have the carbon skeleton characteristic of their group. So, <a href="galantamine">galantamine</a> and homoaporphines do not contain <a href="isoquinoline">isoquinoline</a> fragment, but are, in general, attributed to isoquinoline alkaloids.

Main classes of monomeric alkaloids are listed in the table below:

Most alkaloids contain oxygen in their molecular structure; those compounds are usually colorless crystals at ambient conditions. Oxygen-free alkaloids, such as <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a> or <a href="coniine">coniine</a>, are typically volatile, colorless, oily liquids. Some alkaloids are colored, like <a href="berberine">berberine</a> (yellow) and <a href="sanguinarine">sanguinarine</a> (orange).

Most alkaloids are weak bases, but some, such as <a href="theobromine">theobromine</a> and <a href="theophylline">theophylline</a>, are <a href="amphoteric">amphoteric</a>. Many alkaloids dissolve poorly in water but readily dissolve in <a href="organic%20solvent">organic solvent</a>s, such as <a href="diethyl%20ether">diethyl ether</a>, <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a> or <a href="1%2C2-dichloroethane">1,2-dichloroethane</a>. <a href="Caffeine">Caffeine</a>, <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>, <a href="codeine">codeine</a> and <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a> are slightly soluble in water (with a solubility of ≥1g/L), whereas others, including <a href="morphine">morphine</a> and <a href="yohimbine">yohimbine</a> are very slightly water-soluble (0.1–1 g/L). Alkaloids and acids form salts of various strengths. These salts are usually freely soluble in water and <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> and poorly soluble in most organic solvents. Exceptions include <a href="Hyoscine%20hydrobromide">scopolamine</a> hydrobromide, which is soluble in organic solvents, and the water-soluble quinine sulfate.

Most alkaloids have a bitter taste or are poisonous when ingested. Alkaloid production in plants appeared to have evolved in response to feeding by herbivorous animals; however, some animals have evolved the ability to detoxify alkaloids. Some alkaloids can produce developmental defects in the offspring of animals that consume but cannot detoxify the alkaloids. One example is the alkaloid <a href="cyclopamine">cyclopamine</a>, produced in the leaves of <a href="Veratrum%20californicum">corn lily</a>. During the 1950s, up to 25% of lambs born by sheep that had grazed on corn lily had serious facial deformations. These ranged from deformed jaws to <a href="cyclopia">cyclopia</a> (see picture). After decades of research, in the 1980s, the compound responsible for these deformities was identified as the alkaloid 11-deoxyjervine, later renamed to cyclopamine.

Alkaloids are <a href="anabolism">generated</a> by various living organisms, especially by <a href="Vascular%20plant">higher plants</a> – about 10 to 25% of those contain alkaloids. Therefore, in the past the term "alkaloid" was associated with plants.

The alkaloids content in plants is usually within a few percent and is inhomogeneous over the plant tissues. Depending on the type of plants, the maximum concentration is observed in the leaves (<a href="black%20henbane">black henbane</a>), <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s or <a href="seed">seed</a>s (<a href="Strychnine%20tree">Strychnine tree</a>), root ("<a href="Rauwolfia%20serpentina">Rauwolfia serpentina</a>") or bark (<a href="cinchona">cinchona</a>). Furthermore, different tissues of the same plants may contain different alkaloids.

Beside plants, alkaloids are found in certain types of <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, such as <a href="psilocybin">psilocybin</a> in the fungus of the genus "<a href="Psilocybe">Psilocybe</a>", and in animals, such as <a href="bufotenin">bufotenin</a> in the skin of some toads. Many marine organisms also contain alkaloids. Some <a href="amines">amines</a>, such as <a href="adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>, which play an important role in higher animals, are similar to alkaloids in their structure and biosynthesis and are sometimes called alkaloids.

Because of the structural diversity of alkaloids, there is no single method of their extraction from natural raw materials. Most methods exploit the property of most alkaloids to be soluble in organic solvents but not in water, and the opposite tendency of their salts.

Most plants contain several alkaloids. Their mixture is extracted first and then individual alkaloids are separated. Plants are thoroughly ground before extraction. Most alkaloids are present in the raw plants in the form of salts of organic acids. The extracted alkaloids may remain salts or change into bases. Base extraction is achieved by processing the raw material with alkaline solutions and extracting the alkaloid bases with organic solvents, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, diethyl ether or benzene. Then, the impurities are dissolved by weak acids; this converts alkaloid bases into salts that are washed away with water. If necessary, an aqueous solution of alkaloid salts is again made alkaline and treated with an organic solvent. The process is repeated until the desired purity is achieved.

In the acidic extraction, the raw plant material is processed by a weak acidic solution ("e.g.", <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> in water, ethanol, or methanol). A base is then added to convert alkaloids to basic forms that are extracted with organic solvent (if the extraction was performed with alcohol, it is removed first, and the remainder is dissolved in water). The solution is purified as described above.

Alkaloids are separated from their mixture using their different solubility in certain solvents and different reactivity with certain reagents or by <a href="distillation">distillation</a>.

Biological precursors of most alkaloids are <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, such as <a href="ornithine">ornithine</a>, <a href="lysine">lysine</a>, <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a>, <a href="tryptophan">tryptophan</a>, <a href="histidine">histidine</a>, <a href="aspartic%20acid">aspartic acid</a>, and <a href="anthranilic%20acid">anthranilic acid</a>. <a href="Nicotinic%20acid">Nicotinic acid</a> can be synthesized from tryptophan or aspartic acid. Ways of alkaloid biosynthesis are too numerous and cannot be easily classified. However, there are a few typical reactions involved in the biosynthesis of various classes of alkaloids, including synthesis of <a href="Schiff%20bases">Schiff bases</a> and <a href="Mannich%20reaction">Mannich reaction</a>.

Schiff bases can be obtained by reacting amines with ketones or aldehydes. These reactions are a common method of producing C=N bonds.

In the biosynthesis of alkaloids, such reactions may take place within a molecule, such as in the synthesis of piperidine:

An integral component of the Mannich reaction, in addition to an amine and a <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> compound, is a <a href="carbanion">carbanion</a>, which plays the role of the nucleophile in the <a href="nucleophilic%20addition">nucleophilic addition</a> to the ion formed by the reaction of the amine and the carbonyl.

The Mannich reaction can proceed both intermolecularly and intramolecularly:

In addition to the described above monomeric alkaloids, there are also <a href="Dimer%20%28chemistry%29">dimer</a>ic, and even <a href="trimer%20%28chemistry%29">trimer</a>ic and <a href="tetramer">tetramer</a>ic alkaloids formed upon condensation of two, three, and four monomeric alkaloids. Dimeric alkaloids are usually formed from monomers of the same type through the following mechanisms:

There are also dimeric alkaloids formed from two distinct monomers, such as the "vinca" alkaloids <a href="vinblastine">vinblastine</a> and vincristine, which are formed from the coupling of <a href="catharanthine">catharanthine</a> and <a href="vindoline">vindoline</a>. The newer <a href="semisynthesis">semi-synthetic</a> chemotherapeutic agent <a href="vinorelbine">vinorelbine</a> is used in the treatment of <a href="non-small-cell%20lung%20cancer">non-small-cell lung cancer</a>. It is another derivative dimer of vindoline and catharanthine and is synthesised from <a href="anhydrovinblastine">anhydrovinblastine</a>, starting either from <a href="leurosine">leurosine</a> or the monomers themselves.

The role of alkaloids for living organisms that produce them is still unclear. It was initially assumed that the alkaloids are the final products of <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> in plants, as <a href="urea">urea</a> in mammals. It was later shown that alkaloid concentrations varies over time, and this hypothesis was refuted.

Most of the known functions of alkaloids are related to protection. For example, <a href="aporphine">aporphine</a> alkaloid <a href="liriodenine">liriodenine</a> produced by the <a href="Liriodendron%20tulipifera">tulip tree</a> protects it from parasitic mushrooms. In addition, the presence of alkaloids in the plant prevents insects and <a href="chordate">chordate</a> animals from eating it. However, some animals are adapted to alkaloids and even use them in their own metabolism. Such alkaloid-related substances as <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>, <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a> and <a href="histamine">histamine</a> are important <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a>s in animals. Alkaloids are also known to regulate plant growth. Another example of an organism that uses alkaloids for protection is the "<a href="Utetheisa%20ornatrix">Utetheisa ornatrix</a>", more commonly known as the ornate moth. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids render these larvae and adult moths unpalatable to many of their natural enemies like coccinelid beetles, green lacewings, insectivorous hemiptera and insectivorous bats.

Medical use of alkaloid-containing plants has a long history, and, thus, when the first alkaloids were isolated in the 19th century, they immediately found application in clinical practice. Many alkaloids are still used in medicine, usually in the form of salts, including the following:

Many synthetic and semisynthetic drugs are structural modifications of the alkaloids, which were designed to enhance or change the primary effect of the drug and reduce unwanted side-effects. For example, <a href="naloxone">naloxone</a>, an <a href="opioid%20receptor">opioid receptor</a> <a href="receptor%20antagonist">antagonist</a>, is a derivative of <a href="thebaine">thebaine</a> that is present in <a href="opium">opium</a>.

Prior to the development of a wide range of relatively low-toxic synthetic <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, some alkaloids, such as salts of nicotine and <a href="anabasine">anabasine</a>, were used as <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s. Their use was limited by their high toxicity to humans.

Preparations of plants containing alkaloids and their extracts, and later pure alkaloids, have long been used as <a href="Psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive substances</a>. <a href="Cocaine">Cocaine</a>, <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a>, and <a href="cathinone">cathinone</a> are <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a>s of the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>. <a href="Mescaline">Mescaline</a> and many of indole alkaloids (such as <a href="psilocybin">psilocybin</a>, <a href="dimethyltryptamine">dimethyltryptamine</a> and <a href="ibogaine">ibogaine</a>) have <a href="hallucinogen">hallucinogen</a>ic effect. <a href="Morphine">Morphine</a> and <a href="codeine">codeine</a> are strong narcotic pain killers.

There are alkaloids that do not have strong psychoactive effect themselves, but are <a href="precursor%20%28chemistry%29">precursor</a>s for semi-synthetic psychoactive drugs. For example, <a href="ephedrine">ephedrine</a> and <a href="pseudoephedrine">pseudoephedrine</a> are used to produce <a href="methcathinone">methcathinone</a> and <a href="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a>. <a href="Thebaine">Thebaine</a> is used in the synthesis of many painkillers such as <a href="oxycodone">oxycodone</a>.

Adventism

Adventism is a minor branch of <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> which was started by <a href="William%20Miller%20%28preacher%29">William Miller</a> during the <a href="Second%20Great%20Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

The name refers to belief in the imminent <a href="Second%20Coming%20of%20Christ">Second Coming (or "Second Advent") of Jesus Christ</a>. <a href="William%20Miller%20%28preacher%29">William Miller</a> started the Adventist movement in the 1830s. His followers became known as <a href="Millerism">Millerites</a>.

Although the Adventist churches hold much in common, their <a href="Christian%20theology">theologies</a> differ on whether the <a href="intermediate%20state">intermediate state</a> is <a href="Soul%20sleep">unconscious sleep</a> or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is <a href="annihilationism">annihilation</a> or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of refers to the one in <a href="heavenly%20sanctuary">heaven</a> or one on earth. The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the <a href="Sabbath%20in%20Seventh-day%20Adventism">Sabbath</a>. The <a href="General%20Conference%20of%20Seventh-day%20Adventists">General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists</a> has compiled that church's core beliefs in <a href="the%2028%20Fundamental%20Beliefs">the 28 Fundamental Beliefs</a> (1980 and 2005), which use Biblical references as justification.

In 2010, Adventism claimed some 22 million believers scattered in various independent churches. The largest church within the movement—the <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>—is one of the largest Christian churches in the world, with more than 18 million baptized members.

Adventism began as an inter-denominational movement. Its most vocal leader was William Miller. Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported Miller's predictions of Christ's return. After the "<a href="Great%20Disappointment">Great Disappointment</a>" of October 22, 1844, many people in the movement gave up on Adventism. Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent (<a href="second%20coming">second coming</a> of Jesus).

Of those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that Jesus had come not literally but "spiritually", and consequently were known as "spiritualizers". A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted. This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today.

The Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement. Following this meeting, the "Millerites" then became known as "Adventists" or "Second Adventists". However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points. Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the <a href="Advent%20Christian%20Church">Advent Christian Church</a>, and the <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>.

The largest group was organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church. Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death. They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies. It has diminished to almost non-existence today. Their main publication was the "Advent Herald", of which <a href="Sylvester%20Bliss">Sylvester Bliss</a> was the editor until his death in 1863. It was later called the "Messiah's Herald".

The Life and Advent Union was founded by <a href="George%20Storrs">George Storrs</a> in 1863. He had established "The Bible Examiner" in 1842. It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964.

The <a href="Advent%20Christian%20Church">Advent Christian Church</a> officially formed in 1861 grew rapidly at first. It declined a little during the 20th century. The Advent Christians publish the four magazines "The Advent Christian Witness", "Advent Christian News", "Advent Christian Missions" and "Maranatha". They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a one-year Bible College in Lenox, Massachusetts, called Berkshire Institute for Christian Studies. The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.

The <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> officially formed in 1863. It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship. It published the "Adventist Review, Kids Review, and Sabbath Herald". It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.

Miller did not join any of the movements, and he spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.

The "Handbook of Denominations in the United States", 12th edn., describes the following churches as "Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches":

The Christadelphians were founded in 1844 by John Thomas and had an estimated 25,000 members in 170 ecclesias, or churches, in 2000 in America.

The Advent Christian Church was founded in 1860 and had 25,277 members in 302 churches in 2002 in America. It is a "first-day" body of Adventist Christians founded on the teachings of William Miller. It adopted the "conditional immortality" views of Charles F. Hudson and <a href="George%20Storrs">George Storrs</a> who formed the "Advent Christian Association" in <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem, Massachusetts</a>, in 1860.

The Primitive Advent Christian Church is a small group which separated from the Advent Christian Church. It differs from the parent body mainly on two points. Its members observe foot washing as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized). This is sometimes referred to as rebaptism.

The Seventh-day Adventist Church, founded in 1863, had over 19,500,000 baptized members (not counting children of members) worldwide as of June 2016. It is best known for its teaching that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the <a href="Sabbath%20in%20Seventh-day%20Adventism">Sabbath</a> and is the appropriate day for worship. However, it is the second coming of Jesus Christ along with the Judgement day, based on the three angels message in Revelation 14:6–13, that is the main doctrine of SDA.

The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members from the <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> caused by disagreement over military service on the Sabbath day during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

The Davidians (originally named Shepherd's Rod) is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members made up primarily of voluntarily disfellowshipped members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They were originally known as the Shepherd's Rod and are still sometimes referred to as such. The group derives its name from two books on Bible doctrine written by its founder, <a href="Victor%20Houteff">Victor Houteff</a>, in 1929.

The <a href="Branch%20Davidian">Branch Davidian</a>s were a split ("branch") from the Davidians. Many of them were killed during the infamous <a href="Waco%20Siege">Waco Siege</a> of April 1993.

The Church of God (Seventh-Day) was founded in 1863 and it had an estimated 11,000 members in 185 churches in 1999 in America. Its founding members separated in 1858 from those Adventists associated with <a href="Ellen%20G.%20White">Ellen G. White</a> who later organized themselves as Seventh-day Adventists in 1863. The Church of God (Seventh Day) split in 1933, creating two bodies: one headquartered in Salem, West Virginia, and known as the <a href="Church%20of%20God%20%287th%20day%29%20%E2%80%93%20Salem%20Conference">Church of God (7th day) – Salem Conference</a> and the other one headquartered in Denver, Colorado and known as the <a href="General%20Conference%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20God%20%28Seventh-Day%29">General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day)</a>. The <a href="Worldwide%20Church%20of%20God">Worldwide Church of God</a> splintered from this.

The Church of God and Saints of Christ was founded in 1896 and had an estimated 40,000 members in approximately 200 congregations in 1999 in America.

Many denominations known as "<a href="Church%20of%20God%20%28disambiguation%29">Church of God</a>" have Adventist origins.
The Church of God General Conference was founded in 1921 and had 7,634 members in 162 churches in 2004 in America. It is an Adventist Christian body which is also known as the "Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith" and the "Church of God General Conference (Morrow, GA)".

<a href="Creation%20Seventh%20Day%20Adventist%20Church">Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church</a>

The United Seventh-Day Brethren is a small Sabbatarian Adventist body.
In 1947, several individuals and two independent congregations within the Church of God Adventist movement formed the "United Seventh-Day Brethren", seeking to increase fellowship and to combine their efforts in evangelism, publications, and other .


The <a href="Bible%20Student%20movement">Bible Students movement</a> founded by <a href="Charles%20Taze%20Russell">Charles Taze Russell</a> had in its early development close connections with the Millerite movement and stalwarts of the Adventist faith, including George Storrs and <a href="Joseph%20Seiss">Joseph Seiss</a>. The various groupings of independent Bible Students has currently have a cumulative membership about less than 20,000 worldwide. Although both <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> and Bible Students do not categorize themselves as part of the Millerite Adventist movement (or other denominations, in general), some theologians do categorize the group and schisms as Millerite Adventist because of its teachings regarding an imminent Second Coming and use of specific dates. As of January 2014 there are approximately 8 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.

Archbishop of Canterbury

The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior <a href="bishop">bishop</a> and principal leader of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, the symbolic head of the worldwide <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> and the <a href="diocesan%20bishop">diocesan bishop</a> of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Canterbury">Diocese of Canterbury</a>. The current archbishop is <a href="Justin%20Welby">Justin Welby</a>. His enthronement took place at <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> on 21 March 2013. Welby is the <a href="list%20of%20Archbishops%20of%20Canterbury">105th in a line</a> which goes back more than 1400 years to <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a>, the "Apostle to the English", sent from <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in the year 597. Welby succeeded <a href="Rowan%20Williams">Rowan Williams</a>.

From the time of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">St Augustine of Canterbury</a> in the 6th century, until Archbishop Reginald Pole in the 16th century, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in <a href="full%20communion">full communion</a> with the <a href="See%20of%20Rome">See of Rome</a> and they usually received the <a href="pallium">pallium</a>. During the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, based upon King <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a>'s divorce from <a href="Catherine%20of%20Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>, the Church of England broke away from the authority of the <a href="Pope">Pope</a> and the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>.

In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other <a href="bishop">bishop</a>s. At various times the choice was made by the <a href="canons%20of%20Canterbury%20Cathedral">canons of Canterbury Cathedral</a>, the Pope, or the <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a>. Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has been more explicitly a <a href="state%20church">state church</a> and the choice is legally that of <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>; today it is made by the <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen</a> on the advice of the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, who receives a shortlist of two names from an "ad hoc" committee called the <a href="Appointment%20of%20Church%20of%20England%20bishops">Crown Nominations Commission</a>.

Today the archbishop fills four main roles:


In the last two of these functions, he has an important <a href="ecumenical">ecumenical</a> and <a href="interfaith">interfaith</a> role, speaking on behalf of Anglicans in England and worldwide.

The archbishop's main residence is <a href="Lambeth%20Palace">Lambeth Palace</a> in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Lambeth">London Borough of Lambeth</a>. He also has lodgings in the Old Palace, <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, located beside <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>, where the <a href="Chair%20of%20St%20Augustine">Chair of St Augustine</a> sits.

As holder of one of the "five great sees" (the others being <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">York</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">London</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Durham</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Winchester</a>), the Archbishop of Canterbury is "ex officio" one of the <a href="Lords%20Spiritual">Lords Spiritual</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. He is one of the highest-ranking men in England and the highest ranking non-royal in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20order%20of%20precedence">United Kingdom's order of precedence</a>.

Since <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> broke with <a href="Catholic%20Church">Rome</a>, the Archbishops of Canterbury have been selected by the English (British since the Act of Union in 1707) monarch. Today the choice is made in the name of the monarch by the prime minister, from a shortlist of two selected by an ad-hoc committee called the <a href="Crown%20Nominations%20Commission">Crown Nominations Commission</a>. Since the 20th century, the appointment of Archbishops of Canterbury conventionally alternates between more moderate <a href="Anglo-Catholics">Anglo-Catholics</a> and <a href="Evangelicals">Evangelicals</a>.

The current archbishop, Justin Welby, the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury, was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 4 February 2013. As archbishop he signs himself as "+ Justin Cantuar". His predecessor, Rowan Williams, 104th Archbishop of Canterbury, was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 27 February 2003. Immediately prior to his appointment to Canterbury, Williams was the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Monmouth">Bishop of Monmouth</a> and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Wales">Archbishop of Wales</a>. On 18 March 2012, Williams announced he would be stepping down as Archbishop of Canterbury at the end of 2012 to become <a href="Master%20%28college%29">Master</a> of <a href="Magdalene%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Magdalene College, Cambridge</a>.

In addition to his office, the archbishop also holds a number of other positions; for example, he is Joint President of the <a href="Council%20of%20Christians%20and%20Jews">Council of Christians and Jews</a> in the United Kingdom. Some positions he formally holds "<a href="ex%20officio">ex officio</a>" and others virtually so (the incumbent of the day, although appointed personally, is appointed because of his office). Amongst these are:




The Archbishop of Canterbury is also a president of <a href="Churches%20Together%20in%20England">Churches Together in England</a> (an <a href="ecumenical">ecumenical</a> organisation). <a href="Geoffrey%20Fisher">Geoffrey Fisher</a>, 99th Archbishop of Canterbury, was the first since 1397 to visit Rome, where he held private talks with <a href="Pope%20John%20XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a> in 1960. In 2005, Rowan Williams became the first Archbishop of Canterbury to attend a papal funeral since the Reformation. He also attended the inauguration of <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>. The 101st archbishop, <a href="Donald%20Coggan">Donald Coggan</a>, was the first to attend a papal inauguration, that of <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> in 1978.

Since 2002, the Archbishop of Canterbury has co-sponsored the Alexandria Middle East Peace process with the Grand Mufti of Egypt. In July 2008, the archbishop attended a conference of Christians, Jews and Muslims convened by the King of Saudi Arabia at which the notion of the "clash of civilizations" was rejected. Delegates agreed "on international guidelines for dialogue among the followers of religions and cultures." Delegates said that "the deepening of moral values and ethical principles, which are common denominators among such followers, would help strengthen stability and achieve prosperity for all humans."

It has been suggested that the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> province of <a href="Roman%20Britain">Britannia</a> had four archbishops, seated at <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="York">York</a>, <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a> and <a href="Cirencester">Cirencester</a>. However, in the 5th and 6th centuries Britannia began to be overrun by <a href="paganism">pagan</a>, <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic peoples</a> who came to be known collectively as the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>. Of the kingdoms they created, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a> arguably had the closest links with European politics, trade and culture, because it was conveniently situated for communication with <a href="continental%20Europe">continental Europe</a>. In the late 6th century, King <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht of Kent</a> married a Christian <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> princess named <a href="Bertha%20of%20Kent">Bertha</a>, possibly before becoming king, and certainly a number of years before the arrival of the first Christian mission to England. He permitted the preaching of Christianity.

The first Archbishop of Canterbury was <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">St Augustine</a> (not to be confused with <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">St Augustine of Hippo</a>), who arrived in Kent in 597 AD, having been sent by <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Pope Gregory I</a> on a mission to the English. He was accepted by King Æthelbert, on his conversion to Christianity, about the year 598. It seems that Pope Gregory, ignorant of recent developments in the former Roman province, including the spread of the <a href="Pelagianism">Pelagian heresy</a>, had intended the new archiepiscopal sees for England to be established in London and York. In the event, Canterbury was chosen instead of London, owing to political circumstances. Since then the Archbishops of Canterbury have been referred to as occupying the <a href="Chair%20of%20St.%20Augustine">Chair of St. Augustine</a>.

A Gospel pageRank.Book believed to be directly associated with St Augustine's mission survives in the <a href="Parker%20Library%2C%20Corpus%20Christi%20College">Parker Library, Corpus Christi College</a>, <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a>, England. Catalogued as Cambridge "Manuscript 286", it has been positively dated to 6th century Italy and this bound book, the <a href="St%20Augustine%20Gospels">St Augustine Gospels</a>, is still used during the swearing-in ceremony of new archbishops of Canterbury.

Before the break with papal authority in the 16th century, the Church of England was an integral part of the Western European church. Since the break the Church of England, an established national church, still considers itself part of the broader Western Catholic tradition (although this is not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church which regards Anglicanism as schismatic and does not accept Anglican holy orders as valid) as well as being the "mother church" of the worldwide Anglican Communion.

The Archbishop of Canterbury exercises metropolitical (or supervisory) jurisdiction over the <a href="Province%20of%20Canterbury">Province of Canterbury</a>, which encompasses thirty of the forty-four dioceses of the Church of England, with the rest falling within the <a href="Province%20of%20York">Province of York</a>. The four dioceses of Wales were formerly also under the Province of Canterbury until 1920 when they were transferred from the <a href="established%20church">established Church</a> of England to the <a href="Disestablishment%20of%20the%20Church%20in%20Wales">disestablished</a> <a href="Church%20in%20Wales">Church in Wales</a>.
The Archbishop of Canterbury has a ceremonial provincial "curia", or court, consisting of some of the senior bishops of his province. The <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>—the most senior cleric of the church with the exception of the two archbishops—serves as Canterbury's provincial <a href="Dean%20%28Church%29">dean</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> as <a href="Chancellor%20%28ecclesiastical%29">chancellor</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a> as vice-chancellor, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a> as <a href="precentor">precentor</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a> as <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a> and the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a> as <a href="crucifer">cross-bearer</a>.

Along with <a href="Primacy%20of%20Canterbury">primacy over the Archbishop of York</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury also has a precedence of honour over the other bishops of the Anglican Communion. He is recognised as "primus inter pares", or first amongst equals. He does not, however, exercise any direct authority in the provinces outside England, except in certain minor roles dictated by Canon in those provinces (for example, he is the judge in the event of an ecclesiastical prosecution against the Archbishop of Wales). He does hold <a href="Metropolitan%20bishop">metropolitical</a> authority over several <a href="extra-provincial%20Anglican%20churches">extra-provincial Anglican churches</a>, and he serves as "ex officio" <a href="Bishop%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Bishop of the Falkland Islands</a>.

At present the archbishop has three <a href="suffragan">suffragan</a> bishops:


The <a href="Bishop%20of%20Maidstone">Bishop of Maidstone</a> was previously a second "actual" suffragan bishop working in the diocese, until it was decided at the diocesan synod of November 2010 that a new bishop will not be appointed.

The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York are both styled as "The Most Reverend"; retired archbishops are styled as "The Right Reverend". Archbishops are, by convention, appointed to the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> and may, therefore, also use the style of "<a href="The%20Right%20Honourable">The Right Honourable</a>" for life (unless they are later removed from the council). In formal documents, the Archbishop of Canterbury is referred to as "The Most Reverend Father in God, <a href="Given%20name">Forenames</a>, by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and Metropolitan". In debates in the House of Lords, the archbishop is referred to as "The Most Reverend Primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury". "The Right Honourable" is not used in either instance. He may also be formally addressed as "Your Grace"—or, more often these days, simply as "Archbishop", or "Father".

The surname of the Archbishop of Canterbury is not always used in formal documents; often only the first name and see are mentioned. The archbishop is legally entitled to sign his name as "Cantuar" (from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for Canterbury). The right to use a title as a legal signature is only permitted to bishops, <a href="Peers%20of%20the%20Realm">Peers of the Realm</a> and peers by courtesy. The current Archbishop of Canterbury usually signs as ""+Justin Cantuar:"".

In the <a href="Order%20of%20Precedence%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">English and Welsh order of precedence</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury is ranked above all individuals in the realm, with the exception of the <a href="Sovereign">Sovereign</a> and members of the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">Royal Family</a>. Immediately below him is the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> and then the Archbishop of York.

The Archbishop of Canterbury awards academic degrees, commonly called "<a href="Lambeth%20degree">Lambeth degree</a>s".

The Archbishop of Canterbury's official residence in London is <a href="Lambeth%20Palace">Lambeth Palace</a>.
He also has a residence, named <a href="Old%20Palace%2C%20Canterbury">The Old Palace</a>, next to <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> on the site of the medieval Archbishop's Palace.
The archbishops had palaces on the periphery of London and on the route between London and Canterbury.

Former palaces of the archbishops include

Since 1900, the following have served as Archbishop of Canterbury:

Albion is a city in <a href="Calhoun%20County%2C%20Michigan">Calhoun County</a> in the south central region of the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula</a> of the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The population was 8,616 at the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 census</a> and is part of the <a href="Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Battle Creek</a> <a href="United%20States%20metropolitan%20area">Metropolitan Statistical Area</a>. From the time that the earliest English-speaking settlers arrived, the area has also been known as "The Forks", because it is situated at the confluence of the north and south branches of the <a href="Kalamazoo%20River">Kalamazoo River</a>. The "Festival of the Forks" has been held annually since 1967 to celebrate Albion's ethnic heritage.

The presence of several major manufacturers since the 19th century has given Albion the reputation of a factory town. This has changed with the closure of several manufacturers, and Albion's culture is changing to that of a college town with a strong interest in technology and sustainability issues. <a href="Albion%20College">Albion College</a> is a private liberal arts college with a student population of about 1,750. Albion is a <a href="sister%20city">sister city</a> with <a href="Noisy-le-Roi">Noisy-le-Roi</a>, France.

The first European-American settler, Tenney Peabody, arrived in 1833 along with his brother-in-law Charles Blanchard, and a young man named Clark Dowling. Peabody's family followed soon after. In 1835, the Albion Company, a land development company formed by <a href="Jesse%20Crowell">Jesse Crowell</a>, <a href="plat">plat</a>ted a village and Peabody's wife was asked to name the settlement. She considered the name "Peabodyville", but "Albion" was selected instead, after the former residence of Jesse Crowell. Crowell became the first postmaster in 1838. Albion incorporated as a village in 1855 and as a city in 1885.

In 1835, <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist Episcopal</a> settlers established <a href="Albion%20College">Albion College</a>, which was known by a few other names before 1861 when the college was fully authorized to confer four-year degrees on both men and women. The first classes were held in Albion in 1843.

The forks of the Kalamazoo River provided power for <a href="Watermill">mills</a>, and Albion quickly became a mill town as well as an agricultural market. A railroad line arrived in 1852, fostering the development of other industries.

In 1973 Albion was named an <a href="All-America%20City%20Award">All-America City</a> by the <a href="National%20Civic%20League">National Civic League</a>. It celebrated winning the award on May 15, 1974 when the Governor of Michigan, <a href="William%20Milliken">William Milliken</a>, and many dignitaries came to town. However, in 1975 the closure of a major factory cut the celebration short and new challenges were created overnight.

Since that time citizens have mobilized, with support from the Albion Community Foundation founded in 1968, and the Albion Volunteer Service Organization, founded in the 1980s with support from Albion College, to address the challenge of diminishing economic opportunity.

<a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Key to the City Honor</a> Bestowed:


Albion has a <a href="Council-manager%20government">Council-Manager</a> form of government. City residents elect a Mayor and City Council members from six districts. The council in turn selects a City Manager to handle day-to-day affairs of the city. The mayor presides over and is a voting member of the council. Council members are elected to four-year terms, staggered every two years. A mayor is elected every two years. The city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents.

<doc id="2348" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2348" title="Anointing of the Sick">
Anointing of the Sick

Anointing of the sick, known also by other names, is a form of religious <a href="anointing">anointing</a> or "unction" (an older term with the same meaning) for the benefit of a sick person. It is practiced by many <a href="Christian%20church">Christian church</a>es and <a href="Christian%20denomination">denominations</a>.

Anointing of the sick was a customary practice in many civilizations, including among the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a> and early <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> communities. The use of oil for healing purposes is referred to in the writings of <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a>.

Anointing of the sick should be distinguished from other religious anointings that occur in relation to other <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s, in particular <a href="baptism">baptism</a>, <a href="confirmation">confirmation</a> and <a href="ordination">ordination</a>, and also in the <a href="coronation">coronation</a> of a <a href="monarch">monarch</a>.

Since 1972, the Roman Catholic Church uses the name "Anointing of the Sick" both in the English translations issued by the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a> of its official documents in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and in the English official documents of <a href="Episcopal%20conference">Episcopal conference</a>s. It does not, of course, forbid the use of other names, for example the more archaic term "Unction of the Sick" or the term "Extreme Unction". Cardinal <a href="Walter%20Kasper">Walter Kasper</a> used the latter term in his intervention at the 2005 <a href="Assembly%20of%20the%20Synod%20of%20Bishops">Assembly of the Synod of Bishops</a>. However, the Church declared that "'Extreme unction' ... may also "and more fittingly" be called 'anointing of the sick'" (emphasis added), and has itself adopted the latter term, while not outlawing the former. This is to emphasize that the sacrament is available, and recommended, to all those suffering from any serious illness, and to dispel the common misconception that it is exclusively for those at or very near the point of death.

Extreme Unction was the usual name for the sacrament in the West from the late twelfth century until 1972, and was thus used at the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a> and in the 1913 <a href="Catholic%20Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a>. <a href="Peter%20Lombard">Peter Lombard</a> (died 1160) is the first writer known to have used the term, which did not become the usual name in the West till towards the end of the twelfth century, and never became current in the East. The word "extreme" (final) indicated either that it was the last of the sacramental unctions (after the anointings at Baptism, Confirmation and, if received, Holy Orders) or because at that time it was normally administered only when a patient was "in extremis".

Other names used in the West include the unction or blessing of consecrated oil, the unction of God, and the office of the unction. Among some <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> bodies, who do not consider it a sacrament, but instead as a practice suggested rather than commanded by Scripture, it is called anointing with oil.

In the Greek Church the sacrament is called Euchelaion (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> Εὐχέλαιον, from εὐχή, "prayer", and ἔλαιον, "oil"). Other names are also used, such as ἅγιον ἔλαιον (holy oil), ἡγιασμένον ἔλαιον (consecrated oil), and χρῖσις or χρῖσμα (anointing).

The <a href="Community%20of%20Christ">Community of Christ</a> uses the term administration to the sick.

The term "<a href="last%20rites">last rites</a>" refers to administration to a dying person not only of this sacrament but also of <a href="Sacrament%20of%20Penance%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Penance</a> and <a href="Eucharist">Holy Communion</a>, the last of which, when administered in such circumstances, is known as "<a href="Viaticum">Viaticum</a>", a word whose original meaning in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> was "provision for the journey". The normal order of administration is: first Penance (if the dying person is physically unable to <a href="Confession%20%28religion%29">confess</a>, absolution, conditional on the existence of contrition, is given); next, Anointing; finally, Viaticum (if the person can receive it).

The chief <a href="Bible">Biblical</a> text concerning the rite is : "Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven." (RSV)

, and are also quoted in this regard.

The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> and <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Coptic</a> and <a href="Old%20Catholic%20Church">Old Catholic</a> Churches consider this anointing to be a sacrament. Other Christians too, in particular <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>s, Lutherans and some <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> and other Christian communities use a rite of anointing the sick, without necessarily classifying it as a sacrament.

In the Churches mentioned here by name, the oil used (called "oil of the sick" in both West and East) is blessed specifically for this purpose.

An extensive account of the teaching of the Catholic Church on Anointing of the Sick is given in <a href="http%3A//www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt2art5.shtml">"Catechism of the Catholic Church", 1499–1532.</a>

Anointing of the Sick is one of the seven <a href="Sacraments%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Sacraments</a> recognized by the Catholic Church, and is associated with not only bodily healing but also forgiveness of sins. Only <a href="Holy%20Orders%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">ordained priests</a> can administer it, and "any priest may carry the holy oil with him, so that in a case of necessity he can administer the sacrament of anointing of the sick."

The Catholic Church sees the effects of the sacrament as follows. As the sacrament of Marriage gives grace for the married state, the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness. Through the sacrament a gift of the Holy Spirit is given, that renews confidence and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement, despair and anguish at the thought of death and the struggle of death; it prevents from losing Christian hope in God's justice, truth and salvation.

The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has as its effects:

The duly blessed oil used in the sacrament is, as laid down in the Apostolic Constitution <a href="http%3A//www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19721130_sacram-unctionem_en.html">Sacram unctionem infirmorum</a>, pressed from olives or from other plants. It is blessed by the bishop of the diocese at the <a href="Chrism">Chrism</a> Mass he celebrates on <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Holy Thursday</a> or on a day close to it. If oil blessed by the bishop is not available, the priest administering the sacrament may bless the oil, but only within the framework of the celebration.

The <a href="Roman%20Rite">Roman Rite</a> Anointing of the Sick, as revised in 1972, puts greater stress than in the immediately preceding centuries on the sacrament's aspect of healing, and points to the place sickness holds in the normal life of Christians and its part in the redemptive work of the Church. Canon law permits its administration to any Catholic who has reached the <a href="use%20of%20reason">use of reason</a> and is beginning to be put in danger by illness or old age, unless the person in question obstinately persists in a manifestly grave sin. "If there is any doubt as to whether the sick person has reached the use of reason, or is dangerously ill, or is dead, this sacrament is to be administered". There is an obligation to administer it to the sick who, when they were in possession of their faculties, at least implicitly asked for it. A new illness or a renewal or worsening of the first illness enables a person to receive the sacrament a further time.

The ritual book on pastoral care of the sick provides three rites: anointing outside Mass, anointing within Mass, and anointing in a hospital or institution. The rite of anointing outside Mass begins with a greeting by the priest, followed by sprinkling of all present with holy water, if deemed desirable, and a short instruction. There follows a penitential act, as at the beginning of Mass. If the sick person wishes to receive the sacrament of penance, it is preferable that the priest make himself available for this during a previous visit; but if the sick person must confess during the celebration of the sacrament of anointing, this confession replaces the penitential rite A passage of Scripture is read, and the priest may give a brief explanation of the reading, a short litany is said, and the priest lays his hands on the head of the sick person and then says a prayer of thanksgiving over the already blessed oil or, if necessary, blesses the oil himself.

The actual anointing of the sick person is done on the forehead, with the prayer "Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit", and on the hands, with the prayer "May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up". To each prayer the sick person, if able, responds: "Amen." It is permitted, in accordance with local culture and traditions and the condition of the sick person, to anoint other parts of the body in addition, such as the area of pain or injury, but without repeating the sacramental form. In case of emergency, a single anointing, not necessarily on the forehead, is sufficient.

From the early <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> until after the Second Vatican Council the sacrament was administered, within the <a href="Latin%20Church">Latin Church</a>, only when <a href="death">death</a> was approaching and, in practice, bodily recovery was not ordinarily looked for, giving rise, as mentioned above to the name "Extreme Unction" (i.e. final anointing). The form used in the Roman Rite included anointing of seven parts of the body while saying (in Latin): "Through this holy unction and His own most tender mercy may the Lord pardon thee whatever sins or faults thou hast committed [quidquid deliquisti] by sight [by hearing, smell, taste, touch, walking, carnal delectation]", the last phrase corresponding to the part of the body that was touched; however, in the words of the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, "the unction of the loins is generally, if not universally, omitted in English-speaking countries, and it is of course everywhere forbidden in case of women". Use of this form is still permitted under the conditions mentioned in article 9 of the 2007 <a href="motu%20proprio">motu proprio</a> "<a href="Summorum%20Pontificum">Summorum Pontificum</a>".

Liturgical rites of the Catholic Church, both Western and Eastern, other than the Roman, have a variety of other forms for celebrating the sacrament.

The teaching of the Eastern Orthodox Church on the Holy Mystery (sacrament) of Unction is similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church. However, the reception of the Mystery is not limited to those who are enduring physical illness. The Mystery is given for healing (both physical and spiritual) and for the forgiveness of sin. For this reason, it is normally required that one go to confession before receiving Unction. Because it is a Sacred Mystery of the Church, only Orthodox Christians may receive it.

The solemn form of Eastern Christian anointing requires the ministry of seven priests. A table is prepared, upon which is set a vessel containing <a href="wheat">wheat</a>. Into the wheat has been placed an empty shrine-lamp, seven candles, and seven anointing brushes. Candles are distributed for all to hold during the service. The rite begins with reading <a href="Psalm%2051">Psalm 50</a> (the great penitential psalm), followed by the chanting of a special <a href="Canon%20%28hymnography%29">canon</a>. After this, the senior priest (or bishop) pours pure olive oil and a small amount of wine into the shrine lamp, and says the "Prayer of the Oil", which calls upon God to "...sanctify this Oil, that it may be effectual for those who shall be anointed therewith, unto healing, and unto relief from every passion, every malady of the flesh and of the spirit, and every ill..." Then follow seven series of <a href="epistle">epistle</a>s, <a href="gospel">gospel</a>s, long prayers, <a href="Ektenia">Ektenia</a>s (litanies) and anointings. Each series is served by one of the seven priests in turn. The afflicted one is anointed with the <a href="sign%20of%20the%20cross">sign of the cross</a> on seven places: the forehead, the nostrils, the cheeks, the lips, the breast, the palms of both hands, and the back of the hands. After the last anointing, the <a href="Gospel%20Book">Gospel pageRank.Book</a> is opened and placed with the writing down upon the head of the one who was anointed, and the senior priest reads the "Prayer of the Gospel". At the end, the anointed kisses the Gospel, the Cross and the right hands of the priests, receiving their blessing.

Anointing is considered to be a public rather than a private sacrament, and so as many of the faithful who are able are encouraged to attend. It should be celebrated in the church when possible, but if this is impossible, it may be served in the home or hospital room of the afflicted.

Unction in the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox Church</a> and Churches of Hellenic custom (<a href="Antiochian%20Eastern-Orthodox">Antiochian Eastern-Orthodox</a>, <a href="Melkite">Melkite</a>, etc.) is usually given with a minimum of ceremony.

Anointing may also be given during <a href="Clean%20Monday">Forgiveness Vespers</a> and <a href="Holy%20Week">Great Week</a>, on <a href="Holy%20Wednesday">Great and Holy Wednesday</a>, to all who are prepared. Those who receive Unction on Holy Wednesday should go to <a href="Holy%20Communion">Holy Communion</a> on Maundy Thursday. The significance of receiving Unction on Holy Wednesday is shored up by the hymns in the <a href="Triodion">Triodion</a> for that day, which speak of the sinful woman who anointed the feet of Christ (). Just as her sins were forgiven because of her penitence, so the faithful are exhorted to repent of their sins. In the same narrative, Jesus says, "in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial" (Id., v. 12), linking the unction with Christ's death and resurrection.

In some <a href="diocese">diocese</a>s of the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> it is customary for the bishop to visit each parish or region of the diocese some time during <a href="Great%20Lent">Great Lent</a> and give Anointing for the faithful, together with the local clergy.

The 1552 and later editions of the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">pageRank.Book of Common Prayer</a> omitted the form of anointing given in the original (1549) version in its Order for the Visitation of the Sick, but most twentieth-century Anglican prayer books do have anointing of the sick.

Some Anglicans accept that anointing of the sick has a sacramental character and is therefore a channel of God's grace, seeing it as an "outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace" which is the definition of a sacrament. The Catechism of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America includes Unction of the Sick as among the "other sacramental rites" and it states that unction can be done with oil or simply with laying on of hands. The rite of anointing is included in the Episcopal Church's "Ministration to the Sick" 

Article 25 of the <a href="Thirty-Nine%20Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a>, which are one of the historical formularies of the Church of England (and as such, the Anglican Communion), speaking of the sacraments, says: "Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God."

Anointing of the sick has been retained in some <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> churches since the Reformation. Although it is not considered a <a href="Lutheran%20sacraments">sacrament</a> like <a href="Baptism%23Reformation">baptism</a> and the <a href="Eucharist%20in%20the%20Lutheran%20Church">Eucharist</a>, it is known as a <a href="ritual">ritual</a> in the same respect as <a href="Confession%20in%20the%20Lutheran%20Church">confession</a>, <a href="Confirmation%20%28Lutheran%20Church%29">confirmation</a>, <a href="Holy%20Orders">holy orders</a>, and <a href="Christian%20views%20of%20marriage%23Protestants">matrimony</a>.

After the penitent has received <a href="absolution">absolution</a> following confession, the presiding minister recites . He goes on to recite the following:
[Name], you have confessed your sins and received Holy Absolution. In remembrance of the grace of God given by the Holy Spirit in the waters of Holy Baptism, I will anoint you with oil. Confident in our Lord and in love for you, we also pray for you that you will not lose faith. Knowing that in Godly patience the Church endures with you and supports you during this affliction. We firmly believe that this illness is for the glory of God and that the Lord will both hear our prayer and work according to His good and gracious will.

He anoints the person on the forehead and says this blessing:

Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has given you the new birth of water and the Spirit and has forgiven you all your sins, strengthen you with His grace to life everlasting. Amen.
Among Protestants, anointing is provided in a wide variety of formats but, for the most part, however, it has fallen into disuse. Protestant communities generally vary widely on the sacramental character of anointing. Most Mainline Protestants recognize only two sacraments, the Eucharist and baptism, deeming Anointing only a humanly-instituted rite. Non-traditional Protestant communities generally use the term "<a href="Ordinance%20%28Christian%29">ordinance</a>" rather than "Sacrament".

<a href="Liturgical">Liturgical</a> or <a href="Mainline%20Protestant">Mainline Protestant</a> communities (e.g. <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a>, <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregationalist</a>/<a href="United%20Church%20of%20Christ">United Church of Christ</a>, <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>, etc.) all have official yet often optional liturgical rites for the anointing of the sick partly on the model of Western pre-Reformation rites. Anointing need not be associated with grave illness or imminent danger of death.

In <a href="Charismatic%20%28Christians%29">Charismatic</a> and <a href="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> communities, anointing of the sick is a frequent practice and has been an important ritual in these communities since the respective movements were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These communities use extemporaneous forms of administration at the discretion of the minister, who need not be a pastor. There is minimal ceremony attached to its administration. Usually, several people physically touch (laying on of hands) the recipient during the anointing. It may be part of a worship service with the full assembly of the congregation present, but may also be done in more private settings, such as homes or hospital rooms. Some Pentecostals believe that physical healing is within the anointing and so there is often great expectation or at least great hope that a miraculous cure or improvement will occur when someone is being prayed over for healing.

In <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> and <a href="Fundamentalism">Fundamentalist</a> communities, anointing of the sick is performed with varying degrees of frequency, although laying on of hands may be more common than anointing. The rite would be similar to that of Pentecostals in its simplicity, but would usually not have the same emotionalism attached to it. Unlike some Pentecostals, Evangelicals and Fundamentalists generally do not believe that physical healing is within the anointing. Therefore, God may or may not grant physical healing to the sick. The healing conferred by anointing is thus a spiritual event that may not result in physical recovery.

The Church of the Brethren practices Anointing with Oil as an ordinance along with Baptism, Communion, Laying on of Hands, and the Love Feast.

Evangelical Protestants who use anointing differ about whether the person doing the anointing must be an ordained member of the <a href="clergy">clergy</a>, whether the oil must necessarily be olive oil and have been previously specially consecrated, and about other details. Several Evangelical groups reject the practice so as not to be identified with <a href="Charismatic%20movement">charismatic</a> and Pentecostal groups, which practice it widely.

Some Protestant US military chaplains carry the Roman Rite version of the Anointing of the Sick with them for use if called upon to assist wounded or dying soldiers who are Catholics. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider invalid "as a sacrament" the administration of Anointing of the Sick by such chaplains, who in the eyes of those Churches are not validly ordained priests. The rite performed by them is thus seen as having the same by no means negligible value of any other form of prayer offered for the sick or dying.

<a href="Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">Latter-day Saints</a>, who consider themselves <a href="Restorationism%20%28Christian%20primitivism%29">restorationists</a>, also practice ritual anointing of the sick, as well as other forms of anointing. Members of <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church) consider anointing to be an <a href="Ordinance%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">ordinance</a>.

Members of the LDS Church who hold the <a href="Melchizedek%20priesthood%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Melchizedek priesthood</a> may use consecrated oil in performing the ordinance of <a href="Anointing%20of%20the%20Sick%23Latter%20Day%20Saints">blessing of the "sick or afflicted"</a>, though oil is not required if it is unavailable. The priesthood holder anoints the recipient's head with a drop of oil, then <a href="Laying%20on%20of%20hands">lays hands upon that head</a> and declare their act of anointing. Then another priesthood holder joins in, if available, and pronounces a "sealing" of the anointing and other words of blessing, as he feels inspired. Melchizedek priesthood holders are also authorized to consecrate any pure olive oil and often carry a personal supply in case they have need to perform a blessing. Oil is not used in other <a href="Priesthood%20blessing">blessings</a>, such as for people seeking comfort or counsel.

In addition to the reference, the <a href="Doctrine%20and%20Covenants">Doctrine and Covenants</a> contains numerous references to the anointing and healing of the sick by those with authority to do so.

<a href="Sacraments%20%28Community%20of%20Christ%29%23Administration%20to%20the%20sick">Administration to the sick</a> is one of the eight <a href="Sacraments%20%28Community%20of%20Christ%29">sacraments of the Community of Christ</a>, in which it has also been used for people seeking spiritual, emotional or mental healing.

Abstract data type

In <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, an abstract data type (ADT) is a <a href="mathematical%20model">mathematical model</a> for <a href="data%20type">data type</a>s, where a data type is defined by its behavior (<a href="Semantics%20%28computer%20science%29">semantics</a>) from the point of view of a "user" of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This contrasts with <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a>s, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.

Formally, an ADT may be defined as a "class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations"; this is analogous to an <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a> in mathematics. What is meant by "behavior" varies by author, with the two main types of formal specifications for behavior being "axiomatic (algebraic) specification" and an "abstract model;" these correspond to <a href="axiomatic%20semantics">axiomatic semantics</a> and <a href="operational%20semantics">operational semantics</a> of an <a href="abstract%20machine">abstract machine</a>, respectively. Some authors also include the <a href="Computational%20complexity%20theory">computational complexity</a> ("cost"), both in terms of time (for computing operations) and space (for representing values). In practice many common data types are not ADTs, as the abstraction is not perfect, and users must be aware of issues like <a href="arithmetic%20overflow">arithmetic overflow</a> that are due to the representation. For example, integers are often stored as fixed width values (32-bit or 64-bit binary numbers), and thus experience <a href="integer%20overflow">integer overflow</a> if the maximum value is exceeded.

ADTs are a theoretical concept in computer science, used in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software systems, and do not correspond to specific features of <a href="computer%20language">computer language</a>s—mainstream computer languages do not directly support formally specified ADTs. However, various language features correspond to certain aspects of ADTs, and are easily confused with ADTs proper; these include <a href="abstract%20type">abstract type</a>s, <a href="opaque%20data%20type">opaque data type</a>s, <a href="Protocol%20%28object-oriented%20programming%29">protocols</a>, and <a href="design%20by%20contract">design by contract</a>. ADTs were first proposed by <a href="Barbara%20Liskov">Barbara Liskov</a> and Stephen N. Zilles in 1974, as part of the development of the <a href="CLU%20%28programming%20language%29">CLU</a> language.

For example, <a href="integer">integer</a>s are an ADT, defined as the values …, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …, and by the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, together with greater than, less than, etc., which behave according to familiar mathematics (with care for <a href="integer%20division">integer division</a>), independently of how the integers are represented by the computer. Explicitly, "behavior" includes obeying various axioms (associativity and commutativity of addition etc.), and preconditions on operations (cannot divide by zero). Typically integers are represented in a data structure as <a href="binary%20number">binary number</a>s, most often as <a href="two%27s%20complement">two's complement</a>, but might be <a href="binary-coded%20decimal">binary-coded decimal</a> or in <a href="ones%27%20complement">ones' complement</a>, but the user is abstracted from the concrete choice of representation, and can simply use the data as integers.

An ADT consists not only of operations, but also of values of the underlying data and of constraints on the operations. An "interface" typically refers only to the operations, and perhaps some of the constraints on the operations, notably pre-conditions and post-conditions, but not other constraints, such as relations between the operations.

For example, an abstract <a href="Stack%20%28abstract%20data%20type%29">stack</a>, which is a last-in-first-out structure, could be defined by three operations: push, that inserts a data item onto the stack; pop, that removes a data item from it; and peek or top, that accesses a data item on top of the stack without removal. An abstract <a href="Queue%20%28abstract%20data%20type%29">queue</a>, which is a first-in-first-out structure, would also have three operations: enqueue, that inserts a data item into the queue; dequeue, that removes the first data item from it; and front, that accesses and serves the first data item in the queue. There would be no way of differentiating these two data types, unless a mathematical constraint is introduced that for a stack specifies that each pop always returns the most recently pushed item that has not been popped yet. When <a href="analysis%20of%20algorithms">analyzing the efficiency</a> of algorithms that use stacks, one may also specify that all operations take the same time no matter how many data items have been pushed into the stack, and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element.

Abstract data types are purely theoretical entities, used (among other things) to simplify the description of abstract algorithms, to classify and evaluate data structures, and to formally describe the <a href="type%20system">type system</a>s of programming languages. However, an ADT may be <a href="implementation">implemented</a> by specific <a href="data%20type">data type</a>s or <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a>s, in many ways and in many programming languages; or described in a <a href="formal%20specification%20language">formal specification language</a>. ADTs are often implemented as <a href="modular%20programming">modules</a>: the module's <a href="interface%20%28computer%20science%29">interface</a> declares procedures that correspond to the ADT operations, sometimes with <a href="comment%20%28computer%20programming%29">comments</a> that describe the constraints. This <a href="information%20hiding">information hiding</a> strategy allows the implementation of the module to be changed without disturbing the <a href="client%20%28computing%29">client</a> programs.

The term abstract data type can also be regarded as a generalized approach of a number of algebraic structures, such as lattices, groups, and rings. The notion of abstract data types is related to the concept of <a href="data%20abstraction">data abstraction</a>, important in <a href="object-oriented%20programming%20language">object-oriented programming</a> and <a href="design%20by%20contract">design by contract</a> methodologies for <a href="software%20engineering">software development</a>.

An abstract data type is defined as a mathematical model of the data objects that make up a data type as well as the functions that operate on these objects.
There are no standard conventions for defining them. A broad division may be drawn between "imperative" and "functional" definition styles.

In the philosophy of <a href="imperative%20programming">imperative programming</a> languages, an abstract data structure is conceived as an entity that is "mutable"—meaning that it may be in different "states" at different times. Some operations may change the state of the ADT; therefore, the order in which operations are evaluated is important, and the same operation on the same entities may have different effects if executed at different times—just like the instructions of a computer, or the commands and procedures of an imperative language. To underscore this view, it is customary to say that the operations are "executed" or "applied", rather than "evaluated". The imperative style is often used when describing abstract algorithms. (See <a href="The%20Art%20of%20Computer%20Programming">The Art of Computer Programming</a> by <a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> for more details)

Imperative-style definitions of ADT often depend on the concept of an "abstract variable", which may be regarded as the simplest non-trivial ADT. An abstract variable "V" is a mutable entity that admits two operations:
with the constraint that

As in so many programming languages, the operation store("V", "x") is often written "V" ← "x" (or some similar notation), and fetch("V") is implied whenever a variable "V" is used in a context where a value is required. Thus, for example, "V" ← "V" + 1 is commonly understood to be a shorthand for store("V",fetch("V") + 1).

In this definition, it is implicitly assumed that storing a value into a variable "U" has no effect on the state of a distinct variable "V". To make this assumption explicit, one could add the constraint that

More generally, ADT definitions often assume that any operation that changes the state of one ADT instance has no effect on the state of any other instance (including other instances of the same ADT) — unless the ADT axioms imply that the two instances are connected (<a href="Aliasing%20%28computing%29">aliased</a>) in that sense. For example, when extending the definition of abstract variable to include abstract <a href="record%20%28computer%20science%29">records</a>, the operation that selects a field from a record variable "R" must yield a variable "V" that is aliased to that part of "R".

The definition of an abstract variable "V" may also restrict the stored values "x" to members of a specific set "X", called the "range" or "type" of "V". As in programming languages, such restrictions may simplify the description and <a href="analysis%20of%20algorithms">analysis of algorithms</a>, and improve their readability.

Note that this definition does not imply anything about the result of evaluating fetch("V") when "V" is "un-initialized", that is, before performing any store operation on "V". An algorithm that does so is usually considered invalid, because its effect is not defined. (However, there are some important algorithms whose efficiency strongly depends on the assumption that such a fetch is legal, and returns some arbitrary value in the variable's range.)

Some algorithms need to create new instances of some ADT (such as new variables, or new stacks). To describe such algorithms, one usually includes in the ADT definition a create() operation that yields an instance of the ADT, usually with axioms equivalent to
This axiom may be strengthened to exclude also partial aliasing with other instances. On the other hand, this axiom still allows implementations of create() to yield a previously created instance that has become inaccessible to the program.

As another example, an imperative-style definition of an abstract stack could specify that the state of a stack "S" can be modified only by the operations
with the constraint that

Since the assignment "V" ← "x", by definition, cannot change the state of "S", this condition implies that "V" ← pop("S") restores "S" to the state it had before the push("S", "x"). From this condition and from the properties of abstract variables, it follows, for example, that the sequence
where "x", "y", and "z" are any values, and "U", "V", "W" are pairwise distinct variables, is equivalent to

Here it is implicitly assumed that operations on a stack instance do not modify the state of any other ADT instance, including other stacks; that is,

An abstract stack definition usually includes also a <a href="Boolean%20value">Boolean</a>-valued function empty("S") and a create() operation that returns a stack instance, with axioms equivalent to

Sometimes an ADT is defined as if only one instance of it existed during the execution of the algorithm, and all operations were applied to that instance, which is not explicitly notated. For example, the abstract stack above could have been defined with operations push("x") and pop(), that operate on "the" only existing stack. ADT definitions in this style can be easily rewritten to admit multiple coexisting instances of the ADT, by adding an explicit instance parameter (like "S" in the previous example) to every operation that uses or modifies the implicit instance.

On the other hand, some ADTs cannot be meaningfully defined without assuming multiple instances. This is the case when a single operation takes two distinct instances of the ADT as parameters. For an example, consider augmenting the definition of the abstract stack with an operation compare("S", "T") that checks whether the stacks "S" and "T" contain the same items in the same order.

Another way to define an ADT, closer to the spirit of <a href="functional%20programming">functional programming</a>, is to consider each state of the structure as a separate entity. In this view, any operation that modifies the ADT is modeled as a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">mathematical function</a> that takes the old state as an argument, and returns the new state as part of the result. Unlike the imperative operations, these functions have no <a href="side%20effect%20%28computer%20science%29">side effect</a>s. Therefore, the order in which they are evaluated is immaterial, and the same operation applied to the same arguments (including the same input states) will always return the same results (and output states).

In the functional view, in particular, there is no way (or need) to define an "abstract variable" with the semantics of imperative variables (namely, with fetch and store operations). Instead of storing values into variables, one passes them as arguments to functions.

For example, a complete functional-style definition of an abstract stack could use the three operations:

In a functional-style definition there is no need for a create operation. Indeed, there is no notion of "stack instance". The stack states can be thought of as being potential states of a single stack structure, and two stack states that contain the same values in the same order are considered to be identical states. This view actually mirrors the behavior of some concrete implementations, such as <a href="linked%20list">linked list</a>s with <a href="hash%20cons">hash cons</a>.

Instead of create(), a functional-style definition of an abstract stack may assume the existence of a special stack state, the "empty stack", designated by a special symbol like Λ or "()"; or define a bottom() operation that takes no arguments and returns this special stack state. Note that the axioms imply that
In a functional-style definition of a stack one does not need an empty predicate: instead, one can test whether a stack is empty by testing whether it is equal to Λ.

Note that these axioms do not define the effect of top("s") or pop("s"), unless "s" is a stack state returned by a push. Since push leaves the stack non-empty, those two operations are undefined (hence invalid) when "s" = Λ. On the other hand, the axioms (and the lack of side effects) imply that push("s", "x") = push("t", "y") <a href="if%20and%20only%20if">if and only if</a> "x" = "y" and "s" = "t".

As in some other branches of mathematics, it is customary to assume also that the stack states are only those whose existence can be proved from the axioms in a finite number of steps. In the abstract stack example above, this rule means that every stack is a "finite" sequence of values, that becomes the empty stack (Λ) after a finite number of pops. By themselves, the axioms above do not exclude the existence of infinite stacks (that can be poped forever, each time yielding a different state) or circular stacks (that return to the same state after a finite number of pops). In particular, they do not exclude states "s" such that pop("s") = "s" or push("s", "x") = "s" for some "x". However, since one cannot obtain such stack states with the given operations, they are assumed "not to exist".

Aside from the behavior in terms of axioms, it is also possible to include, in the definition of an ADT operation, their <a href="Analysis%20of%20algorithms">algorithmic complexity</a>. <a href="Alexander%20Stepanov">Alexander Stepanov</a>, designer of the C++ <a href="Standard%20Template%20Library">Standard Template Library</a>, included complexity guarantees in the STL specification, arguing:

<a href="Abstraction%20%28computer%20science%29">Abstraction</a> provides a promise that any implementation of the ADT has certain properties and abilities; knowing these is all that is required to make use of an ADT object. The user does not need any technical knowledge of how the implementation works to use the ADT. In this way, the implementation may be complex but will be encapsulated in a simple interface when it is actually used.

Code that uses an ADT object will not need to be edited if the implementation of the ADT is changed. Since any changes to the implementation must still comply with the interface, and since code using an ADT object may only refer to properties and abilities specified in the interface, changes may be made to the implementation without requiring any changes in code where the ADT is used.

Different implementations of the ADT, having all the same properties and abilities, are equivalent and may be used somewhat interchangeably in code that uses the ADT. This gives a great deal of flexibility when using ADT objects in different situations. For example, different implementations of the ADT may be more efficient in different situations; it is possible to use each in the situation where they are preferable, thus increasing overall efficiency.

Some operations that are often specified for ADTs (possibly under other names) are

In imperative-style ADT definitions, one often finds also

The free operation is not normally relevant or meaningful, since ADTs are theoretical entities that do not "use memory". However, it may be necessary when one needs to analyze the storage used by an algorithm that uses the ADT. In that case one needs additional axioms that specify how much memory each ADT instance uses, as a function of its state, and how much of it is returned to the pool by free.

Some common ADTs, which have proved useful in a great variety of applications, are

Each of these ADTs may be defined in many ways and variants, not necessarily equivalent. For example, an abstract stack may or may not have a count operation that tells how many items have been pushed and not yet popped. This choice makes a difference not only for its clients but also for the implementation.

An extension of ADT for computer graphics was proposed in 1979: an <a href="abstract%20graphical%20data%20type">abstract graphical data type</a> (AGDT). It was introduced by <a href="Nadia%20Magnenat%20Thalmann">Nadia Magnenat Thalmann</a>, and <a href="Daniel%20Thalmann">Daniel Thalmann</a>. AGDTs provide the advantages of ADTs with facilities to build graphical objects in a structured way.

Implementing an ADT means providing one <a href="subroutine">procedure or function</a> for each abstract operation. The ADT instances are represented by some concrete <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a> that is manipulated by those procedures, according to the ADT's specifications.

Usually there are many ways to implement the same ADT, using several different concrete data structures. Thus, for example, an abstract stack can be implemented by a <a href="linked%20list">linked list</a> or by an <a href="Array%20data%20structure">array</a>.

In order to prevent clients from depending on the implementation, an ADT is often packaged as an "<a href="opaque%20data%20type">opaque data type</a>" in one or more <a href="module%20%28programming%29">modules</a>, whose interface contains only the signature (number and types of the parameters and results) of the operations. The implementation of the module—namely, the bodies of the procedures and the concrete data structure used—can then be hidden from most clients of the module. This makes it possible to change the implementation without affecting the clients. If the implementation is exposed, it is known instead as a "transparent data type."

When implementing an ADT, each instance (in imperative-style definitions) or each state (in functional-style definitions) is usually represented by a <a href="handle%20%28computing%29">handle</a> of some sort.

Modern object-oriented languages, such as <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a> and <a href="Java%20programming%20language">Java</a>, support a form of abstract data types. When a class is used as a type, it is an abstract type that refers to a hidden representation. In this model an ADT is typically implemented as a <a href="class%20%28computer%20science%29">class</a>, and each instance of the ADT is usually an <a href="object%20%28computer%20science%29">object</a> of that class. The module's interface typically declares the constructors as ordinary procedures, and most of the other ADT operations as <a href="method%20%28computer%20science%29">methods</a> of that class. However, such an approach does not easily encapsulate multiple representational variants found in an ADT. It also can undermine the extensibility of object-oriented programs.
In a pure object-oriented program that uses interfaces as types, types refer to behaviors not representations.

As an example, here is an implementation of the abstract stack above in the <a href="C%20programming%20language">C programming language</a>.
An imperative-style interface might be:
This interface could be used in the following manner:
This interface can be implemented in many ways. The implementation may be arbitrarily inefficient, since the formal definition of the ADT, above, does not specify how much space the stack may use, nor how long each operation should take. It also does not specify whether the stack state "s" continues to exist after a call "x" ← pop("s").

In practice the formal definition should specify that the space is proportional to the number of items pushed and not yet popped; and that every one of the operations above must finish in a constant amount of time, independently of that number. To comply with these additional specifications, the implementation could use a linked list, or an array (with dynamic resizing) together with two integers (an item count and the array size).

Functional-style ADT definitions are more appropriate for functional programming languages, and vice versa. However, one can provide a functional-style interface even in an imperative language like C. For example:
Many modern programming languages, such as C++ and Java, come with standard libraries that implement several common ADTs, such as those listed above.

The specification of some programming languages is intentionally vague about the representation of certain built-in data types, defining only the operations that can be done on them. Therefore, those types can be viewed as "built-in ADTs". Examples are the arrays in many scripting languages, such as <a href="Awk">Awk</a>, <a href="Lua%20%28programming%20language%29">Lua</a>, and <a href="Perl">Perl</a>, which can be regarded as an implementation of the abstract list.

American Football League

The American Football League (AFL) was a major professional <a href="American%20football">American football</a> league that operated from 1960 until 1969, when it merged with the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL). The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence. It was more successful than earlier rivals to the NFL with the same name, the <a href="American%20Football%20League%20%281926%29">American Football League (1926)</a>, <a href="American%20Football%20League%20%281936%29">American Football League (1936)</a>, and <a href="American%20Football%20League%20%281940%29">American Football League (1940)</a>.

The AFL was created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises. The AFL's original lineup consisted of an Eastern division of the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Titans</a>, <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">Boston Patriots</a>, <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>, and the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a>, and a Western division of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a>, <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>, and <a href="Dallas%20Texans%20%28AFL%29">Dallas Texans</a>. The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the <a href="1960%20NFL%20Draft">NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960</a>, including Houston's successful signing of <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> winner <a href="Billy%20Cannon">Billy Cannon</a>.

While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance, the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> (followed by a contract with <a href="National%20Broadcasting%20Company">NBC</a> for games starting with the 1965 season) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide. Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s, as well as successful franchise shifts of the Chargers to <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> and the Texans to <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>, the AFL established a dedicated following. The transformation of the struggling Titans into the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a> under new ownership further solidified the league's reputation among the major media.

As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues, especially after a series of "raids", the leagues agreed to a <a href="AFL%E2%80%93NFL%20merger">merger in 1966</a>. Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions, which would eventually become known as the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>.

The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970, with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game. During this time the AFL added the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> and <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>. After losses by Kansas City and Oakland in the first two AFL-NFL Championship Games to the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a> and <a href="Kansas%20City%20Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a> won <a href="Super%20Bowl%20III">Super Bowls III</a> and <a href="Super%20Bowl%20IV">IV</a> respectively, cementing the league's claim to being an equal to the NFL.

In 1970, the AFL was absorbed into the NFL, and the ten AFL franchises along with the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a>, <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, and <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> became the <a href="American%20Football%20Conference">American Football Conference</a>.

During the 1950s, the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> had grown to rival <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> as one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States. One franchise that did not share in this newfound success of the league was the <a href="Chicago%20Cardinals%20%28NFL%2C%201920%E2%80%9359%29">Chicago Cardinals</a>, owned by the Bidwill family, who had become overshadowed by the more popular <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago Bears</a>. The Bidwills hoped to relocate their franchise, preferably to <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> but could not come to terms with the league on a relocation fee. Needing cash, the Bidwills began entertaining offers from would-be investors, and one of the men who approached the Bidwills was <a href="Lamar%20Hunt">Lamar Hunt</a>, son and heir of millionaire oilman <a href="H.%20L.%20Hunt">H. L. Hunt</a>. Hunt offered to buy the Cardinals and move them to <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, where he had grown up. However, these negotiations came to nothing, since the Bidwills insisted on retaining a controlling interest in the franchise and were unwilling to move their team to a city where a <a href="Dallas%20Texans%20%28NFL%29">previous NFL franchise</a> had failed in <a href="1952%20NFL%20season">1952</a>. While Hunt negotiated with the Bidwills, similar offers were made by <a href="Bud%20Adams">Bud Adams</a>, <a href="Bob%20Howsam">Bob Howsam</a>, and <a href="Max%20Winter">Max Winter</a>.

When Hunt, Adams, and Howsam were unable to secure a controlling interest in the Cardinals, they approached NFL commissioner <a href="Bert%20Bell">Bert Bell</a> and proposed the addition of <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>s. Bell, wary of expanding the 12-team league and risking its newfound success, rejected the offer. On his return flight to Dallas, Hunt conceived the idea of an entirely new league and decided to contact the others who had shown interest in purchasing the Cardinals. He contacted Adams, Howsam, and Winter (as well as Winter's business partner, Bill Boyer) to gauge their interest in starting a new league. Hunt's first meeting with Adams was held in March 1959. Hunt, who felt a regional rivalry would be critical for the success of the new league, convinced Adams to join and found his team in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>. Hunt next secured an agreement from Howsam to bring a team to <a href="Denver">Denver</a>.

After Winter and Boyer agreed to start a team in <a href="Minneapolis-Saint%20Paul">Minneapolis-Saint Paul</a>, the new league had its first four teams. Hunt then approached Willard Rhodes, who hoped to bring pro football to <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>. However, the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> was unwilling to let the fledgling league use <a href="Husky%20Stadium">Husky Stadium</a>, probably due to the excessive wear and tear that would have been caused to the facility's grass surface. With no place for his team to play, Rhodes' effort came to nothing. Hunt also sought franchises in Los Angeles, <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a> and New York City. During the summer of 1959, he sought the blessings of the NFL for his nascent league, as he did not seek a potentially costly rivalry. Within weeks of the July 1959 announcement of the league's formation, Hunt received commitments from <a href="Barron%20Hilton">Barron Hilton</a> and <a href="Harry%20Wismer">Harry Wismer</a> to bring teams to Los Angeles and New York, respectively. His initial efforts for Buffalo, however, were rebuffed, when Hunt's first choice of owner, <a href="Pat%20McGroder">Pat McGroder</a>, declined to take part; McGroder had hoped that the threat of the AFL would be enough to prompt the NFL to expand to Buffalo.

On August 14, 1959, the first league meeting was held in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and charter memberships were given to Dallas, New York, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis-Saint Paul. On August 22 the league officially was named the American Football League at a meeting in Dallas. The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier <a href="All-America%20Football%20Conference">All-America Football Conference</a> (Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league. AFL owners were approached with promises of new NFL franchises or ownership stakes in existing ones. Only the party from Minneapolis accepted, and the Minnesota group joined the NFL the next year in 1961; the Minneapolis group were joined by <a href="Ole%20Haugsrud">Ole Haugsrud</a> and <a href="Bernie%20Ridder">Bernie Ridder</a> in the new NFL team's ownership group, which was named the <a href="Minnesota%20Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>. The older league also announced on August 29 that it had conveniently reversed its position against expansion, and planned to bring NFL expansion teams to Houston and Dallas, to start play in 1961. (The NFL did not expand to Houston at that time, the promised Dallas team – the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> – actually started play in 1960, and the Vikings began play in 1961.) Finally, the NFL quickly came to terms with the Bidwills and allowed them to relocate the struggling Cardinals to St. Louis, eliminating that city as a potential AFL market.

<a href="Ralph%20Wilson">Ralph Wilson</a>, who owned a minority interest in the NFL's <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a> at the time, initially announced he was placing a team in <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, but like the Seattle situation, was also rebuffed by local ownership; given five other choices, Wilson negotiated with McGroder and brought the team that would become the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Bills</a> to Buffalo. Buffalo was officially awarded its franchise on October 28. During a league meeting on November 22, a 10-man ownership group from <a href="Boston">Boston</a> (led by <a href="Billy%20Sullivan%20%28American%20football%29">Billy Sullivan</a>) was awarded the AFL's eighth team. On November 30, 1959, <a href="Joe%20Foss">Joe Foss</a>, a World War II <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine</a> <a href="fighter%20ace">fighter ace</a> and former governor of <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>, was named the AFL's first commissioner. Foss commissioned a friend of Harry Wismer's to develop the AFL's eagle-on-football logo. Hunt was elected President of the AFL on January 26, 1960.

The AFL's first <a href="American%20Football%20League%20Draft">draft</a> took place the same day Boston was awarded its franchise, and lasted 33 rounds. The league held a second draft on December 2, which lasted for 20 rounds. Because the Raiders joined after the AFL draft, they inherited Minnesota's selections. A special "<a href="1960%20American%20Football%20League%20Draft">allocation draft</a>" was held in January 1960, to allow the Raiders to stock their team, as some of the other AFL teams had already signed some of Minneapolis' original draft choices.

In November 1959, Minneapolis owner Max Winter announced his intent to leave the AFL to accept a franchise offer from the NFL. In 1961, his team began play in the NFL as the <a href="Minnesota%20Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>. <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a> owner Barron Hilton demanded that a replacement for Minnesota be placed in California, to reduce his team's operating costs and to create a rivalry. After a brief search, <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a> was chosen and an ownership group led by <a href="F.%20Wayne%20Valley">F. Wayne Valley</a> and local real estate developer <a href="Chet%20Soda">Chet Soda</a> was formed. After initially being called the Oakland ""Señores"", the <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> officially joined the AFL on January 30, 1960.

The AFL's first major success came when the <a href="Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a> signed <a href="Billy%20Cannon">Billy Cannon</a>, the All-American and 1959 <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> winner from <a href="LSU%20Tigers%20football">LSU</a>. Cannon signed a $100,000 contract to play for the Oilers, despite having already signed a $50,000 contract with the NFL's <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>. The Oilers filed suit and claimed that Rams general manager <a href="Pete%20Rozelle">Pete Rozelle</a> had unduly manipulated Cannon. The court upheld the Houston contract, and with Cannon the Oilers appeared in the AFL's first three championship games (winning two).

On June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, which brought in revenues of approximately US$2,125,000 per year for the entire league. On June 17, the AFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, which was dismissed in 1962 after a two-month trial. The AFL began regular-season play (a night game on Friday, September 9, 1960) with eight teams in the league — the <a href="Boston%20Patriots">Boston Patriots</a>, <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>, <a href="Dallas%20Texans%20%28AFL%29">Dallas Texans</a>, <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, <a href="Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Titans%20%28football%29">New York Titans</a>, and <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>. Raiders' co-owner <a href="F.%20Wayne%20Valley">Wayne Valley</a> dubbed the AFL ownership "The Foolish Club", a term Lamar Hunt subsequently used on team photographs he sent as Christmas gifts.

The Oilers became the first-ever league champions by defeating the Chargers, 24–16, in the AFL Championship on January 1, 1961. Attendance for the 1960 season was respectable for a new league, but not nearly that of the NFL. In 1960, the NFL averaged attendance of more than 40,000 fans per game and more popular NFL teams in 1960 regularly saw attendance figures in excess of 50,000 per game, while CFL attendances averaged approximately 20,000 per game. By comparison, AFL attendance averaged about 16,500 per game and generally hovered between 10,000-20,000 per game. Professional football was still primarily a gate-driven business in 1960, so low attendance meant financial losses. The Raiders, with a league-worst average attendance of just 9,612, lost $500,000 in their first year and only survived after receiving a $400,000 loan from Bills owner Ralph Wilson. In an early sign of stability, however, the AFL did not lose any teams after its first year of operation. In fact, the only major change was the relocation of the Chargers from Los Angeles to nearby <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego</a>.

On August 8, 1961, the AFL challenged the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> to an exhibition game that would feature the <a href="Hamilton%20Tiger-Cats">Hamilton Tiger-Cats</a> and the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>, which was attended by 24,376 spectators. Playing at <a href="Ivor%20Wynne%20Stadium">Civic Stadium</a> in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, the Tiger-Cats defeated the Bills 38–21 playing a mix of AFL and CFL rules.

While the Oilers found instant success in the AFL, other teams did not fare as well. The Oakland Raiders and New York Titans struggled on and off the field during their first few seasons in the league. Oakland's eight-man ownership group was reduced to just three in 1961, after heavy financial losses in their first season. Attendance for home games was poor, partly due to the team playing in the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>—which already had an established NFL team (the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>)—but the product on the field was also to blame. After winning six games in their debut season, the Raiders won a total of three times in the 1961 and 1962 seasons. Oakland took part in a 1961 supplemental draft meant to boost the weaker teams in the league, but it did little good. They participated in another such draft in 1962.

The Titans fared a little better on the field but had their own financial troubles. Attendance was so low for home games that team owner Harry Wismer had fans move to seats closer to the field to give the illusion of a fuller stadium on television. Eventually Wismer could no longer afford to meet his payroll, and on November 8, 1962 the AFL took over operations of the team. The Titans were sold to a five-person ownership group headed by <a href="Sonny%20Werblin">Sonny Werblin</a> on March 28, 1963, and in April the new owners changed the team's name to the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>.

The Raiders and Titans both finished last in their respective divisions in the 1962 season. The Texans and Oilers, winners of their divisions, faced each other for the 1962 AFL Championship on December 23. The Texans dethroned the two-time champion Oilers, 20–17, in a double-<a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">overtime</a> contest that was, at the time, professional football's longest-ever game.

In 1963, the Texans became the second AFL team to relocate. Lamar Hunt felt that despite winning the league championship in 1962, the Texans could not succeed financially competing in the same market as the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, which entered the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1960. After meetings with <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, and <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, Hunt announced on May 22 that the Texans' new home would be <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. Kansas City mayor <a href="Harold%20Roe%20Bartle">Harold Roe Bartle</a> (nicknamed "Chief") was instrumental in his city's success in attracting the team. Partly to honor Bartle, the franchise officially became the Kansas City Chiefs on May 26.

The San Diego Chargers, under head coach <a href="Sid%20Gillman">Sid Gillman</a>, won a decisive 51–10 victory over the Boston Patriots for the 1963 AFL Championship. Confident that his team was capable of beating the NFL-champion <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago Bears</a> (he had the Chargers' rings inscribed with the phrase "World Champions"), Gillman approached NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle and proposed a final championship game between the two teams. Rozelle declined the offer; however, the game would be instituted three seasons later.

A series of events throughout the next few years demonstrated the AFL's ability to achieve a greater level of equality with the NFL. On January 29, 1964, the AFL signed a lucrative $36 million television contract with <a href="NBC">NBC</a> (beginning in the 1965 season), which gave the league money it needed to compete with the NFL for players. Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney was quoted as saying to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle that "They don't have to call us 'Mister' anymore". A single-game attendance record was set on November 8, 1964, when 61,929 fans packed <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a> to watch the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.

The bidding war for players between the AFL and NFL escalated in 1965. The Chiefs drafted <a href="Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football">University of Kansas</a> star <a href="Gale%20Sayers">Gale Sayers</a> in the first round of the 1965 AFL draft (held November 28, 1964), while the Chicago Bears did the same in the NFL draft. Sayers eventually signed with the Bears. A similar situation occurred when the New York Jets and the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals both drafted University of Alabama quarterback <a href="Joe%20Namath">Joe Namath</a>. In what was viewed as a key victory for the AFL, Namath signed a $427,000 contract with the Jets on January 2, 1965 (the deal included a new car). It was the highest amount of money ever paid to a collegiate football player, and is cited as the strongest contributing factor to the eventual merger between the two leagues.

After the 1963 season, the <a href="Orlando%20Panthers">Newark Bears</a> of the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Football%20League">Atlantic Coast Football League</a> expressed interest in joining the AFL; concerns over having to split the New York metro area with the still-uncertain Jets were a factor in the Bears bid being rejected. In early 1965, the AFL awarded its first <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a> to <a href="Rankin%20Smith">Rankin Smith</a> of <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. The NFL quickly counteroffered Smith a franchise, which Smith accepted; the <a href="Atlanta%20Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a> began play as an NFL franchise. In March 1965, <a href="Joe%20Robbie">Joe Robbie</a> had met with Commissioner Foss to inquire about an expansion franchise for <a href="Miami">Miami</a>. On May 6, after Atlanta's exit, Robbie secured an agreement with Miami mayor Robert King High to bring a team to Miami. League expansion was approved at a meeting held on June 7, and on August 16 the AFL's ninth franchise was officially awarded to Robbie and television star <a href="Danny%20Thomas">Danny Thomas</a>. The <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> joined the league for a fee of $7.5 million and started play in the AFL's Eastern Division in 1966.

In 1966, the rivalry between the AFL and NFL reached an all-time peak. On April 7, Joe Foss resigned as AFL commissioner. His successor was Oakland Raiders head coach and general manager <a href="Al%20Davis">Al Davis</a>, who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of that franchise. No longer content with trying to outbid the NFL for college talent, the AFL under Davis started to recruit players already on NFL squads. Davis's strategy focused on quarterbacks in particular, and in two months he persuaded seven NFL quarterbacks to sign with the AFL. Although Davis's intention was to help the AFL win the bidding war, some AFL and NFL owners saw the escalation as detrimental to both leagues. Alarmed with the rate of spending in the league, <a href="Hilton%20Hotels">Hilton Hotels</a> forced Barron Hilton to relinquish his stake in the Chargers as a condition of maintaining his leadership role with the hotel chain.

The same month Davis was named commissioner, several NFL owners, along with Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm, secretly approached Lamar Hunt and other AFL owners and asked the AFL to merge. They held a series of secret meetings in Dallas to discuss their concerns over rapidly increasing player salaries, as well as the practice of player poaching. Hunt and Schramm completed the basic groundwork for a merger of the two leagues by the end of May, and on June 8, 1966, the merger was officially announced. Under the terms of the agreement, the two leagues would hold a common player draft. The agreement also called for a title game to be played between the champions of the respective leagues. The two leagues would be fully merged by 1970, NFL commissioner <a href="Pete%20Rozelle">Pete Rozelle</a> would remain as commissioner of the merged league, and additional expansion teams would eventually be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring it to a 28-team league. The AFL also agreed to pay indemnities of $18 million to the NFL over 20 years. In protest, Davis resigned as AFL commissioner on July 25 rather than remain until the completion of the merger, and <a href="Milt%20Woodard">Milt Woodard</a> was named President of the AFL.

On January 15, 1967, the first-ever World Championship Game between the champions of the two separate professional football leagues, the AFL-NFL Championship Game (retroactively referred to as <a href="Super%20Bowl%20I">Super Bowl I</a>), was played in Los Angeles. After a close first half, the NFL champion <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> overwhelmed the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs, 35–10. The loss reinforced for many the notion that the AFL was an inferior league. Packers head coach <a href="Vince%20Lombardi">Vince Lombardi</a> stated after the game, "I do not think they are as good as the top teams in the National Football League."

The second AFL-NFL Championship (<a href="Super%20Bowl%20II">Super Bowl II</a>) yielded a similar result. The Oakland Raiders—who had easily beaten the Houston Oilers to win their first AFL championship—were overmatched by the Packers, 33–14. The more experienced Packers capitalized on a number of Raiders miscues and never trailed. Green Bay defensive tackle <a href="Henry%20Jordan">Henry Jordan</a> offered a compliment to Oakland and the AFL, when he said, "... the AFL is becoming much more sophisticated on offense. I think the league has always had good personnel, but the blocks were subtler and better conceived in this game."

The AFL added its tenth and final team on May 24, 1967, when it awarded the league's second expansion franchise to an ownership group from <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, headed by NFL legend <a href="Paul%20Brown">Paul Brown</a>. Although Brown had intended to join the NFL, he agreed to join the AFL when he learned that his team would be included in the NFL once the merger was completed. The <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> began play in the 1968 season, finishing last in the Western Division.

While many AFL players and observers believed their league was the equal of the NFL, their first two Super Bowl performances did nothing to prove it. However, on November 17, 1968, when NBC <a href="Heidi%20Game">cut away from a game</a> between the Jets and Raiders to air the children's movie "<a href="Heidi%20%281968%20film%29">Heidi</a>", the ensuing uproar helped disprove the notion that fans still considered the AFL an inferior product. The perception of AFL inferiority forever changed on January 12, 1969, when the AFL Champion New York Jets shocked the heavily favored NFL Champion <a href="Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20III">Super Bowl III</a>. The Colts, who entered the contest favored by as many as 18 points, had completed the <a href="1968%20NFL%20season">1968 NFL season</a> with a 13–1 record, and won the NFL title with a convincing 34–0 win over the Cleveland Browns. Led by their stalwart defense—which allowed a record-low 144 points—the 1968 Colts were considered one of the best-ever NFL teams.

By contrast, the Jets had allowed 280 points, the highest total for any division winner in the two leagues. They had also only narrowly beaten the favored Oakland Raiders 27–23 in the AFL championship game. Jets quarterback <a href="Joe%20Namath">Joe Namath</a> recalled that in the days leading up to the game, he grew increasingly angry when told New York had no chance to beat Baltimore. Three days before the game, a frustrated Namath responded to a <a href="heckler">heckler</a> at the Touchdown Club in Miami by declaring, "We're going to win Sunday, I'll guarantee you."

Namath and the Jets made good on his guarantee as they held the Colts scoreless until late in the fourth quarter. The Jets won, 16–7, in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in American sports history. With the win, the AFL finally achieved parity with the NFL and legitimized the merger of the two leagues. That notion was reinforced one year later in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20IV">Super Bowl IV</a>, when the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs upset the NFL champion <a href="Minnesota%20Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>, 23–7, in the last championship game to be played between the two leagues. The Vikings, favored by 12½ points, were held to just 67 rushing yards.

The last game in AFL history was the <a href="AFL%20All-Star%20Game">AFL All-Star Game</a>, held in Houston's <a href="Astrodome">Astrodome</a> on January 17, 1970. The Western All-Stars, led by Chargers quarterback <a href="John%20Hadl">John Hadl</a>, defeated the Eastern All-Stars, 26–3. Buffalo rookie back O.J. Simpson carried the ball for the last play in AFL history. Hadl was named the game's <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a>. Prior to the start of the <a href="1970%20NFL%20season">1970 NFL season</a>, the merged league was organized into two conferences of three divisions each. All ten AFL teams made up the bulk of the new <a href="American%20Football%20Conference">American Football Conference</a>. To avoid having an inequitable number of teams in each conference, the leagues voted to move three NFL teams to the AFC. Motivated by the prospect of an <a href="Battle%20of%20Ohio%20%28NFL%29">intrastate rivalry</a> with the Bengals as well as by personal animosity toward <a href="Paul%20Brown">Paul Brown</a>, Cleveland Browns owner <a href="Art%20Modell">Art Modell</a> quickly offered to include his team in the AFC. He helped persuade the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> (<a href="Browns%E2%80%93Steelers%20rivalry">the Browns' archrivals</a>) and Baltimore Colts (who shared the <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>/Washington, D.C. market with the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>) to follow suit, and each team received US $3 million to make the switch. All the other NFL squads became part of the <a href="National%20Football%20Conference">National Football Conference</a>.

<a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> receiver <a href="Charlie%20Joiner">Charlie Joiner</a>, who started his career with the <a href="Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a> (<a href="1969%20AFL%20season">1969</a>), was the last AFL player active in professional football, retiring after the 1986 season, when he played for the <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a>.

The American Football League stands as the only professional football league to successfully compete against the NFL. When the two leagues merged in 1970, all ten AFL franchises and their statistics became part of the new NFL. Every other professional league that had competed against the NFL before the AFL–NFL merger had folded completely: the three previous leagues named "American Football League" and the <a href="All-America%20Football%20Conference">All-America Football Conference</a>. From an earlier AFL (1936–1937), only the Cleveland Rams (now the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>) joined the NFL and are currently operating, as are the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> and the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> from the AAFC. A third AAFC team, the <a href="Baltimore%20Colts%20%281947%E2%80%931950%29">Baltimore Colts</a> (not related to the 1953–1983 Baltimore Colts or to the current Indianapolis Colts franchise), played only one year in the NFL, disbanding at the end of the 1950 season. The league resulting from the merger was a 26-team juggernaut (since expanded to 32) with television rights covering all of the <a href="Big%20Three%20television%20networks">Big Three television networks</a> and teams in close proximity to almost all of the top 40 metropolitan areas, a fact that has precluded any other competing league from gaining traction since the merger; failed attempts to mimic the AFL's success included the <a href="World%20Football%20League">World Football League</a> (1974–75), <a href="United%20States%20Football%20League">United States Football League</a> (1983–85), <a href="XFL">XFL</a> (2001) and <a href="United%20Football%20League%20%282009%29">United Football League</a> (2009–2012).

The AFL was also the most successful of numerous upstart leagues of the 1960s and 1970s that attempted to challenge a major professional league's dominance. All nine teams that were in the AFL at the time the merger was agreed upon were accepted into the league intact (as was the tenth team added between the time of the merger's agreement and finalization), and none of the AFL's teams have ever folded. For comparison, the <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> (1972–79) managed to have four of its six remaining teams merged into the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a>, which actually caused the older league to contract a franchise, but WHA teams were forced to disperse the majority of their rosters and restart as expansion teams. The merged WHA teams were also not financially sound (in large part from the expansion fees the NHL imposed on them), and three of the four were forced to relocate within 20 years. The <a href="American%20Basketball%20Association">American Basketball Association</a> (1967–76) managed to have only four of its teams merged into the National Basketball Association, and the rest of the league was forced to fold. Both the WHA and ABA lost several teams to financial insolvency over the course of their existences. The <a href="Continental%20League">Continental League</a>, a proposed third league for <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> that was to begin play in 1961, never played a single game, largely because MLB responded to the proposal by expanding to four of that league's proposed cities. Historically, the only other professional sports league in the United States to exhibit a comparable level of franchise stability from its inception was the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>.

The NFL adopted some of the innovations introduced by the AFL immediately and a few others in the years following the merger. One was including the names on player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a <a href="stopwatch">stopwatch</a> used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a> to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the "AFL" than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.

The NFL also adapted how the AFL used the growing power of televised football games, which were bolstered with the help of major network contracts (first with <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> and later with <a href="NBC">NBC</a>). With that first contract with ABC, the AFL adopted the first-ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds were divided equally among member clubs. It featured many outstanding games, such as the classic 1962 double-overtime American Football League championship game between the <a href="Dallas%20Texans%20%28AFL%29">Dallas Texans</a> and the defending champion <a href="Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a>. At the time it was the longest <a href="Professional%20American%20football%20championship%20games">professional football championship game</a> ever played. The AFL also appealed to fans by offering a flashier style of play (just like the ABA in basketball), compared to the more conservative game of the NFL. Long passes ("bombs") were commonplace in AFL offenses, led by such talented quarterbacks as <a href="John%20Hadl">John Hadl</a>, <a href="Daryle%20Lamonica">Daryle Lamonica</a> and <a href="Len%20Dawson">Len Dawson</a>.

Despite having a national television contract, the AFL often found itself trying to gain a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks. For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report scores from the innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL. It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.

The AFL took advantage of the burgeoning popularity of football by locating teams in major cities that lacked NFL franchises. Hunt's vision not only brought a new professional football league to <a href="California">California</a> and <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, but introduced the sport to <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, restored it to <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and later to fast-growing <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, as well as bringing it to <a href="New%20England">New England</a> for the first time in 12 years. Buffalo, having lost its <a href="Buffalo%20%28NFL%29">original NFL franchise</a> in 1929 and turned down by the NFL at least twice (1940 and <a href="Buffalo%20Bills%20%28AAFC%29">1950</a>) for a replacement, returned to the NFL with the merger. The return of football to Kansas City was the first time that city had seen professional football since the NFL's <a href="Kansas%20City%20Blues/Cowboys">Kansas City Blues/Cowboys</a> of the 1920s; the arrival of the Chiefs, and the contemporary arrival of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20%28NFL%29">St. Louis Football Cardinals</a>, brought professional football back to Missouri for the first time since the temporary <a href="St.%20Louis%20Gunners">St. Louis Gunners</a> of 1934.

If not for the AFL, at least 17 of today's NFL teams would probably never have existed: the ten teams from the AFL, and seven clubs that were instigated by the AFL's presence to some degree. Three NFL franchises were awarded as a direct result of the AFL's competition with the older league: the Minnesota Vikings, who were awarded to Max Winter in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the Atlanta Falcons, whose franchise went to Rankin Smith to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>; and the New Orleans Saints, because of successful anti-trust legislation which let the two leagues merge, and was supported by several Louisiana politicians.

In the case of the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL had long sought to return to the Dallas area after the <a href="Dallas%20Texans%20%28NFL%29">Dallas Texans</a> folded in 1952, but was originally met with strong opposition by <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> owner <a href="George%20Preston%20Marshall">George Preston Marshall</a>, who had enjoyed a monopoly as the only NFL team to represent the American South. Marshall later changed his position after future-Cowboys owner <a href="Clint%20Murchison">Clint Murchison</a> bought the rights to Washington's fight song "<a href="Hail%20to%20the%20Redskins">Hail to the Redskins</a>" and threatened to prevent Marshall from playing it at games. By then, the NFL wanted to quickly award the new Dallas franchise to Murchison so the team could immediately begin play and complete with the AFL's Texans. As a result, the Cowboys played its inaugural season in 1960 without the benefit of the <a href="1960%20NFL%20Draft">NFL draft</a>.

As part of the merger agreement, additional expansion teams would be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring the league to 28 franchises; this requirement was fulfilled when the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> and the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> began play in 1976. In addition, had it not been for the existence of the Oilers from 1960 to 1996, the <a href="Houston%20Texans">Houston Texans</a> also would likely not exist today; the 2002 expansion team restored professional football in Houston after the original charter AFL member Oilers relocated to become the <a href="Tennessee%20Titans">Tennessee Titans</a>.

Kevin Sherrington of "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" has argued that the presence of AFL and the subsequent merger radically altered the fortunes of the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, saving the team "from stinking". Before the merger, the Steelers had long been one of the NFL's worst teams. Constantly lacking the money to build a quality team, the Steelers had only posted eight winning seasons, and just one playoff appearance, since their first year of existence in 1933. They also finished with <a href="1969%20NFL%20season">a 1-13 record in 1969</a>, tied with the <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago Bears</a> for the worst record in the NFL. The $3 million indemnity that the Steelers received for joining the AFC with the rest of the former AFL teams after the merger helped them rebuild into a contender, drafting eventual-<a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>rs like <a href="Terry%20Bradshaw">Terry Bradshaw</a> and <a href="Joe%20Greene%20%28American%20football%29">Joe Greene</a>, and ultimately winning four Super Bowls in the 1970s. Since the 1970 merger, the Steelers have the NFL's highest winning percentage, the most total victories, the most trips to either conference championship game, are tied for the second most trips to the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> (with the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> and <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, trailing only the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a>), and have won an NFL-record six Super Bowl championships.

Perhaps the greatest social legacy of the AFL was the <a href="domino%20effect">domino effect</a> of its policy of being more liberal than the entrenched NFL in offering opportunity for <a href="Black%20players%20in%20American%20professional%20football">black players</a>. While the NFL was still emerging from thirty years of segregation influenced by Washington Redskins' owner <a href="George%20Preston%20Marshall">George Preston Marshall</a>, the AFL actively recruited from small and predominantly black colleges. The AFL's color-blindness led not only to the explosion of black talent on the field, but to the eventual entry of blacks into scouting, coordinating, and ultimately head coaching positions, long after the league ceased to exist.

The AFL's free agents came from several sources. Some were players who could not find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a>. In the late 1950s, many players released by the NFL, or un-drafted and unsigned out of college by the NFL, went North to try their luck with the CFL, and later returned to the states to play in the AFL.

In the league's first years, players such as Oilers' <a href="George%20Blanda">George Blanda</a>, Chargers/Bills' <a href="Jack%20Kemp">Jack Kemp</a>, Texans' <a href="Len%20Dawson">Len Dawson</a>, the NY Titans' <a href="Don%20Maynard">Don Maynard</a>, Raiders/Patriots/Jets' <a href="Babe%20Parilli">Babe Parilli</a>, Pats' <a href="Bob%20Dee">Bob Dee</a> proved to be AFL standouts. Other players such as the Broncos' <a href="Frank%20Tripucka">Frank Tripucka</a>, the Pats' <a href="Gino%20Cappelletti">Gino Cappelletti</a>, the Bills' <a href="Cookie%20Gilchrist">Cookie Gilchrist</a> and the Chargers' <a href="Tobin%20Rote">Tobin Rote</a>, <a href="Sam%20DeLuca">Sam DeLuca</a> and <a href="Dave%20Kocourek">Dave Kocourek</a> also made their mark to give the fledgling league badly needed credibility. Rounding out this mix of potential talent were the true "free agents", the walk-ons and the "wanna-be's", who tried out in droves for the chance to play professional American football.

After the AFL–NFL merger agreement in 1966, and after the AFL's <a href="New%20York%20Jets">Jets</a> defeated the "best team in the history of the NFL", the Colts, a popular misconception fostered by the NFL and spread by media reports was that the AFL defeated the NFL because of the <a href="Common%20Draft">Common Draft</a> instituted in 1967. This apparently was meant to assert that the AFL could not achieve parity as long as it had to compete with the NFL in the draft. But the 1968 Jets had less than a handful of "common draftees". Their stars were honed in the AFL, many of them since the Titans days. As noted below, the AFL got its share of stars long before the "common draft".

Players who chose the AFL to develop their talent included <a href="Lance%20Alworth">Lance Alworth</a> and <a href="Ron%20Mix">Ron Mix</a> of the <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">Chargers</a>, who had also been drafted by the NFL's <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> and <a href="Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> respectively. Both eventually were elected to the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> after earning recognition during their careers as being among the best at their positions. Among specific teams, the 1964 <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> stood out by holding their opponents to a pro football record 913 yards rushing on 300 attempts, while also recording fifty quarterback sacks in a 14-game schedule.

Another example is cited by the <a href="University%20of%20Kansas">University of Kansas</a> website, which describes the 1961 <a href="Bluebonnet%20Bowl">Bluebonnet Bowl</a>, won by KU, and goes on to say ""Two Kansas players, quarterback <a href="John%20Hadl">John Hadl</a> and fullback <a href="Curtis%20McClinton">Curtis McClinton</a>, signed professional contracts on the field immediately after the conclusion of the game. Hadl inked a deal with the "[AFL]" <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a>, and McClinton went to the "[AFL]" <a href="Dallas%20Texans%20%28AFL%29">Dallas Texans</a>."" Between them, in their careers Hadl and McClinton combined for an <a href="American%20Football%20League%20Rookies%20of%20the%20Year">American Football League Rookie of the Year</a> award, seven <a href="American%20Football%20League%20All-Star%20games">AFL All-Star</a> selections, two Pro Bowl selections, a team MVP award, two <a href="American%20Football%20League%20All-Star%20games">AFL All-Star Game</a> MVP awards, two <a href="American%20Football%20League%20playoffs%231962%20Championship">AFL championships</a>, and a <a href="Professional%20American%20football%20championship%20games">World Championship</a>. And these were players selected by the AFL long "before" the "Common Draft".

In 2009, a five-part series, "", on the "<a href="Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29">Showtime</a> Network", refuted many of the long-held misconceptions about the AFL. In it, <a href="Abner%20Haynes">Abner Haynes</a> tells of how his father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the Haynes home; the NFL Cowboys' Tex Schramm is quoted as saying that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's <a href="Dallas%20Texans%20%28AFL%29">Dallas Texans</a>, they would very likely have lost; <a href="George%20Blanda">George Blanda</a> makes a case for more AFL players being inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by pointing out that Hall of Famer <a href="Willie%20Brown%20%28American%20football%29">Willie Brown</a> was cut by the <a href="Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a> because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker <a href="Charlie%20Hennigan">Charlie Hennigan</a> in practice. Later, when Brown was with the Broncos, Hennigan needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break <a href="Lionel%20Taylor">Lionel Taylor</a>'s Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season. Hennigan caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by Brown, Blanda's point being that if Hennigan could do so well against a Hall of Fame DB, he deserves induction, as well.

The AFL also spawned coaches whose style and techniques have profoundly affected the play of professional football to this day. In addition to AFL greats like <a href="Hank%20Stram">Hank Stram</a>, <a href="Lou%20Saban">Lou Saban</a>, <a href="Sid%20Gillman">Sid Gillman</a> and <a href="Al%20Davis">Al Davis</a> were eventual hall of fame coaches such as <a href="Bill%20Walsh%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Bill Walsh</a>, a protégé of Davis with the AFL <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> for one season; and <a href="Chuck%20Noll">Chuck Noll</a>, who worked for Gillman and the AFL <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">LA/San Diego Chargers</a> from 1960 through 1965. Others include <a href="Buddy%20Ryan">Buddy Ryan</a> (AFL's <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>), <a href="Chuck%20Knox">Chuck Knox</a> (Jets), <a href="Walt%20Michaels">Walt Michaels</a> (Jets), and <a href="John%20Madden">John Madden</a> (AFL's <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>). Additionally, many prominent coaches began their pro football careers as players in the AFL, including <a href="Sam%20Wyche">Sam Wyche</a> (<a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>), <a href="Marty%20Schottenheimer">Marty Schottenheimer</a> (<a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>), <a href="Wayne%20Fontes">Wayne Fontes</a> (Jets), and two-time Super Bowl winner <a href="Tom%20Flores">Tom Flores</a> (<a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>). Flores also has a Super Bowl ring as a player (<a href="1969%20AFL%20season">1969</a> <a href="Kansas%20City%20Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>).

As the influence of the AFL continues through the present, the 50th anniversary of its launch was celebrated during <a href="2009%20NFL%20season">2009</a>. The season-long celebration began in August with the 2009 <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Game">Pro Football Hall of Fame Game</a> in <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton, Ohio</a> between two AFC teams (as opposed to the AFC-vs-NFC format the game first adopted in 1971). The opponents were two of the original AFL franchises, the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> and <a href="Tennessee%20Titans">Tennessee Titans</a> (the former <a href="Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a>). Bills' owner <a href="Ralph%20C.%20Wilson%20Jr.">Ralph C. Wilson Jr.</a> (a 2009 Hall of Fame inductee) and Titans' owner <a href="Bud%20Adams">Bud Adams</a> were the only surviving members of the <a href="Foolish%20Club">Foolish Club</a>, the eight original owners of AFL franchises.

The Hall of Fame Game was the first of several "Legacy Weekends", during which each of the "original eight" AFL teams sported uniforms from their AFL era. Each of the 8 teams took part in at least two such "legacy" games. <a href="List%20of%20American%20Football%20League%20officials">On-field officials</a> also wore red-and-white-striped AFL uniforms during these games.

In the fall of 2009, the <a href="Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29">Showtime</a> pay-cable network premiered "", a 5-part documentary series produced by <a href="NFL%20Films">NFL Films</a> that features vintage game film and interviews as well as more recent interviews with those associated with the AFL.

The NFL sanctioned a variety of ""Legacy"" gear to celebrate the AFL anniversary, such as "throwback" jerseys, T-shirts, signs, pennants and banners, including items with the logos and colors of the <a href="Dallas%20Texans%20%28AFL%29">Dallas Texans</a>, <a href="Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a>, and <a href="New%20York%20Titans%20%28football%29">New York Titans</a>, the three of the <a href="Foolish%20Club">Original Eight</a> AFL teams which have changed names or venues. A December 5, 2009 story by Ken Belson in the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" quotes league officials as stating that AFL ""Legacy"" gear made up twenty to thirty percent of the league's annual $3 billion merchandise income. Fan favorites were the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>' vertically striped socks, which could not be re-stocked quickly enough.

Today, two of the NFL's eight divisions are composed entirely of former AFL teams, the <a href="AFC%20West">AFC West</a> (Broncos, Chargers, Chiefs, and Raiders) and the <a href="AFC%20East">AFC East</a> (Bills, Dolphins, Jets, and Patriots). Additionally, the Bengals now play in the <a href="AFC%20North">AFC North</a> and the <a href="Tennessee%20Titans">Tennessee Titans</a> (formerly the Oilers) play in the <a href="AFC%20South">AFC South</a>.

From 1960 to 1968, the AFL determined its champion via a single-elimination playoff game between the winners of its two divisions. The home teams alternated each year by division, so in 1968 the Jets hosted the Raiders, even though Oakland had a better record (this was changed in 1969). In 1963, the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots finished tied with identical records of 7–6–1 in the AFL East Division. There was no tie-breaker protocol in place, so a one-game playoff was held in War Memorial Stadium in December. The visiting Patriots defeated the host Bills 26–8. The Patriots traveled to San Diego as the Chargers completed a three-game season sweep over the weary Patriots with a 51–10 victory. A similar situation occurred in the 1968 season, when the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs finished the regular season tied with identical records of 12–2 in the AFL West Division. The Raiders beat the Chiefs 41–6 in a division playoff to qualify for the AFL Championship Game. In 1969, the final year of the independent AFL, Professional Football's first "<a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild card</a>" playoffs were conducted. A four-team playoff was held, with the second-place teams in each division playing the winner of the other division. The Chiefs upset the Raiders in Oakland 17–7 in the league's Championship, the final AFL game played. The Kansas City Chiefs were the first Super Bowl champion to win two road playoff games and the first wildcard team to win the Super Bowl, although the term "wildcard" was coined by the media, and not used officially until several years later.

"Italics" – Super Bowl Appearance, Bold – Super Bowl Victory

The AFL did not play an All-Star game after its first season in 1960, but did stage All-Star games for the 1961 through 1969 seasons. All-Star teams from the Eastern and Western divisions played each other after every season except 1965. That season, the league champion Buffalo Bills played all-stars from the other teams.

After the 1964 season, the AFL All-Star game had been scheduled for early 1965 in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>' Tulane Stadium. After numerous black players were refused service by a number of area hotels and businesses, black and white players alike called for a <a href="boycott">boycott</a>. Led by Bills players such as <a href="Cookie%20Gilchrist">Cookie Gilchrist</a>, the players successfully lobbied to have the game moved to Houston's <a href="Jeppesen%20Stadium">Jeppesen Stadium</a>.

As chosen by 1969 AFL Hall of Fame Selection Committee Members:

The following is a sample of some records set during the existence of the league. The NFL considers AFL statistics and records equivalent to its own.

A.S. Roma

Associazione Sportiva Roma (, ; "Rome Sport Association"), commonly referred to as simply Roma , is a professional <a href="Football%20in%20Italy">Italian football club</a> based in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20Serie%20B">1951–52</a>.

Roma have won <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a> three times, in <a href="1941%E2%80%9342%20Serie%20A">1941–42</a>, <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Serie%20A">1982–83</a> and <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Serie%20A">2000–01</a>, as well as winning nine <a href="Coppa%20Italia">Coppa Italia</a> titles and two <a href="Supercoppa%20Italiana">Supercoppa Italiana</a> titles.

Since 1953 Roma have played their home games at the <a href="Stadio%20Olimpico">Stadio Olimpico</a>, a venue they share with city rivals <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a>. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the <a href="List%20of%20football%20stadiums%20in%20Italy">second largest</a> of its kind in Italy, with only the <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a> able to seat more. The club plan to move to a <a href="Stadio%20della%20Roma">new stadium</a>, though this is yet to start construction.

The club's home colours are <a href="Tyrian%20purple">Tyrian purple</a> and gold, which gives Roma their nickname "I Giallorossi" (The Yellow and Reds). Their club badge features a she-wolf, an allusion to the <a href="Founding%20of%20Rome">founding myth of Rome</a>.

A.S. Roma was founded in the summer of 1927 when Italo Foschi initiated the merger of three older <a href="Italian%20Football%20Championship">Italian Football Championship</a> clubs from the city of Rome; <a href="Roman%20F.C.">Roman FC</a>, <a href="S.S.%20Alba-Audace%20Roma">SS Alba-Audace</a> and <a href="Fortitudo-Pro%20Roma%20S.G.S.">Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS</a>. The purpose of the merger was to give the Italian capital a strong club to rival that of the more dominant <a href="Northern%20Italy">Northern Italian</a> clubs of the time. The only major Roman club to resist the merger was <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">S.S. Lazio</a> because of the intervention of the army General Vaccaro, member of the club and executive of Italian Football Federation.
The club played its earliest seasons at the "Motovelodromo Appio" stadium, before settling in the working-class streets of <a href="Testaccio">Testaccio</a>, where it built an all-wooden ground "Campo Testaccio"; this was opened in November 1929. An early season in which Roma made a large mark was the <a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20Serie%20A">1930–31</a> championship, the club finished as runners-up behind <a href="Juventus">Juventus</a>. Captain <a href="Attilio%20Ferraris">Attilio Ferraris</a> along with <a href="Guido%20Masetti">Guido Masetti</a>, <a href="Fulvio%20Bernardini">Fulvio Bernardini</a> and <a href="Rodolfo%20Volk">Rodolfo Volk</a> were highly important players during this period.

After a slump in league form and the departure of high key players, Roma eventually rebuilt their squad adding goalscorers such as the Argentine <a href="Enrique%20Guaita">Enrique Guaita</a>. Under the management of <a href="Luigi%20Barbesino">Luigi Barbesino</a>, the Roman club came close to their first title in <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20Serie%20A">1935–36</a>; finishing just one point behind champions <a href="Bologna%20F.C.%201909">Bologna</a>.

Roma returned to form after being inconsistent for much of the late 1930s; Roma recorded an unexpected title triumph in the <a href="1941%E2%80%9342%20Serie%20A">1941–42</a> season by winning their first ever" scudetto" title. The eighteen goals scored by local player <a href="Amedeo%20Amadei">Amedeo Amadei</a> were essential to the <a href="Alfr%C3%A9d%20Schaffer">Alfréd Schaffer</a> coached Roma side winning the title. At the time Italy was involved in World War II and Roma were playing at the "<a href="Stadio%20Nazionale%20PNF">Stadio del Partito Nazionale Fascista</a>".

In the years just after the war, Roma were unable to recapture their league stature from the early 1940s. Roma finished in the lower half of Serie A for five seasons in a row, before eventually succumbing to their only ever relegation to <a href="Serie%20B">Serie B</a> at the end of the <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20Serie%20A">1950–51</a> season; around a decade after their championship victory. Under future <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">national team</a> manager <a href="Giuseppe%20Viani">Giuseppe Viani</a>, promotion straight back up was achieved.

After returning to the Serie A, Roma managed to stabilise themselves as a top half club again with players such as <a href="Egisto%20Pandolfini">Egisto Pandolfini</a>, <a href="Dino%20Da%20Costa">Dino Da Costa</a> and Dane <a href="Helge%20Bron%C3%A9e">Helge Bronée</a>. Their best finish of this period was under the management of Englishman <a href="Jesse%20Carver">Jesse Carver</a>, when in <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20Serie%20A">1954–55</a> they finished as runners-up, after <a href="Udinese%20Calcio">Udinese</a> who originally finished second were relegated for corruption.
Although Roma were unable to break into the top four during the following decade, they did achieve some measure of cup success. Their first honour outside of Italy was recorded in <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup%201960-61">1960–61</a> when Roma won the <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> by beating <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> 4–2 in the finals. A few years later Roma won their first <a href="Coppa%20Italia">Coppa Italia</a> trophy in 1963–64, by beating <a href="Torino%20F.C.">Torino</a> 1–0.

Their lowest point came during the 1964–65 season when manager <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20Lorenzo">Juan Carlos Lorenzo</a> announced that the club could not pay its players and was unlikely to be able to afford to travel to <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a> to fulfil its next fixture. Supporters kept the club going with a fundraiser at the Sistine Theatre and bankruptcy was avoided with the election of a new club president <a href="Franco%20Evangelisti%20%28politician%29">Franco Evangelisti</a>.

Their second Coppa Italia trophy was won in 1968–69 when it competed in a small league like system. <a href="Giacomo%20Losi">Giacomo Losi</a> set a Roma appearance record during 1969 with 450 appearances in all competitions, the record he set would last for 38 years.

Roma were able to add another cup to their collection in 1972, with a 3–1 victory over <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> in the <a href="Anglo-Italian%20Cup">Anglo-Italian Cup</a>. During much of the 1970s Roma's appearance in the top half of Serie A was sporadic. The best place the club were able to achieve during the decade was third in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Serie%20A">1974–75</a>. Notable players who turned out for the club during this period included midfielders <a href="Giancarlo%20De%20Sisti">Giancarlo De Sisti</a> and <a href="Francesco%20Rocca">Francesco Rocca</a>.

The dawning of a newly successful era in Roma's footballing history was brought in with another Coppa Italia victory, they beat <a href="Torino%20F.C.">Torino</a> on penalties to win the 1979–80 cup. Roma would reach heights in the league which they had not touched since the 1940s by narrowly and <a href="Turone%27s%20goal">controversially</a> finishing as runners-up to <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Serie%20A">1980–81</a>. Former <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> player <a href="Nils%20Liedholm">Nils Liedholm</a> was the manager at the time, with players such as <a href="Bruno%20Conti">Bruno Conti</a>, <a href="Agostino%20Di%20Bartolomei">Agostino Di Bartolomei</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Pruzzo">Roberto Pruzzo</a> and <a href="Falc%C3%A3o">Falcão</a>.
The second "scudetto" did not elude Roma for much longer; in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Serie%20A">1982–83</a> the Roman club won the title for the first time in 41 years, amidst celebrations in the capital. The <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Serie%20A">following season</a> Roma finished as runners-up in Italy and collected a Coppa Italia title, they also finished as runners-up in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> final of <a href="1984%20European%20Cup%20Final">1984</a>. The European Cup final with <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> ended in a 1–1 draw with a goal from Pruzzo, but Roma eventually lost the penalty shoot-out. Roma's successful run in the 1980s would finish with a runners-up spot in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Serie%20A">1985–86</a> and a Coppa Italia victory, beating out <a href="U.C.%20Sampdoria">Sampdoria</a> 3–2.

After that a comparative decline began in the league, one of the few league highs from the following period being a third-place finish in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Serie%20A">1987–88</a>. At the start of the 1990s the club was involved in an all-Italian <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> final, where they lost 2–1 to <a href="F.C.%20Internazionale%20Milano">Internazionale</a> in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20UEFA%20Cup">1991</a>; the same season the club won its <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Coppa%20Italia">seventh</a> Coppa Italia trophy and ended runners-up to <a href="U.C.%20Sampdoria">Sampdoria</a> in the <a href="Supercoppa%20Italiana">Supercoppa Italiana</a>. Aside from finishing runners-up to <a href="Torino%20F.C.">Torino</a> in a Coppa Italia final, the rest of the decade was largely sub-par in the history of Roma; especially in the league where the highest they could manage was fourth in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Serie%20A">1997–98</a>. The early 1990s also saw the emergence of homegrown striker <a href="Francesco%20Totti">Francesco Totti</a> who would go on to be an important member of the team and the club's iconic captain.

Roma returned to form in the 2000s, starting the decade in great style by winning their third ever Serie A title in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Serie%20A">2000–01</a>; the "scudetto" was won on the last day of the season by beating <a href="Parma%20F.C.">Parma</a> 3–1, edging out Juventus by two points. The club's captain, <a href="Francesco%20Totti">Francesco Totti</a> was a large reason for the title victory and he would become one of the main heroes in the club's history, going on to break several <a href="A.S.%20Roma%20statistics%20and%20records">club records</a>. Other important players during this period included <a href="Aldair">Aldair</a>, <a href="Cafu">Cafu</a>, <a href="Gabriel%20Batistuta">Gabriel Batistuta</a>, and <a href="Vincenzo%20Montella">Vincenzo Montella</a>.

The club attempted to defend the title in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Serie%20A">following season</a> but ended as runners-up to <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> by just one point. This would be the start of Roma finishing as runners-up many times in both Serie A and <a href="Coppa%20Italia">Coppa Italia</a> during the 2000s; they lost out 4–2 to <a href="A.C.%20Milan">AC Milan</a> in the Coppa Italia final of <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Coppa%20Italia">2003</a> and lost out to Milan again by finishing second in <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a> for the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Serie%20A">2003–04</a> season. The club also re-capitalized several time in 2003–04 season. In November 2003 €37.5 million was injected by "Roma 2000" to cover the half-year loss and loss carried from previous year. and again on 30 June for €44.57 million. Through stock market, a further €19.850 million of new shares issued, and at the year end, the share capital was €19.878 million, which was unchanged . The following season also saw the departure of <a href="Walter%20Samuel">Walter Samuel</a> for €25 million and <a href="Emerson%20Ferreira%20da%20Rosa">Emerson</a> for €28 million, which decreased the strength of the squad, thus "Giallorossi" finished in eighth place, one of the worst of recent season.

On 9 July 2006, Roma's Francesco Totti, <a href="Daniele%20De%20Rossi">Daniele De Rossi</a> and <a href="Simone%20Perrotta">Simone Perrotta</a> were part of the Italy team that beat France in the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20final">2006 FIFA World Cup final</a>. A <a href="2006%20Serie%20A%20scandal">Serie A scandal</a> was revealed during 2006 and Roma were one of the teams not involved; after punishments were handed out, Roma was re-classified as runners-up for <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Serie%20A">2005–06</a>; the same season in which they finished second in the Coppa Italia losing to <a href="F.C.%20Internazionale%20Milano">Internazionale</a>. In the two following seasons, <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Serie%20A">2006–07</a> and <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Serie%20A">2007–08</a>, Roma finished as Serie A runners-up, meaning that in the 2000s Roma have finished in the top two positions more than any other decade in their history Meanwhile, in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> during both of these seasons, they reached the quarter-finals before going out to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Despite the sloppy start in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2008–09 Champions League</a>, Roma managed to reach the knockout stage ahead of <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in their group, thus finishing for the first time in their history as winners of the group stage. The "Giallorossi", however, would lose to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the knockout stage on penalty kicks, ending their Champions League campaign.

After a disappointing start to the 2009–10 season, <a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a> replaced <a href="Luciano%20Spalletti">Luciano Spalletti</a> as head coach. At the time of the switch, Roma lay bottom of the Serie A table after losses to Juventus and Genoa. Despite this setback, Roma would later embark on an incredible unbeaten streak of 24 matches in the league – with the last of the 24 being a 2–1 win over rivals Lazio, whereby Roma came from 1–0 down at half-time to defeat their city rivals after Ranieri courageously substituted both Totti and De Rossi at the interval. The Giallorossi were on top of the table at one point, before a loss to U.C. Sampdoria later in the season. Roma would finish runners-up to Inter yet again in both Serie A and the Coppa Italia. This rounded out a highly successful decade in Roma's history, following somewhat mediocre results of the 1990s. During the 2000s, Roma had finally recaptured the "Scudetto", two Coppa Italia trophies, and their first two Supercoppa Italiana titles. Other notable contributions to the club's history have included a return to the Champions League quarter-finals (in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2006–07</a> and <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2007–08</a> editions) since 1984, six runners up positions in the league, four Coppa Italia finals and three Supercoppa finals – marking Roma's greatest ever decade.

In the summer of 2010, the Sensi family agreed to relinquish their control of Roma as part of a debt-settlement agreement. This brought an end to the presidential reign of the Sensi family, who had presided over the club since 1993. Until a new owner was appointed, Rosella Sensi would continue her directorial role of the club. The <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20A.S.%20Roma%20season">2010–11 season</a> had once again seen Roma start off with mixed fortunes on both a domestic and European level. These included losses against teams like <a href="Cagliari%20Calcio">Cagliari</a>, <a href="Brescia%20Calcio">Brescia</a> and a 2–0 defeat against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the group stages of the Champions League, a match which saw manager <a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a> openly criticised by his players. However, these were accompanied by victories against Inter and a sensational victory against Bayern in the return fixture, which saw Roma fight back from 0–2 down at half-time to emerge as 3–2 winners. Following a series of poor results which saw Roma engage in a winless-streak of five consecutive matches, Ranieri resigned as head coach in February 2011, and former striker <a href="Vincenzo%20Montella">Vincenzo Montella</a> was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. It was also during this season that Roma icon <a href="Francesco%20Totti">Francesco Totti</a> scored his 200th Serie A goal against <a href="ACF%20Fiorentina">Fiorentina</a> in March 2011 – becoming only the sixth ever player to achieve such a feat.

On 16 April 2011, the takeover contract was closed with an American investment group led by <a href="Thomas%20R.%20DiBenedetto">Thomas R. DiBenedetto</a>, with <a href="James%20Pallotta">James Pallotta</a>, Michael Ruane and Richard D'Amore as partners. DiBenedetto became the 22nd president of the club, serving from 27 September 2011 to 27 August 2012 and was succeeded by Pallotta. The new intermediate holding company, NEEP Roma Holding, was 60% owned by American's "AS Roma SPV, LLC" and the rest (40%) was retained by the creditor of Sensi, <a href="UniCredit">UniCredit</a>; NEEP in turn owned all shares held previously by Sensi (about 67%) with the rest free float in the stock market. UniCredit later disinvested NEEP Roma Holding to sold to "AS Roma SPV, LLC" and Pallotta.

The new ownership immediately went into effect by making significant changes in the club, hiring <a href="Walter%20Sabatini">Walter Sabatini</a> as director of football and former Spanish international and <a href="FC%20Barcelona%20B">Barcelona B</a> coach <a href="Luis%20Enrique%20%28footballer%29">Luis Enrique</a> as manager. The first high-profile player signings from the duo were attacking midfielder <a href="%C3%89rik%20Lamela">Érik Lamela</a> from <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate">River Plate</a>, forward <a href="Bojan%20Krki%C4%87">Bojan</a> from <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, goalkeeper <a href="Maarten%20Stekelenburg">Maarten Stekelenburg</a> from <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> and unattached defender <a href="Gabriel%20Heinze">Gabriel Heinze</a>. The club also sold and released defender <a href="John%20Arne%20Riise">John Arne Riise</a>, goalkeeper <a href="Doni%20%28footballer%29">Doni</a> and forwards <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20M%C3%A9nez">Jérémy Ménez</a> and <a href="Mirko%20Vu%C4%8Dini%C4%87">Mirko Vučinić</a>. At the financial level, the company had recapitalized for more than €100 million, the last recapitalization occurring in the early 2000s.

Roma, however, was eliminated from <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2011–12 UEFA Europa League</a> play-off round. After the formal takeover on 18 August, Roma bought forward <a href="Dani%20Osvaldo">Dani Osvaldo</a>, midfielders <a href="Miralem%20Pjani%C4%87">Miralem Pjanić</a> and <a href="Fernando%20Gago">Fernando Gago</a> and defender <a href="Simon%20Kj%C3%A6r">Simon Kjær</a>, as well as youngster <a href="Fabio%20Borini">Fabio Borini</a>, which cost the club more than €40 million. In 2012, Pallotta became the new president.

The 2012–13 pre-season started with the June hiring of former manager <a href="Zden%C4%9Bk%20Zeman">Zdeněk Zeman</a>. Zeman replaced <a href="Luis%20Enrique%20%28footballer%29">Luis Enrique</a> who resigned at the end of the 2011–12 season. Enrique's lone season reign had seen the disappointing loss to <a href="%C5%A0K%20Slovan%20Bratislava">Slovan Bratislava</a> in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> as well as the inability to qualify for international competitions for the 2012–13 season. Roma eventually finished 7th, losing the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> chase to rivals <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a>, <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a> and <a href="Inter%20Milan">Internazionale</a>. Zeman brought back his high-scoring 4–3–3 formation and his hard working ethic which successfully guided former team <a href="Delfino%20Pescara%201936">Pescara</a> to the Serie A. He was, however, sacked on 2 February 2013. He was replaced by caretaker manager <a href="Aurelio%20Andreazzoli">Aurelio Andreazzoli</a>, who's reign saw the continuation of a disappointing season, with the team ending up in 6th place in <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a>, whilst also losing 1–0 to rivals <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a> in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Coppa%20Italia">Coppa Italia</a> final. As a result, Roma missed out on European competition for the second season in a row.

On 12 June 2013, Pallotta announced that <a href="Rudi%20Garc%C3%ADa">Rudi García</a> had been appointed the new manager of Roma. He enjoyed a fantastic start to his Roma career, winning his first ten consecutive games (an all-time <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a> record) including a 2–0 derby win against Lazio, a 0–3 victory away to Inter and a 2–0 home win over title rivals <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a>. During this run, Roma scored 24 times while conceding just once, away to <a href="Parma%20F.C.">Parma</a>. The 2013–14 season saw one of Roma's best ever in <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a>, the club tallying an impressive 85 points and finishing second to <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, who won the league with a record-breaking 102 points. Roma's defense was significantly better than in previous seasons, with only 25 goals conceded and a total of 21 clean sheets, including nine in their first ten matches.

In 2014–15, Roma finished second behind Juventus for the second consecutive season after a poor run of form in 2015. At the end of season the club was sanctioned for loss making and breaking <a href="UEFA%20Financial%20Fair%20Play%20Regulations">UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations</a>.

On 13 January 2016, Garcia was sacked after a run of one win in seven Serie A games. <a href="Luciano%20Spalletti">Luciano Spalletti</a> was appointed manager of Roma for his second spell. On 21 February, Totti publicly criticised Spalletti due to his own lack of playing-time since returning from injury; as a result, he was subsequently dropped by Spalletti for Roma's 5–0 win over <a href="U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo">Palermo</a>, with the decision causing an uproar among the fans and in the media. After their initial disagreements, Spalletti began to use Totti as an immediate impact substitute, which proved to be an effective decision, as the Roma number 10 rediscovered his form, and contributed with four goals and an assist after coming off the bench in five consecutive Serie A games; as a result, Spalletti was able to lead Roma from a mid-table spot to a third-place finish in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Serie%20A">Serie A</a>, clinching the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> play-off spot.

During summer 2016 Roma lost star midfielder <a href="Miralem%20Pjani%C4%87">Miralem Pjanić</a> to rivals Juventus in order to improve its financial position.

On 13 June 2017, <a href="Eusebio%20Di%20Francesco">Eusebio Di Francesco</a> was appointed as Roma manager, replacing Spalletti, who left for <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter</a>.

Roma's colours of <a href="Tyrian%20purple">imperial purple</a> with a golden yellow trim represents the traditional colours of Rome, the official seal of the "<a href="Comune%20di%20Roma">Comune di Roma</a>" features the same colours. The gold and the purple-red represent <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman imperial</a> dignity. White shorts and black socks are usually worn with the red shirt, however in particularly high key games the shorts and socks are the same colour as the home shirt.

The kit itself was originally worn by "<a href="Roman%20F.C.">Roman Football Club</a>"; one of the three clubs who merged to form the current incarnation in 1927. Because of the colours they wear, Roma are often nicknamed "i giallorossi" meaning the yellow-reds. Roma's away kit is traditionally white, with a third kit changing colour from time to time.

A popular nickname for the club is "i lupi" (the wolves), the animal has always featured on the club's badge in different forms throughout their history. Currently the emblem of the team is the one which was used when the club was first founded. It portrays the female wolf with the two infant brothers <a href="Romulus%20and%20Remus">Romulus and Remus</a>, illustrating the <a href="Founding%20of%20Rome">myth of the founding of Rome</a>, superimposed on a bipartite golden yellow over maroon red shield. In the myth from which the club take their nickname and logo, the twins (sons of <a href="Mars%20%28god%29">Mars</a> and <a href="Rhea%20Silvia">Rhea Silvia</a>) are thrown into the <a href="River%20Tiber">River Tiber</a> by their uncle <a href="Amulius">Amulius</a>, a she-wolf saved the twins and looked after them. Eventually the two twins took revenge on Amulius, before falling out themselves; <a href="Romulus">Romulus</a> killed <a href="Remus">Remus</a> and as thus was made king of a new city named in his honour, Rome.

The very first sport facility A.S. Roma used was <a href="Motovelodromo%20Appio">Motovelodromo Appio</a> which was previously used by <a href="S.S.%20Alba-Audace%20Roma">Alba-Audace</a>. A.S. Roma only played the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20Divisione%20Nazionale">1927–28 season</a> there until they moved to <a href="Campo%20Testaccio">Campo Testaccio</a> the very next season. Campo Testaccio was used through 1929 to 1940. The team moved later to the <a href="Stadio%20Nazionale%20PNF">Stadio Nazionale del PNF</a> where they spent 13 years before moving once again.

In the 1953–54 season A.S. Roma moved to the Olympic arena, <a href="Stadio%20Olimpico">Stadio Olimpico</a>, which it shares with Lazio. The arena has undergone several changes over the years. The most significant change took place in the nineties when Stadio Olimpico was demolished and then reconstructed to for the <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Football World Cup 1990</a>, witch took place in Italy. A.S. Roma has played almost every season since 1953–54, with exception of the 1989–90 seasons due to the reconstruction of Stadio Olimpico. That year Roma played its home games at <a href="Stadio%20Flaminio">Stadio Flaminio</a>.

On 30 December 2012, AS Roma president <a href="James%20Pallotta">James Pallotta</a> announced the construction of a new stadium in the <a href="Tor%20di%20Valle">Tor di Valle</a> area of Rome. The new stadium, <a href="Stadio%20della%20Roma">Stadio della Roma</a> will have a capacity of 52,500 spectators. On 2 February 2017, the <a href="Lazio">Region of Lazio</a> and the mayor of Rome rejected the proposal to build a new stadium, however, was later approved on 24 February after final review of the stadium's design adjustments. In August 2017, the stadium hit another delay, forcing Roma to renew their lease with the Stadio Olimpico until 2020. It is still uncertain how long it will take to open the stadium.


A sports centre located in at kilometer 3600 in south-east of Rome was purchased on 22 July 1977 by the then club president <a href="Gaetano%20Anzalone">Gaetano Anzalone</a>. It was opened on 23 July 1979 as Anzalone's final act as president. The complex had its first expansion in 1984 when the club was handled by <a href="Dino%20Viola">Dino Viola</a> and another in 1998 under the chairmanship of <a href="Franco%20Sensi">Franco Sensi</a>. The sports centre official name is <a href="Fulvio%20Bernardini%20di%20Trigoria">Fulvio Bernardini di Trigoria</a>, named after the club icon <a href="Fulvio%20Bernardini">Fulvio Bernardini</a>.

The sports centre is also known for hosting the <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentinian football team</a> during the <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990 FIFA World Cup</a>.

Roma is the fifth-most supported football club in Italy, behind <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, <a href="Inter%20Milan">Internazionale</a>, <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> and <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a>, with around 7% of Italian football fans supporting the club (according to the Doxa Institute-L'Espresso's research of April 2006). Historically, the largest section of Roma supporters in the city of Rome have come from the <a href="Inner%20city">inner-city</a>, especially <a href="Testaccio">Testaccio</a>.

The traditional <a href="ultras">ultras</a> group of the club was "Commando Ultrà Curva Sud" commonly abbreviated as "CUCS". This group was founded by the merger of many smaller groups and was considered one of the most historic in the history of <a href="European%20football">European football</a>. By the mid-1990s, however, "CUCS" had been usurped by rival factions and ultimately broke up. Since that time, the "<a href="Curva%20%28stadia%29">Curva</a> Sud" of the Stadio Olimpico has been controlled by more right-wing groups, including "A.S. Roma Ultras", "Boys", "Giovinezza" and others. The oldest group, "Fedayn", is <a href="apolitical">apolitical</a>, however, and politics is not the main identity of Roma, just a part of their overall identity. Besides ultras groups, it is believed that Roma fans support the left as opposed to Lazio supporters, that are notoriously proud of their right-wing affiliation. In September 2009, the club unveiled plans to build a new <a href="Stadio%20Franco%20Sensi">55,000-capacity stadium</a> in Rome's western suburbs.

In November 2015, Roma's ultras and their Lazio counterparts boycotted Roma's 1–0 victory in the <a href="Derby%20della%20Capitale">Derby della Capitale</a> in protest at new safety measures imposed at the Stadio Olimpico. The measures, imposed by Rome’s prefect, Franco Gabrielli, had involved plastic glass dividing walls being installed in both the Curva Sud and Curva Nord, splitting the sections behind each goal in two. Both sets of ultras continued their protests for the rest of the season, including during Roma's 4–1 victory in the return fixture. Lazio's ultras returned to the Curva Nord for Roma's 1–4 victory in December 2016, but the Roma ultras continue to boycott games.
The most known club anthem is "Roma (non-si discute, si ama)", also known as "Roma Roma", by singer <a href="Antonello%20Venditti">Antonello Venditti</a>. The title roughly means, "Roma is not to be questioned, it is to be loved," and it is sung before each match. The song "Grazie Roma", by the same singer, is played at the end of victorious home games. Recently, the main riff of <a href="The%20White%20Stripes">The White Stripes</a>' song "<a href="Seven%20Nation%20Army">Seven Nation Army</a>" has also become widely popular at games.

In <a href="Italian%20football">Italian football</a>, Roma is a club with many rivalries; first and foremost is their rivalry with Lazio, the club with whom they share the Stadio Olimpico. The <a href="Local%20derby">derby</a> between the two is called the "<a href="Derby%20della%20Capitale">Derby della Capitale</a>", it is amongst the most heated and emotional <a href="Major%20football%20rivalries">footballing rivalries</a> in the world. The fixture has seen some occasional instances of violence in the past, including the death of Lazio fan Vincenzo Paparelli in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Serie%20A">1979–80</a> as a result of an <a href="Flare%20gun">emergency flare</a> fired from the Curva Sud, and the abandonment of a game in March 2004, following unfounded rumours of a fatality which led to violence outside the stadium.

With Napoli, Roma also compete in the "<a href="Derby%20del%20Sole">Derby del Sole</a>", rivalry meaning the "Derby of the Sun". Nowadays, fans also consider other Serie A giants like Juventus (rivalry born especially in the 1980s), Milan and Inter (increased in recent years) among their rivals, as these four compete for the top three spots in the league table to secure a spot in the Champions League.

There have been a number of instances of conflict in recent years between some Roma supporters and fans of English clubs, and the subsequent violence outside the stadium which saw a number of <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> fans stabbed. Since then, there have been further instances of some English supporters being attacked and stabbed in Rome, including incidents in 2001 when Liverpool visited Roma twice and subsequent clashes with <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> fans in 2006 and <a href="2007%20A.S.%20Roma%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20conflict">Manchester United fans in 2007</a>. In March 2009, a coach carrying <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> supporters was attacked by a group of Roma ultras just outside the Stadio Olimpico. The coach's windows were smashed and at least one person entered the vehicle, letting off a flare and stabbed a supporter in the knee.

Roma have had numerous chairmen ( or ) over the course of their history, some of which have been the owners and co-owners of the club, some of them were nominated by the owners. <a href="Franco%20Sensi">Franco Sensi</a> was the chairman until his death in 2008, with his daughter, Roma CEO <a href="Rosella%20Sensi">Rosella Sensi</a> taking his place as chairman. Here is a complete list of Roma chairmen from 1927 until the present day.
Roma have had many managers and trainers running the team during their history, here is a chronological list of them from 1927 onwards.

<a href="Francesco%20Totti">Francesco Totti</a> holds Roma's official appearance record, having made 785 (as of 20 May 2017) appearances in all competitions, over the course of 25 seasons from 1993 until 2017. He also holds the record for Serie A appearances with 618, as he passed <a href="Giacomo%20Losi">Giacomo Losi</a> on 1 March 2008 during a home match against <a href="S.S.D.%20Parma%20Calcio%201913">Parma</a>.

Including all competitions, Totti is the all-time leading goalscorer for Roma with 307 goals since joining the club, 250 of which were scored in Serie A (another Roma record). <a href="Roberto%20Pruzzo">Roberto Pruzzo</a>, who was the all-time topscorer since 1988, comes in second in all competitions with 138. In the 1930–31 season, <a href="Rodolfo%20Volk">Rodolfo Volk</a> scored 29 goals in Serie A over the course of a single season; not only was he the league's top scorer that year, but he set a Roma record for most goals scored in a season which was later equalled by <a href="Edin%20D%C5%BEeko">Edin Džeko</a> in the 2016–17 season.

Its major founders Fortitudo and Alba having been relegated at the end of 1926–27 campaign, new-founded Roma had to take part to Southern First Division championship (Serie B) for its inaugural season; nevertheless the FIGC decided on a special enlargement of first level division re-admitting AS Roma and SSC Napoli. The first ever official game participated in by Roma was in the <a href="Divisione%20Nazionale">National Division</a>, the predecessor of Serie A, of <a href="Divisione%20Nazionale%201927%E2%80%9328">1927–28</a>, against <a href="A.S.%20Livorno%20Calcio">Livorno</a>; Roma won 2–0. The biggest ever victory recorded by Roma was 9–0 against <a href="U.S.%20Cremonese">Cremonese</a> during the Serie A season of <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20Serie%20A">1929–30</a>. The heaviest defeat Roma have ever suffered is 7–1, which has occurred three times, first against <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> during <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20Serie%20A">1931–32</a>, then against <a href="Torino%20F.C.">Torino</a> in <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20Serie%20A">1947–48</a> and most recently against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2006–07</a>.

Since 1999, during Franco Sensi's period in charge, Associazione Sportiva Roma has been a listed <a href="Societ%C3%A0%20per%20azioni">Società per azioni</a> on <a href="Borsa%20Italiana">Borsa Italiana</a>. From 2004 to 2011, Roma's <a href="share%20%28finance%29">share</a>s are distributed between; 67.1% to Compagnia Italpetroli SpA (the Sensi family "<a href="Holding%20company">holding</a>"; <a href="Banca%20di%20Roma">Banca di Roma</a> later acquired 49% stake on Italpetroli due to debt restructuring) and 32.9% to other public shareholders.

Along with Lazio and Juventus, Roma is one of only three quotated Italian clubs. According to <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">The Football Money League</a> published by consultants <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a>, in the 2010–11 season, Roma was the 15th highest-earning football club in the world with an <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League%23Full%20listing">estimated revenue</a> of €143.5 million.

In April 2008, after months of speculation, <a href="George%20Soros">George Soros</a> was confirmed by Rosella Sensi, CEO of Italian Serie A association football club A.S. Roma, to be bidding for a takeover. The takeover bid was successively rejected by the Sensi family, who instead preferred to maintain the club's ownership. On 17 August 2008 club chairman and owner <a href="Franco%20Sensi">Franco Sensi</a> died after a long illness; his place at the chairmanship of the club was successively taken by his daughter Rosella.

Since the takeover in 2011, NEEP Roma Holding S.p.A. has owned all shares Sensi previously hold. NEEP, itself a joint venture, was held by DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC (later renamed to AS Roma SPV, LLC) and <a href="Unicredit">Unicredit</a> in 60–40 ratio from 2011 to 2013, which the former had four real person shareholders in equal ratio, led by future Roma president <a href="Thomas%20R.%20DiBenedetto">Thomas R. DiBenedetto</a> (2011–12). The takeover also activated a mandatory bid of shares from the general public, however not all minority shareholders were willing to sell their shares. The mandatory bid meant NEEP held 78.038% of shares of AS Roma (increased from 67.1% of the Sensi). On 1 August 2013, the president of Roma as well as one of the four American shareholders of AS Roma SPV, LLC, <a href="James%20Pallotta">James Pallotta</a>, bought an additional 9% shares of NEEP Roma Holding from Unicredit (through Raptor Holdco LLC), as the bank was not willing to fully participate in the capital increase of NEEP from €120,000 to €160,008,905 (excluding <a href="share%20premium">share premium</a>). On 4 April 2014 <a href="Starwood%20Capital%20Group">Starwood Capital Group</a> also became the fifth shareholder of AS Roma SPV, as well as forming a strategic partnership with AS Roma SpA to develop real estate around the new stadium. The private investment firm was represented by Zsolt Kohalmi in AS Roma SPV, who was appointed on 4 April as a partner and head of European acquisitions of the firm. On 11 August 2014, UniCredit sold the remain shares on NEEP (of 31%) for €33 million which meant AS Roma SPV LLC (91%) and Raptor Holdco LLC (9%) were the sole intermediate holding company of AS Roma SpA.

Since re-capitalization in 2003–04, Roma had a short-lived financial self-sustainability, until the takeover in 2011. The club had set up a special amortisation fund using <a href="Articolo%2018-bis%20Legge%2091/1981">Articolo 18-bis Legge 91/1981</a> mainly for the abnormal signings prior 2002–03 season, (such as <a href="Davide%20Bombardini">Davide Bombardini</a> for €11 million account value in June 2002, when the flopped player exchange boosted 2001–02 season result) and the tax payment of 2002–03 was rescheduled. In 2004–05, Roma made a net profit of €10,091,689 and followed by €804,285 in 2005–06. In 2006–07 season the accounting method changed to IFRS, which meant that the 2005–06 result was reclassified as net loss of €4,051,905 and 2006–07 season was net income of €10,135,539 (€14.011 million as a group). Moreover, the special fund (€80,189,123) was removed from the asset and co-currently for the equity as scheduled, meant Roma group had a negative equity of €8.795 million on 30 June 2007. In 2007–08, Roma made a net income of €18,699,219. (€19 million as a group) However, 2008–09 saw the decrease of gate and TV income, co-currently with finishing sixth in Serie A, which saw Roma made a net loss of €1,894,330. (€1.56 million as a <a href="Consolidated%20financial%20statement">group</a>) The gate and TV income further slipped in 2009–10 with a net loss of €21,917,292 (already boosted by the sale of <a href="Alberto%20Aquilani">Alberto Aquilani</a>; €22 million as a group) despite sporting success (finishing in second place in <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Serie%20A">2009–10</a>). Moreover, despite a positive equity as a separate company (€105,142,589), the AS Roma Group had a negative equity on the <a href="Consolidated%20financial%20statement">consolidated balance sheet</a>, and fell from +€8.8 million to −€13.2 million. In the 2010–11 season, Roma was administrated by UniCredit as the Sensi family failed to repay the bank and the club was put on the market, which also saw Roma not have a major signing in 2010–11. Concurrently with no selling profit on the players, Roma's net loss rose to €30,589,137 (€30.778 million as a group) and the new owner already planned a re-capitalization after the mandatory bid on the shares. On the positive side, TV income was increased from €75,150,744 to €78,041,642, and gate income increased from €23,821,218 to €31,017,179. This was because Roma entered <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2010–11 Champions League</a>, which counter-weighed the effect of the new collective agreement of Serie A. In 2011–12, the renewal of squad and participation in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2011–12 UEFA Europa League</a> had worsened the financial result, which the €50 million capital increase (in advance) was counter-weighted totally by the net loss. In the 2012–13 season, the participation in domestic league only, was not only not harmful to the revenue but increase in gate income as well as decrease in wage bill, however Roma still did not yet break even (€40.130 million net loss in consolidated accounts). NEEP Roma also re-capitalized AS Roma in advance for another €26,550,000 during 2012–13. A proposed capital increase by €100 million for Roma was announced on 25 June 2014; however, until 22 May 2014, NEEP already injected €108 million into the club, which depends on public subscription; more than €8 million would convert to medium-long-term loan from shareholder instead of becoming share capital.

One of the subsidiaries of Roma (joint venture with football clubs Lazio, 37.5% x2 and Parma, 25%), Società Diritti Sportivi S.r.l., was in the process of liquidation since 2005. The company was a joint-venture of four football clubs, including Fiorentina. After the bankruptcy of the old "Viola", however, both Roma and Lazio had increased their shares ratio from 25% to 37.5%. Another subsidiary, "Soccer S.A.S. di Brand Management S.r.l.", was a <a href="special-purpose%20entity">special-purpose entity</a> (SPV) that Roma sold their brand to the subsidiary in 2007. In February 2015, another SPV, "ASR Media and Sponsorship S.r.l", was set up in order to secure a five-year bank loan of €175 million from <a href="Goldman%20Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a>, for three month <a href="Euribor">Euribor</a> (min. 0.75%) + 6.25% spread (i.e. min. 7% interests rate p.a.).

In 2015, Inter and Roma were the only two Italian clubs that were sanctioned by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> for breaking <a href="UEFA%20Financial%20Fair%20Play%20Regulations">UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations</a>.

A.S. Roma had a team in the <a href="Superleague%20Formula">Superleague Formula</a> race car series where teams were sponsored by football clubs. Roma's driver was ex-<a href="IndyCar%20Series">IndyCar Series</a> driver <a href="Franck%20Perera">Franck Perera</a>. The team had posted three podiums and was operated by <a href="Alan%20Docking%20Racing">Alan Docking Racing</a>.

Abu Nidal Organization

The Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) is the most common name for the Palestinian group Fatah–The Revolutionary Council ("Fatah al-Majles al-Thawry").
The ANO is named after its founder <a href="Abu%20Nidal">Abu Nidal</a>. It was created by a split from <a href="Yasser%20Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a>'s <a href="Fatah">Fatah</a> faction of the <a href="Palestinian%20Liberation%20Organization">PLO</a> in 1974. The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and the European Union.

The ANO was originally formed as a result of the 1974 <a href="Rejectionist%20Front">Rejectionist Front</a> split in the PLO, after Arafat's Fatah had pushed through amendments of the PLO's goals, which were seen as a step towards compromise with <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. Abu Nidal then moved to <a href="Ba%27athist%20Iraq">Ba'athist Iraq</a> where he set up the ANO, which soon began a vicious string of terrorist attacks.

It hasn't clearly defined its ideological position, but was clearly opposed to any form of compromise or negotiation with Israel. It is known as one of the most uncompromisingly militant Palestinian groups ever. It had an estimated membership of several hundred, but its strength today is not known.

The ANO carried out attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring almost 1650 persons. Targets include the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Israel, moderate <a href="Palestinian%20diaspora">Palestinians</a>, the <a href="PLO">PLO</a>, and various <a href="Arab%20world">Arab</a> and European countries. The group has not attacked Western targets since the late 1980s.

Major attacks included the <a href="Rome%20and%20Vienna%20Airport%20Attacks">Rome and Vienna Airport Attacks</a> in December 1985, the <a href="Neve%20Shalom%20synagogue">Neve Shalom synagogue</a> in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and the <a href="Pan%20Am%20Flight%2073">Pan Am Flight 73</a> hijacking in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> in September 1986, and the "<a href="City%20of%20Poros%20%28ship%29">City of Poros</a>" day-excursion ship attack in Greece in July 1988.

The ANO has been especially noted for its uncompromising stance on negotiation with Israel, treating anything less than all-out military struggle against Israel as treachery. This led the group to perform numerous attacks against the PLO, which had made clear it accepted a negotiated solution to the conflict. Fatah-RC is believed to have assassinated PLO deputy chief <a href="Abu%20Iyad">Abu Iyad</a> and PLO security chief Abu Hul in <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> in January 1991. It assassinated a <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>ian diplomat in <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> in January 1994 and has been linked to the killing of the PLO representative there. Noted PLO moderate <a href="Issam%20Sartawi">Issam Sartawi</a> was killed by the Fatah-RC in 1983. In the late 1970s, the group also made failed assassination attempt on the present Palestinian <a href="President%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20National%20Authority">president</a> and PLO chairman, <a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas">Mahmoud Abbas</a>. These attacks, and numerous others, led to the PLO issuing a death sentence "in absentia" against Abu Nidal. In the early 1990s, it made an attempt to gain control of a refugee camp in <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, but this was thwarted by PLO organizations.

Antibody

An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shaped <a href="protein">protein</a> produced mainly by <a href="plasma%20cell">plasma cell</a>s that is used by the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> to neutralize <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s such as <a href="pathogenic%20bacteria">pathogenic bacteria</a> and <a href="Viral%20disease">viruses</a>. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an <a href="antigen">antigen</a>, via the <a href="fragment%20antigen-binding">Fab's variable region</a>. Each tip of the "Y" of an antibody contains a <a href="paratope">paratope</a> (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular <a href="epitope">epitope</a> (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can "tag" a <a href="microbe">microbe</a> or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance. The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its <a href="Fragment%20crystallizable%20region">Fc region</a> (located at the base of the "Y"), which contains a conserved <a href="glycosylation">glycosylation</a> site involved in these interactions. The production of antibodies is the main function of the <a href="humoral%20immune%20system">humoral immune system</a>.

Antibodies are secreted by <a href="B%20cell">B cell</a>s of the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called <a href="plasma%20cell">plasma cell</a>s. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the <a href="blood%20plasma">blood plasma</a>, and a <a href="cell%20membrane">membrane</a>-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the <a href="B-cell%20receptor">B-cell receptor</a> (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called <a href="plasma%20cell">plasma cell</a>s or <a href="memory%20B%20cell">memory B cell</a>s that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a <a href="T%20cell">T helper cell</a> is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the <a href="blood">blood</a> and tissue fluids, as well as many <a href="secretion">secretion</a>s to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.

Antibodies are <a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a>s belonging to the <a href="immunoglobulin%20superfamily">immunoglobulin superfamily</a>. They constitute most of the <a href="gamma%20globulin">gamma globulin</a> fraction of the <a href="blood%20proteins">blood proteins</a>. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large <a href="Immunoglobulin%20heavy%20chain">heavy chain</a>s and two small <a href="Immunoglobulin%20light%20chain">light chains</a>. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may be attached to the antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five "<a href="isotype%20%28immunology%29">isotypes</a>". Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, <a href="IgE">IgE</a> is responsible for an <a href="allergic">allergic</a> response consisting of <a href="mast%20cell">mast cell</a> degranulation and <a href="histamine">histamine</a> release. IgE's <a href="Fragment%20antigen-binding">Fab</a> paratope binds to allergic <a href="antigen">antigen</a>, for example <a href="house%20dust%20mite">house dust mite</a> particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.

Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the "hypervariable region". Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of <a href="gene">gene</a> segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or "paratopes"), followed by random <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.

Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called <a href="Immunoglobulin%20class%20switching">class switching</a> that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.

The membrane-bound form of an antibody may be called a "surface immunoglobulin" (sIg) or a "membrane immunoglobulin" (mIg). It is part of the "B cell receptor" (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation. The BCR is composed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β <a href="heterodimer">heterodimer</a>s, which are capable of <a href="signal%20transduction">signal transduction</a>. A typical human B cell will have 50,000 to 100,000 antibodies bound to its surface. Upon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1 micrometer in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other cell signaling receptors.
These patches may improve the efficiency of the <a href="Cell-mediated%20immunity">cellular immune response</a>. In humans, the cell surface is bare around the B cell receptors for several hundred nanometers, which further isolates the BCRs from competing influences.

The antibody's paratope interacts with the antigen's epitope. An antigen usually contains different epitopes along its surface arranged discontinuously, and dominant epitopes on a given antigen are called determinants.

Antibody and antigen interact by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces involved in the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example <a href="Coulomb%27s%20law">electrostatic forces</a>, <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s, <a href="hydrophobic%20interactions">hydrophobic interactions</a>, and <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20force">van der Waals force</a>s. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's <a href="Affinity%20%28pharmacology%29">affinity</a> towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means it is possible for an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.

Often, once an antibody and antigen bind, they become an <a href="immune%20complex">immune complex</a>, which functions as a unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, <a href="hapten">hapten</a>s are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier <a href="adduct">adduct</a> is antigenic.

Antibodies can come in different varieties known as <a href="Isotype%20%28immunology%29">isotypes</a> or classes. In <a href="eutheria">placental</a> mammals there are five antibody isotypes known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. They are each named with an "Ig" prefix that stands for immunoglobulin, a name sometimes used interchangeably with antibody, and differ in their biological properties, functional locations and ability to deal with different antigens, as depicted in the table. The different suffixes of the antibody isotypes denote the different types of heavy chains the antibody contains, with each heavy chain class named alphabetically: α (alpha), γ (gamma), δ (delta), ε (epsilon), and μ (mu). This gives rise to IgA, IgG, IgD, IgE, and IgM, respectively.

The antibody isotype of a <a href="B%20cell">B cell</a> changes during cell <a href="Pre-pre%20B%20cell">development</a> and activation. Immature B cells, which have never been exposed to an antigen, express only the IgM isotype in a cell surface bound form. The B lymphocyte, in this ready-to-respond form, is known as a "naive B lymphocyte." The naive B lymphocyte expresses both surface IgM and IgD. The co-expression of both of these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen. B cell activation follows engagement of the cell-bound antibody molecule with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and <a href="Cellular%20differentiation">differentiate</a> into an antibody-producing cell called a <a href="plasma%20cell">plasma cell</a>. In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody in a <a href="secrete">secrete</a>d form rather than a <a href="cell%20membrane">membrane</a>-bound form. Some <a href="daughter%20cell">daughter cell</a>s of the activated B cells undergo <a href="isotype%20switching">isotype switching</a>, a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA, or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system.

Antibodies are heavy (~150 k<a href="Dalton%20%28unit%29">Da</a>) <a href="globular%20protein">globular</a> <a href="plasma%20protein">plasma protein</a>s. They have sugar chains (glycans) added to conserved <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> residues. In other words, antibodies are "<a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a>s". The attached glycans are critically important to the structure and function of the antibody. Among other things the expressed glycans can modulate an antibody's affinity for its corresponding FcR(s).

The basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) <a href="monomer">monomer</a> (containing only one Ig unit); secreted antibodies can also be <a href="protein%20dimer">dimeric</a> with two Ig units as with IgA, <a href="tetramer%20protein">tetrameric</a> with four Ig units like <a href="teleost%20fish">teleost fish</a> IgM, or <a href="pentamer">pentamer</a>ic with five Ig units, like mammalian IgM.

The Ig monomer is a "Y"-shaped molecule that consists of four <a href="polypeptide">polypeptide</a> chains; two identical "heavy chains" and two identical "light chains" connected by <a href="disulfide%20bond">disulfide bond</a>s.
Each chain is composed of <a href="structural%20domain">structural domain</a>s called <a href="immunoglobulin%20domain">immunoglobulin domain</a>s. These domains contain about 70–110 <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s and are classified into different categories (for example, variable or IgV, and constant or IgC) according to their size and function. They have a characteristic <a href="immunoglobulin%20fold">immunoglobulin fold</a> in which two <a href="beta%20sheet">beta sheet</a>s create a "sandwich" shape, held together by interactions between conserved <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a>s and other charged amino acids.

There are five types of mammalian Ig <a href="Immunoglobulin%20heavy%20chain">heavy chain</a> denoted by the <a href="Greek%20letters">Greek letters</a>: <a href="%CE%B1">α</a>, <a href="%CE%B4">δ</a>, <a href="%CE%B5">ε</a>, <a href="%CE%B3">γ</a>, and <a href="%CE%BC">μ</a>. The type of heavy chain present defines the "class" of antibody; these chains are found in IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies, respectively. Distinct heavy chains differ in size and composition; α and γ contain approximately 450 amino acids, whereas μ and ε have approximately 550 <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s.
Each heavy chain has two regions, the "constant region" and the "variable region". The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of "three" tandem (in a line) Ig <a href="Structural%20domain">domains</a>, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of "four" immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or <a href="Clone%20%28B-cell%20biology%29">B cell clone</a>. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.

In mammals there are two types of <a href="immunoglobulin%20light%20chain">immunoglobulin light chain</a>, which are called <a href="lambda">lambda</a> (λ) and <a href="kappa">kappa</a> (κ). A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the <a href="iota">iota</a> (ι) chain, are found in other <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s like sharks (<a href="Chondrichthyes">Chondrichthyes</a>) and bony fishes (<a href="Teleostei">Teleostei</a>).

Some parts of an antibody have the same functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the antibody is called the "<a href="Fab%20region">Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region</a>". It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.
The <a href="paratope">paratope</a> is shaped at the <a href="N-terminal%20end">amino terminal end</a> of the antibody <a href="monomer">monomer</a> by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is also referred to as the F region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, variable loops of β-strands, there each on the light (V) and heavy (V) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the <a href="complementarity%20determining%20region">complementarity determining region</a>s (CDRs).
The structures of these CDRs have been clustered and classified by Chothia et al.
and more recently by North et al.
and Nikoloudis et al.
In the framework of the <a href="immune%20network%20theory">immune network theory</a>, CDRs are also called idiotypes. According to immune network theory, the adaptive immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes.

The base of the Y plays a role in modulating immune cell activity. This region is called the "<a href="Fc%20region">Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region</a>", and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of <a href="Fc%20receptor">Fc receptor</a>s, and other immune molecules, such as <a href="Complement%20system">complement</a> proteins. By doing this, it mediates different <a href="physiological">physiological</a> effects including recognition of <a href="opsonization">opsonized</a> particles (binding to FcγR), <a href="lysis">lysis</a> of cells (binding to complement), and <a href="degranulation">degranulation</a> of <a href="mast%20cell">mast cell</a>s, <a href="basophil">basophil</a>s, and <a href="eosinophil">eosinophil</a>s (binding to FcεR).

In summary, the Fab region of the antibody determines antigen specificity while the Fc region of the antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).

The main categories of antibody action include the following:

Activated B cells <a href="cellular%20differentiation">differentiate</a> into either antibody-producing cells called <a href="plasma%20cell">plasma cell</a>s that secrete soluble antibody or <a href="memory%20B%20cell">memory cells</a> that survive in the body for years afterward in order to allow the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.

At the <a href="prenatal">prenatal</a> and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by <a href="passive%20immunization">passive immunization</a> from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the <a href="humoral%20immune%20system">humoral immune system</a>. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one <a href="antigen">antigen</a> (an example is a <a href="virus">virus</a> <a href="capsid">capsid protein</a> fragment). Antibodies contribute to <a href="immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a> in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by <a href="macrophages">macrophages</a> and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other <a href="immune%20response">immune response</a>s such as the <a href="complement%20system">complement pathway</a>. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).

Antibodies that bind to surface antigens (for example, on bacteria) will attract the first component of the <a href="complement%20cascade">complement cascade</a> with their <a href="Fv%20region">Fc region</a> and initiate activation of the "classical" complement system. This results in the killing of bacteria in two ways. First, the binding of the antibody and complement molecules marks the microbe for ingestion by <a href="phagocyte">phagocyte</a>s in a process called <a href="opsonization">opsonization</a>; these phagocytes are attracted by certain complement molecules generated in the complement cascade. Second, some complement system components form a <a href="Complement%20membrane%20attack%20complex">membrane attack complex</a> to assist antibodies to kill the bacterium directly (bacteriolysis).

To combat pathogens that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, causing them to <a href="Agglutination%20%28biology%29">agglutinate</a>. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.

Those cells that recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, as the name suggests, interact with the <a href="Fc%20region">Fc region</a> of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytose</a>, <a href="mast%20cell">mast cell</a>s and <a href="neutrophil">neutrophil</a>s will <a href="degranulation">degranulate</a>, <a href="natural%20killer%20cell">natural killer cell</a>s will release <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s and <a href="cytotoxic">cytotoxic</a> molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as <a href="antibody-dependent%20cell-mediated%20cytotoxicity">antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity</a> (ADCC) – this process may explain the efficacy of <a href="Monoclonal%20antibody">monoclonal antibodies</a> used in <a href="biopharmaceutical">biological</a> therapies against <a href="cancer">cancer</a>. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.

Humans and higher primates also produce "natural antibodies" that are present in serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or <a href="passive%20immunization">passive immunization</a>. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide <a href="galactose">galactose</a> α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on <a href="Glycosylation">glycosylated</a> cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut. Rejection of <a href="Organ%20xenotransplantation">xenotransplantated organs</a> is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.

Virtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens. It has been estimated that humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen. Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of <a href="gene">gene</a>s available to make these proteins is limited by the size of the human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes.

The chromosomal region that encodes an antibody is large and contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (<a href="IGH%40">IGH@</a>) is found on <a href="chromosome%2014">chromosome 14</a>, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (<a href="IGL%40">IGL@</a> and <a href="IGK%40">IGK@</a>) are found on chromosomes <a href="chromosome%2022">22</a> and <a href="chromosome%202">2</a> in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or <a href="complementarity%20determining%20region">complementarity determining region</a>s (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.

Somatic recombination of immunoglobulins, also known as "V(D)J recombination", involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. V, D and J segments are found in <a href="immunoglobulin%20heavy%20chain">Ig heavy chains</a>, but only V and J segments are found in <a href="Immunoglobulin%20light%20chain">Ig light chains</a>. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the <a href="genome">genome</a>s of <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different <a href="wikt%3Aparatope">paratopes</a>, and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.

RAG proteins play an important role with V(D)J recombination in cutting DNA at a particular region. Without the presence of these proteins, V(D)J recombination would not occur.

After a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as <a href="allelic%20exclusion">allelic exclusion</a>) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.

Following activation with antigen, B cells begin to <a href="Cell%20division">proliferate</a> rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains undergo a high rate of <a href="point%20mutation">point mutation</a>, by a process called "somatic hypermutation" (SHM). SHM results in approximately one <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.

This serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding <a href="Chemical%20affinity">affinity</a>. Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity). B cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas those with low affinity antibodies will not, and will die by <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>. Thus, B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the average affinity of antibodies to increase over time. The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called "affinity maturation". Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from <a href="helper%20T%20cell">helper T cell</a>s.
<a href="Immunoglobulin%20class%20switching">Isotype or class switching</a> is a <a href="biological%20process">biological process</a> occurring after activation of the B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.

Class switching occurs in the heavy chain gene <a href="Locus%20%28genetics%29">locus</a> by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> motifs, called "switch (S) regions", found in <a href="DNA">DNA</a> upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity of a series of <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s at two selected S-regions. The variable domain <a href="exon">exon</a> is rejoined through a process called <a href="non-homologous%20end%20joining">non-homologous end joining</a> (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε). This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.

A group of antibodies can be called "monovalent" (or "specific") if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called "polyvalent" (or "unspecific") if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. <a href="Intravenous%20immunoglobulin">Intravenous immunoglobulin</a>, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, <a href="monoclonal%20antibodies">monoclonal antibodies</a> are monovalent for the same epitope.

Heterodimeric antibodies, which are also asymmetrical and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) are connected to the variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.

To further improve the function of heterodimeric antibodies, many scientists are looking towards artificial constructs. Artificial antibodies are largely diverse protein motifs that use the functional strategy of the antibody molecule, but aren’t limited by the loop and framework structural constraints of the natural antibody. Being able to control the combinational design of the sequence and three-dimensional space could transcend the natural design and allow for the attachment of different combinations of drugs to the arms.

Heterodimeric antibodies have a greater range in shapes they can take and the drugs that are attached to the arms don’t have to be the same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.

Detection of particular antibodies is a very common form of medical <a href="medical%20diagnosis">diagnostics</a>, and applications such as <a href="serology">serology</a> depend on these methods. For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis, a <a href="titer">titer</a> of antibodies directed against <a href="Epstein-Barr%20virus">Epstein-Barr virus</a> or <a href="Lyme%20disease">Lyme disease</a> is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected or the infection occurred a "very" long time ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed.

In <a href="clinical%20immunology">clinical immunology</a>, levels of individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by <a href="nephelometry">nephelometry</a> (or turbidimetry) to characterize the antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of <a href="liver">liver</a> damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>, elevated IgM indicates <a href="viral%20hepatitis">viral hepatitis</a> and <a href="primary%20biliary%20cirrhosis">primary biliary cirrhosis</a>, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, <a href="autoimmune%20hepatitis">autoimmune hepatitis</a> and cirrhosis.

<a href="Autoimmune%20disorder">Autoimmune disorder</a>s can often be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own <a href="epitope">epitope</a>s; many can be detected through <a href="blood%20test">blood test</a>s. Antibodies directed against <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a> surface antigens in immune mediated <a href="hemolytic%20anemia">hemolytic anemia</a> are detected with the <a href="Coombs%20test">Coombs test</a>. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in <a href="blood%20transfusion">blood transfusion</a> preparation and also for antibody screening in <a href="antenatal">antenatal</a> women.

Practically, several immunodiagnostic methods based on detection of complex antigen-antibody are used to diagnose infectious diseases, for example <a href="ELISA">ELISA</a>, <a href="immunofluorescence">immunofluorescence</a>, <a href="Western%20blot">Western blot</a>, <a href="immunodiffusion">immunodiffusion</a>, <a href="immunoelectrophoresis">immunoelectrophoresis</a>, and <a href="magnetic%20immunoassay">magnetic immunoassay</a>. Antibodies raised against human chorionic gonadotropin are used in over the counter pregnancy tests.

New dioxaborolane chemistry enables radioactive <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> (<a href="Fluorine-18">F</a>) labeling of antibodies, which allows for <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">positron emission tomography</a> (PET) imaging of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>.

Targeted <a href="monoclonal%20antibody%20therapy">monoclonal antibody therapy</a> is employed to treat diseases such as <a href="rheumatoid%20arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, <a href="multiple%20sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a>, <a href="psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, and many forms of <a href="cancer">cancer</a> including <a href="non-Hodgkin%27s%20lymphoma">non-Hodgkin's lymphoma</a>, <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a>, <a href="head%20and%20neck%20cancer">head and neck cancer</a> and <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a>.

Some immune deficiencies, such as <a href="X-linked%20agammaglobulinemia">X-linked agammaglobulinemia</a> and <a href="hypogammaglobulinemia">hypogammaglobulinemia</a>, result in partial or complete lack of antibodies. These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of <a href="immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a> called <a href="passive%20immunity">passive immunity</a>. Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies in the form of human or animal <a href="blood%20plasma">serum</a>, pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual.

<a href="Rh%20factor">Rh factor</a>, also known as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s; individuals that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal <a href="childbirth">childbirth</a>, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a <a href="fetus">fetus</a> can enter the mother's system. In the case of an Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for <a href="hemolytic%20disease%20of%20the%20newborn">hemolytic disease of the newborn</a>.

<a href="Rho%28D%29%20immune%20globulin">Rho(D) immune globulin</a> antibodies are specific for human RhD antigen. Anti-RhD antibodies are administered as part of a <a href="prenatal%20care">prenatal treatment regimen</a> to prevent sensitization that may occur when a Rh-negative mother has a Rh-positive fetus. Treatment of a mother with Anti-RhD antibodies prior to and immediately after trauma and delivery destroys Rh antigen in the mother's system from the fetus. It is important to note that this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B cells to "remember" Rh antigen by generating memory B cells. Therefore, her humoral immune system will not make anti-Rh antibodies, and will not attack the Rh antigens of the current or subsequent babies. Rho(D) Immune Globulin treatment prevents sensitization that can lead to <a href="Rh%20disease">Rh disease</a>, but does not prevent or treat the underlying disease itself.

Specific antibodies are produced by injecting an <a href="antigen">antigen</a> into a <a href="mammal">mammal</a>, such as a <a href="mouse">mouse</a>, <a href="rat">rat</a>, <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>, <a href="goat">goat</a>, <a href="sheep">sheep</a>, or <a href="horse">horse</a> for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains "<a href="polyclonal%20antibodies">polyclonal antibodies</a>"—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the <a href="Blood%20plasma">serum</a>, which can now be called <a href="antiserum">antiserum</a>. Antigens are also injected into <a href="chicken">chicken</a>s for generation of polyclonal antibodies in <a href="egg%20yolk">egg yolk</a>. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting <a href="lymphocyte">lymphocyte</a>s are isolated from the animal and <a href="Biological%20immortality">immortalized</a> by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called <a href="hybridoma">hybridoma</a>s, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by <a href="dilution%20cloning">dilution cloning</a> to generate <a href="cloning%23Cellular%20cloning">cell clones</a> that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called "<a href="monoclonal%20antibodies">monoclonal antibodies</a>". Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using <a href="Protein%20A/G">Protein A/G</a> or <a href="Affinity%20chromatography">antigen-affinity chromatography</a>.

In research, purified antibodies are used in many applications. Antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine. Research antibodies are most commonly used to identify and locate <a href="intracellular">intracellular</a> and <a href="extracellular">extracellular</a> proteins. Antibodies are used in <a href="flow%20cytometry">flow cytometry</a> to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of <a href="cluster%20of%20differentiation">cluster of differentiation</a> molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins. They are also used in <a href="immunoprecipitation">immunoprecipitation</a> to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a <a href="cell%20lysate">cell lysate</a>, in <a href="Western%20blot">Western blot</a> analyses to identify proteins separated by <a href="electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a>, and in <a href="immunohistochemistry">immunohistochemistry</a> or <a href="immunofluorescence">immunofluorescence</a> to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells with the assistance of a <a href="microscope">microscope</a>. Proteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies, using <a href="ELISA">ELISA</a> and <a href="ELISPOT">ELISPOT</a> techniques.

Antibodies used in research are some of the most powerful, yet most problematic reagents with a tremendous number of factors that must be controlled in any experiment including cross reactivity, or the antibody recognizing multiple epitopes and affinity, which can vary widely depending on experimental conditions such as pH, solvent, state of tissue etc. Multiple attempts have been made to improve both the way that researchers validate antibodies and ways in which they report on antibodies. Researchers using antibodies in their work need to record them correctly in order to allow their research to be reproducible (and therefore tested, and qualified by other researchers). Less than half of research antibodies referenced in academic papers can be easily identified. Papers published in <a href="F1000">F1000</a> in 2014 and 2015 provide researchers with a guide for reporting research antibody use. The RRID paper, is co-published in 4 journals that implemented the <a href="RRIDs">RRIDs</a> Standard for research resource citation, which draws data from the antibodyregistry.org as the source of antibody identifiers (see also group at Force11)

Traditionally, most antibodies are produced by hybridoma <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a> lines through immortalization of antibody-producing cells by chemically-induced fusion with myeloma cells. In some cases, additional fusions with other lines have created "triomas" and "quadromas". The manufacturing process should be appropriately described and validated. Validation studies should
at least include :




The importance of antibodies in health care and the <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a> industry demands knowledge of their structures at <a href="Image%20resolution">high resolution</a>. This information is used for <a href="protein%20engineering">protein engineering</a>, modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming. Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical structures. Online web servers such as "Web Antibody Modeling" (WAM) and "Prediction of Immunoglobulin Structure" (PIGS) enables computational modeling of antibody variable regions. Rosetta Antibody is a novel antibody F region structure prediction <a href="Server%20%28computing%29">server</a>, which incorporates sophisticated techniques to minimize CDR loops and optimize the relative orientation of the light and heavy chains, as well as <a href="homology%20%28biology%29">homology</a> models that predict successful docking of antibodies with their unique antigen.

The ability to describe the antibody through binding affinity to the antigen is supplemented by information on antibody structure and amino acid sequences for the purpose of patent claims.

The first use of the term "antibody" occurred in a text by <a href="Paul%20Ehrlich">Paul Ehrlich</a>. The term "Antikörper" (the German word for "antibody") appears in the conclusion of his article "Experimental Studies on Immunity", published in October 1891, which states that, "if two substances give rise to two different antikörper, then they themselves must be different". However, the term was not accepted immediately and several other terms for antibody were proposed; these included "Immunkörper", "Amboceptor", "Zwischenkörper", "substance sensibilisatrice", "copula", "Desmon", "philocytase", "fixateur", and "Immunisin". The word "antibody" has formal analogy to the word "<a href="antitoxin">antitoxin</a>" and a similar concept to "Immunkörper" ("immune body" in English). As such, the original construction of the word contains a logical flaw; the antitoxin is something directed against a toxin, while the antibody is a body directed against something.

The study of antibodies began in 1890 when <a href="Kitasato%20Shibasabur%C5%8D">Kitasato Shibasaburō</a> described antibody activity against <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a> and <a href="tetanus%20toxin">tetanus toxin</a>s. Kitasato put forward the theory of <a href="humoral%20immunity">humoral immunity</a>, proposing that a mediator in serum could react with a foreign antigen. His idea prompted Paul Ehrlich to propose the <a href="side-chain%20theory">side-chain theory</a> for antibody and antigen interaction in 1897, when he hypothesized that receptors (described as "side-chains") on the surface of cells could bind specifically to <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s – in a "lock-and-key" interaction – and that this binding reaction is the trigger for the production of antibodies. Other researchers believed that antibodies existed freely in the blood and, in 1904, <a href="Almroth%20Wright">Almroth Wright</a> suggested that soluble antibodies coated <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> to label them for <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a> and killing; a process that he named <a href="opsonin">opsonin</a>ization.

In the 1920s, <a href="Michael%20Heidelberger">Michael Heidelberger</a> and <a href="Oswald%20Avery">Oswald Avery</a> observed that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies and went on to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by <a href="John%20Marrack">John Marrack</a>. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of <a href="plasma%20cell">plasma cell</a>s, were responsible for generating antibodies.

Further work concentrated on characterizing the structures of the antibody proteins. A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the early 1960s by <a href="Gerald%20Edelman">Gerald Edelman</a> and Joseph Gally of the antibody <a href="Immunoglobulin%20light%20chain">light chain</a>, and their realization that this protein is the same as the <a href="Bence-Jones%20protein">Bence-Jones protein</a> described in 1845 by <a href="Henry%20Bence%20Jones">Henry Bence Jones</a>. Edelman went on to discover that antibodies are composed of <a href="disulfide%20bond">disulfide bond</a>-linked heavy and light chains. Around the same time, antibody-binding (Fab) and antibody tail (Fc) regions of IgG were characterized by <a href="Rodney%20Porter">Rodney Porter</a>. Together, these scientists deduced the structure and complete <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> sequence of IgG, a feat for which they were jointly awarded the 1972 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a>. The Fv fragment was prepared and characterized by David Givol. While most of these early studies focused on IgM and IgG, other immunoglobulin isotypes were identified in the 1960s: Thomas Tomasi discovered secretory antibody (<a href="IgA">IgA</a>); David S. Rowe and John L. Fahey discovered IgD; and <a href="Kimishige%20Ishizaka">Kimishige Ishizaka</a> and Teruko Ishizaka discovered <a href="IgE">IgE</a> and showed it was a class of antibodies involved in allergic reactions. In a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976, <a href="Susumu%20Tonegawa">Susumu Tonegawa</a> showed that genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies.

<a href="Antibody%20mimetic">Antibody mimetics</a> are organic compounds that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics such as the <a href="Affimer">Affimer</a> and the <a href="DARPin">DARPin</a> have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.

Alessandro Scarlatti

Pietro Alessandro Gaspare Scarlatti (2 May 1660 – 22 October 1725) was an Italian <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> <a href="composer">composer</a>, especially famous for his <a href="opera">opera</a>s and chamber <a href="cantata">cantata</a>s. He is considered the founder of the <a href="Neapolitan%20school">Neapolitan school</a> of opera. He was the father of two other composers, <a href="Domenico%20Scarlatti">Domenico Scarlatti</a> and <a href="Pietro%20Filippo%20Scarlatti">Pietro Filippo Scarlatti</a>.

Scarlatti was born in <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> (or in <a href="Trapani">Trapani</a>), then part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Kingdom of Sicily</a>. He is generally said to have been a pupil of <a href="Giacomo%20Carissimi">Giacomo Carissimi</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, and some theorize that he had some connection with northern Italy because his early works seem to show the influence of <a href="Alessandro%20Stradella">Stradella</a> and <a href="Giovanni%20Legrenzi">Legrenzi</a>. The production at Rome of his opera "Gli Equivoci nell sembiante" (1679) gained him the support of Queen <a href="Christina%20of%20Sweden">Christina of Sweden</a> (who at the time was living in Rome), and he became her "Maestro di Cappella". In February 1684 he became "Maestro di Cappella" to the <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a> of <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, perhaps through the influence of his sister, an opera singer, who might have been the mistress of an influential Neapolitan noble. Here he produced a long series of operas, remarkable chiefly for their fluency and expressiveness, as well as other music for state occasions.

In 1702 Scarlatti left Naples and did not return until the Spanish domination had been superseded by that of the Austrians. In the interval he enjoyed the patronage of <a href="Ferdinando%20%28III%29%20de%27%20Medici">Ferdinando de' Medici</a>, for whose private theatre near <a href="Florence">Florence</a> he composed operas, and of <a href="Cardinal%20Ottoboni">Cardinal Ottoboni</a>, who made him his "maestro di cappella", and procured him a similar post at the <a href="Basilica%20di%20Santa%20Maria%20Maggiore">Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore</a> in Rome in 1703.

After visiting <a href="Venice">Venice</a> and <a href="Urbino">Urbino</a> in 1707, Scarlatti took up his duties in Naples again in 1708, and remained there until 1717. By this time Naples seems to have become tired of his music; the Romans, however, appreciated it better, and it was at the <a href="Teatro%20Capranica">Teatro Capranica</a> in Rome that he produced some of his finest operas ("<a href="Telemaco%20%28Scarlatti%29">Telemaco</a>", 1718; "Marco Attilio Regolò", 1719; "<a href="Griselda%20%28A.%20Scarlatti%29">La Griselda</a>", 1721), as well as some noble specimens of church music, including a <a href="mass%20%28music%29">mass</a> for chorus and orchestra, composed in honor of <a href="Saint%20Cecilia">Saint Cecilia</a> for <a href="Cardinal%20Acquaviva">Cardinal Acquaviva</a> in 1721. His last work on a large scale appears to have been the unfinished <a href="serenata">serenata</a> for the marriage of the prince of <a href="Stigliano">Stigliano</a> in 1723. He died in Naples in 1725.
Scarlatti's music forms an important link between the early <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> Italian vocal styles of the 17th century, with their centers in Florence, Venice and <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, and the classical school of the 18th century. Scarlatti's style, however, is more than a transitional element in Western music; like most of his Naples colleagues he shows an almost modern understanding of the psychology of modulation and also frequently makes use of the ever-changing phrase lengths so typical of the Napoli school. His early operas ("Gli equivoci nel sembiante" 1679; "<a href="L%27honest%C3%A0%20negli%20amori">L'honestà negli amori</a>" 1680, containing the famous aria "Già il sole dal Gange"; "<a href="Il%20Pompeo">Il Pompeo</a>" 1683, containing the well-known airs "O cessate di piagarmi" and "Toglietemi la vita ancor," and others down to about 1685) retain the older cadences in their <a href="recitatives">recitatives</a>, and a considerable variety of neatly constructed forms in their charming little arias, accompanied sometimes by the string quartet, treated with careful elaboration, sometimes with the continuo alone. By 1686 he had definitely established the "Italian overture" form (second edition of "Dal male il bene"), and had abandoned the <a href="ostinato">ground bass</a> and the <a href="binary%20form">binary form</a> air in two stanzas in favour of the <a href="ternary%20form">ternary form</a> or <a href="da%20capo">da capo</a> type of air. His best operas of this period are "La Rosaura" (1690, printed by the <a href="Gesellschaft%20f%C3%BCr%20Musikforschung">Gesellschaft für Musikforschung</a>), and "Pirro e Demetrio" (1694), in which occur the arias "Le Violette", and "Ben ti sta, traditor".

From about 1697 onwards ("La caduta del Decemviri"), influenced partly perhaps by the style of <a href="Giovanni%20Bononcini">Giovanni Bononcini</a> and probably more by the taste of the viceregal court, his opera arias become more conventional and commonplace in rhythm, while his scoring is hasty and crude, yet not without brilliance ("L'Eraclea", 1700), the <a href="oboe">oboe</a>s and <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s being frequently used, and the <a href="violin">violin</a>s often playing in unison. The operas composed for Ferdinando de' Medici are lost; they might have given a more favourable idea of his style as his correspondence with the prince shows that they were composed with a very sincere sense of inspiration.

"<a href="Mitridate%20Eupatore">Mitridate Eupatore</a>", accounted his masterpiece, composed for Venice in 1707, contains music far in advance of anything that Scarlatti had written for Naples, both in technique and in intellectual power. The later Neapolitan operas ("L'amor volubile e tiranno" 1709; "La principessa fedele" 1710; "Tigrane", 1714, &c.) are showy and effective rather than profoundly emotional; the instrumentation marks a great advance on previous work, since the main duty of accompanying the voice is thrown upon the string quartet, the harpsichord being reserved exclusively for the noisy instrumental <a href="ritornello">ritornelli</a>. In his opera "Teodora" (1697) he originated the use of the orchestral "ritornello".
His last group of operas, composed for Rome, exhibit a deeper poetic feeling, a broad and dignified style of melody, a strong dramatic sense, especially in accompanied recitatives, a device which he himself had been the first to use as early as 1686 ("Olimpia vendicata") and a much more modern style of orchestration, the horns appearing for the first time, and being treated with striking effect.

Besides the operas, <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s ("Agar et Ismaele esiliati", 1684; "La Maddalena", 1685; "La Giuditta", 1693; "Christmas Oratorio", c. 1705; "S. Filippo Neri", 1714; and others) and serenatas, which all exhibit a similar style, Scarlatti composed upwards of five hundred chamber-cantatas for solo voice. These represent the most intellectual type of chamber-music of their period, and it is to be regretted that they have remained almost entirely in manuscript, since a careful study of them is indispensable to anyone who wishes to form an adequate idea of Scarlatti's development.
His few remaining Masses (the story of his having composed two hundred is hardly credible) and church music in general are comparatively unimportant, except the great "<a href="St%20Cecilia">St Cecilia</a> <a href="Mass%20%28music%29">Mass</a>" (1721), which is one of the first attempts at the style which reached its height in the great Masses of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>. His instrumental music, though not without interest, is curiously antiquated as compared with his vocal works.

Aston Martin

Aston Martin Lagonda Limited is a British manufacturer of <a href="Luxury%20vehicle">luxury</a> <a href="sports%20car">sports car</a>s and <a href="grand%20tourer">grand tourer</a>s. It was founded in 1913 by <a href="Lionel%20Martin">Lionel Martin</a> and <a href="Robert%20Bamford">Robert Bamford</a>. Steered from 1947 by <a href="David%20Brown%20%28entrepreneur%29">David Brown</a>, it became associated with expensive grand touring cars in the 1950s and 1960s, and with the fictional character <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> following his use of a <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB5">DB5</a> model in the 1964 film "<a href="Goldfinger%20%28film%29">Goldfinger</a>". Their sports cars are regarded as a <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British cultural icon</a>. Aston Martin has held a <a href="Royal%20Warrant%20of%20Appointment%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Royal Warrant</a> as purveyor of motorcars to HRH the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> since 1982.

Headquarters and the main production site are in <a href="Gaydon">Gaydon</a>, <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, England, on the site of a former <a href="RAF">RAF</a> <a href="V%20Bomber">V Bomber</a> airbase. One of Aston Martin's recent cars was named after the 1950s <a href="Vulcan%20Bomber">Vulcan Bomber</a>. Aston Martin has diversified to speed boats, submarines and real estate development. 

Aston Martin had a troubled history after the third quarter of the 20th century but has also enjoyed long periods of success and stability. “In the first century we went bankrupt seven times”, incoming CEO Andy Palmer told "Automotive News Europe". “The second century is about making sure that is not the case.” On the back of strong demand for Aston Martin’s DB11, its first all-new model in a decade, the company swung back to a profit in the first quarter of 2017.

Aston Martin was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and <a href="Robert%20Bamford">Robert Bamford</a>. The two had joined forces as Bamford & Martin the previous year to sell cars made by <a href="Singer%20%28car%29">Singer</a> from premises in Callow Street, London where they also serviced <a href="GWK%20%28car%29">GWK</a> and <a href="Calthorpe%20cars">Calthorpe</a> vehicles. Martin raced specials at <a href="Aston%20Hill">Aston Hill</a> near <a href="Aston%20Clinton">Aston Clinton</a>, and the pair decided to make their own vehicles. The first car to be named "Aston Martin" was created by Martin by fitting a four-cylinder <a href="Coventry-Simplex">Coventry-Simplex</a> engine to the chassis of a 1908 <a href="Isotta-Fraschini">Isotta-Fraschini</a>.

They acquired premises at Henniker Mews in <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a> and produced their first car in March 1915. Production could not start because of the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and Martin joined the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> and Bamford the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Service%20Corps">Royal Army Service Corps</a>. All machinery was sold to the <a href="Sopwith%20Aviation%20Company">Sopwith Aviation Company</a>.

After the war they found new premises at Abingdon Road, Kensington and designed a new car. Bamford left in 1920 and Aston Martin was revitalised with funding from <a href="Count%20Louis%20Zborowski">Count Louis Zborowski</a>. In 1922, Bamford & Martin produced cars to compete in the <a href="French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>, which went on to set world speed and endurance records at <a href="Brooklands">Brooklands</a>. Three works Team Cars with 16-valve were built for racing and record breaking: chassis number 1914, later developed as the Green Pea; chassis number 1915, the <a href="Razor%20Blade">Razor Blade</a> record car; and chassis number 1916, later developed as the <a href="Halford%20Special">Halford Special</a>.

Approximately 55 cars were built for sale in two configurations; and short chassis. Aston Martin went bankrupt in 1924 and was bought by <a href="Godfrey%20Benson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Charnwood%23Family">Dorothea, Lady Charnwood</a> who put her son John Benson on the board. Aston Martin failed again in 1925 and the factory closed in 1926, with Lionel Martin leaving.

Later that year, Bill Renwick, <a href="A%20C%20Bertelli">Augustus (Bert) Bertelli</a> and investors including Lady Charnwood took control of the business. They renamed it Aston Martin Motors and moved it to the former <a href="General%20Aircraft%20Limited%23History">Whitehead Aircraft Limited</a> <a href="Hanworth">Hanworth</a> works in <a href="Feltham">Feltham</a>. Renwick and Bertelli had been in partnership some years and had developed an overhead-cam four-cylinder engine using Renwick's patented combustion chamber design, which they had tested in an <a href="Enfield-Allday">Enfield-Allday</a> chassis. The only "Renwick and Bertelli" motor car made, it was known as "Buzzbox" and still survives.

The pair had planned to sell their engine to motor manufacturers, but having heard that Aston Martin was no longer in production realised they could capitalise on its reputation to jump start the production of a completely new car.

Between 1926 and 1937 Bertelli was both technical director and designer of all new Aston Martins, since known as "Bertelli cars". They included the 1½-litre "T-type", "International", "Le Mans", "MKII" and its racing derivative, the "Ulster", and the 2-litre 15/98 and its racing derivative, the "Speed Model". Most were open two-seater sports cars bodied by Bert Bertelli's brother , with a small number of long-chassis four-seater tourers, dropheads and saloons also produced.

Bertelli was a competent driver keen to race his cars, one of few owner/manufacturer/drivers. The "LM" team cars were very successful in national and international motor racing including at Le Mans and the Mille Miglia.

Financial problems reappeared in 1932. Aston Martin was rescued for a year by <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Owners%20Club">Lance Prideaux Brune</a> before passing it on to <a href="Arthur%20Sutherland">Sir Arthur Sutherland</a>. In 1936, Aston Martin decided to concentrate on road cars, producing just 700 until <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> halted work. Production shifted to aircraft components during the war.

In 1947, old-established (1860) privately-owned <a href="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a> <a href="gear">gear</a> and <a href="machine%20tools">machine tools</a> manufacturer <a href="David%20Brown%20Limited">David Brown Limited</a> bought Aston Martin putting it under control of its Tractor Group. David Brown became Aston Martin's latest saviour. He also acquired without its factory <a href="Lagonda">Lagonda</a>'s business for its 2.6-litre <a href="W.%20O.%20Bentley">W. O. Bentley</a>-designed engine. Lagonda moved operations to Newport Pagnell and shared engines, resources and workshops. Aston Martin began to build the classic "DB" series of cars. 

In April 1950, they announced planned production of their Le Mans prototype to be called the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB2">DB2</a>, followed by the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB2/4">DB2/4</a> in 1953, the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB2/4">DB2/4 MkII</a> in 1955, the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB%20Mark%20III">DB Mark III</a> in 1957 and the Italian-styled 3.7 L <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB4">DB4</a> in 1958.

While these models helped Aston Martin establish a good racing pedigree, the DB4 stood out and yielded the famous <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB5">DB5</a> in 1963. Aston stayed true to its <a href="Grand%20tourer">grand touring</a> style with the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB6">DB6</a> (1965–70), and <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DBS">DBS</a> (1967–1972).

The six-cylinder engines of these cars from 1954 up to 1965 were designed by <a href="Tadek%20Marek">Tadek Marek</a>.

Aston Martin was often financially troubled. In 1972 David Brown paid off all its debts, said to be £5 million or more, and handed it for £101 to Company Developments, a <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>-based investment bank consortium chaired by accountant <a href="William%20Willson%20%28businessman%29">William Willson</a>. More detail on this period may be read at <a href="William%20Willson%20%28businessman%29">Willson's biography</a>. The <a href="1973%E2%80%9375%20recession%23United%20Kingdom">world-wide recession</a>, lack of <a href="working%20capital">working capital</a> and the difficulties of developing without proper resources an engine to meet <a href="California%20Smog%20Check%20Program">California's exhaust emission</a> requirements — it stopped Aston's US sales — again pulled Aston Martin into receivership at the end of 1974. There were 460 workers when the plant closed.
The receiver sold the business in April 1975 for £1.05 million to North American businessmen Peter Sprague of <a href="National%20Semiconductor%23The%20transformation%20of%20National%20Semiconductor">National Semiconductor</a> and Toronto hotelier, George Minden, and Jeremy Turner, a London businessman, who insisted to reporters Aston Martin remained a British controlled business. Sprague later claimed he had fallen in love with the factory, not the cars, the workforce's craftsmanship dedication and intelligence. At this point, he and Minden had brought in investor, Alan Curtis, a British office property developer together with George Flather, a retired Sheffield <a href="steel%20magnate">steel magnate</a>.

Six months later in September 1975 the factory — shut-down the previous December — re-opened under its new owner Aston Martin Lagonda (1975) Limited with 100 employees and plans to lift staff to 250 by the end of 1975. In January 1976 AML revealed it now held orders for 150 cars for USA, 100 for other markets and another 80 from a Japanese importing agency. At the Geneva Motor Show Fred Hartley, managing director and sales director for 13 years before that, announced he had resigned over "differences in marketing policy". Alan Curtis made himself managing director. 

The new owners pushed Aston Martin into modernising its line, producing the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20V8%20Vantage%20%281977%29">V8 Vantage</a> in 1977, the convertible <a href="Aston%20Martin%20V8">Volante</a> in 1978, and the one-off <a href="William%20Towns">William Towns</a>-styled <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Bulldog">Bulldog</a> in 1980. Towns also styled the futuristic new <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Lagonda">Lagonda</a> saloon, based on the V8 model.

Curtis, who had a 42% stake in Aston Martin, also brought about a change in direction from the usual customers who were Aston Martin fanatics (fans) to successful young married businessmen. Prices had been increased by 25%. There was speculation that AML was about to buy <a href="Lamborghini">Lamborghini</a>. At the end of the 1970s there was widespread debate about running MG into the Aston Martin consortium. 85 Tory MPs formed themselves into a pressure group to get British Leyland to release their grip and hand it over. <a href="CH%20Industrials%20plc">CH Industrials plc</a> (car components) bought a 10% share in AML. But in July 1980 blaming a recession AML cut back their workforce of 450 by more than 20% making those people redundant and the following day British Leyland announced it had abandoned hope of an MG rescue by Aston Martin.

in January 1981 there having been no satisfactory revival partners Alan Curtis and Peter Sprague announced they had never intended to maintain a long term financial stake in Aston Martin Lagonda and it was to be sold to <a href="Pace%20Petroleum">Pace Petroleum</a>'s <a href="Victor%20Gauntlett">Victor Gauntlett</a>. Sprague and Curtis pointed out that under their ownership AML finances had improved to where an offer for MG might have been feasible.Worldwide sales had shrunk to three cars per week, prompting chairman Alan Curtis, Sprague, and Minden to consider shutting down production to concentrate on service and <a href="Automotive%20restoration">restoration</a>. At this point Curtis attended the 1980 Pace sponsored <a href="Stirling%20Moss">Stirling Moss</a> benefit day at <a href="Brands%20Hatch">Brands Hatch</a>, and met fellow <a href="Farnham">Farnham</a> resident <a href="Victor%20Gauntlett">Victor Gauntlett</a>.

Gauntlett bought a 12.5% stake in Aston Martin for £500,000 via <a href="Pace%20Petroleum">Pace Petroleum</a> in 1980, with Tim Hearley of CH Industrials taking a similar share. Pace and CHI took over as joint 50/50 owners at the beginning of 1981, with Gauntlett as executive chairman. Gauntlett also led the sales team, and after some development and publicity when it became the world's fastest 4-seater production car, was able to sell the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Lagonda">Aston Martin Lagonda</a> in Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar.

In 1982, Aston Martin was granted a <a href="Royal%20Warrant%20of%20Appointment%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Royal Warrant of Appointment</a> by the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>. Aston Martin holds the warrant to this day.

Understanding that it would take some time to develop new Aston Martin products, they created an engineering service subsidiary to develop automotive products for other companies. It was decided to use, a trade name of Salmons & Son their in-house coachbuilder, <a href="Tickford">Tickford</a> which Aston Martin had bought in 1955. Tickford's name had been long associated with expensive high quality carriages and cars and their folding roofs. New products included a Tickford <a href="Austin%20Metro">Austin Metro</a>, a Tickford <a href="Ford%20Capri">Ford Capri</a> and even Tickford train interiors, particularly on the <a href="Jaguar%20XJS">Jaguar XJS</a>. Pace continued sponsoring racing events, and now sponsored all Aston Martin Owners Club events, taking a Tickford-engined Nimrod Group C car owned by AMOC President <a href="Viscount%20Downe">Viscount Downe</a>, which came third in the Manufacturers Championship in both 1982 and 1983. It also finished seventh in the <a href="1982%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">1982 24 Hours of Le Mans</a> race. However, sales of production cars were now at an all-time low of 30 cars produced in 1982.

As trading became tighter in the petroleum market, and Aston Martin was requiring more time and money, Gauntlett agreed to sell Hays/Pace to the Kuwait Investment Office in September 1983. As Aston Martin required greater investment, he also agreed to sell his share holding to American importer and Greek shipping tycoon <a href="Peter%20Livanos">Peter Livanos</a>, who invested via his <a href="joint%20venture">joint venture</a> with Nick and John Papanicolaou, ALL Inc. Gauntlett remained chairman of AML 55% owned by ALL, with Tickford a 50/50 venture between ALL and CHI. The uneasy relationship was ended when ALL exercised options to buy a larger share in AML; CHI's residual shares were exchanged for CHI's complete ownership of Tickford, which retained development of existing Aston Martin projects. In 1984 Papanicolaou's Titan shipping business was in trouble so Livanos's father George bought out the Papanicolaou's shares in ALL, while Gauntlett again became a shareholder with a 25% holding in AML. The deal valued Aston Martin/AML at £2 million, the year it built its 10,000th car.

Although as a result Aston Martin had to make 60 members of the workforce redundant, Gauntlett bought a stake in Italian styling house <a href="Zagato">Zagato</a>, and resurrected its collaboration with Aston Martin.

In 1986, Gauntlett negotiated the return of fictional British secret agent <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> to Aston Martin. <a href="Cubby%20Broccoli">Cubby Broccoli</a> had chosen to recast the character using actor <a href="Timothy%20Dalton">Timothy Dalton</a>, in an attempt to re-root the Bond-brand back to a more <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a>-like feel. Gauntlett supplied his personal pre-production <a href="Aston%20Martin%20V8%20Vantage%20%281977%29">Vantage</a> for use in the filming of "<a href="The%20Living%20Daylights">The Living Daylights</a>", and sold a Volante to Broccoli for use at his home in America. Gauntlett turned down the role of a <a href="KGB">KGB</a> colonel in the film, however: "I would have loved to have done it but really could not afford the time."

Aston Martin needed funds to survive in the long term. In May 1987, Gauntlett and <a href="Prince%20Michael%20of%20Kent">Prince Michael of Kent</a> were staying at the home of Contessa Maggi, the wife of the founder of the original <a href="Mille%20Miglia">Mille Miglia</a>, while watching the revival event. Another house guest was <a href="Walter%20Hayes">Walter Hayes</a>, vice-president of <a href="Ford%20of%20Europe">Ford of Europe</a>. Despite problems over the previous acquisition of <a href="AC%20Cars">AC Cars</a>, Hayes saw the potential of the brand and the discussion resulted in <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> taking a share holding in September 1987. In 1988, having produced some 5,000 cars in 20 years, a revived economy and successful sales of limited edition <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Vantage">Vantage</a>, and 52 <a href="Aston%20Martin%20V8%20Zagato">Volante Zagato</a> coupes at £86,000 each; Aston Martin finally retired the ancient V8 and introduced the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Virage">Virage</a> range—the first new Aston launched in 20 years.

Although Gauntlett was contractually to stay as chairman for two years, his racing interests took Aston back into sports car racing in 1989 with limited European success. However, with engine rule changes for the 1990 season and the launch of the new <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Volante">Aston Martin Volante</a> model, Ford provided the limited supply of <a href="Cosworth">Cosworth</a> engines to the <a href="Jaguar%20cars">Jaguar cars</a> racing team. As the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB7">"small Aston" DB7</a> would require a large engineering input, Ford agreed to take full control of Aston Martin, and Gauntlett handed over Aston Martin's chairmanship to Hayes in 1991. In 1992, the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Virage%23Vantage">Vantage</a> version was announced, and the following year Aston Martin renewed the DB range by announcing the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB7">DB7</a>.

Ford placed Aston in the <a href="Premier%20Automotive%20Group">Premier Automotive Group</a>, invested in new manufacturing and ramped up production. In 1994, Ford opened a new factory at Banbury Road in <a href="Bloxham">Bloxham</a>. In 1995 Aston Martin produced a record 700 vehicles. Until the Ford era, cars had been produced by hand coachbuilding craft methods, such as the <a href="English%20wheel">English wheel</a>. In 1998 the 2,000th DB7 was built, and in 2002 the 6,000th, exceeding production of all previous DB models. The DB7 range was boosted by the addition of <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB7">V12 Vantage</a> models in 1999, and in 2001 Aston Martin introduced the V12-engined <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Vanquish">Aston Martin Vanquish</a>.

At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan in 2003, Aston Martin introduced the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20V8%20Vantage%20%282005%29">AMV8 Vantage</a> concept car. Expected to have few changes before its introduction in 2005, the Vantage brought back the classic V8 engine to allow Aston Martin to compete in a larger market. 2003 also saw the opening of the <a href="Gaydon">Gaydon</a> factory, the first purpose-built factory in Aston Martin's history. Also introduced in 2003 was the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB9">DB9</a> coupé, which replaced the ten-year-old <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB7">DB7</a>. A <a href="Roadster%20%28automobile%29">convertible</a> version of the DB9, the <a href="DB9%20Volante">DB9 Volante</a>, was introduced at the 2004 Detroit Auto Show.

In October 2004, Aston Martin set up the dedicated <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Engine%20Plant">AMEP</a> engine production plant within the <a href="Ford%20Germany">Ford Germany</a> <a href="Niehl%2C%20Cologne">Niehl, Cologne</a> plant. With capacity to produce up to 5,000 engines a year by 100 specially trained personnel, like traditional Aston Martin engine production from Newport Pagnell, assembly of each unit is entrusted to a single technician from a pool of 30, with V8 and V12 variants assembled in under 20 hours. By bringing engine production back to within Aston Martin, the promise was that Aston Martin would be able to produce small runs of higher performance variants engines. This expanded engine capacity allowed in 2006, the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20V8%20Vantage%20%282005%29">V8 Vantage</a> sports car to enter production at the Gaydon factory, joining the DB9 and DB9 Volante.

In December 2003 Aston Martin announced it would return to motor racing in 2005. A new division was created, called <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Racing">Aston Martin Racing</a>, which became responsible, together with <a href="Prodrive">Prodrive</a>, for the design, development, and management of the DBR9 program. The DBR9 competes in the GT class in <a href="sports%20car%20racing">sports car races</a>, including the world-famous <a href="24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a>.

In 2006, an internal audit led Ford to consider divesting itself of parts of its <a href="Premier%20Automotive%20Group">Premier Automotive Group</a>. After suggestions of selling <a href="Jaguar%20Cars">Jaguar Cars</a>, <a href="Land%20Rover">Land Rover</a>, or <a href="Volvo%20Cars">Volvo Cars</a> were weighed, Ford announced in August 2006 it had engaged <a href="UBS%20AG">UBS AG</a> to sell all or part of Aston Martin at auction.

On 12 March 2007, a consortium led by <a href="Prodrive">Prodrive</a> chairman <a href="David%20Richards%20%28racing%29">David Richards</a> purchased Aston Martin for £475m (US$848m). The group included American investment banker John Singers and two <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>i companies, <a href="Investment%20Dar">Investment Dar</a> and <a href="Adeem%20Investment">Adeem Investment</a>; Prodrive had no financial involvement in the deal.
Ford kept a stake in Aston Martin valued at £40m (US$70m).

To demonstrate the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20V8%20Vantage%20%282005%29">V8 Vantage</a>'s durability across hazardous terrain and promote the car in China, the first east-west crossing of the <a href="Asian%20Highway%20Network%23First%20car%20crossing">Asian Highway</a> was undertaken between June and August 2007. A pair of Britons drove from Tokyo to <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> before joining the European motorway network for another to London. The promotion was so successful Aston Martin opened dealerships in Shanghai and Beijing within three months.

On 19 July 2007, the <a href="Newport%20Pagnell">Newport Pagnell</a> plant rolled out the last of nearly 13,000 cars made there since 1955, a Vanquish S. The Tickford Street facility was converted to Aston Martin's service and restoration department. UK production is now concentrated at Gaydon on the former RAF V-bomber airfield. In March 2008 Aston Martin announced a partnership with <a href="Magna%20Steyr">Magna Steyr</a> to outsource manufacture of over 2,000 cars annually to Graz, Austria, reassuringly stating: "The continuing growth and success of Aston Martin is based upon Gaydon as the focal point and heart of the business, with the design and engineering of all Aston Martin products continuing to be carried out there."

More dealers in Europe and the new pair in China brought the total to 120 in 28 countries.

On 1 September 2008, Aston Martin announced the revival of the <a href="Lagonda">Lagonda</a> marque, proposing a concept to be shown in 2009 to coincide with the brand's 100th anniversary. The first production cars are slated for 2012.

In December 2008, Aston Martin announced it would cut its workforce from 1,850 to 1,250.

The first four-door <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Rapide">Aston Martin Rapide</a> sports cars rolled out of the <a href="Magna%20Steyr">Magna Steyr</a> factory in <a href="Graz">Graz</a>, Austria in 2010. The contract manufacturer provides dedicated facilities to ensure compliance with the exacting standards of Aston Martin and other marques, including <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>. Ulrich Bez has publicly speculated about outsourcing all of Aston Martin's operations with the exception of marketing. In September 2011 it was announced Rapide production would be returned to Gaydon in the second half of 2012, restoring all manufacture there.

In late 2012, Investment Dar reviewed its stake, with <a href="Mahindra%20%26amp%3B%20Mahindra">Mahindra & Mahindra</a> emerging as a potential bidder for as much as half of Aston Martin. Instead, Italian private equity fund <a href="Investindustrial">Investindustrial</a> signed a deal on 6 December 2012 to buy 37.5% of Aston Martin, investing £150 million as a capital increase. This was confirmed by Aston Martin in a press release on 7 December 2012. In April 2013 it was reported that Dr Ulrich Bez would be leaving his role as chief executive officer to take up a more ambassadorial position widely seen as the first move by the new shareholders in reviewing the leadership and strategy of Aston Martin. On 2 September 2014, Aston Martin announced it had appointed the <a href="Nissan">Nissan</a> executive <a href="Andy%20Palmer">Andy Palmer</a> as CEO with Ulrich Bez retaining a position as non-executive chairman. As sales had been declining, from 2015 Aston Martin sought new customers (particularly wealthy female buyers) with cars like Lagonda and DBX while releasing concept cars like the <a href="Aston%20Martin%20Vulcan">Vulcan</a>. According to Palmer, the troubles started when sales of the DB9 failed to generate sufficient fund to develop next-generation models which led to a downward spiral of declining sales and profitability.

In 2014, Aston Martin suffered a pre-tax loss of £72 million, almost triple that of 2013 selling 3,500 cars during the year, well below 7,300 sold in 2007 and 4,200 sold in 2013. In March 2014 Aston Martin issued “payment in kind” notes of US$165 million, at 10.25% interest, in addition to the £304 million of senior secured notes at 9.25% issued in 2011. Aston Martin also had to secure an additional investment of £200 million from its shareholders to fund development of new models.
It is reported that Aston Martin's pre-tax losses for 2016 increased by 27% to £162.8 million, the sixth year it continued to suffer a loss.

In 2013 Aston Martin signed a deal with <a href="Daimler%20AG">Daimler AG</a> to supply the next generation Aston Martin cars with new <a href="Mercedes%20AMG">Mercedes-AMG</a> engines. Daimler AG now owns 5% of Aston Martin. Mercedes-AMG will also supply Aston Martin with electrical systems. This technical partnership will support Aston Martin’s launch of a new generation of models that will incorporate new technology and V8s. The first model to sport Mercedes technology is the DB11, announced at the 2016 Geneva Motor, sporting Mercedes electronics for the entertainment, navigation and other systems.

In August 2017, a 1956 Aston Martin DBR1/1 sold at a <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> auction at the <a href="Pebble%20Beach%2C%20California">Pebble Beach, California</a> <a href="Concours%20d%27Elegance">Concours d'Elegance</a> for $22,550,000, which made it the most-expensive British car ever sold at auction, according to Sotheby's. The car was driven before by racing legends like <a href="Carroll%20Shelby">Carroll Shelby</a> and <a href="Stirling%20Moss">Stirling Moss</a>.

Albert Pike

Albert Pike (December 29, 1809 – April 2, 1891) was an attorney, soldier, writer, and <a href="Freemason">Freemason</a>. 

Pike was born in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, the son of Ben and Sarah (Andrews) Pike, and spent his childhood in <a href="Byfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Byfield</a> and <a href="Newburyport%2C%20Massachusetts">Newburyport, Massachusetts</a>. His colonial ancestors settled the area in 1635, and included <a href="John%20Pike%20%28settler%29">John Pike</a> (1613–1688/1689), the founder of <a href="Woodbridge%2C%20New%20Jersey">Woodbridge, New Jersey</a>. He attended school in Newburyport and <a href="Framingham%2C%20Massachusetts">Framingham</a> until he was 15. In August 1825, he passed entrance exams at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, though when the college requested payment of tuition fees for the first two years he chose not to attend. He began a program of self-education, later becoming a schoolteacher in <a href="Gloucester%2C%20Massachusetts">Gloucester</a>, <a href="Bedford%2C%20Massachusetts">North Bedford</a>, <a href="Fairhaven%2C%20Massachusetts">Fairhaven</a> and Newburyport.

Pike was an imposing figure; six feet tall and 300 pounds with hair that reached his shoulders and a long beard. In 1831, he left Massachusetts to travel west, first stopping in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a> and later moving on to <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. There he joined an expedition to <a href="Taos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Taos, New Mexico</a>, hunting and trading. During the excursion his horse broke and ran, forcing Pike to walk the remaining 500 miles to Taos. After this he joined a trapping expedition to the <a href="Llano%20Estacado">Llano Estacado</a> in New Mexico and Texas. Trapping was minimal and, after traveling about 1,300 miles (650 on foot), he finally arrived at <a href="Fort%20Smith%2C%20Arkansas">Fort Smith, Arkansas</a>.

Settling in Arkansas in 1833, Pike taught in a school and wrote a series of articles for the <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a> "Arkansas Advocate" under the pen name of "Casca." The articles were popular enough that he was asked to join the newspaper's staff. After marrying Mary Ann Hamilton in 1834, he purchased the newspaper. Under Pike's administration the "Advocate" promoted the viewpoint of the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> in a politically volatile and divided Arkansas December 1832.

He was the first reporter for the <a href="Arkansas%20Supreme%20Court">Arkansas Supreme Court</a> and also wrote a book (published anonymously), titled "The Arkansas Form pageRank.Book", which was a guidebook for lawyers. Pike then began to study law and was admitted to the <a href="bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> in 1837, selling the "Advocate" the same year. He also made several contacts among the Native American tribes in the area. He specialized in claims on behalf of Native Americans against the federal government. In 1852 he represented <a href="Muscogee">Creek Nation</a> before the Supreme Court in a claim regarding ceded tribal land. In 1854 he advocated for the <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a> and <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a> although compensation later awarded to the tribes in 1856 and 1857 was insufficient. These relationships were to influence the course of his Civil War service.

Additionally, Pike wrote on several legal subjects and continued producing poetry, a hobby he had begun in his youth in Massachusetts. His poems were highly regarded in his day, but are now mostly forgotten. Several volumes of his works were privately published posthumously by his daughter. In 1859, he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Harvard.

When the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> started, Pike joined the Regiment of Arkansas Mounted Volunteers (a cavalry regiment) and was commissioned as a troop commander with the rank of captain in June 1846. With his regiment, he fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buena%20Vista">Battle of Buena Vista</a>. Pike was discharged in June 1847. He and his commander, Colonel <a href="John%20Selden%20Roane">John Selden Roane</a>, had several differences of opinion. This situation led finally to an "inconclusive" <a href="duel">duel</a> between Pike and Roane on July 29, 1847 near Fort Smith, Arkansas. Although several shots were fired in the duel, nobody was injured, and the two were persuaded by their seconds to discontinue it.

After the war, Pike returned to the practice of law, moving to <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans</a> for a time beginning in 1853. He wrote another book, "Maxims of the Roman Law and some of the Ancient French Law, as Expounded and Applied in Doctrine and Jurisprudence". Although unpublished, this book increased his reputation among his associates in law. He returned to Arkansas in 1857, gaining some amount of prominence in the legal field.

At the Southern Commercial Convention of 1854, Pike said the South should remain in the Union and seek equality with the North, but if the South "were forced into an inferior status, she would be better out of the Union than in it." His stand was that state's rights superseded national law and supported the idea of a Southern secession. This stand is made clear in his pamphlet of 1861, "State or Province, Bond or Free?"

In 1861, Pike penned the lyrics to "Dixie to Arms!". At the beginning of the war, Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to the Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated <a href="List%20of%20treaties%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">several treaties</a>, one of the most important being with <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> chief <a href="John%20Ross%20%28Cherokee%20chief%29">John Ross</a>, which was concluded in 1861.

Pike was commissioned as a <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> on November 22, 1861, and given a command in the <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a>. With Gen. <a href="Benjamin%20McCulloch">Ben McCulloch</a>, Pike trained three Confederate <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s of <a href="Indian%20cavalry">Indian cavalry</a>, most of whom belonged to the "<a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">civilized tribes</a>", whose loyalty to the Confederacy was variable. Although initially victorious at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pea%20Ridge">Battle of Pea Ridge</a> (Elkhorn Tavern) in March 1862, Pike's unit was defeated later in a counterattack, after falling into disarray. When Pike was ordered to send troops to Arkansas in May 1862, he resigned in protest. As in the previous war, Pike came into conflict with his superior officers, at one time drafting a letter to <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> complaining about his direct superior.

After Pea Ridge, Pike was faced with charges that his troops had <a href="scalping">scalped</a> soldiers in the field. Maj. Gen. <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Hindman">Thomas C. Hindman</a> also charged Pike with mishandling of money and material, ordering his arrest. Both these charges were later found to be considerably lacking in evidence; nevertheless Pike, facing arrest, escaped into the hills of Arkansas, sending his resignation from the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a> on July 12. He was at length arrested on November 3 under charges of <a href="insubordination">insubordination</a> and <a href="treason">treason</a>, and held briefly in <a href="Warren%2C%20Fannin%20County%2C%20Texas">Warren, Texas</a>, but his resignation was accepted on November 11 and he was allowed to return to Arkansas.

Pike first joined the <a href="Independent%20Order%20of%20Odd%20Fellows">Independent Order of Odd Fellows</a> in 1840, and he had then joined a <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a>, where he became extremely active in the affairs of the organization, being elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the <a href="Scottish%20Rite">Scottish Rite</a>'s Southern Jurisdiction in 1859. He remained Sovereign Grand Commander for the remainder of his life (a total of thirty-two years), devoting a large amount of his time to developing the rituals of the order. Notably, he published a book called "<a href="Morals%20and%20Dogma%20of%20the%20Ancient%20and%20Accepted%20Scottish%20Rite%20of%20Freemasonry">Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry</a>" in 1871, of which there were several subsequent editions.

In America, Pike is still considered an eminent and influential Freemason, primarily in the Scottish Rite Southern Jurisdiction.

Pike died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 81, and was buried at <a href="Oak%20Hill%20Cemetery%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Oak Hill Cemetery</a>. Burial was against his wishes; he had left instructions for his body to be cremated. In 1944, his remains were moved to the <a href="House%20of%20the%20Temple">House of the Temple</a>, headquarters of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite. A <a href="Brigadier%20General%20Albert%20Pike">memorial to Pike</a> is located in the <a href="Judiciary%20Square">Judiciary Square</a> neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

The <a href="Albert%20Pike%20Memorial%20Temple">Albert Pike Memorial Temple</a> is an historic Masonic lodge in Little Rock, Arkansas listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

As a young man, Pike wrote poetry and he continued to do so for the rest of his life. At 23, he published his first poem, “Hymns to the Gods.” Later work was printed in literary journals like Blackwood’s "Edinburgh Magazine" and local newspapers. His first collection of poetry, "Prose Sketches and Poems Written in the Western Country", appeared in 1834. He later gathered many of his poems and republished them in "Hymns to the Gods and Other Poems" (1872). After his death these appeared again in "Gen. Albert Pike’s Poems" (1900) and "Lyrics and Love Songs" (1916). It was suggested that the authorship of the "<a href="The%20Old%20Canoe">The Old Canoe</a>" was attributed to Pike. It was fastened upon Pike because about the time of its publication, when it was going the rounds of the press, probably without any credit, a <a href="doggerel">doggerel</a> called "The Old Canoe" was composed about Pike by one of his political foes, the subject of it being a canoe in which he left <a href="Columbia%2C%20Tennessee">Columbia, Tennessee</a>, when a young man practicing law in that place. Pike himself stated to Senator <a href="Edward%20W.%20Carmack">Edward W. Carmack</a> that he was not the author of "The Old Canoe," and could not imagine how he ever got the credit for it. The rightful author was <a href="Emily%20Rebecca%20Page">Emily Rebecca Page</a>.

Abdul Rashid Dostum

Abdul Rashid Dostum ( ; عبدالرشید دوستم) (born 1954) is an <a href="Afghan">Afghan</a> politician who has served as <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20Afghanistan">Vice President of Afghanistan</a> since 2014. He is an ethnic <a href="Uzbeks">Uzbek</a>, former <a href="warlord">warlord</a> and general, previously part of the leadership council of the <a href="National%20Front%20of%20Afghanistan">National Front of Afghanistan</a> along with <a href="Ahmad%20Zia%20Massoud">Ahmad Zia Massoud</a> and <a href="Mohammad%20Mohaqiq">Mohammad Mohaqiq</a>, as well as chairman of his own political party, <a href="Junbish-e%20Milli-yi%20Islami-yi%20Afghanistan">Junbish-e Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan</a> (National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan). He also served in the past as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff of the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Army">Afghan National Army</a>, a role often viewed as ceremonial.

During the <a href="Soviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan">Soviet war in Afghanistan</a>, Dostum was a general in the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Army">Afghan army</a>. He later became an independent warlord and leader of <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Afghanistan%23Uzbek">Afghanistan's Uzbek community</a>. He participated in battles against the <a href="Mujahideen">Mujahideen</a> fighters in the 1980s as well as against the <a href="Islamic%20Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan">Taliban</a> in the 1990s. After the fall of the Taliban, he mainly resided in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> before returning to the country. In 2013 he made a public apology for his role in the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%281978-present%29">civil war</a>. He subsequently entered parliament, and later joined <a href="Ashraf%20Ghani">Ashraf Ghani</a>'s presidential administration as a vice president.

Dostum was born in 1954 in <a href="Khwaja%20du%20koh">Khwaja du koh</a>, <a href="Jowzjan%20Province">Jowzjan Province</a>, Afghanistan. Coming from an impoverished family, he received a very basic traditional education as he was forced to drop out of school at a young age. From there, he took up work in the <a href="Natural%20gas%20field">gas field</a>s.

Dostum began working in 1970 in a state-owned gas refinery in <a href="Sheberghan">Sheberghan</a>, participating in <a href="Trade%20union">union</a> <a href="politics">politics</a>, as the new government started to arm the staff of the workers in the oil and gas <a href="refineries">refineries</a>. The reason for this was to create "groups for the defense of the <a href="Saur%20Revolution">revolution</a>". Because of the new <a href="communist">communist</a> ideas entering Afghanistan in the 1970s, he enlisted in the army in 1978. Dostum received his basic military training in <a href="Jalalabad">Jalalabad</a>. His <a href="Squadron%20%28army%29">squadron</a> was deployed in the rural areas around Sheberghan, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security.

By the mid-1980s he commanded around 20,000 militia men and controlled the northern provinces of Afghanistan. While the unit recruited throughout Jowzjan and had a relatively broad base, many of its early troops and commanders came from Dostum's home village. He left the army after the purge of <a href="Parcham">Parcham</a>is, but returned after the <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet</a> occupation began.

During the <a href="Soviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan">Soviet war in Afghanistan</a>, Dostum was commanding a militia battalion to fight and rout <a href="mujahideen">mujahideen</a> forces; he had been appointed an <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer</a> due to prior military experience. This eventually became a regiment and later became incorporated into the defense forces as the <a href="53rd%20Division%20%28Afghanistan%29">53rd Infantry Division</a>. Dostum and his new <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> reported directly to President <a href="Mohammad%20Najibullah">Mohammad Najibullah</a>. Later on he became the commander of the <a href="military%20unit">military unit</a> 374 in <a href="Jowzjan">Jowzjan</a>. He defended the Soviet-backed Afghan government against the mujahideen forces throughout the 1980s. While he was only a regional commander, he had largely raised his forces by himself. The Jowzjani militia Dostum controlled was one of the few in the country which was able to be deployed outside its own region. They were deployed in <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a> in 1988 when <a href="Soviet%20withdrawal%20from%20Afghanistan">Soviet forces were withdrawing</a> from Afghanistan.

Dostum's men would become an important force in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Kabul">fall of Kabul</a> in 1992. In April 1992, the opposition forces began their march to Kabul against the government of Najibullah. Dostum had allied himself with the opposition commanders <a href="Ahmad%20Shah%20Massoud">Ahmad Shah Massoud</a> and <a href="Sayed%20Jafar%20Naderi">Sayed Jafar Naderi</a>, the head of the <a href="Isma%27ili">Isma'ili</a> community, and together they captured the capital city. He and Massoud fought in a coalition against <a href="Gulbuddin%20Hekmatyar">Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</a>. Massoud and Dostum's forces joined together to defend Kabul against Hekmatyar, with some 4000-5000 of his troops, units of his Shiberghan-based 53rd Division and Balkh-based Guards Division, garrisoning <a href="Bala%20Hissar%2C%20Kabul">Bala Hissar</a> fort, Maranjan Hill, and <a href="Kabul%20International%20Airport">Khwaja Rawash International Airport</a>. In 1994, Dostum allied himself with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar against the government of <a href="Burhanuddin%20Rabbani">Burhanuddin Rabbani</a> and Ahmad Shah Massoud.

Following the rise of the <a href="Islamic%20Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan">Taliban</a> and their capture of Kabul, Dostum aligned himself with the <a href="Northern%20Alliance">Northern Alliance</a> (United Front) against the Taliban. He stationed his troops in the city of <a href="Mazar-e-Sharif">Mazar-e-Sharif</a>. The Northern Alliance was assembled in late 1996 by Dostum, Massoud and <a href="Karim%20Khalili">Karim Khalili</a> against the Taliban. At this point he is said to have had a force of some 50,000 men supported by both aircraft and tanks. He ruled what was, in effect, an independent region. He printed his own Afghan currency and ran a small airline named <a href="Balkh%20Air">Balkh Air</a>.

Much like other northern alliance leaders, Dostum also faced infighting within his group and was later forced to surrender his power to General <a href="Abdul%20Malik%20Pahlawan">Abdul Malik Pahlawan</a>. Malik entered into secret negotiations with the Taliban, who promised to respect his authority over much of northern Afghanistan, in exchange for the apprehension of <a href="Ismail%20Khan">Ismail Khan</a>, one of their enemies. Accordingly, on 25 May 1997 Malik arrested Khan, handed him over and let the Taliban enter Mazar-e-Sharif, giving them control over most of northern Afghanistan. Because of this, Dostum was forced to flee to Turkey. However, Malik soon realized that the Taliban were not sincere with their promises as he saw his men being disarmed. He then rejoined the Northern Alliance, and turned against his erstwhile allies, driving them from Mazar-e-Sharif. In October 1997, Dostum returned from exile and retook charge. After Dostum briefly regained control of Mazar-e-Sharif, the Taliban returned in 1998 and he again fled to <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>.

Dostum returned to Afghanistan in October 2001 to join the U.S.-led campaign against the Taliban. Along with General <a href="Mohammed%20Fahim">Fahim</a>, <a href="Ismail%20Khan">Ismail Khan</a> and <a href="Mohammad%20Mohaqiq">Mohammad Mohaqiq</a>. In November 2001, with the beginning of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and against the wishes of the <a href="CIA">CIA</a> who distrusted Dostum, a team including <a href="Johnny%20Micheal%20Spann">Johnny Micheal Spann</a> landed to set up communications in the Dar-e-Suf. A few hours later 23 men of <a href="Special%20Forces%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595</a> landed to begin the war.

On 24 November 2001, 300 Taliban soldiers retreated after the <a href="Siege%20of%20Kunduz">Siege of Kunduz</a> by <a href="United%20States%20Army">American</a> and Northern Alliance. The Taliban laid down their weapons a few miles from the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. They eventually surrendered to Dostum. A small group of armed foreign fighters were transferred to the 19th century <a href="Prison">prison fortress</a>, <a href="Qala-i-Jangi">Qala-i-Jangi</a>. The Taliban used concealed weapons to start the <a href="Battle%20of%20Qala-i-Jangi">Battle of Qala-i-Jangi</a> against the opposition forces. The uprising was eventually brought under control.

In late 2001, Carlotta Gall, Jamie Doran and Newsweek began reporting rumors that Dostum's forces, who were fighting the Taliban alongside the US Special Forces, intentionally suffocated as many as 2,000 Taliban prisoners in container trucks in an ill-defined incident that has become known as the <a href="Dasht-i-Leili%20massacre">Dasht-i-Leili massacre</a>. In July 2009, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that according to anonymous witnesses they interviewed, "over a three-day period, Taliban prisoners were stuffed into closed metal shipping containers and given no food or water; many suffocated while being trucked to the prison. Other prisoners were killed when guards shot into the containers. The bodies were said to have been buried in a mass grave in Dasht-i-Leili, a stretch of desert just outside <a href="Sheberghan">Sheberghan</a>. A 2002 declassified U.S. State Department intelligence report quoting a news source states that another anonymous source concluded that about 1,500 Taliban prisoners died. Estimates from other anonymous witnesses or from a report by Physicians for Human Rights range from several hundred to several thousand. The report also says that several Afghan witnesses were later tortured or killed." Dostum, the Red Cross and eyewitnesses in the prison claimed that only 200 taliban prisoners died from wounds or sickness. Physicians for Human Rights claims there is satellite evidence that graves had been dug up but no investigation was done despite Dostum inviting the UN to investigate. No formal investigation was conducted and an official website of General Dostum using eyewitnesses who go on the record lays out a timeline of events that debunk the allegations. The foundation of the controversy lay in confusion in estimating the number of Taliban that possibly joined the Northern Alliance or simply returned to their villages after the Kunduz surrender. According to the biography "The Last Warlord, The Life and Times of General Dostum written by Professor Brian Williams, General Dostum has been the target of a number of sensational claims that were later debunked. Among them was the famous claim in Ahmed Rashid's book "The Taliban" that describes a tank was used to crush a thief. Ahmed Rashid corrects what turns out to be a second hand story in William's book and provides first person description of events that directly contradict the rumors.

In the aftermath of Taliban's removal from northern Afghanistan, forces loyal to Dostum frequently clashed with <a href="Tajik%20people">Tajik</a> forces loyal to <a href="Atta%20Muhammad%20Nur">Atta Muhammad Nur</a>. Atta's men kidnapped and killed a number of Dostum's men, and constantly agitated to gain control of Mazar-e-Sharif. Through the political mediations of the Karzai administration, the <a href="International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force">International Security Assistance Force</a> (ISAF) and the United Nations, the Dostum-Atta feud has gradually declined.

Dostum served as deputy defense minister the early period of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Hamid%20Karzai">Karzai administration</a>. In March 2003, he established a <a href="North%20Zone%20of%20Afghanistan">North Zone of Afghanistan</a>. On 20 May 2003, Dostum narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. He was often residing outside Afghanistan, mainly in Turkey.

On 16 August 2009, Dostum made a requested return from exile to Afghanistan to support President Hamid Karzai in his bid for <a href="Afghan%20presidential%20election%2C%202009">re-election</a>. He later flew by helicopter to his northern stronghold of Sheberghan, where he was greeted by thousands of his supporters in the local stadium. He subsequently made overtures to the United States, promising he could "destroy the Taliban and al Qaeda" if supported by the U.S., saying that "the U.S. needs strong friends like Dostum."

Dostum became <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20Afghanistan">Vice President of Afghanistan</a> in the <a href="Afghan%20presidential%20election%2C%202014">2014 Afghan presidential election</a>. His running mates were <a href="Ashraf%20Ghani">Ashraf Ghani</a> and <a href="Sarwar%20Danish">Sarwar Danish</a>.

In July 2016 <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> accused Abdul Rashid Dostum's <a href="National%20Islamic%20Movement%20of%20Afghanistan">National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan</a> of killing, abusing and looting civilians in the northern <a href="Faryab%20Province">Faryab Province</a> during June. Militia forces loyal to Dostum stated that the civilians they targeted - at least 13 killed and 32 wounded - were supporters of the Taliban.

Some media reports stated earlier that Dostum was "seeking political asylum" in Turkey while others said he was exiled. One Turkish media outlet said Dostum was visiting after flying there with then Turkey's Foreign Minister <a href="Ali%20Babacan">Ali Babacan</a> during a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

While Dostum was ruling northern Afghanistan before the Taliban took over in 1998, women were able to go about unveiled, girls were allowed to go to school and study at the <a href="University%20of%20Balkh">University of Balkh</a> in <a href="Mazar-e-Sharif">Mazar-e-Sharif</a>, cinemas showed Indian films and music played on television, activities which were all banned by the Taliban.

He viewed the ISAF forces attempt to crush the Taliban as ineffective and has gone on record saying that he could mop up the Taliban "in six months" if allowed to raise a 10,000 strong army of Afghan veterans. Senior Afghan government officials do not trust Dostum as they are concerned that he might be secretly rearming his forces.

Dostum is currently barred from entering the U.S. because of his human rights record and of his involvement in the <a href="Dasht-i-Leili%20massacre">Dasht-i-Leili massacre</a>.

A tribe named Andhra was mentioned in <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> texts such as <a href="Aitareya%20Brahmana">Aitareya Brahmana</a> (800-500 <a href="BCE">BCE</a>). According to "Aitareya Brahmana" of the <a href="Rig%20Veda">Rig Veda</a>, the Andhras left north India and settled in south India. The Satavahanas have been mentioned by the names "Andhra", "Andhrara-jatiya" and "<a href="Andhrabhrtya">Andhrabhrtya</a>" in the <a href="Puranas">Puranic literature</a>. They did not refer themselves as "Andhra" in any of their coins or inscriptions; it is possible that they were termed as "Andhras" because of their ethnicity or because their territory included the Andhra region.

Archaeological evidence from places such as <a href="Amaravathi%20%28village%29%2C%20Guntur%20district">Amaravati</a>, <a href="Dharanikota">Dharanikota</a> and <a href="Vaddamanu">Vaddamanu</a> suggests that the Andhra region was part of the <a href="Mauryan%20Empire">Mauryan Empire</a>.

After the death of Emperor <a href="Ashoka">Ashoka</a>, Mauryan rule weakened around 200 BCE, and was replaced by several smaller <a href="Kingship%20and%20kingdom%20of%20God">kingdoms</a> in the Andhra region.

The <a href="Satavahana%20dynasty">Satavahana dynasty</a> dominated the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan region</a> from the <a href="1st%20century%20BC">1st century BC</a> to the <a href="3rd%20century">3rd century</a>. The later Satavahanas made <a href="Dharanikota">Dharanikota</a> and <a href="Amaravathi%20village%2C%20Guntur%20district">Amaravathi</a> their capital, which according to the Buddhists is the place where <a href="Nagarjuna">Nagarjuna</a>, the philosopher of <a href="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> lived in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The <a href="Andhra%20Ikshvaku">Andhra Ikshvaku</a>s, with their capital at <a href="Vijayapuri%20%28South%29">Vijayapuri</a>, succeeded the Satavahanas in the <a href="Krishna%20River">Krishna River</a> valley in the later half of the 2nd century. Pallavas, who were originally executive officers under the Satavahana kings, were not a recognised political power before the 2nd century AD and were swept away by the <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20Empire">Western Chalukyan</a> invasion, led by Pulakesin II in the first quarter of the 7th century CE. After the downfall of the Ikshvakus, the <a href="Vishnukundinas">Vishnukundinas</a> were the first great dynasty in the 5th and 6th centuries, and held sway over the entire Andhra country, including <a href="Kalinga%20%28historical%20region%29">Kalinga</a> and parts of <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a>. They played an important role in the history of Deccan during the 5th and 6th century CE, with <a href="Eluru">Eluru</a>, Amaravathi and Puranisangam.

The <a href="Eastern%20Chalukyas">Eastern Chalukyas</a> of <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a>, whose dynasty lasted for around 500 years from the 7th century until 1130 C.E., eventually merged with the <a href="Chola%20empire">Chola empire</a>. They continued to rule under the protection of the Chola empire until 1189 C.E., when the kingdom succumbed to the <a href="Hoysalas">Hoysalas</a> and the <a href="Yadavas">Yadavas</a>. The roots of the <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu language</a> have been seen on inscriptions found near the <a href="Guntur">Guntur</a> district and from others dating to the rule of Renati Cholas in the fifth century <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a>.

<a href="Kakatiyas">Kakatiyas</a> ruled Andhra Pradesh state for nearly 200 years. They constructed several forts here. Their legacy was carried forward by their family members the <a href="Musunuri%20Nayaks">Musunuri Nayaks</a>.

<a href="Musunuri%20Nayaks">Musunuri Nayaks</a>, the south Indian empire who are the first kings in India to win against Delhi sultanates ruled the present day Andhra Pradesh State. Musunuri Nayaks are family members belonging to same Vamsha of <a href="Kakatiyas">Kakatiyas</a> which made them to be Nayak leaders of group of Nayaks against rebellion against Turks. Musunuri Nayaks were assisted by 75 Nayaks in the revolt against Delhi sultanates. <a href="Musunuri%20Prolaya%20Nayudu">Musunuri Prolaa Naidu</a> is the first king of Modern day Andhra Pradesh state after the fall of Kakatiyas and the first Indian king who won against Delhi sultanates. He is succeeded by his cousin <a href="Musunuri%20Kapaya%20Nayak">Musunuri Kaapaa Naidu</a> who assumed titles "Andhradesadeswara" and "Andhra Suratrana"
and ruled for nearly 40 years.

The <a href="Reddy%20dynasty">Reddy dynasty</a> (1325–1448 CE) was established by Prolaya Vema Reddi in the early <a href="14th%20century">14th century</a>, who ruled from present day Kondaveedu. Prolaya Vema Reddi was part of the confederation of states that started a movement against the invading <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a> Muslim armies of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> in 1323 CE and succeeded in repulsing them from <a href="Warangal">Warangal</a>. They constructed <a href="Kondaveedu%20Fort">Kondaveedu Fort</a> which they ruled between 1328–1428, before it was taken over by the <a href="Gajapathi%20King">Gajpathis</a> of Orissa, and later ravaged by the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> rulers of the <a href="Bahmani%20kingdom">Bahmani kingdom</a> in 1458. The <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a> emperor <a href="Krishnadevaraya">Krishnadevaraya</a> captured it in 1516. The <a href="Golconda">Golconda</a> <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a>s fought for the fort in 1531, 1536 and 1579, and Sultan <a href="Quli%20Qutb%20Shah">Quli Qutb Shah</a> captured it in 1579, renaming it "Murtuzanagar". Again it was reconquered by Vijayanagarans who overthrew sultunate rule across the entirety of modern day Andhra Pradesh (excluding Telangana). After this rebellion, the Bahmani sultans launched no further military compaigns outside their kingdoms, because the Marathas soon emerged as the strongest power in India. Efforts are in progress to classify <a href="Kondaveedu%20Fort">Kondaveedu Fort</a> as a UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>.

<a href="Pemmasani%20Nayaks">Pemmasani Nayaks</a>, the greatest kings during Vijayanagara times ruled parts of Andhra Pradesh state with <a href="Gandikota">Gandikota</a> as capital for nearly 300 years.

The Vijayanagara Empire originated in the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan Plateau</a> region in the early 14th century. It was established in 1336 by <a href="Harihara%20Raya%20I">Harihara Raya I</a> and his brother <a href="Bukka%20Raya%20I">Bukka Raya I</a> of the <a href="Sangama%20Dynasty">Sangama Dynasty</a>. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a>, <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>, <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, while <a href="Carnatic%20music">Carnatic music</a> evolved into its current form.

<a href="Harihara">Harihara</a> and <a href="Bukka">Bukka</a>, who served as treasury officers of the Kakatiyas of Warangal, founded the [Vijayanagara Empire]]. In 1347 <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a>, an independent Muslim state, the <a href="Bahmani%20Sultanate">Bahmani Sultanate</a>, was established in <a href="south%20India">south India</a> by <a href="Ala-ud-Din%20Bahman%20Shah">Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah</a> in a revolt against the Delhi Sultanate.

Later the <a href="Nizam">Nizam</a> rulers of Hyderabad ceded five territories to the British that eventually became the <a href="Rayalaseema">Rayalaseema</a> region. The Nizams retained control of the interior provinces as the <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a> of <a href="Hyderabad%20State">Hyderabad</a>, acknowledging British rule in return for local autonomy. However, <a href="Komaram%20Bheem">Komaram Bheem</a>, a tribal leader, started his fight against the erstwhile <a href="Asaf%20Jahi%20Dynasty">Asaf Jahi Dynasty</a> for the liberation of <a href="Hyderabad%20State">Hyderabad State</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">French</a> occupied <a href="Yanam%20%28India%29">Yanam</a>, in the Godavari delta, and (save for periods of British control) would hold it until 1954. In 1947 Vizianagaram was the largest Hindu princely state in Andhra Pradesh.

<a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">India became independent</a> from the United Kingdom in 1947. The Nizam wanted to retain the independence of the Princely Hyderabad State from India, but the people of the region launched a movement to join the Indian Union. The state of Hyderabad was forcibly joined to the Republic of India with <a href="Operation%20Polo">Operation Polo</a> in 1948.

As Madras became a bone of contention, in 1949 a JVP committee report stated "Andhra Province could be formed provided the Andhras give up their claim on the city of Madras (now Chennai)". After Potti Sreeramulu's death, the Telugu-speaking area of <a href="Andhra%20State">Andhra State</a> was carved out of <a href="Madras%20State">Madras State</a> on 1 October 1953, with <a href="Kurnool">Kurnool</a> as its capital city. On the basis of a gentlemen's agreement of 1 November 1956, the <a href="States%20Reorganisation%20Act">States Reorganisation Act</a> formed Andhra Pradesh by merging Andhra State with the Telugu-speaking areas of the already existing <a href="Hyderabad%20State">Hyderabad State</a>.

Accelerated Graphics Port

The Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) is a high-speed point-to-point channel for attaching a <a href="video%20card">video card</a> to a <a href="computer">computer</a> system, primarily to assist in the acceleration of <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D computer graphics</a>. It was originally designed as a successor to <a href="Peripheral%20Component%20Interconnect">PCI</a>-type connections for video cards. Since 2004, AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of <a href="PCI%20Express">PCI Express</a> (PCIe); by mid-2008, PCI Express cards dominated the market and only a few AGP models were available.

As computers increasingly became graphically oriented, successive generations of graphics adapters began to push the limits of <a href="Peripheral%20Component%20Interconnect">PCI</a>, a <a href="computer%20bus">bus</a> with shared bandwidth. This led to the development of AGP, a "bus" dedicated to graphics adapters.

AGP is heavily based on PCI, and in fact the AGP bus is a superset of the <a href="conventional%20PCI">conventional PCI</a> bus, and AGP cards must act as PCI cards.

The primary advantage of AGP over PCI is that it provides a dedicated pathway between the slot and the processor rather than sharing the PCI bus. In addition to a lack of contention for the bus, the direct connection allows for higher clock speeds.

The second major change is that AGP uses split transactions, where the address and data phases of a PCI transaction are separated. The card may send many address phases, and the host processes them in order. This avoids long delays, with the bus idle, during read operations.

Third, PCI bus handshaking is simplified. Unlike PCI bus transactions whose length is negotiated on a cycle-by-cycle basis using the FRAME# and STOP# signals, AGP transfers are always a multiple of 8 bytes long, and the total length is included in the request. Further, rather than using the IRDY# and TRDY# signals for each word, data is transferred in blocks of four clock cycles (32 words at AGP 8× speed), and pauses are allowed only between blocks.

Finally, AGP allows (optional in AGP 1.0 and 2.0, mandatory in AGP 3.0) "sideband addressing", meaning that the <a href="address%20bus">address</a> and <a href="Bus%20%28computing%29">data buses</a> are separated so the address phase does not use the main address/data (AD) lines at all. This is done by adding an extra 8-bit "SideBand Address" <a href="computer%20bus">bus</a> over which the graphics controller can issue new AGP requests while other AGP data is flowing over the main 32 address/data (AD) lines. This results in improved overall AGP data throughput.

This great improvement in memory read performance makes it practical for an AGP card to read <a href="Texture%20mapping">textures</a> directly from system RAM, while a PCI graphics card must copy it from system RAM to the card's <a href="video%20memory">video memory</a>. System memory is made available using the <a href="graphics%20address%20remapping%20table">graphics address remapping table</a> (GART), which apportions main memory as needed for texture storage. The maximum amount of system memory available to AGP is defined as the "AGP <a href="Aperture%20%28computer%20memory%29">aperture</a>".

The AGP slot first appeared on <a href="x86">x86</a>-compatible system boards based on <a href="Socket%207">Socket 7</a> Intel <a href="P5%20%28microarchitecture%29">P5</a> <a href="Pentium">Pentium</a> and <a href="Slot%201">Slot 1</a> <a href="P6%20%28microarchitecture%29">P6</a> <a href="Pentium%20II">Pentium II</a> processors. Intel introduced AGP support with the i<a href="440LX">440LX</a> Slot 1 chipset on August 26, 1997, and a flood of products followed from all the major system board vendors.

The first Socket 7 chipsets to support AGP were the <a href="VIA%20Technologies">VIA</a> <a href="Apollo%20VP3">Apollo VP3</a>, <a href="Silicon%20Integrated%20Systems">SiS</a> 5591/5592, and the <a href="Acer%20Laboratories%20Incorporated">ALI</a> Aladdin V. Intel never released an AGP-equipped Socket 7 chipset. <a href="First%20International%20Computer">FIC</a> demonstrated the first Socket 7 AGP system board in November 1997 as the "FIC PA-2012" based on the VIA Apollo VP3 chipset, followed very quickly by the "EPoX P55-VP3" also based on the VIA VP3 chipset which was first to market.

Early video chipsets featuring AGP support included the <a href="Rendition%20%28company%29">Rendition</a> Vérité V2200, <a href="3dfx">3dfx</a> <a href="3dfx%23Voodoo%20Banshee">Voodoo Banshee</a>, <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> <a href="RIVA%20128">RIVA 128</a>, <a href="3Dlabs">3Dlabs</a> PERMEDIA 2, <a href="Intel740">Intel i740</a>, <a href="ATI%20Rage">ATI Rage series</a>, <a href="Matrox">Matrox</a> Millennium II, and <a href="S3%20ViRGE">S3 ViRGE GX/2</a>. Some early AGP boards used graphics processors built around PCI and were simply bridged to AGP. This resulted in the cards benefiting little from the new bus, with the only improvement used being the 66 MHz bus clock, with its resulting doubled bandwidth over PCI, and bus exclusivity. Examples of such cards were the Voodoo Banshee, Vérité V2200, Millennium II, and S3 ViRGE GX/2. Intel's i740 was explicitly designed to exploit the new AGP feature set; in fact it was designed to texture only from AGP memory, making PCI versions of the board difficult to implement (local board RAM had to emulate AGP memory.)

Microsoft first introduced AGP support into "<a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> OEM Service Release 2" (OSR2 version 1111 or 950B) via the "USB SUPPLEMENT to OSR2" patch. After applying the patch the Windows 95 system became "Windows 95 version 4.00.950 B". The first Windows NT-based operating system to receive AGP support was <a href="Windows%20NT%204.0">Windows NT 4.0</a> with <a href="Service%20Pack">Service Pack</a> 3, introduced in 1997. <a href="Linux">Linux</a> support for AGP enhanced fast data transfers was first added in 1999 with the implementation of the <a href="AGPgart">AGPgart</a> kernel module.

Intel released "AGP specification 1.0" in 1997. It specified 3.3 V signals and 1× and 2× speeds. Specification 2.0 documented 1.5 V signaling, which could be used at 1×, 2× and the additional 4× speed and 3.0 added 0.8 V signaling, which could be operated at 4× and 8× speeds. (1× and 2× speeds are physically possible, but were not specified.)

Available versions are listed in the table on the right.

AGP version 3.5 is only publicly mentioned by Microsoft under "Universal Accelerated Graphics Port (UAGP)", which specifies mandatory supports of extra registers once marked optional under AGP 3.0. Upgraded registers include PCISTS, CAPPTR, NCAPID, AGPSTAT, AGPCMD, NISTAT, NICMD. New required registers include APBASELO, APBASEHI, AGPCTRL, APSIZE, NEPG, GARTLO, GARTHI.

There are various physical interfaces (connectors); see the <a href="%23Compatibility">Compatibility</a> section.

An official extension for cards that required more electrical power, with a longer slot with additional pins for that purpose. AGP Pro cards were usually workstation-class cards used to accelerate professional <a href="computer-aided%20design">computer-aided design</a> applications employed in the fields of architecture, machining, engineering, simulations, and similar fields.

A <a href="64-bit">64-bit</a> channel was once proposed as an optional standard for AGP 3.0 in draft documents, but it was dropped in the final version of the standard.

The standard allows 64-bit transfer for AGP8× reads, writes, and fast writes; 32-bit transfer for PCI operations.

A number of non-standard variations of the AGP interface have been produced by manufacturers.


AGP cards are <a href="Backward%20compatibility">backward</a> and <a href="Forward%20compatibility">forward compatible</a> within limits. 1.5 V-only keyed cards will not go into 3.3 V slots and vice versa, though "Universal" cards exist which will fit into either type of slot. There are also unkeyed "Universal" slots that will accept either type of card. When an AGP Universal card is plugged-into an AGP Universal slot, only the 1.5 V portion of the card is used. Some cards, like Nvidia's <a href="GeForce%206">GeForce 6</a> series (except the 6200) or ATI's <a href="Radeon%20X800">Radeon X800</a> series, only have keys for 1.5 V to prevent them from being installed in older mainboards without 1.5 V support. Some of the last modern cards with 3.3 V support were the Nvidia <a href="GeForce%20FX">GeForce FX</a> series (FX 5200, FX 5500, FX 5700, some FX 5800, FX 5900 and some FX 5950), Geforce 6 Series (6200, 6600/6600 LE/6600 GT only) and the ATI <a href="Radeon%20R300">Radeon 9500/9700/9800(R350)</a> (but not 9600/9800(R360)). Some Geforce 6200 and Geforce 6600 cards will function with AGP 1.0 (3.3v) slots.

AGP Pro cards will not fit into standard slots, but standard AGP cards will work in a Pro slot. Motherboards equipped with a Universal AGP Pro slot will accept a 1.5 V or 3.3 V card in either the AGP Pro or standard AGP configuration, a Universal AGP card, or a Universal AGP Pro card.

Some cards incorrectly have dual notches, and some motherboards incorrectly have fully open slots, allowing a card to be plugged into a slot that does not support the correct signaling voltage, which may damage card or motherboard. Some incorrectly designed older 3.3 V cards have the 1.5 V key.

There are some proprietary systems incompatible with standard AGP; for example, <a href="Apple%20Computer">Apple</a> <a href="Power%20Macintosh">Power Macintosh</a> computers with the <a href="Apple%20Display%20Connector">Apple Display Connector</a> (ADC) have an extra connector which delivers power to the attached display. Some cards designed to work with a specific <a href="CPU%20design">CPU architecture</a> (e.g., PC, Apple) may not work with others due to <a href="firmware">firmware</a> issues.

Mark Allen of Playtools.com made the following comments regarding Practical AGP Compatibility for AGP 3.0 and AGP 2.0:

"...nobody makes AGP 3.0 cards, and nobody makes AGP 3.0 motherboards. At least not any manufacturers I can find. Every single video card I could find which claimed to be an AGP 3.0 card was actually a universal 1.5V AGP 3.0 card. And every motherboard which claimed to be an AGP 3.0 motherboard turned out to be a universal 1.5V AGP 3.0 motherboard. It makes sense, if you think about it, because if anyone actually shipped a consumer-oriented product which supported only 0.8 volts, they would end up with lots of confused customers and a support nightmare. In the consumer market, you'd have to be crazy to ship a 0.8 volt only product."

Actual power supplied by an AGP slot depends upon the card used. The maximum <a href="Electric%20current">current</a> drawn from the various rails is given in the specifications for the various versions. For example, if maximum current is drawn from all supplies and all voltages are at their specified upper limits, an AGP 3.0 slot can supply up to 48.25 <a href="watt">watt</a>s; this figure can be used to specify a power supply conservatively, but in practice a card is unlikely ever to draw more than 40 W from the slot, with many using less. AGP Pro provides additional power up to 110 W. Many AGP cards had additional power connectors to supply them with more power than the slot could provide.

By 2010 few new motherboards had AGP slots. No new motherboard chipsets were equipped with AGP support, but motherboards continued to be produced with older chipsets with support for AGP.

Graphics processors of this period use PCI-Express, a general-purpose (not restricted to graphics) standard that supports higher data transfer rates and <a href="Duplex%20%28telecommunications%29">full-duplex</a>. To create AGP-compatible graphics cards, those chips require an additional PCIe-to-AGP bridge-chip to convert PCIe signals to and from AGP signals. This incurs additional board costs due to the need for the additional bridge chip and for a separate AGP-designed circuit board.

Various manufacturers of graphics cards continued to produce AGP cards for the shrinking AGP user-base. The first bridged cards were the GeForce 6600 and ATI Radeon X800 XL boards, released during 2004-5. In 2009 AGP cards from Nvidia had a ceiling of the <a href="GeForce%207%20Series">GeForce 7 Series</a>. In 2011 <a href="DirectX">DirectX</a> 10-capable AGP cards from AMD vendors (Club 3D, HIS, Sapphire, Jaton, Visiontek, Diamond, etc.) included the <a href="Radeon%20R600">Radeon HD 2400, 3450, 3650</a>, 3850, <a href="Radeon%20R700">4350, 4650, and 4670</a>. The HD 5000 AGP series mentioned in the catalyst software was never available. There were many problems with the AMD Catalyst 11.2 - 11.6 AGP hotfix drivers under Windows 7 with the HD 4000 series AGP video cards; use of 10.12 or 11.1 AGP hotfix drivers is the recommended workaround. Several of the vendors listed above make available past versions of the AGP drivers.

An AGP bus is a superset of a 66 MHz <a href="conventional%20PCI">conventional PCI</a> bus and, immediately after reset, follows the same protocol. The card must act as a PCI target, and optionally may act as a PCI master. (AGP 2.0 added a "fast writes" extension which allows PCI writes from the motherboard to the card to transfer data at higher speed.)

After the card is initialized using PCI transactions, AGP transactions are permitted. For these, the card is always the AGP master and the motherboard is always the AGP target. The card queues multiple requests which correspond to the PCI address phase, and the motherboard schedules the corresponding data phases later. An important part of initialization is telling the card the maximum number of outstanding AGP requests which may be queued at a given time.

AGP requests are similar to PCI memory read and write requests, but use a different encoding on command lines C/BE[3:0] and are always 8-byte <a href="Data%20structure%20alignment">aligned</a>; their starting address and length are always multiples of 8 bytes (64 bits). The three low-order bits of the address are used instead to communicate the length of the request.

Whenever the PCI GNT# signal is asserted, granting the bus to the card, three additional status bits ST[2:0] indicate the type of transfer to be performed next. If the bits are codice_1, a previously queued AGP transaction's data is to be transferred; if the three bits are codice_2, the card may begin a PCI transaction or (if sideband addressing is not in use) queue a request in-band using PIPE#.

Like PCI, each AGP transaction begins with an address phase, communicating an address and 4-bit command code. The possible commands are different from PCI, however:


AGP 3.0 dropped high-priority requests and the long read commands, as they were little used. It also mandated side-band addressing, thus dropping the dual address cycle, leaving only four request types: low-priority read (0000), low-priority write (0100), flush (1010) and fence (1100).

To queue a request in-band, the card must request the bus using the standard PCI REQ# signal, and receive GNT# plus bus status ST[2:0] equal to codice_2. Then, instead of asserting FRAME# to begin a PCI transaction, the card asserts the PIPE# signal while driving the AGP command, address, and length on the C/BE[3:0], AD[31:3] and AD[2:0] lines, respectively. (If the address is 64 bits, a dual address cycle similar to PCI is used.) For every cycle that PIPE# is asserted, the card sends another request without waiting for acknowledgement from the motherboard, up to the configured maximum queue depth. The last cycle is marked by deasserting REQ#, and PIPE# is deasserted on the following idle cycle.

If side-band addressing is supported and configured, the PIPE# signal is not used. (And the signal is re-used for another purpose in the AGP 3.0 protocol, which requires side-band addressing.) Instead, requests are broken into 16-bit pieces which are sent as two bytes across the SBA bus. There is no need for the card to ask permission from the motherboard; a new request may be sent at any time as long as the number of outstanding requests is within the configured maximum queue depth. The possible values are:


Sideband address bytes are sent at the same rate as data transfers, up to 8× the 66 MHz basic bus clock. Sideband addressing has the advantage that it mostly eliminates the need for turnaround cycles on the AD bus between transfers, in the usual case when read operations greatly outnumber writes.

While asserting GNT#, the motherboard may instead indicate via the ST bits that a data phase for a queued request will be performed next. There are four queues: two priorities (low- and high-priority) for each of reads and writes, and each is processed in order. Obviously, the motherboard will attempt to complete high-priority requests first, but there is no limit on the number of low-priority responses which may be delivered while the high-priority request is processed.

For each cycle when the GNT# is asserted and the status bits have the value codice_13, a read response of the indicated priority is scheduled to be returned. At the next available opportunity (typically the next clock cycle), the motherboard will assert TRDY# (target ready) and begin transferring the response to the oldest request in the indicated read queue. (Other PCI bus signals like FRAME#, DEVSEL# and IRDY# remain deasserted.) Up to four clock cycles worth of data (16 bytes at AGP 1× or 128 bytes at AGP 8×) are transferred without waiting for acknowledgement from the card. If the response is longer than that, both the card and motherboard must indicate their ability to continue on the third cycle by asserting IRDY# (initiator ready) and TRDY#, respectively. If either one does not, <a href="wait%20state">wait state</a>s will be inserted until two cycles after they both do. (The value of IRDY# and TRDY# at other times is irrelevant and they are usually deasserted.)

The C/BE# byte enable lines may be ignored during read responses, but are held asserted (all bytes valid) by the motherboard.

The card may also assert the RBF# (read buffer full) signal to indicate that it is temporarily unable to receive more low-priority read responses. The motherboard will refrain from scheduling any more low-priority read responses. The card must still be able to receive the end of the current response, and the first four-cycle block of the following one if scheduled, plus any high-priority responses it has requested.

For each cycle when GNT# is asserted and the status bits have the value codice_14, write data is scheduled to be sent across the bus. At the next available opportunity (typically the next clock cycle), the card will assert IRDY# (initiator ready) and begin transferring the data portion of the oldest request in the indicated write queue. If the data is longer than four clock cycles, the motherboard will indicate its ability to continue by asserting TRDY# on the third cycle. Unlike reads, there is no provision for the card to delay the write; if it didn't have the data ready to send, it shouldn't have queued the request.

The C/BE# lines "are" used with write data, and may be used by the card to select which bytes should be written to memory.

The multiplier in AGP 2×, 4× and 8× indicates the number of data transfers across the bus during each 66 MHz clock cycle. Such transfers use <a href="source%20synchronous">source synchronous</a> clocking with a "strobe" signal (AD_STB[0], AD_STB[1], and SB_STB) generated by the data source. AGP 4× adds complementary strobe signals.

Because AGP transactions may be as short as two transfers, at AGP 4× and 8× speeds it is possible for a request to complete in the middle of a clock cycle. In such a case, the cycle is padded with dummy data transfers (with the C/BE# byte enable lines held deasserted).

The AGP connector contains almost all PCI signals, plus several additions. The connector has 66 contacts on each side, although 4 are removed for each keying notch. Pin 1 is closest to the I/O bracket, and the B and A sides are as in the table, looking down at the motherboard connector.

Contacts are spaced at 1 mm intervals, however they are arranged in two staggered vertical rows so that there is 2 mm space between pins in each row. Odd-numbered A-side contacts, and even-numbered B-side contacts are in the lower row (1.0 to 3.5 mm from the card edge). The others are in the upper row (3.7 to 6.0 mm from the card edge).

PCI signals omitted are:

Signals added are:
