Bird

Birds (Aves) are a group of <a href="endotherm">endotherm</a>ic <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, characterised by <a href="feather">feather</a>s, <a href="tooth">tooth</a>less <a href="beak">beak</a>ed jaws, the <a href="Oviparity">laying</a> of <a href="Eggshell">hard-shelled</a> eggs, a high <a href="metabolic">metabolic</a> rate, a four-chambered <a href="heart">heart</a>, and a strong yet lightweight <a href="Bird%20skeleton">skeleton</a>. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the <a href="bee%20hummingbird">bee hummingbird</a> to the <a href="Common%20ostrich">ostrich</a>. They rank as the <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">class</a> of <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, sometimes known as perching birds. Birds are the closest living relatives of <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns. Birds are descendants of extinct <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s with <a href="feathered%20dinosaur">feathers</a>, making them the only surviving dinosaurs according to <a href="cladistics">cladistics</a>.

The <a href="fossil">fossil</a> record indicates that birds evolved from <a href="feathered%20dinosaur">feathered</a> ancestors within the <a href="theropod">theropod</a> group, which are traditionally placed within the <a href="saurischia">saurischia</a>n <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s, though a 2017 paper has put them in a proposed clade <a href="Ornithoscelida">Ornithoscelida</a>, along with the <a href="Ornithischia">Ornithischia</a>. True birds first appeared during the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period, around 120 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event</a> 66 million years ago, which reduced the <a href="Pterosaur">Pterosaur</a>s, and killed off all the non-avian dinosaur lineages. Birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group <a href="Avialae">Avialae</a>, have been found dating back to the mid-<a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> period, around 170 million years ago. Many of these early "stem-birds", such as "<a href="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a>", were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.

Birds have which are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups without wings are the <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="moa">moa</a> and <a href="elephant%20bird">elephant bird</a>s. Wings, which evolved from <a href="forelimb">forelimb</a>s, gave birds the ability to <a href="bird%20flight">fly</a>, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in <a href="flightless%20bird">flightless bird</a>s, including <a href="ratite">ratite</a>s, <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s, and diverse <a href="endemism%20in%20birds">endemic island species of birds</a>. The <a href="Digestion">digestive</a> and <a href="respiratory%20system">respiratory system</a>s of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s and some <a href="Water%20bird">waterbirds</a>, have further evolved for <a href="aquatic%20locomotion">swimming</a>.

Some birds, especially <a href="corvids">corvids</a> and <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s, are among the most <a href="intelligent%20animal">intelligent animal</a>s; several bird species <a href="tool%20use%20by%20animals">make and use tools</a>, and many <a href="social%20animal">social species</a> pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of <a href="culture">culture</a>. Many species annually <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and <a href="bird%20vocalization">bird song</a>s, and participating in such social behaviours as <a href="helpers%20at%20the%20nest">cooperative breeding</a> and hunting, <a href="Flocking%20%28behavior%29">flocking</a>, and <a href="Mobbing%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mobbing</a> of predators. The vast majority of bird species are <a href="socially%20monogamous">socially monogamous</a> (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are <a href="Polyandry">polygynous</a> (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, <a href="Polyandry">polyandrous</a> (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying <a href="egg">egg</a>s which are fertilised through <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual reproduction</a>. They are usually laid in a <a href="Bird%20nest">nest</a> and <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubated</a> by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as <a href="Chicken">hens</a>, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.

Many species of birds are economically important as <a href="food">food</a> for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds (<a href="poultry">poultry</a> and <a href="Game%20%28hunting%29">game</a>) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. <a href="Songbird">Songbird</a>s, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. <a href="Guano">Guano</a> (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a <a href="fertilizer">fertiliser</a>. Birds <a href="list%20of%20fictional%20birds">prominently figure</a> throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to <a href="bird%20conservation">protect</a> them. Recreational <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a> is an important part of the <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a> industry.

The first <a href="biological%20classification">classification</a> of birds was developed by <a href="Francis%20Willughby">Francis Willughby</a> and <a href="John%20Ray">John Ray</a> in their 1676 volume "Ornithologiae".
<a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> modified that work in 1758 to devise the <a href="taxonomic%20classification">taxonomic classification</a> system currently in use. Birds are categorised as the <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">biological class</a> Aves in <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">Linnaean taxonomy</a>. <a href="Phylogenetic%20taxonomy">Phylogenetic taxonomy</a> places Aves in the dinosaur <a href="clade">clade</a> <a href="Theropoda">Theropoda</a>.

Aves and a sister group, the clade <a href="Crocodilia">Crocodilia</a>, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade <a href="Archosauria">Archosauria</a>. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetically</a> as all descendants of the <a href="most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">most recent common ancestor</a> of modern birds and "<a href="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx lithographica</a>". However, an earlier definition proposed by <a href="Jacques%20Gauthier">Jacques Gauthier</a> gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the <a href="Phylocode">Phylocode</a> system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the <a href="crown%20group">crown group</a> of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the Avialae, in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of "Archaeopteryx" in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.

Gauthier identified four different definitions for the same biological name "Aves", which is a problem. Gauthier proposed to reserve the term Aves only for the <a href="crown%20group">crown group</a> consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants, which corresponds to meaning number 4 below. He assigned other names to the other groups.


Under the fourth definition "Archaeopteryx" is an avialan, and not a member of Aves. Gauthier's proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of palaeontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent. Avialae, initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of Aves, is often used synonymously with the vernacular term "bird" by these researchers.

Most researchers define Avialae as branch-based clade, though definitions vary. Many authors have used a definition similar to "all <a href="theropod">theropod</a>s closer to birds than to "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>"." Avialae is also occasionally defined as an <a href="Phylogenetic%20nomenclature%23Phylogenetic%20definitions">apomorphy-based clade</a> (that is, one based on physical characteristics). <a href="Jacques%20Gauthier">Jacques Gauthier</a>, who named Avialae in 1986, re-defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered <a href="wing">wing</a>s used in flapping <a href="Bird%20flight">flight</a>, and the birds that descended from them.

Based on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of <a href="theropod">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s, and more specifically, they are members of <a href="Maniraptora">Maniraptora</a>, a group of theropods which includes <a href="dromaeosaur">dromaeosaur</a>s and <a href="oviraptorid">oviraptorid</a>s, among others. As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the <a href="Liaoning">Liaoning</a> Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod <a href="feathered%20dinosaurs">feathered dinosaurs</a>, contribute to this ambiguity.

The consensus view in contemporary <a href="paleontology">palaeontology</a> is that the flying theropods, or <a href="Avialae">avialans</a>, are the closest relatives of the <a href="deinonychosaur">deinonychosaur</a>s, which include dromaeosaurids and <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a>s. Together, these form a group called <a href="Paraves">Paraves</a>. Some <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> members of this group, such as "<a href="Microraptor">Microraptor</a>", have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small. This evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a>, have been able to glide, or both. Unlike "Archaeopteryx" and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that the first avialans were <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>s.

The <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> "Archaeopteryx" is well known as one of the first <a href="transitional%20fossil">transitional fossil</a>s to be found, and it provided support for the <a href="theory%20of%20evolution">theory of evolution</a> in the late 19th century. "Archaeopteryx" was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail, as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor.

The earliest known avialan fossils come from the <a href="Tiaojishan%20Formation">Tiaojishan Formation</a> of China, which has been dated to the late <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> period (<a href="Oxfordian%20%28stage%29">Oxfordian</a> stage), about 160 million years ago. The avialan species from this time period include "<a href="Anchiornis%20huxleyi">Anchiornis huxleyi</a>", "<a href="Xiaotingia%20zhengi">Xiaotingia zhengi</a>", and "<a href="Aurornis%20xui">Aurornis xui</a>".

The well-known early avialan, "Archaeopteryx", dates from slightly later Jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird evolution. These features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or "hind wings" covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering.

Avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the <a href="Cretaceous%20Period">Cretaceous Period</a>. Many groups retained <a href="symplesiomorphy">primitive characteristics</a>, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as "Archaeopteryx" and "<a href="Jeholornis">Jeholornis</a>", retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the <a href="pygostyle">pygostyle</a> bone in the group <a href="Pygostylia">Pygostylia</a>. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.

The first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed avialans to evolve were the <a href="enantiornithes">enantiornithes</a>, or "opposite birds", so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds. Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches, from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters. While they were the dominant group of avialans during the Cretaceous period, enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> era.

Many species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify, the <a href="Euornithes">Euornithes</a> (meaning "true birds", because they include the ancestors of modern birds), were semi-aquatic and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms. Unlike the enantiornithes, which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats, most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species, waders, and swimming and diving species.

The later included the superficially <a href="gull">gull</a>-like "<a href="Ichthyornis">Ichthyornis</a>", the <a href="Hesperornithiformes">Hesperornithiformes</a>, which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic. The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws). Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true <a href="pygostyle">pygostyle</a> and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers, which may have replaced the "hind wing" as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.

All modern birds lie within the <a href="crown%20group">crown group</a> Aves (alternately Neornithes), which has two subdivisions: the <a href="Palaeognathae">Palaeognathae</a>, which includes the flightless <a href="ratite">ratite</a>s (such as the <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>es) and the weak-flying <a href="tinamou">tinamou</a>s, and the extremely diverse <a href="Neognathae">Neognathae</a>, containing all other birds. These two subdivisions are often given the <a href="taxonomic%20rank">rank</a> of <a href="superorder">superorder</a>, although <a href="Bradley%20C.%20Livezey">Livezey</a> and Zusi assigned them "cohort" rank. Depending on the <a href="alpha%20taxonomy">taxonomic</a> viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,050.

The discovery of "<a href="Vegavis">Vegavis</a>", a late Cretaceous member of the <a href="Anatidae">Anatidae</a>, proved that the diversification of modern birds started before the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>. The affinities of an earlier fossil, the possible galliform "Austinornis lentus", dated to about 85 million years ago, are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird diversification.

Most studies agree on a <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> age for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds but estimates range from the <a href="Middle%20Cretaceous">Middle Cretaceous</a> to the latest <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a>. Similarly, there is no agreement on whether most of the early diversification of modern birds occurred before or after the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event</a>. This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; most molecular dating studies suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while <a href="fossil">fossil</a> evidence points to a <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> radiation (the so-called 'rocks' versus 'clocks' controversy). Previous attempts to reconcile molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial, but more recent estimates, using a more comprehensive sample of fossils and a new way of calibrating <a href="molecular%20clocks">molecular clocks</a>, showed that while modern birds originated early in the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a>, a pulse of diversification in all major groups occurred around the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event</a>.

<a href="Cladogram">Cladogram</a> of modern bird relationships based on Prum, R.O. "et al". (2015) with some <a href="clade">clade</a> names after Yuri, T. et al. (2013).

The classification of birds is a contentious issue. <a href="Charles%20Sibley">Sibley</a> and <a href="Jon%20Ahlquist">Ahlquist</a>'s "Phylogeny and Classification of Birds" (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.

Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents, reaching their southern extreme in the <a href="Snow%20petrel">snow petrel's</a> breeding colonies up to inland in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. The highest bird <a href="biodiversity">diversity</a> occurs in tropical regions. It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher <a href="speciation">speciation</a> rates in the tropics; however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater <a href="extinction">extinction</a> rates than in the tropics. Several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them, with some <a href="seabird">seabird</a> species coming ashore only to breed and some <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s have been recorded diving up to deep.

Many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the <a href="ring-necked%20pheasant">ring-necked pheasant</a>, for example, has been introduced around the world as a <a href="game%20bird">game bird</a>. Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild <a href="monk%20parakeet">monk parakeet</a>s in several North American cities after their escape from captivity. Some species, including <a href="cattle%20egret">cattle egret</a>, <a href="yellow-headed%20caracara">yellow-headed caracara</a> and <a href="galah">galah</a>, have <a href="Avian%20range%20expansion">spread naturally</a> far beyond their original ranges as <a href="Agriculture">agricultural practices</a> created suitable new habitat.

Compared with other vertebrates, birds have a <a href="body%20plan">body plan</a> that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate <a href="bird%20flight">flight</a>.

The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the <a href="respiratory%20system">respiratory system</a>. The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show <a href="cranial%20sutures">cranial sutures</a>. The <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbits</a> are large and separated by a bony <a href="septum">septum</a>. The <a href="vertebral%20column">spine</a> has cervical, thoracic, lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical (neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior <a href="thoracic%20vertebrae">thoracic vertebrae</a> and absent in the later vertebrae. The last few are fused with the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> to form the <a href="synsacrum">synsacrum</a>. The ribs are flattened and the <a href="sternum">sternum</a> is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders. The forelimbs are modified into wings.

Like the <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a> instead of <a href="urea">urea</a> or <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a <a href="urinary%20bladder">urinary bladder</a> or external urethral opening and (with exception of the <a href="Ostrich%23Description">ostrich</a>) uric acid is excreted along with faeces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete <a href="creatine">creatine</a>, rather than <a href="creatinine">creatinine</a> like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a>. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by <a href="Bird%20anatomy%23Reproduction">joining cloaca</a>, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate <a href="Pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellets</a>.

Males within <a href="Palaeognathae">Palaeognathae</a> (with the exception of the <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>s), the <a href="Anseriformes">Anseriformes</a> (with the exception of <a href="screamer">screamer</a>s), and in rudimentary forms in <a href="Galliformes">Galliformes</a> (but fully developed in <a href="Cracidae">Cracidae</a>) possess a <a href="bird%20penis">penis</a>, which is never present in <a href="Neoaves">Neoaves</a>. The length is thought to be related to <a href="sperm%20competition">sperm competition</a>. When not copulating, it is hidden within the <a href="proctodeum">proctodeum</a> compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The <a href="digestive%20system">digestive system</a> of birds is unique, with a <a href="crop%20%28anatomy%29">crop</a> for storage and a <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a> that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.

Birds have one of the most complex <a href="respiratory%20system">respiratory system</a>s of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior <a href="Parabronchi">air sac</a> which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the <a href="syrinx%20%28biology%29">syrinx</a>, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.

In birds, the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right <a href="aortic%20arches">aortic arch</a> (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms this part of the <a href="aorta">aorta</a>. The postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system. Unlike in mammals, the circulating <a href="red%20blood%20cells">red blood cells</a> in birds retain their <a href="cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a>.

The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a <a href="serous%20fluid">serous fluid</a> for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an <a href="atrium%20%28heart%29">atrium</a> and <a href="ventricle%20%28heart%29">ventricle</a>. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by <a href="atrioventricular%20valves">atrioventricular valves</a> which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.

The <a href="sinoatrial%20node">sinoatrial node</a> uses calcium to cause a depolarising signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of <a href="endocardial">endocardial</a>, <a href="myocardial">myocardial</a> and <a href="epicardial">epicardial</a> layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.

Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo <a href="vasoconstriction">vasoconstriction</a>, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.

Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called <a href="vasodilation">vasodilation</a> bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.

The <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> is large relative to the bird's size. The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the <a href="cerebellum">cerebellum</a> coordinates movement and the <a href="cerebrum">cerebrum</a> controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and <a href="Bird%20nest">nest</a> building. Most birds have a poor <a href="olfaction">sense of smell</a> with notable exceptions including <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>s, <a href="New%20World%20vulture">New World vulture</a>s and <a href="tubenoses">tubenoses</a>. The avian <a href="visual%20system">visual system</a> is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual <a href="Fovea%20centralis">fovea</a>. Birds are <a href="tetrachromacy">tetrachromatic</a>, possessing <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> (UV) sensitive <a href="cone%20cell">cone cell</a>s in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones. This allows them to perceive ultraviolet light, which is involved in courtship. Birds have <a href="https%3A//birdsnews.com/2014/scientists-document-light-sensitive-eye-within-brain-birds/%23.U8ArB_ldWCl">specialised light-sensing cells deep in their brains</a> that respond to light without input from eyes or other sensory neurons. These photo-receptive cells in the hypothalamus are involved in detecting the longer days of spring, and thus regulate breeding activities.

Many birds show plumage patterns in <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male <a href="blue%20tit">blue tit</a>s have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—<a href="kestrel">kestrel</a>s have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a>, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a <a href="contact%20lens">contact lens</a> in many aquatic birds. The bird <a href="retina">retina</a> has a fan shaped blood supply system called the <a href="Pecten%20oculi">pecten</a>.

Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the <a href="great%20cormorant">great cormorant</a>. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide <a href="visual%20field">visual field</a>, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular vision</a> and can estimate the <a href="depth%20of%20field">depth of field</a>. The avian <a href="ear">ear</a> lacks external <a href="pinna%20%28anatomy%29">pinnae</a> but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the "<a href="Asio">Asio</a>", "<a href="Horned%20owl">Bubo</a>" and "<a href="Scops%20owl">Otus</a>" <a href="owl">owl</a>s, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a> has a <a href="cochlea">cochlea</a>, but it is not spiral as in mammals.

A few species are able to use chemical defences against predators; some <a href="Procellariiformes">Procellariiformes</a> can eject an unpleasant <a href="stomach%20oil">stomach oil</a> against an aggressor, and some species of <a href="pitohui">pitohui</a>s from <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> have a powerful <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a> in their skin and feathers.

A lack of field observations limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (<a href="Anhimidae">Anhimidae</a>), some jacanas ("<a href="Jacana">Jacana</a>", "<a href="Hydrophasianus">Hydrophasianus</a>"), the spur-winged goose ("<a href="Plectropterus">Plectropterus</a>"), the torrent duck ("<a href="Merganetta">Merganetta</a>") and nine species of lapwing ("<a href="Vanellus">Vanellus</a>") use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks ("<a href="Tachyeres">Tachyeres</a>"), geese and swans ("<a href="Anserinae">Anserinae</a>"), the solitaire ("<a href="Pezophaps">Pezophaps</a>"), sheathbills ("<a href="Chionis">Chionis</a>"), some guans ("<a href="Crax">Crax</a>") and stone curlews ("<a href="Burhinus">Burhinus</a>") use a bony knob on the <a href="alula">alula</a>r metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents. The jacanas "<a href="Actophilornis">Actophilornis</a>" and "<a href="Irediparra">Irediparra</a>" have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct "<a href="Xenicibis">Xenicibis</a>" was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail. <a href="Cygnus%20olor">Swans</a>, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.

Birds have two sexes: either <a href="female">female</a> or <a href="male">male</a>. The sex of birds is determined by the <a href="ZW%20sex-determination%20system">Z and W sex chromosomes</a>, rather than by the <a href="XY%20sex-determination%20system">X and Y chromosomes</a> present in <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s. Male birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z chromosome (WZ).

In nearly all species of birds, an individual's sex is determined at fertilisation. However, one recent study demonstrated <a href="temperature-dependent%20sex%20determination">temperature-dependent sex determination</a> among the <a href="Australian%20brushturkey">Australian brushturkey</a>, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male <a href="sex%20ratio">sex ratio</a>. This, however, was later proven to not be the case. These birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, but temperature-dependent sex mortality.

Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in <a href="Feathered%20dinosaurs">some dinosaurs</a> not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate <a href="bird%20flight">flight</a>, provide insulation that aids in <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called <a href="Pterylography">pterylae</a>. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, may vary within species by age, <a href="social%20status">social status</a>, and <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sex</a>.

Plumage is regularly <a href="moult">moult</a>ed; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the "" plumage, or—in the <a href="Humphrey-Parkes%20terminology">Humphrey-Parkes terminology</a>—"basic" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as "" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although <a href="Glossary%20of%20bird%20terms%23cite%20note-32">some</a> may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s are replaced one at a time with the innermost being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.

A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the <a href="Phasianidae">Phasianidae</a>. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s and <a href="treecreeper">treecreeper</a>s, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare <a href="brood%20patch">brood patch</a> by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.

Feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily, spending an average of around 9% of their daily time on this. The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply <a href="wax">wax</a>y secretions from the <a href="uropygial%20gland">uropygial gland</a>; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an <a href="Antimicrobial">antimicrobial agent</a>, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>. This may be supplemented with the secretions of <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a> from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as <a href="Anting%20%28bird%20activity%29">anting</a>, to remove feather parasites.

The <a href="Bird%20anatomy%23Scales">scales</a> of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. They are found mainly on the toes and <a href="metatarsus">metatarsus</a>, but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. Most bird scales do not overlap significantly, except in the cases of <a href="kingfisher">kingfisher</a>s and <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s.
The scales of birds are thought to be <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a> to those of reptiles and mammals.

Most birds can <a href="Flying%20and%20gliding%20animals">fly</a>, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (<a href="wing">wing</a>) that serves as an <a href="airfoil">aerofoil</a>.

Wing shape and size generally determine a bird's flight style and performance; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are <a href="Flightless%20bird">flightless</a>, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to "fly" through the water, as do <a href="auk">auk</a>s, <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s and <a href="dipper">dipper</a>s.
Most birds are <a href="diurnal%20animal">diurnal</a>, but some birds, such as many species of <a href="owl">owl</a>s and <a href="nightjar">nightjar</a>s, are <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> or <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a> (active during twilight hours), and many coastal <a href="wader">wader</a>s feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night.

 are varied and often include <a href="nectar%20%28plant%29">nectar</a>, fruit, plants, seeds, <a href="carrion">carrion</a>, and various small animals, including other birds. Because birds have no teeth, their <a href="digestive%20system">digestive system</a> is adapted to process <a href="mastication">unmasticated</a> food items that are swallowed whole.

Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds <a href="Gleaning%20%28birds%29">glean</a> for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek <a href="Pest%20%28organism%29">pest</a> <a href="insect">insect</a>s are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in <a href="biological%20pest%20control">biological pest control</a> programmes.

Nectar feeders such as <a href="hummingbird">hummingbird</a>s, <a href="sunbird">sunbird</a>s, <a href="lories%20and%20lorikeets">lories, and lorikeets</a> amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit <a href="Coevolution">co-adapted</a> flowers. <a href="Kiwi">Kiwi</a>s and <a href="shorebird">shorebird</a>s with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s. <a href="Loon">Loon</a>s, <a href="diving%20duck">diving duck</a>s, <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s and <a href="auks">auks</a> pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as <a href="sulidae">sulid</a>s, <a href="kingfisher">kingfisher</a>s and <a href="tern">tern</a>s plunge dive after their prey. <a href="Flamingo">Flamingo</a>s, three species of <a href="prion%20%28bird%29">prion</a>, and some ducks are <a href="filter%20feeder">filter feeder</a>s. <a href="Geese">Geese</a> and <a href="dabbling%20duck">dabbling duck</a>s are primarily grazers.

Some species, including <a href="frigatebird">frigatebird</a>s, <a href="gull">gull</a>s, and <a href="skua">skua</a>s, engage in <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a>, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of <a href="great%20frigatebird">great frigatebird</a>s stealing from <a href="masked%20booby">masked boobies</a> estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%. Other birds are <a href="scavenger">scavenger</a>s; some of these, like <a href="vulture">vulture</a>s, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.

Water is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of <a href="sweat%20gland">sweat gland</a>s reduces the physiological demands. Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting. Seabirds can drink seawater and have <a href="salt%20gland">salt gland</a>s inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.

Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat. Some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the <a href="Columbidae">pigeon</a>, <a href="Estrildidae">finch</a>, <a href="Coliidae">mousebird</a>, <a href="Turnicidae">button-quail</a> and <a href="Otididae">bustard</a> families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and <a href="sandgrouse">sandgrouse</a> are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called <a href="crop%20milk">crop milk</a> that they provide to their chicks.

Feathers being critical to the survival of a bird, require maintenance. Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and <a href="Bird%20louse">birdlice</a>. The physical condition of feathers are maintained by often with the application of secretions from the . Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as <a href="Anting%20%28bird%20activity%29">anting</a> in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.

Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of <a href="season">season</a>al temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, <a href="shorebird">shorebird</a>s, and <a href="waterbird">waterbird</a>s undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the <a href="temperate">temperate</a> or <a href="polar%20region">polar region</a>s and a non-breeding season in the <a href="tropical">tropical</a> regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.

Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. Landbirds have a flight range of around and shorebirds can fly up to , although the <a href="bar-tailed%20godwit">bar-tailed godwit</a> is capable of non-stop flights of up to . <a href="Seabird">Seabird</a>s also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of <a href="sooty%20shearwater">sooty shearwater</a>s, which nest in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="California">California</a>, an annual round trip of . Other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. Albatrosses nesting in the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.
Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. <a href="wiktionary%3Airruptive">Irruptive</a> species such as the boreal <a href="finch">finch</a>es are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration is normally associated with food availability. Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates. Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory.

<a href="Altitudinal%20migration">Altitudinal migration</a> is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">the normal territories</a> also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. <a href="True%20parrots">Parrot</a>s as a <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.

The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s, a <a href="Manx%20shearwater">Manx shearwater</a> released in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> in the United States returned to its colony in <a href="Skomer">Skomer</a>, in Wales within 13 days, a distance of . Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For <a href="diurnal%20animal">diurnal</a> migrants, the <a href="sun">sun</a> is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an <a href="Chronobiology">internal clock</a>. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s surrounding <a href="Polaris">Polaris</a>. These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's <a href="geomagnetism">geomagnetism</a> through specialised <a href="Photoreceptor%20cell">photoreceptor</a>s.

Birds <a href="Animal%20communication">communicate</a> using primarily visual and auditory signals. Signals can be interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species).

Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the <a href="sunbittern">sunbittern</a>'s mimicry of a large predator to ward off <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species.

Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where "dances" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.

<a href="Bird%20vocalization">Bird calls and songs</a>, which are produced in the <a href="Syrinx%20%28biology%29">syrinx</a>, are the major means by which birds communicate with <a href="sound">sound</a>. This communication can be very complex; some species can operate the two sides of the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.
Calls are used for a variety of purposes, including mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The "<a href="Coenocorypha">Coenocorypha</a>" <a href="snipe">snipe</a>s of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> drive air through their feathers, <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s drum territorially, and <a href="palm%20cockatoo">palm cockatoo</a>s use tools to drum.

While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large <a href="flock%20%28birds%29">flocks</a>. The principal benefits of flocking are <a href="safety%20in%20numbers">safety in numbers</a> and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where <a href="ambush%20predation">ambush predation</a> is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This has led to the development of many <a href="mixed-species%20feeding%20flock">mixed-species feeding flock</a>s, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources. Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.

Birds sometimes also form associations with non-avian species. Plunge-diving <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s associate with <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s and <a href="tuna">tuna</a>, which push shoaling fish towards the surface. <a href="Hornbill">Hornbill</a>s have a <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic relationship</a> with <a href="dwarf%20mongoose">dwarf mongoose</a>s, in which they forage together and warn each other of nearby <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> and other predators.
The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times. Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening "peeks", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats. <a href="Swift">Swift</a>s are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight. It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight.

Some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into <a href="slow-wave%20sleep">slow-wave sleep</a> one <a href="Cerebral%20hemisphere">hemisphere</a> of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for <a href="predator">predator</a>s by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s. <a href="Communal%20roosting">Communal roosting</a> is common because it lowers the <a href="thermoregulation">loss of body heat</a> and decreases the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.

Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their <a href="beak">bills</a> in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. <a href="Passerine">Perching birds</a> have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus "<a href="Loriculus">Loriculus</a>" roost hanging upside down. Some <a href="hummingbird">hummingbird</a>s go into a nightly state of <a href="torpor">torpor</a> accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This <a href="Adaptation">physiological adaptation</a> shows in nearly a hundred other species, including <a href="owlet-nightjar">owlet-nightjar</a>s, <a href="nightjar">nightjar</a>s, and <a href="woodswallow">woodswallow</a>s. One species, the <a href="common%20poorwill">common poorwill</a>, even enters a state of <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a>. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like <a href="urohidrosis">urohidrosis</a> to cool themselves.

Ninety-five per cent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both <a href="paternal%20care">paternal care</a> and <a href="Parental%20investment">biparental care</a>, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of <a href="forced%20copulation">forced copulation</a> in ducks and other <a href="anatidae">anatid</a>s.

Female birds have <a href="Female%20sperm%20storage">sperm storage</a> mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may <a href="Sperm%20competition">compete</a> through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.

Other mating systems, including <a href="polygyny">polygyny</a>, <a href="polyandry">polyandry</a>, <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a>, <a href="polygynandry">polygynandry</a>, and <a href="promiscuity">promiscuity</a>, also occur. Polygamous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males. Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.

Breeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male. Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of <a href="bird%20vocalization">song</a>. Some displays, however, are quite elaborate. Depending on the species, these may include wing or tail drumming, dancing, aerial flights, or communal <a href="lek%20%28mating%20arena%29">lek</a>king. Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection, although in the polyandrous <a href="phalaropes">phalaropes</a>, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females. <a href="Courtship%20feeding">Courtship feeding</a>, <a href="Billing%20%28birds%29">billing</a> and are commonly performed between partners, generally after the birds have paired and mated.

<a href="Homosexuality%20in%20animals%23Birds">Homosexual behaviour has been observed</a> in males or females in numerous species of birds, including copulation, pair-bonding, and joint parenting of chicks.

Many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s and <a href="swift">swift</a>s, often breed in <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a> instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.

All birds lay <a href="amniotic%20egg">amniotic egg</a>s with hard shells made mostly of <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a>d eggs. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting <a href="nightjar">nightjar</a>s have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of <a href="brood%20parasites">brood parasites</a> have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.

Bird eggs are usually laid in a <a href="Bird%20nest">nest</a>. Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; <a href="albatross">albatross</a> nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation. Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting <a href="common%20guillemot">common guillemot</a> lays its eggs on bare rock, and male <a href="emperor%20penguin">emperor penguin</a>s keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are <a href="precocial">precocial</a>.
<a href="Egg%20incubation">Incubation</a>, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through <a href="brood%20patch">brood patch</a>es, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of <a href="megapode">megapode</a>s comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s, <a href="cuckoo">cuckoo</a>s and <a href="passerine">passerine</a> birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>s).

The diversity of characteristics of birds is great, sometimes even in closely related species. Several avian characteristics are compared in the table below.

At the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their species. Helpless chicks are termed "<a href="altricial">altricial</a>", and tend to be born small, <a href="Blindness">blind</a>, immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed "<a href="precocial">precocial</a>". Altricial chicks need help <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulating</a> and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. The young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the precocial or altricial category, having some aspects of each and thus fall somewhere on an "altricial-precocial spectrum". Chicks at neither extreme but favoring one or the other may be termed or . 

The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in <a href="megapode">megapode</a>s ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the <a href="great%20frigatebird">great frigatebird</a>, whose chicks take up to six months to <a href="fledge">fledge</a> and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The "chick guard stage" describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.

In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex. In some species, <a href="helpers%20at%20the%20nest">other member</a>s of the same species—usually close relatives of the <a href="breeding%20pair">breeding pair</a>, such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young. Such alloparenting is particularly common among the <a href="Corvida">Corvida</a>, which includes such birds as the true <a href="Corvidae">crows</a>, <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> and <a href="fairy-wren">fairy-wren</a>s, but has been observed in species as different as the <a href="Rifleman%20%28bird%29">rifleman</a> and <a href="red%20kite">red kite</a>. Among most groups of animals, <a href="Paternal%20care">male parental care</a> is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class. Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a <a href="division%20of%20labour">division of labour</a> in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.

The point at which chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> varies dramatically. The chicks of the "<a href="Synthliboramphus">Synthliboramphus</a>" murrelets, like the <a href="ancient%20murrelet">ancient murrelet</a>, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. Chicks may also follow their parents during their first <a href="bird%20migration">migration</a>.

<a href="Brood%20parasitism">Brood parasitism</a>, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism. After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either "obligate brood parasites", which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or "non-obligate brood parasites", which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a>s to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including <a href="honeyguide">honeyguide</a>s, <a href="icterid">icterid</a>s, and <a href="Black-headed%20duck">ducks</a>, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the <a href="cuckoo">cuckoo</a>s. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.

Birds have <a href="evolution">evolved</a> a variety of <a href="mating">mating</a> behaviours, with the <a href="peafowl">peacock</a> tail being perhaps the most famous example of <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> and the <a href="Fisherian%20runaway">Fisherian runaway</a>. Commonly occurring <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>s such as size and colour differences are energetically costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations. Many types of avian <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> have been identified; intersexual selection, also known as female choice; and intrasexual competition, where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate. Sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual’s fitness. Conflicts between an individual fitness and signalling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and <a href="courtship%20behavior">courtship behaviour</a> are "honest" traits. Signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviours.

Inbreeding causes early death (<a href="inbreeding%20depression">inbreeding depression</a>) in the <a href="zebra%20finch">zebra finch</a> "Taeniopygia guttata". Embryo survival (that is, hatching success of fertile eggs) was significantly lower for <a href="sibling">sib-sib</a> mating pairs than for unrelated pairs.

<a href="Darwin%27s%20finches">Darwin’s finch</a> "Geospiza scandens" experiences <a href="inbreeding%20depression">inbreeding depression</a> (reduced survival of offspring) and the magnitude of this effect is influenced by environmental conditions such as low food availability.

Incestuous matings by the <a href="Purple-crowned%20fairywren">purple-crowned fairy wren</a> "Malurus coronatus" result in severe fitness costs due to <a href="inbreeding%20depression">inbreeding depression</a> (greater than 30% reduction in hatchability of eggs). Females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings (see <a href="Promiscuity%23Other%20animals">Promiscuity#Other animals</a> for 90% frequency in avian species) that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding. However, there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings. Nevertheless, 43% of broods produced by incestuously paired females contained extra pair young.

Inbreeding depression occurs in the <a href="great%20tit">great tit</a> ("Parus major") when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. In natural populations of "Parus major", inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.

<a href="Southern%20pied%20babbler">Southern pied babbler</a>s "Turdoides bicolor" appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways. The first is through dispersal, and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates. Although both males and females disperse locally, they move outside the range where genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered. Within their group, individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite-sex breeder is unrelated.

<a href="Cooperative%20breeding">Cooperative breeding</a> in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin. Female offspring rarely stay at home, dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently, or to join unrelated groups. In general, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (<a href="inbreeding%20depression">inbreeding depression</a>) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles. <a href="Outcrossing">Cross-fertilisation</a> between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.

Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the <a href="Ecological%20niche">niche</a>s occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the <a href="forest%20canopy">forest canopy</a>, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s, <a href="frugivore">frugivore</a>s, and <a href="nectarivore">nectarivore</a>s. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a>. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised <a href="scavenger">scavenger</a>s. <a href="Avivore">Avivore</a>s are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.

Some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal. Plants and pollinating birds often <a href="coevolution">coevolve</a>, and in some cases a flower's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.

Birds are often important to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the <a href="moa">moa</a>s were important browsers, as are the <a href="New%20Zealand%20pigeon">kereru</a> and <a href="kokako">kokako</a> today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa. Nesting <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of <a href="guano">guano</a>, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.

A wide variety of <a href="avian%20ecology%20field%20methods">avian ecology field methods</a>, including counts, nest monitoring, and capturing and marking, are used for researching avian ecology.

Since birds are highly visible and common animals, humans have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man. Sometimes, these relationships are <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a>, like the cooperative honey-gathering among <a href="honeyguide">honeyguide</a>s and African peoples such as the <a href="Borana%20people">Borana</a>. Other times, they may be <a href="Commensalism">commensal</a>, as when species such as the <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a> have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an <a href="bird%20strike">aviation hazard</a>. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (<a href="hunting">hunting</a>, <a href="avian%20lead%20poisoning">avian lead poisoning</a>, <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, <a href="roadkill">roadkill</a>, <a href="wind%20turbine">wind turbine</a> kills and predation by pet <a href="cat">cat</a>s and <a href="dog">dog</a>s are common sources of death for birds).

Birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as <a href="psittacosis">psittacosis</a>, <a href="salmonellosis">salmonellosis</a>, <a href="campylobacteriosis">campylobacteriosis</a>, mycobacteriosis (avian <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>), <a href="avian%20influenza">avian influenza</a> (bird flu), <a href="giardiasis">giardiasis</a>, and <a href="cryptosporidiosis">cryptosporidiosis</a> over long distances. Some of these are <a href="zoonosis">zoonotic diseases</a> that can also be transmitted to humans.

Domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called <a href="poultry">poultry</a>, are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, tons of poultry and tons of eggs were produced worldwide. <a href="Chicken">Chicken</a>s account for much of human poultry consumption, though domesticated <a href="domesticated%20turkey">turkeys</a>, <a href="domestic%20duck">ducks</a>, and <a href="domestic%20goose">geese</a> are also relatively common. Many species of birds are also hunted for meat. Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>s, <a href="wild%20turkey">wild turkey</a>s, quail, <a href="dove">dove</a>s, <a href="partridge">partridge</a>, <a href="grouse">grouse</a>, <a href="snipe">snipe</a>, and <a href="woodcock">woodcock</a>. <a href="Muttonbirding">Muttonbirding</a> is also popular in Australia and New Zealand. Though some hunting, such as that of muttonbirds, may be sustainable, hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species.

Other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers (especially the <a href="Down%20feather">down</a> of geese and ducks), which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird faeces (<a href="guano">guano</a>), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a>, sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.

Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes. Colourful birds, such as <a href="Parrot%20%28family%29">parrots</a> and <a href="myna">myna</a>s, are bred in <a href="aviculture">captivity</a> or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a>. <a href="Falcon">Falcon</a>s and <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s have long been used for <a href="Falconry">hunting</a> and <a href="Cormorant%20fishing">fishing</a>, respectively. <a href="Messenger%20pigeon">Messenger pigeon</a>s, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as <a href="pigeon%20racing">pigeon racing</a>.

Amateur bird enthusiasts (called birdwatchers, twitchers or, more commonly, <a href="birding">birders</a>) number in the millions. Many homeowners erect <a href="bird%20feeder">bird feeder</a>s near their homes to attract various species. <a href="Bird%20feeding">Bird feeding</a> has grown into a multimillion-dollar industry; for example, an estimated 75% of households in Britain provide food for birds at some point during the winter.

Birds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology.
In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a <a href="deity">deity</a>, such as in the Cult of <a href="Makemake%20%28mythology%29">Makemake</a>, in which the <a href="Tangata%20manu">Tangata manu</a> of <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a> served as chiefs or as attendants, as in the case of <a href="Hugin%20and%20Munin">Hugin and Munin</a>, the two <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a>s who whispered news into the ears of the <a href="Norse%20god">Norse god</a> <a href="Odin">Odin</a>. In several civilisations of <a href="History%20of%20Italy">ancient Italy</a>, particularly <a href="Etruscan%20mythology">Etruscan</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> <a href="Religion%20in%20Ancient%20Rome">religion</a>, priests were involved in <a href="augur">augur</a>y, or interpreting the words of birds while the "auspex" (from which the word "auspicious" is derived) watched their activities to foretell events.

They may also serve as <a href="Religious%20symbolism">religious symbols</a>, as when <a href="Jonah">Jonah</a> (Hebrew: יוֹנָה, <a href="dove">dove</a>) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves. Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the <a href="common%20peacock">common peacock</a>, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the <a href="Dravidian%20people">Dravidian</a>s of India. In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.

Birds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times, when they were represented in early <a href="cave%20painting">cave painting</a>s. Some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological <a href="Roc%20%28mythology%29">Roc</a> and the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a>'s legendary "<a href="Poukai">Pouākai</a>", a giant bird capable of snatching humans. Birds were later used as symbols of power, as in the magnificent <a href="Peacock%20Throne">Peacock Throne</a> of the <a href="Mughal%20era">Mughal</a> and <a href="History%20of%20Iran">Persian</a> emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books.

Among the most famous of these bird artists was <a href="John%20James%20Audubon">John James Audubon</a>, whose paintings of <a href="List%20of%20North%20American%20birds">North American birds</a> were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the <a href="National%20Audubon%20Society">National Audubon Society</a>. Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, <a href="Homer">Homer</a> incorporated <a href="nightingale">nightingale</a>s into his "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", and <a href="Catullus">Catullus</a> used a <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a> as an erotic symbol in his <a href="Catullus%202">Catullus 2</a>. The relationship between an <a href="albatross">albatross</a> and a sailor is the central theme of <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>'s "<a href="The%20Rime%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>", which led to the use of the <a href="Albatross%20%28metaphor%29">term as a metaphor for a 'burden'</a>. Other <a href="English%20language">English</a> metaphors derive from birds; <a href="vulture%20fund">vulture fund</a>s and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.

Perceptions of bird species vary across cultures. <a href="Owl">Owl</a>s are associated with bad luck, <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. <a href="Hoopoe">Hoopoe</a>s were considered sacred in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and symbols of virtue in <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe and harbingers of war in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. In <a href="heraldry">heraldry</a>, birds, especially <a href="Eagle%20%28heraldry%29">eagles</a>, often appear in <a href="coats%20of%20arms">coats of arms</a>.

<a href="Birds%20in%20music">In music</a>, birdsong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as <a href="Antonio%20Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a>, <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Messiaen</a>, and <a href="Beethoven">Beethoven</a> did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as <a href="Ottorino%20Respighi">Ottorino Respighi</a> first did; or like <a href="Beatrice%20Harrison">Beatrice Harrison</a> and <a href="David%20Rothenberg">David Rothenberg</a>, they can duet with birds.

Though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the <a href="barn%20swallow">barn swallow</a> and <a href="European%20starling">European starling</a>, they have caused population decreases or <a href="extinction">extinction</a> in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of <a href="Melanesia">Melanesia</a>n, <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>n, and <a href="Micronesia">Micronesia</a>n islands. Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> by <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> and the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> in 2009.

The most commonly cited human threat to birds is <a href="Habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a>. Other threats include overhunting, accidental mortality due to collisions with <a href="bird-skyscraper%20collisions">buildings</a> or <a href="bird%20strike">vehicles</a>, <a href="long-line%20fishing">long-line fishing</a> <a href="bycatch">bycatch</a>, pollution (including <a href="oil%20spill">oil spill</a>s and pesticide use), competition and predation from nonnative <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>, and climate change.

Governments and <a href="conservation%20biology">conservation</a> groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that <a href="In-situ%20conservation">preserve</a> and <a href="ecological%20restoration">restore</a> bird habitat or by establishing <a href="Ex-situ%20conservation">captive populations</a> for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the <a href="California%20condor">California condor</a> and <a href="Norfolk%20parakeet">Norfolk parakeet</a>.

...Baby One More Time (album)

...Baby One More Time is the debut <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American singer <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a>. It was released on January 12, 1999 through <a href="Jive%20Records">Jive Records</a>. In June 1997, while Spears negotiated with manager <a href="Lou%20Pearlman">Lou Pearlman</a> to join female pop group <a href="Innosense">Innosense</a>, her mother asked family friend and entertainment lawyer <a href="Larry%20Rudolph">Larry Rudolph</a> for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a> <a href="karaoke">karaoke</a> song. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, sending them a demo tape with an unused song from <a href="Toni%20Braxton">Toni Braxton</a>. Jive was interested and appointed the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. After hearing the recorded material, Jive signed Spears to a multi-album deal.

Spears traveled to Sweden to work with producers <a href="Max%20Martin">Max Martin</a>, <a href="Denniz%20Pop">Denniz Pop</a>, and <a href="Rami%20Yacoub">Rami Yacoub</a>, among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American R&B group <a href="TLC%20%28band%29">TLC</a>; however, they rejected the track. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. By June 1998, the album had been finished.

<a href="Music%20journalism">Music critics</a> gave the album mixed reviews, describing the singer as a <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> next door, considering it silly and premature. The album was successful on the charts, topping the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> and <a href="Canadian%20Albums%20Chart">Canadian Albums Chart</a>, and reaching the top five in several countries. It also received several certifications around the world, including a <a href="RIAA%20certification">14× platinum (diamond) certification</a> from the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA), for shipments of over fourteen million copies in the United States. "...Baby One More Time" is Spears's most successful album, making it one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20albums">best-selling albums of all time</a> and the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.

Five singles were released from the album. The lead single "<a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28song%29">...Baby One More Time</a>" became a worldwide success, topping every chart it appeared on, and one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles%20worldwide">best-selling singles of all time</a>, selling over ten million copies. The album was promoted with appearances on live television, and also by the <a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20Tour">...Baby One More Time Tour</a> in 1999, with a second leg titled <a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20Tour">Crazy 2k Tour</a> in 2000. Spears claimed she wasn't able to explore her vocal ability on the album. This album set Spears's international <a href="Pop%20icon">pop culture icon</a> image and launched her career. The album earned Spears <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nominations for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20New%20Artist">Best New Artist</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Female Pop Vocal Performance</a> for "...Baby One More Time" at the <a href="42nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">42nd Annual Grammy Awards</a> (2000).

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager <a href="Lou%20Pearlman">Lou Pearlman</a> to join female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, which required a professional <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a>. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded in a studio with a <a href="Audio%20engineering">sound engineer</a>. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a> and the <a href="Spice%20Girls">Spice Girls</a>, and "there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another <a href="Debbie%20Gibson">Debbie Gibson</a> or another <a href="Tiffany%20%28American%20singer%29">Tiffany</a>." Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of <a href="Artists%20and%20repertoire">A&R</a> Jeff Fenster stated, "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that." They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney." Spears recorded ten songs with White, including "Autumn Goodbye", "E-Mail My Heart", "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart", "I'm So Curious", "I Will Still Love You", "Luv The Hurt Away", "Soda Pop", "Thinkin' About You", and "You Got It All". The singer also recorded a cover of <a href="Sonny%20%26amp%3B%20Cher">Sonny & Cher</a>'s 1967 single "<a href="The%20Beat%20Goes%20On%20%28Sonny%20%26amp%3B%20Cher%20song%29">The Beat Goes On</a>". White was responsible for the vocal recording and song production, while additional production was done by English electronic music group <a href="All%20Seeing%20I">All Seeing I</a>.

After hearing the material, president <a href="Clive%20Calder">Clive Calder</a> ordered a full album. Spears flew to <a href="Cheiron%20Studios">Cheiron Studios</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> group <a href="TLC%20%28band%29">TLC</a>; however, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit. "We at Jive said, 'This is a fuckin' smash'," revealed the label's A&R executive, Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line "Hit Me" would condone <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a>, and later revised it to "...Baby One More Time". The singer revealed that she "didn't do well at all the first day in the studio [recording the song], I was just too nervous. So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing '... Baby One More Time'." By June 1998, the album was done, and Spears embarked on a promotional tour sponsored by <a href="L%27Oreal">L'Oreal</a>. "...Baby One More Time" was released as Spears' debut album on January 12, 1999.

Spears originally envisioned "<a href="Sheryl%20Crow">Sheryl Crow</a> music, but younger more adult contemporary", but felt all right with her label's producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." The album opens with the first single "<a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28song%29">...Baby One More Time</a>", a <a href="teen%20pop">teen pop</a> and <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> song that begins with a three-note <a href="motif%20%28music%29">motif</a> in the bass range of the <a href="piano">piano</a>. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as "<a href="We%20Will%20Rock%20You">We Will Rock You</a>" (1977), "<a href="Start%20Me%20Up">Start Me Up</a>" (1981), "<a href="These%20Words">These Words</a>" (2004) and the theme song of the film "<a href="Jaws%20%28film%29">Jaws</a>" due to the fact the track "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>", "...Baby One More Time" is composed by "<a href="wah-wah%20%28music%29">wah-wah</a> guitar lines and <a href="electrocardiography">EKG</a>-machine bass-slaps". Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of "Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide" (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song "gesture toward [Spears] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." The next song and third single, "<a href="%28You%20Drive%20Me%29%20Crazy">(You Drive Me) Crazy</a>" runs through a <a href="down-tempo">moderately slow</a> <a href="dance%20music">dance</a> <a href="beat%20%28music%29">beat</a>, and has a <a href="R%26amp%3BB">rhythm and blues</a> <a href="melody">melody</a> mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single "<a href="Sometimes%20%28Britney%20Spears%20song%29">Sometimes</a>" is a <a href="Ballad%20%28music%29">ballad</a>, that Spears begins with "You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every time you come too close I move away". <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> noted the song has "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent <a href="Eurodance">euro-dance</a> rhythm."

After "Sometimes" is "...Baby One More Time's" fourth track, "Soda Pop", a song that draws influences from <a href="bubblegum%20pop">bubblegum pop</a> and <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a>, and features background vocals from co-writer Mikey Bassie. Spears' vocals on the fifth track and fourth single, "<a href="Born%20to%20Make%20You%20Happy">Born to Make You Happy</a>", span more than an <a href="octave">octave</a>. Its lyrics allude to a relationship that a woman desires to repair, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that "I don't know how to live without your love/I was born to make you happy". The sixth track and final single, "<a href="From%20the%20Bottom%20of%20My%20Broken%20Heart">From the Bottom of My Broken Heart</a>", is a sentimental slow-tempo <a href="teen%20pop">teen pop</a> ballad.
"I Will Be There" features a guitar riff similar to <a href="Natalie%20Imbruglia">Natalie Imbruglia</a>'s "<a href="Torn%20%28Natalie%20Imbruglia%20song%29">Torn</a>" (1997), with a "rousing chorus about standing by your man (or a best friend or a house pet)", as noted by Kyle Anderson of <a href="MTV">MTV</a>. The eleventh track, "E-Mail My Heart", is a sensitive piano ballad where Spears sings, "E-mail me back/ And say our love will stay alive". The cover of <a href="Sonny%20%26amp%3B%20Cher">Sonny & Cher</a>'s 1967 single "<a href="The%20Beat%20Goes%20On%20%28Sonny%20%26amp%3B%20Cher%20song%29">The Beat Goes On</a>" is influenced by <a href="bossa%20nova">bossa nova</a> and <a href="trip%20hop">trip hop</a>, and features a similar sound to <a href="spy%20film">spy movies</a> themes.

Promotion began in 1998, when Spears did a small tour in malls and food courts that were located mostly in larger cities around the United States and Canada. Each show lasted around thirty minutes, and Spears had two male dancers with her on the stage. The promo tour is also known as the <a href="L%27Oreal">L'Oreal</a> Mall Tour, after its sponsor. The singer made several promotional appearances including talk shows and live performances around the world. On December 1998, Spears' first showed up on MTV's and the Box's most-requested video charts. She also appeared on the "<a href="Ricki%20Lake%20%28TV%20series%29">Ricki Lake Show</a>", the "<a href="Howie%20Mandel">Howie Mandel</a> Show", and was the presenter of the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%201999">1999 American Music Awards</a>, prior to the release of the album. The singer also appeared on MTV's "<a href="Spring%20Break">Spring Break</a>" and on the hundredth episode of <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>'s "<a href="All%20That">All That</a>". However, after hurting her knee, she had rescheduled appearances several shows such as "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>" and "<a href="Live%20with%20Regis%20and%20Kelly">Live with Regis and Kathie Lee</a>". After recovering, Spears embarked on another promotional schedule. The singer appeared on <a href="Kids%27%20Choice%20Awards">12th Annual "Nickelodeon"s Kids' Choice Awards</a> on May 1, MTV's "<a href="FANatic">FANatic</a>" on May 12, "Live with Regis and Kathie Lee" on May 3, and "<a href="The%20Rosie%20O%27Donnell%20Show">The Rosie O'Donnell Show</a>" on May 25.

Outside the United States, Spears visited German talk show "<a href="Wetten%2C%20dass..%3F">Wetten, dass..?</a>" and "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>" on June 25, 1999. She also went to the United Kingdom, making appearances on programmes such as "<a href="This%20Morning%20%28TV%20series%29">This Morning</a>", "" and "<a href="National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Lottery</a>". She visited a music variety show called "<a href="Hey%21%20Hey%21%20Hey%21%20Music%20Champ">Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ</a>" in Japan, and performed at the Festival Bar in Italy. Spears was also featured on an episode of <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> television sitcom, "<a href="Sabrina%2C%20the%20Teenage%20Witch">Sabrina, the Teenage Witch</a>", where she played herself. Spears was returning a favor to actress <a href="Melissa%20Joan%20Hart">Melissa Joan Hart</a>, who played a cameo role in Spears' video for "(You Drive Me) Crazy," according to "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>". The episode aired on September 24, 1999. The same month, Spears performed on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" on September 27, and visited <a href="Carson%20Daly">Carson Daly</a> on MTV's "Total Request Live" the following day. She had a mini-<a href="Disney">Disney</a> concert titled "Britney Spears & Joey McIntyre in Concert." Spears and <a href="Joey%20McIntyre">Joey McIntyre</a> performed live in the taped concert event. Promotion for the album continued in early 2000, where Spears performed at the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202000">2000 American Music Awards</a>, and also performed "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" in a medley with "...Baby One More Time" at the <a href="42nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">42nd Annual Grammy Awards</a>.

"<a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28song%29">...Baby One More Time</a>" was released as Spears' debut single on October 23, 1998. The song received generally favorable critical reviews, mostly praising its composition. "...Baby One More Time" attained worldwide success, reaching number one in every European country where it charted. It received numerous certifications around the world, and is one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles%20worldwide">best-selling singles of all time</a>, at over ten million copies. An accompanying music video, directed by <a href="Nigel%20Dick">Nigel Dick</a>, portrays Spears as a student from a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> high school, who starts to <a href="daydream">daydream</a> that she is singing and dancing around the school, while watching her love interest from afar. In 2010, the music video for "...Baby One More Time" was voted the third-most influential video in the history of <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a>.

"<a href="Sometimes%20%28Britney%20Spears%20song%29">Sometimes</a>" was released as the second single on April 30, 1999. "Sometimes" achieved commercial success worldwide, reaching number one on <a href="Ultratop%2050">Ultratop Flanders Singles</a> in Belgium, <a href="Mega%20Single%20Top%20100">Mega Single Top 100</a> in Netherlands and <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">RIANZ Singles</a> in New Zealand, while peaking inside the top five in four countries. In the United States, "Sometimes" missed the top-twenty, peaking at number twenty-one on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>. The music video for the song was directed by Nigel Dick. During rehearsals, on February 11, 1999, Spears injured her left knee and needed surgery. After recuperating in <a href="Kentwood%2C%20Louisiana">Kentwood, Louisiana</a>, the music video was shot on April 9–10, 1999 at Paradise Cove in <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu, California</a>.
It was released on May 6, 1999, on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>".

In May 1999, Max Martin and Spears went to the Battery Studios in <a href="New%20York%20City%2C%20New%20York">New York City, New York</a>, to re-record the vocals of "<a href="%28You%20Drive%20Me%29%20Crazy">(You Drive Me) Crazy</a>", due to the fact that a remixed version called "The Stop! Remix" was going to be included on the original motion picture soundtrack of the film "<a href="Drive%20Me%20Crazy">Drive Me Crazy</a>" (1999). "The Stop! Remix" of the song was released as the third single on August 23, 1999. The remix had the addition of a stanza where Spears yells "Stop!", then all sound cutting out, followed by a transition.

The music video was directed by Nigel Dick, and featured actors <a href="Melissa%20Joan%20Hart">Melissa Joan Hart</a> and <a href="Adrian%20Grenier">Adrian Grenier</a>.

"<a href="Born%20to%20Make%20You%20Happy">Born to Make You Happy</a>" was released on December 6, 1999, as the fourth single, and received mixed reviews from music critics.

"<a href="From%20the%20Bottom%20of%20My%20Broken%20Heart">From the Bottom of My Broken Heart</a>" was released on December 15, 1999, as the final single. The song also received mixed reviews, finding the song a classic hit and competent single, despite considering it as an unremarkable song that refers only to kissing. "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" achieved moderate success, peaking at number thirty-seven in Australia, and twenty-three in New Zealand. Through imports, the song reached one hundred seventy-four in the United Kingdom. In the United States, "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" reached number fourteen on "Billboard" Hot 100, and seventeen on Pop Songs, and was later certified Platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) on March 28, 2000, for selling over 1,000,000 physical units of the single. The music video, directed by <a href="Gregory%20Dark">Gregory Dark</a>, was released on December 17, 1999. It was highly criticized due to the fact that Dark had previously directed porn films.

On March 5, 1999, it was reported that Spears was planning her first headlining tour. She announced that the tour would start in July. On May 12, <a href="Tommy%20Hilfiger">Tommy Hilfiger</a> was announced as the main tour sponsor. During the time of the announcement, Spears was being featured in the company's "AllStars" campaign. On December 17, during the premiere of the music video of "<a href="From%20the%20Bottom%20of%20My%20Broken%20Heart">From the Bottom of My Broken Heart</a>" on "TRL", Spears called the show to announce March 2000 United States tour dates. The extension, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, was considered a prelude to her future world tour, <a href="Oops%21...%20I%20Did%20It%20Again%20World%20Tour">Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour</a>. The leg's main sponsor was <a href="Got%20Milk%3F">Got Milk?</a>. Media director Peter Gardiner explained, "Britney is magic with teen-age girls, and that's an absolutely crucial target for milk". Spears shot an advertising campaign to be shown before her performances began. The secondary sponsor was <a href="Polaroid%20Corporation">Polaroid</a> and the corporation released the <a href="I-Zone">I-Zone</a> as the tour's official camera. Spears used the I-Zone onstage to take pictures of the audience and further promote the product. The show was divided into segments, separated by interlude, ending with an encore. The set list consisted of songs from her debut album and several <a href="cover%20version">covers</a>. Some changes were made during the 2000 leg, with the covers replaced by songs from her second studio album, "<a href="Oops%21...%20I%20Did%20It%20Again%20%28album%29">Oops!... I Did It Again</a>". The tour received positive critical appreciation. During the tour, Spears was accused of lip synching, although she denied these claims. On April 20, 2000, the concert at <a href="Hilton%20Hawaiian%20Village">Hilton Hawaiian Village</a> in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, was taped. It was slightly altered from its Crazy 2k incarnation and featured different costumes. On June 5, 2000, it was broadcast on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a>. The special was aired several times during the year. On November 21, 2000, JIVE Records released the "<a href="Live%20and%20More%21">Live and More!</a>" <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, which included the Fox special. It was certified triple Platinum by the RIAA for shipping 300,000 units.

"...Baby One More Time" received mixed reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, and commented that, by the time Spears launched her career, "everything old was new again", comparing the album to "<a href="Hangin%27%20Tough">Hangin' Tough</a>" (1988) by <a href="New%20Kids%20on%20the%20Block">New Kids on the Block</a>. Erlewine further complimented the quality of the singles while praising Max Martin, "who is also the mastermind behind Spears' debut." "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s Beth Johnson noted the singer "sounds remarkably like the <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a>' kid sister", saying, however, that this was "not surprising, since BSB hit-meister Max Martin wrote the candy-pop-with-a-funky-edge smash debut." <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> commented Spears portrayed a "Madonna next door" in the album with songs like "...Baby One More Time" and "Soda Pop", while Craig McDennis of "<a href="The%20Hamilton%20Spectator">The Hamilton Spectator</a>" said the album "offers a glib compendium of soul/pop cliches, served with a giddy, uptempo verve that recalls <a href="Debbie%20Gibson">Debbie Gibson</a> on a chocolate high." <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>'s Rickey Wright gave "...Baby One More Time" a mixed review, saying that "a few of the disc's cuts are pleasantly catchy", noting, however, "neither does the 17-year-old Spears's debut album contain anything else that remotely approaches that instant hit single ['...Baby One More Time']." "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"s Paul Verna considered the album "a top 40-ready workout filled with hook-laden songs from the same bag as the title cut".

Kyle Anderson of <a href="MTV">MTV</a> said he "was surprised in more ways than one "with his first listening of "...Baby One More Time", commenting he "expected there to be a lot of filler (there sort of is), though I didn't expect it to be as odd (at least sonically) as it ended up being. There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos." Barry Walters of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" gave the album two stars out of five, and compared the album's sound to early hits of Debbie Gibson, Mariah Carey, and <a href="Samantha%20Fox">Samantha Fox</a>. Walters also said that "while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', are pure spam." A "<a href="NME">NME</a>" reviewer rated "...Baby One More Time" 1 out of 10, saying that "we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career". He also found the album premature, commenting, "hopefully, if she starts to live the wretched life that we all eventually do, her voice will show the scars, she'll stop looking so fucking smug, she'll find solace in drugs and we'll be all the more happier for it. Now grow up, girl. Quick!" Amanda Murray of <a href="Sputnikmusic">Sputnikmusic</a> felt that, "with the exception of the terrific title track, "...Baby One More Time" is a collection of either competent pop songs underwhelmingly executed or underwhelmingly written pop songs competently executed."

"...Baby One More Time" debuted at the top of the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> selling 121,000 units, replacing <a href="DMX%20%28rapper%29">DMX</a>'s "<a href="Flesh%20of%20My%20Flesh%2C%20Blood%20of%20My%20Blood">Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood</a>" (1998). Spears broke several records by doing so. The singer became the first new female artist to have a number one single on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and number one album on the "Billboard" 200 at the same time; the first new artist (male or female) to have a single go to the number one spot the same week that the album debuted at number one; and the first new female artist to have the first single and first album at number one the same week. Spears is also the youngest female in "Billboard" history to have a simultaneous single and album at number one in the same week. After four weeks since its release, the album had sold more than 500,000 copies, according to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a> sales data.

The album was later certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">Diamond</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA), making Spears the youngest artist to receive that award, breaking <a href="Alanis%20Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a>'s record, who was twenty-one years old when she released "<a href="Jagged%20Little%20Pill">Jagged Little Pill</a>" (1995). The album was the fourteenth album since 1991 to sell over ten million copies in the United States, and Spears became the best-selling female artist of 1999. "...Baby One More Time" spent a total of fifty-one weeks in the top ten of the "Billboard" 200. The album spent a total of one-hundred-and-three weeks on the chart. "...Baby One More Time" landed at number three on <a href="BMG%20Music%20Club">BMG Music Club</a> all-time best-sellers list, selling 1.6 million units, behind <a href="Shania%20Twain">Shania Twain</a>'s "<a href="Come%20on%20Over%20%28Shania%20Twain%20album%29">Come on Over</a>" (1997).

The album debuted at number one on the <a href="Canadian%20Albums%20Chart">Canadian Albums Chart</a>, totaling nine non-consecutive weeks at the top. On December 12, 1999, the <a href="Canadian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Canadian Recording Industry Association</a> (CRIA) certified it Diamond, for sales over one million units. "...Baby One More Time" spent two weeks at number two on the <a href="European%20Top%20100%20Albums">European Top 100 Albums</a>, and sold over four million copies within the continent, being certified quadruple Platinum by the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20the%20Phonographic%20Industry">International Federation of the Phonographic Industry</a> (IFPI). The album reached number two on the <a href="Official%20Charts%20Company">UK Albums Chart</a>, number four in <a href="Syndicat%20National%20de%20l%27%C3%89dition%20Phonographique">French Albums Chart</a> and was certified triple Platinum by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> (BPI), double Platinum by the <a href="Syndicat%20National%20de%20l%27%C3%89dition%20Phonographique">Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique</a> (SNEP), triple <a href="Gold%20certification">Gold</a> in Germany by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), and decuple Platinum (Diamond) by the <a href="Polish%20Society%20of%20the%20Phonographic%20Industry">Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry</a> (ZPAV). "...Baby One More Time" debuted at number nine in May 1999 on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA Albums Chart</a> in Australia, reaching number two nine weeks later, placing behind the <a href="Dawson%27s%20Creek%23Music">"Dawson's Creek" soundtrack</a>. The album became the seventh highest-selling of 1999 in the country, and was certified quadruple Platinum by the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a> (ARIA) the following year after shipping 280,000 copies to retailers. The album debuted at number three on the <a href="Recorded%20Music%20NZ">RIANZ Albums Chart</a> in New Zealand, placing behind Shania Twain's "Come on Over" (1997) and <a href="The%20Corrs">The Corrs</a>' "<a href="In%20Blue">In Blue</a>" (2000). The album was later certified triple Platinum in the country by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">Recording Industry Association of New Zealand</a> (RIANZ).

Spears was credited with leading the revival of <a href="teen%20pop">teen pop</a>. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Yomiuri">The Daily Yomiuri</a>" reported that "critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson." "Rolling Stone" wrote: "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene." Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented, "I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice." Chuck Taylor of "Billboard" observed, "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice ... "(You Drive Me) Crazy", her third single ... demonstrates Spears' own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice." Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry." Sputnikmusic writer Amanda Murray noted the album "offers a marker for Spears' progression as an artist, as a celebrity, and as a woman." In 2010, the album was included in the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

Spears became an international <a href="pop%20icon">pop culture icon</a> immediately after launching her recording career. "Rolling Stone" magazine wrote: "One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century," she "spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop ... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank". She is listed by the "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>" as having the "Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist". Melissa Ruggieri of the "<a href="Richmond%20Times-Dispatch">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>" reported, "She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 25 million albums worldwide". Barbara Ellen of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" has reported: "Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry". "...Baby One More Time" is Spears' most successful album to date, with worldwide sales over 25 million copies, and also the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.

Burn card

In <a href="card%20game">card game</a>s, a burn card is a <a href="playing%20card">playing card</a> dealt from the top of a deck, and discarded ("burned"), unused by the players. Burn cards are almost always placed face down next to the discard pile without being revealed to the players.

Burning is most often performed in <a href="casino">casino</a>s to deter a form of cheating known as <a href="card%20marking">card marking</a>. In <a href="poker">poker</a>, for example, the top card of the deck stub is burned at the beginning of each betting round, so that players who might have been able to read markings on that card during the previous round are less able to take advantage of that information. Knowledge of a burn card might be marginally useful, such as knowing there is one fewer Ace in the deck, but far less so than having it in play.

Two other uses for burning are: to prevent <a href="second%20dealing">second dealing</a> and to provide extra cards for use when an irregularity of play occurs. Sometimes a misdealt card (such as one of the down cards in poker that has flashed during the deal) will be used as the burn card—in those cases, the card should be immediately placed face up on the deck after the deal is complete.

In <a href="Texas%20hold%20%27em">Texas hold 'em</a> (as well as in <a href="Omaha%20hold%20%27em">Omaha hold 'em</a>), a card is burned before the <a href="Flop%20%28poker%29">flop</a>, before the <a href="turn%20%28poker%29">turn</a>, and before the <a href="river%20%28poker%29">river</a>.

Bulgaria

Bulgaria (; , '), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (, ', ), is a country in <a href="Southeast%20Europe">southeastern Europe</a>. It is bordered by <a href="Romania">Romania</a> to the north, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a> to the west, <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> to the south, and the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> to the east. With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's <a href="List%20of%20European%20countries%20by%20area">16th-largest country</a>.

Organised <a href="prehistoric">prehistoric</a> cultures began developing on current Bulgarian lands during the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period. Its ancient history saw the presence of the <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greeks</a>, <a href="Persians">Persians</a>, <a href="Celts">Celts</a>, <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a>, <a href="Goths">Goths</a>, <a href="Alans">Alans</a> and <a href="Huns">Huns</a>. The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a> in 681 AD, which dominated most of the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> and functioned as a cultural hub for <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a> during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. With the downfall of the <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Second Bulgarian Empire</a> in 1396, its territories came under <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> rule for nearly five centuries. The <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%9378%29">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a> led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a one-party <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Bulgaria">socialist state</a> as part of the Soviet-led <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. In <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">December 1989</a> the ruling <a href="Bulgarian%20Communist%20Party">Communist Party</a> allowed <a href="Multi-party%20system">multi-party</a> elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a <a href="democracy">democracy</a> and a market-based economy.

Bulgaria's population of 7.2 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its <a href="Provinces%20of%20Bulgaria">28 provinces</a>. Most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city, <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>. The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry, power engineering, and agriculture, all of which rely on local natural resources.

The country's current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a <a href="Unitary%20state">unitary</a> <a href="parliamentary%20republic">parliamentary republic</a> with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. It is a member of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, and the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a>; a founding state of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a> three times.

The country's name, "Bulgaria" is taken from the word, <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a>, an extinct tribe of <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a> origin, which created the country. Their name is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD. but it is possibly derived from the <a href="Proto-Turkic">Proto-Turkic</a> word "bulģha" ("to mix", "shake", "stir") and its derivative "bulgak" ("revolt", "disorder") Alternate etymologies include derivation from a <a href="Mongolic%20languages">Mongolic</a> cognate "bulğarak" ("to separate", "split off") or from a compound of <a href="proto-Turkic">proto-Turkic</a> "bel" ("five") and "gur" ("arrow" in the sense of "<a href="Turkic%20tribal%20confederations">tribe</a>"), a proposed division within the <a href="Utigurs">Utigurs</a> or <a href="Onogurs">Onogurs</a> ("ten tribes").

Within Bulgaria, some historians question the identification of the Bulgars as a Turkic tribe, citing certain linguistic evidence (such as Asparukh's name) in favor of a <a href="Iranian%20languages">North Iranian</a> or <a href="Pamir%20languages">Pamiri</a> origin.

Human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria can be traced back to the <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a>. Animal bones incised with man-made markings from <a href="Kozarnika">Kozarnika</a> cave are assumed to be the earliest examples of <a href="symbolic%20behaviour">symbolic behaviour</a> in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> <a href="Hamangia%20culture">Hamangia culture</a>, <a href="Vin%C4%8Da%20culture">Vinča culture</a> and the <a href="eneolithic">eneolithic</a> <a href="Varna%20culture">Varna culture</a> (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing <a href="gold">gold</a> working and exploitation. Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the <a href="Varna%20Necropolis">Varna Necropolis treasure</a>, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.

<a href="Thracians">Thracians</a>, one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians, began appearing in the region during the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>. In the late 6th century BC, the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persians</a> conquered most of present-day Bulgaria. and kept it until <a href="Second%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece">479 BC</a>. With influence from the Persians, the bulk of the Thracian tribes were united in the <a href="Odrysian%20kingdom">Odrysian kingdom</a> in the 470s BC by king <a href="Teres%20I">Teres</a>, but were later subjugated by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> and by the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a> in 46 AD. After the division of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in the 5th century the area fell under <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> control. By this time, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> had already spread in the region. A small <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> community in <a href="Nicopolis%20ad%20Istrum">Nicopolis ad Istrum</a> produced the first <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic language</a> book in the 4th century, the <a href="Gothic%20Bible">Wulfila Bible</a>. The <a href="Monastery%20of%20Saint%20Athanasius">first Christian monastery</a> in Europe was established around the same time by <a href="Saint%20Athanasius">Saint Athanasius</a> in central Bulgaria. From the 6th century the easternmost <a href="South%20Slavs">South Slavs</a> gradually settled in the region, assimilating the partly Hellenised or Romanised Thracians.

In 680 <a href="Bulgars">Bulgar</a> tribes under the leadership of <a href="Asparukh%20of%20Bulgaria">Asparukh</a> moved south across the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> and settled in the area between the lower Danube and the <a href="Balkan">Balkan</a>, establishing their capital at <a href="Pliska">Pliska</a>. A peace treaty with Byzantium in 681 marked the beginning of the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a>. The Bulgars gradually mixed with the local population, adopting a common language on the basis of the local <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> dialect.

Succeeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. <a href="Krum%20of%20Bulgaria">Krum</a> doubled the country's territory, killed Byzantine emperor <a href="Nicephorus%20I">Nicephorus I</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pliska">Battle of Pliska</a>, and introduced the first written code of law. Paganism was abolished in favour of <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Christianity</a> under <a href="Boris%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Boris I</a> in 864. This <a href="Christianization%20of%20Bulgaria">conversion</a> was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the <a href="Bulgarian%20Orthodox%20Church">Bulgarian church</a> and the adoption of the <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic alphabet</a> developed at <a href="Preslav%20Literary%20School">Preslav</a> which strengthened central authority and helped fuse the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people. A subsequent cultural golden age began during the 34-year rule of <a href="Simeon%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Simeon the Great</a>, who also achieved the largest territorial expansion of the state.

Wars with <a href="Magyars">Magyars</a> and <a href="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a> and the spread of the <a href="Bogomilism">Bogomil heresy</a> weakened Bulgaria after Simeon's death. Consecutive <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Rus'</a> and Byzantine invasions resulted in the seizure of the capital <a href="Preslav">Preslav</a> by the Byzantine army in 971. Under <a href="Samuel%20of%20Bulgaria">Samuil</a>, Bulgaria briefly recovered from these attacks, but this rise ended when Byzantine emperor <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> defeated the Bulgarian army at <a href="battle%20of%20Kleidion">Klyuch</a> in 1014. Samuil died shortly after the battle, and by 1018 the Byzantines had ended the First Bulgarian Empire.

After his conquest of Bulgaria, <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> prevented revolts and discontent by retaining the rule of the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing them to be paid in kind instead. He also allowed the <a href="Bulgarian%20Orthodox%20Church">Bulgarian Patriarchate</a> to retain its <a href="autocephaly">autocephalous status</a> and all its <a href="diocese">diocese</a>s, but reduced it to an <a href="Orthodox%20Archbishopric%20of%20Ohrid%20%28ancient%29">archbishopric</a>. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, <a href="Bulgarian%20uprising%20against%20the%20Byzantine%20Empire%20%281040-1041%29">the largest</a> being led by <a href="Peter%20Delyan">Peter Delyan</a>. In 1185 <a href="Asen%20dynasty">Asen dynasty</a> nobles <a href="Ivan%20Asen%20I">Ivan Asen I</a> and <a href="Peter%20IV%20of%20Bulgaria">Peter IV</a> organised a <a href="Uprising%20of%20Asen%20and%20Peter">major uprising</a> which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with <a href="Veliko%20Tarnovo">Tarnovo</a> as the capital.

<a href="Kaloyan">Kaloyan</a>, the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominion to <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> and <a href="Ohrid">Ohrid</a>. He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of <a href="the%20pope">the pope</a> and received a royal crown from a <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>. The empire reached its zenith under <a href="Ivan%20Asen%20II">Ivan Asen II</a> (1218–1241), when commerce and culture flourished. The strong economic and religious influence of Tarnovo made it a "<a href="Third%20Rome">Third Rome</a>", unlike the already declining Constantinople.

The country's military and economic might declined after the Asen dynasty ended in 1257, facing internal conflicts, constant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks and <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Europe">Mongol domination</a>. By the end of the 14th century, factional divisions between <a href="boyars">the feudal landlords</a> and the spread of Bogomilism had caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three tsardoms—<a href="Tsardom%20of%20Vidin">Vidin</a>, <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire%23Ivan%20Alexander%20and%20fall%20of%20Bulgaria">Tarnovo</a> and <a href="Despotate%20of%20Dobruja">Karvuna</a>—and several semi-independent principalities that fought each other, along with Byzantines, Hungarians, Serbs, <a href="Venetian%20Republic">Venetians</a> and <a href="Genoese%20Republic">Genoese</a>. By the late 14th century the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a> had started their conquest of Bulgaria and had taken most towns and fortresses south of the Balkan mountains.

Tarnovo was captured by the Ottomans after a three-month siege in 1393. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nicopolis">Battle of Nicopolis</a> in 1396 brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom, the Ottomans conquered all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube. The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was <a href="Serfdom">enserfed</a> to Ottoman masters, with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries. Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an <a href="rayah">inferior class</a> of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and a small portion of the Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete <a href="Islamisation">Islamisation</a>, and their culture was suppressed. Ottoman authorities established the Rum <a href="Millet%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29">Millet</a>, a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying as Christians. However, the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive, and that helped it to survive as in some rural, remote areas, as well as in the militant <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Bulgaria">Catholic community</a> in the northwestern part of the country.

Several Bulgarian revolts erupted throughout the nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule, most notably the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg</a>-backed Tarnovo uprisings <a href="First%20Tarnovo%20Uprising">in 1598</a> and <a href="Second%20Tarnovo%20Uprising">in 1686</a>, the <a href="Chiprovtsi%20Uprising">Chiprovtsi Uprising</a> in 1688 and <a href="Karposh%27s%20Rebellion">Karposh's Rebellion</a> in 1689. In the 18th century, the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> in Western Europe provided influence for the initiation of a movement known as the <a href="National%20awakening%20of%20Bulgaria">National awakening of Bulgaria</a>. It restored national consciousness and became a key factor in the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876 <a href="April%20Uprising">April Uprising</a>. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion. The massacres prompted the <a href="Great%20Powers%23History">Great Powers</a> to take action. They convened the <a href="Constantinople%20Conference">Constantinople Conference</a> in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans. This allowed the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> to seek a solution by force without risking military confrontation with other Great Powers, as had happened in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. In 1877 <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%2C%201877%E2%80%931878">Russia declared war</a> on the Ottoman Empire and defeated its forces with the help of <a href="Opalchentsi">Bulgarian volunteers</a>.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a> was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire, and included a provision to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire. 3 March has since become <a href="Liberation%20Day">Liberation Day</a>, a public holiday in Bulgaria, though the holiday was suppressed and fell out of favour following the left-wing uprising in 1944.

The other <a href="Great%20Powers%23History">Great Powers</a> immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the subsequent <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berlin%2C%201878">Treaty of Berlin</a>, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state comprising <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> and the region of <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, leaving large populations of Bulgarians outside the new country. This played a significant role in forming Bulgaria's militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century.

The Bulgarian principality won <a href="Serbo-Bulgarian%20War">a war against Serbia</a> and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of <a href="Eastern%20Rumelia">Eastern Rumelia</a> in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarised and was often referred to as "the Balkan <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>".

Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became involved in three consecutive conflicts—two <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a> and <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. After a disastrous defeat in the <a href="Second%20Balkan%20War">Second Balkan War</a>, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at <a href="Battle%20of%20Doiran%20%281917%29">Doiran</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Dobrich">Dobrich</a>, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees <a href="immigrated">immigrated</a> to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.

The political unrest resulting from these losses led to the establishment of a royal <a href="authoritarianism">authoritarian dictatorship</a> by Tsar <a href="Boris%20III%20of%20Bulgaria">Boris III</a> (1918–1943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of <a href="Axis%20Powers">the Axis</a> but declined to participate in <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> and <a href="Rescue%20of%20the%20Bulgarian%20Jews">saved its Jewish population</a> from deportation to <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">concentration camps</a>. The sudden death of Boris III in the summer of 1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum. The government of <a href="Bogdan%20Filov">Bogdan Filov</a> subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies. Bulgaria did not comply with Soviet demands to expel German forces from its territory, resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the USSR in September 1944. The communist-dominated <a href="Fatherland%20Front%20%28Bulgaria%29">Fatherland Front</a> took power, ended participation in the Axis and joined the Allied side until the war ended.
The <a href="Bulgarian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20of%201944">left-wing uprising</a> of 9 September 1944 led to the abolition of monarchic rule, but it was not until 1946 that a <a href="One-party%20state">one-party</a> <a href="people%27s%20republic">people's republic</a> was established. It became a part of the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of <a href="Georgi%20Dimitrov">Georgi Dimitrov</a> (1946–1949), who laid the foundations for a rapidly industrialising <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> state which was also highly repressive with thousands of dissidents executed. By the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly, while political repressions were lessened. By the 1980s both national and per capita GDPs quadrupled, but the economy remained prone to debt spikes, the most severe taking place in 1960, 1977 and 1980. The Soviet-style <a href="planned%20economy">planned economy</a> saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under <a href="Todor%20Zhivkov">Todor Zhivkov</a> (1954–1989). His daughter <a href="Lyudmila%20Zhivkova">Lyudmila</a> bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage, culture and arts worldwide. In an attempt to erase the identity of the <a href="Turks%20in%20Bulgaria">ethnic Turk</a> minority, an assimilation campaign was launched in 1984 which included closing mosques and forcing ethnic Turks to adopt Slavic names. These policies (combined with the end of communist rule in 1989) resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic Turks to Turkey.

Under the influence of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">collapsing of the Eastern Bloc</a>, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a> (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party). A <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bulgaria">new constitution</a> that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status. It became a member of <a href="NATO">NATO</a> in 2004 and participated in the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a>. After several years of reforms it joined the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption.

Bulgaria occupies a portion of the eastern <a href="Balkans">Balkan</a> peninsula, bordering five countries—<a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> to the south, <a href="Macedonia%20%28country%29">Macedonia</a> and <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> to the west, and <a href="Romania">Romania</a> to the north. The land borders have a total length of , and the coastline has a length of . Its total area of ranks it as the world's 105th-largest country. Bulgaria's geographic coordinates are <a href="43rd%20parallel%20north">43° N</a> <a href="25th%20meridian%20east">25° E</a>.

The most notable <a href="topographical">topographical</a> features are the <a href="Danubian%20Plain%20%28Bulgaria%29">Danubian Plain</a>, the <a href="Balkan%20Mountains">Balkan Mountains</a>, the <a href="Thracian%20Plain">Thracian Plain</a>, and the <a href="Rhodope%20Mountains">Rhodope Mountains</a>. The southern edge of the Danubian Plain slopes upward into the foothills of the Balkans, while the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> defines the border with Romania. The <a href="Thracia">Thracia</a>n Plain is roughly triangular, beginning southeast of <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> and broadening as it reaches the <a href="Bulgarian%20Black%20Sea%20Coast">Black Sea coast</a>.

The Balkan mountains run laterally through the middle of the country. The mountainous southwest of the country has two alpine ranges—<a href="Rila">Rila</a> and <a href="Pirin">Pirin</a>, which border the lower but more extensive <a href="Rhodope%20Mountains">Rhodope Mountains</a> to the east. Bulgaria is home to the highest point of the Balkan peninsula, <a href="Musala">Musala</a>, at and its lowest point is sea level. Plains occupy about one-third of the territory, while plateaus and hills occupy 41 per cent. The country has a dense network of about 540 rivers, most of which are relatively small and with low water levels. The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory, the <a href="Iskar%20%28river%29">Iskar</a>, has a length of . Other major rivers include the <a href="Struma%20River">Struma</a> and the <a href="Maritsa">Maritsa</a> in the south.

Bulgaria has a dynamic climate, which results from its being positioned at the meeting point of <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> and continental air masses and the barrier effect of its mountains. Northern Bulgaria averages cooler and registers more precipitation annually than the regions south of the Balkan mountains. Temperature amplitudes vary significantly in different areas. The lowest recorded temperature is , while the highest is . <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">Precipitation</a> averages about per year, and varies from in <a href="Dobrudja">Dobrudja</a> to more than in the mountains. Continental air masses bring significant amounts of snowfall during winter.

Bulgaria adopted the <a href="Kyoto%20Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> and achieved the protocol's objectives by reducing <a href="carbon%20dioxide%20emissions">carbon dioxide emissions</a> from 1990 to 2009 by 30 percent. However, pollution from factories and metallurgy works and severe <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> continue to cause major problems to the health and welfare of the population. In 2013, air pollution in Bulgaria was more severe than any other European country. Urban areas are particularly affected by energy production from coal-based powerplants and automobile traffic, while pesticide usage in the agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution with chemicals and <a href="detergents">detergents</a>. Bulgaria is home to <a href="Maritsa%20Iztok%20Complex">Maritsa Iztok-2</a>, a <a href="lignite">lignite</a>-fired power station causing the highest damage costs to <a href="health">health</a> and the <a href="Environmental%20degradation">environment</a> in the entire European Union according to the <a href="European%20Environment%20Agency">European Environment Agency</a>. It is the only EU member which does not recycle municipal waste, although an <a href="Computer%20recycling">electronic waste recycling</a> plant opened in June 2010. The situation has improved in recent years, and several government-funded programs have been put into place in an attempt to reduce pollution levels. According to Yale University's 2012 <a href="Environmental%20Performance%20Index">Environmental Performance Index</a>, Bulgaria is a "modest performer" in protecting the environment. Over 75% of surface rivers meet the standards for good quality. An improvement of water quality began in 1998 and has maintained a sustainable trend of moderate improvement.

The interaction of climatic, hydrological, geological and topographical conditions have produced a relatively wide variety of plant and animal species.
Bulgaria is one of the countries with highest <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> in Europe.
Bulgaria's biodiversity <a href="List%20of%20protected%20areas%20of%20Bulgaria">is conserved</a> in three national parks, 11 nature parks and 16 <a href="biosphere%20reserve">biosphere reserve</a>s. Nearly 35 per cent of its land area consists of forests, where some of the oldest trees in the world, such as <a href="Baikushev%27s%20pine">Baikushev's pine</a> and the <a href="Granit%20oak">Granit oak</a>, grow. Most of the plant and animal life is central European, although representatives of Arctic and alpine species are present at high altitudes. Its flora encompass more than 3,800 species of which 170 are <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> and 150 are considered endangered. A checklist of larger <a href="fungi">fungi</a> of Bulgaria reported that more than 1,500 species occur in the country. Animal species include <a href="owl">owl</a>s, <a href="rock%20partridge">rock partridge</a>s, <a href="wallcreeper">wallcreeper</a>s and <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>s. The <a href="Eurasian%20lynx">Eurasian lynx</a> and the <a href="eastern%20imperial%20eagle">eastern imperial eagle</a> have small, but growing populations.

In 1998, the Bulgarian government approved the National Biological Diversity Conservation Strategy, a comprehensive programme seeking the preservation of local ecosystems, protection of endangered species and conservation of genetic resources. Bulgaria has some of the largest <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a> areas in Europe covering 33.8% of its territory.

Bulgaria is a <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">parliamentary democracy</a> in which the most powerful executive position is that of prime minister. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a> for <a href="citizen">citizen</a>s at least 18 years old. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bulgaria">Constitution of Bulgaria</a> provides also possibilities of direct democracy. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.

Political parties gather in the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Bulgaria%29">National Assembly</a>, which consists of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Bulgaria">Prime Minister</a> and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements. The <a href="President%20of%20Bulgaria">president</a> serves as the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the <a href="presidential%20veto">presidential veto</a> by a simple majority vote of all members of parliament.

The first <a href="GERB">GERB</a> government was formed after the centre right political party won the <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202009">2009 general election</a> in July with 117 seats in the National Assembly and ruling as a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> without support from the other political parties in the parliament. However, the government resigned on 20 February 2013 after <a href="Protests%20against%20the%20Borisov%20cabinet">nationwide protests</a> caused by high costs of utilities, low living standards and the failure of the democratic system. The protest wave was marked by self-immolations, spontaneous demonstrations and a strong sentiment against political parties. As a consequence, the Parliament was dissolved and a new provisional government was set up by the President. 
The subsequent snap elections in <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202013">May 2013</a> resulted in a narrow win for <a href="GERB">GERB</a>. However, with no support from the other three political parties that entered the parliament, on 24 May, <a href="GERB">GERB</a> leader <a href="Boyko%20Borisov">Boyko Borisov</a> returned the president's mandate to form a government. The <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a> nominated the ex-Finance Minister <a href="Plamen%20Oresharski">Plamen Oresharski</a> for the post of Prime Minister in May 2013. Only two weeks after its initial formation the Oresharski government came under opposition criticism and had to deal with another wave of <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bulgarian%20protests%20against%20the%20Oresharski%20cabinet">large-scale protests</a> some with more than 11 000 participants. The government survived five <a href="vote%20of%20confidence">votes of no-confidence</a> before voluntarily resigning on 23 July 2014. On 6 August, a <a href="Bliznashki%20Government">caretaker government</a> led by <a href="Georgi%20Bliznashki">Georgi Bliznashki</a> was sworn into office and the Oresharski government was officially dissolved.

A new round of snap elections in <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202014">October 2014</a> resulted in a third <a href="GERB">GERB</a> victory with around a third of the vote. A record of eight parties won seats, the first time since the beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament. After being tasked by <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Bulgaria">President</a> <a href="Rosen%20Plevneliev">Rosen Plevneliev</a> to form a government, Borisov's GERB <a href="Second%20Borisov%20Government">formed a coalition</a> and members of the parties in the <a href="Reformist%20Bloc">Reformist Bloc</a> (<a href="Democrats%20for%20a%20Strong%20Bulgaria">Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB)</a>, <a href="Union%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20%28Bulgaria%29">Union of Democratic Forces (SDS)</a>, <a href="Bulgaria%20for%20Citizens%20Movement">Bulgaria for Citizens Movement (DBG)</a>, <a href="Alternative%20for%20Bulgarian%20Revival">Alternative for Bulgarian Revival</a> and <a href="Bulgarian%20Agrarian%20National%20Union">Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS)</a>) were chosen for Minister positions. However, <a href="Boyko%20Borisov">Boyko Borisov</a> made a vow in 2016 – should <a href="GERB">GERB</a> President nominee <a href="Tsetska%20Tsacheva">Tsetska Tsacheva</a> does not win the <a href="Bulgarian%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">Bulgarian presidential election, 2016</a>, he would resign as a Prime Minister. <a href="GERB">GERB</a> lost at this election from the independent candidate <a href="Rumen%20Radev">Rumen Radev</a> who was, nevertheless, supported by the <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a>. Subsequently, <a href="Boyko%20Borisov">Boyko Borisov</a> resigned for the second time.
The new president <a href="Rumen%20Radev">Rumen Radev</a> formed a <a href="Gerdzhikov%20Government">caretaker government</a> led by <a href="Ognyan%20Gerdzhikov">Ognyan Gerdzhikov</a> officially dissolving the <a href="Second%20Borisov%20Government">Second Borisov Government</a>.

At the next snap elections in <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202017">March 2017</a>, <a href="GERB">GERB</a> won for the fourth time and four other parties entered the parliament – <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a>, <a href="Patriotic%20Front%20%28Bulgaria%29">Patriotic Front</a>, <a href="Movement%20for%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms">Movement for Rights and Freedoms</a> and <a href="Volia">Volia</a>.

Bulgaria has a typical <a href="Civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a> legal system. The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. Bulgaria's judiciary, along with other institutions, remains one of Europe's most corrupt and inefficient.

Law enforcement is carried out by organisations mainly subordinate to the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Interior%20%28Bulgaria%29">Ministry of the Interior</a>. The <a href="National%20Police%20Service%20%28Bulgaria%29">National Police Service</a> (NPS) combats general crime, maintains public order and supports the operations of other law enforcement agencies. NPS fields 27,000 police officers in its local and national sections. The Ministry of Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the <a href="Gendarmerie%20%28Bulgaria%29">National Gendarmerie</a>—a specialised branch for anti-terrorist activity, crisis management and riot control. Counterintelligence and national security are the responsibility of the State Agency for National Security, established in 2008.

Bulgaria is a <a href="unitary%20state">unitary state</a>. Since the 1880s, the number of territorial management units has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces ("oblasti", singular "<a href="oblast">oblast</a>"). A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces subdivide into 264 <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Bulgaria">municipalities</a>.

Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly <a href="centralization">centralised</a> state, where the national Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.

Bulgaria became a member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">Security Council</a> three times, most recently from 2002 to 2003. Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) in 1975. It joined <a href="NATO">NATO</a> on 29 March 2004, signed the European Union <a href="Treaty%20of%20Accession%202005">Treaty of Accession</a> on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. Polls carried out seven years after the country's accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from membership, with almost 40% of the population saying they would not bother to vote in the <a href="Elections%20to%20the%20European%20Parliament">2014 EU elections</a>. Euro-Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism, although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the <a href="European%20Communities">European Communities</a> by 1987.

Bulgaria's relationship with its neighbours since 1990 has generally been good. The country also plays an important role in promoting regional security. Bulgaria has an active tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, maintains strong relations with EU members, the United States, and Russia, and continues to improve its traditionally good ties with <a href="China">China</a> and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. The <a href="HIV%20trial%20in%20Libya">HIV trial in Libya</a>, which followed after the imprisonment of several Bulgarian nurses in <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a> in 1998, had a significant impact on relations between Bulgaria, the European Union, and Libya. It resulted in the release of the nurses by Muammar Gaddafi's government, which was granted a contract to receive a nuclear reactor and weapons supplies from France in exchange.

Bulgaria's relations with the <a href="Russia">Russian Federation</a> are currently on a good or fair level. Both countries have had centuries-long interactions, sharing a common heritage. The <a href="Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic alphabet</a> originated during 9th century and it was created by <a href="Clement%20of%20Ohrid">Clement</a> and <a href="Saint%20Naum">Naum</a>, who were the students of Cyril and Methodius, which later accepted the Orthodox Slavic countries as their standard letter. Relations between Russia and Bulgaria have dated back as far as the 19th century. Both nations had the tradition of calling monarchs <a href="tsar">tsar</a>s, a Slavic word for "caesar" or "emperor". The <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> was the first country to recognize Bulgaria, and greatly helped Bulgaria in its war of independence from <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1908. During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, Bulgaria became an ally of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> as a satellite state. After the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a>, relations between Bulgaria and Russia still share many different opinions, such as the two World Wars when Bulgaria both joined German side against Russia, and the problem over the history.

Bulgaria hosted six <a href="KC-135%20Stratotanker">KC-135 Stratotanker</a> aircraft and 200 support personnel for the war effort in Afghanistan in 2001, which was the first stationing of foreign forces on its territory since World War II. International military relations were further expanded in April 2006, when Bulgaria and the United States signed a defence cooperation agreement providing for the usage of <a href="Bezmer%20Air%20Base">Bezmer</a> and <a href="Graf%20Ignatievo%20Air%20Base">Graf Ignatievo</a> air bases, the <a href="Novo%20Selo%20Range">Novo Selo</a> training range, and a logistics centre in <a href="Aytos%20Logistics%20Center">Aytos</a> as <a href="List%20of%20joint%20US-Bulgarian%20military%20bases">joint military training facilities</a>. The same year "<a href="Foreign%20Policy%20%28magazine%29">Foreign Policy</a>" magazine listed Bezmer Air Base as one of the six most important overseas facilities used by the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">USAF</a> due to its proximity to the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. A total of 756 troops are <a href="Military%20of%20Bulgaria%23Deployments">deployed abroad</a> as part of various UN and NATO missions. Historically, Bulgaria deployed significant numbers of military and civilian advisors in Soviet-allied countries, such as <a href="Nicaraguan%20Revolution">Nicaragua</a> and <a href="Great%20Socialist%20People%27s%20Libyan%20Arab%20Jamahiriya">Libya</a> (more than 9,000 personnel).

Domestic defence is the responsibility of the all-<a href="volunteer%20military">volunteer</a> <a href="military%20of%20Bulgaria">military of Bulgaria</a>, consisting of <a href="Bulgarian%20land%20forces">land forces</a>, <a href="Bulgarian%20Navy">navy</a> and <a href="Bulgarian%20Air%20Force">air force</a>. The land forces consist of two mechanised brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems in six air bases, and the navy operates a variety of ships, helicopters and coastal defence measures. Following a series of reductions beginning in 1990, the number of active troops contracted from 152,000 in 1988 to about 32,000 in the 2000s, supplemented in 2010 by a reserve force of 302,500 soldiers and officers and 34,000 paramilitary servicemen. The inventory is mostly of Soviet origin, such as <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a> fighters, <a href="SA-10%20Grumble">SA-10 Grumble</a> SAMs and <a href="SS-21%20Scarab">SS-21 Scarab</a> short-range <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a>s. , the government planned to spend $1.4 billion for the deployment of new fighter jets, communications systems and <a href="cyber%20warfare">cyber warfare</a> capabilities. Total military spending for 2016 was BGN 1.3 billion (USD 560m).

Bulgaria has an emerging <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a> in the upper middle income range, where the private sector accounts for more than 80 per cent of GDP. From a largely agricultural country with a predominantly rural population in 1948, by the 1980s Bulgaria had transformed into an industrial economy with scientific and technological research at the top of its budgetary expenditure priorities. The loss of <a href="COMECON">COMECON</a> markets in 1990 and the subsequent "<a href="Shock%20therapy%20%28economics%29">shock therapy</a>" of the planned system caused a steep decline in industrial and agricultural production, ultimately followed by an economic collapse in 1997. The economy largely recovered during a period of rapid growth several years later, but the average salary remains one of the lowest in the EU at 1,036 leva (€529) per month in March 2017. More than a fifth of the labour force are employed on a <a href="minimum%20wage">minimum wage</a> of €1 per hour. Wages, however, account for only half of the total household income, owing to the substantial <a href="informal%20economy">informal economy</a> which amounts to almost 32% of GDP. Bulgarian PPS <a href="GDP">GDP</a> <a href="per%20capita">per capita</a> stood at 47 per cent of the EU average in 2015 according to <a href="Eurostat">Eurostat</a> data, while at the same time the cost of living in the country was 47 per cent of the EU average as well. The currency is the <a href="Bulgarian%20lev">lev</a>, which is pegged to the euro at a rate of 1.95583 levа for 1 euro. Bulgaria is not yet part of the <a href="eurozone">eurozone</a> but is showing progress.

Economic indicators have improved after the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a>. After several consecutive years of high growth, GDP contracted 5.5 per cent in 2009 and unemployment remained above 12 per cent. Industrial output declined 10 per cent, mining by 31 per cent, and ferrous and metal production marked a 60 per cent drop. Positive growth was restored in 2010, although investments and consumption continue to decline steadily due to rising unemployment. The same year, intercompany debt exceeded €51 billion, meaning that 60 per cent of all Bulgarian companies were mutually indebted. By 2012, it had increased to €83 billion, or 227 per cent of GDP. The government implemented strict austerity measures with IMF and EU encouragement to some positive fiscal results, but the social consequences of these measures have been "catastrophic" according to the <a href="International%20Trade%20Union%20Confederation">International Trade Union Confederation</a>. <a href="Corruption">Corruption</a> remains another obstacle to economic growth. Bulgaria is one of the most corrupt European Union members and ranks 75th in the <a href="Corruption%20Perceptions%20Index">Corruption Perceptions Index</a>. Weak law enforcement and overall low capacity of civil service remain as challenges in curbing corruption. However, fighting against corruption has become the focus of the government because of the EU accession, and several anti-corruption programs have been undertaken by different government agencies.
Economic activities are fostered by the lowest personal and corporate income tax rates in the EU, and the third-lowest <a href="public%20debt">public debt</a> of all member states at 28.7% of GDP in 2016. In 2016, GDP (<a href="Purchasing%20power%20parity">PPP</a>) was estimated at $143.1 billion, with a per capita value of $20,116. Sofia and the surrounding <a href="Yugozapaden">Yugozapaden</a> planning area are the most developed region of the country with a per capita PPS GDP of €20,600 ($27,400) in 2014. Bulgaria is a net receiver of funds from the EU. The absolute amount of received funds was €589 million in 2009.

The labour force is 2.45 million people, of whom 7.1 per cent are employed in agriculture, 35.2 per cent are employed in industry and 57.7 per cent are employed in the services sector. Extraction of metals and minerals, production of <a href="chemical%20industry">chemicals</a>, <a href="machinery%20industry">machinery</a> and vehicle components, <a href="refined%20petroleum%20fuel">petroleum refining</a> and steel are among the major industrial activities. Mining and its related industries employ a total of 120,000 people and generate about five per cent of the country's GDP. Bulgaria is Europe's sixth-largest coal producer. Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors. Almost all top export items of Bulgaria are industrial commodities such as oil products, copper products and pharmaceuticals. Bulgaria is also a net exporter of agricultural and food products, of which two-thirds go to <a href="OECD">OECD</a> countries. It is the largest global producer of perfumery essential oils such as <a href="lavender%20oil">lavender</a> and <a href="rose%20oil">rose oil</a>. Agriculture has declined significantly in the past two decades. Production in 2008 amounted to only 66 per cent of that between 1999 and 2001, while cereal and vegetable yields have dropped by nearly 40 per cent since 1990. Of the services sector, <a href="Tourism%20in%20Bulgaria">tourism</a> is the most significant contributor to economic growth. In recent years, Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach of the tourist industry. <a href="Lonely%20Planet">Lonely Planet</a> ranked it among its top 10 destinations for 2011. Most of the visitors are British, Romanian, German and Russian. The capital <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, the medieval capital <a href="Veliko%20Tarnovo">Veliko Tarnovo</a>, coastal resorts <a href="Golden%20Sands">Golden Sands</a> and <a href="Sunny%20Beach">Sunny Beach</a> and winter resorts <a href="Bansko">Bansko</a>, <a href="Pamporovo">Pamporovo</a> and <a href="Borovets">Borovets</a> are some of the locations most visited by tourists.

Bulgaria spends 0.95% of GDP on research and development.
Chronic underinvestment in research since 1990 forced many scientific professionals to leave the country. As a result, Bulgaria scores low in terms of innovation, competitiveness and high-value added exports. Principal areas of research and development are energy, <a href="nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a> and medicine. The <a href="Bulgarian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</a> (BAS) is the leading scientific establishment and employs most Bulgarian researchers in its numerous institutes. It has been active in the field of <a href="space%20science">space science</a> with <a href="RADOM-7">RADOM-7</a> radiation monitoring experiments on the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> and <a href="Chandrayaan-1">Chandrayaan-1</a>, and domestically developed space <a href="greenhouse">greenhouse</a>s on the <a href="Mir%20space%20station">Mir space station</a>. Bulgaria became the <a href="Timeline%20of%20space%20travel%20by%20nationality">sixth country</a> in the world to have an astronaut in space with <a href="Georgi%20Ivanov">Georgi Ivanov</a>'s flight on <a href="Soyuz%2033">Soyuz 33</a> in 1979. Bulgaria is an active member of <a href="CERN">CERN</a> and has contributed to its activities with nearly 200 scientists since its accession in 1999.

In the 1980s Bulgaria was known as the "<a href="Silicon%20Valley">Silicon Valley</a> of the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>" because of its large-scale computing technology exports to <a href="COMECON">COMECON</a> states. The <a href="Information%20and%20communication%20technologies">ICT</a> sector generates 10 per cent of GDP and employs the third-largest contingent of ICT specialists in the world. A <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Supercomputing%20Applications%20%28Bulgaria%29">National Centre for Supercomputing Applications</a> (NCSA) operates the only supercomputer in Southeastern Europe. The <a href="Bulgarian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</a> is planning to buy another supercomputer in 2015 which will be used together with Hi-Tech SME's.

Internet usage has increased rapidly since 2000—the number of users grew from 430,000 to 3.4 million (48 per cent penetration rate) in 2010. Telephone services are widely available, and a central digital trunk line connects most regions. More than 90 per cent of fixed lines are served by the <a href="Bulgarian%20Telecommunications%20Company">Bulgarian Telecommunications Company</a> (BTC), while mobile services are provided by three operators—<a href="Mobiltel">Mtel</a>, <a href="Telenor%20%28Bulgaria%29">Telenor</a> and <a href="Vivacom">Vivacom</a>.

Bulgaria's strategic geographic location and well-developed energy sector make it a key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits. Nearly 34 percent of its electricity is produced by the <a href="Kozloduy%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant">nuclear power station at Kozloduy</a> and public opinion strongly supports nuclear energy development. The rapid expansion of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power stations make Bulgaria one of the fastest-growing wind energy producers in the world. The country aims to produce 16 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020.

The national road network has a total length of , of which are paved, but nearly half fall into the lowest international rating for paved roads. Railroads are a major mode of freight transportation, although highways carry a progressively larger share of freight. Bulgaria has of railway track and currently a total of of <a href="high-speed%20rail">high-speed lines</a> are in operation. Rail links are available with Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Serbia, and express trains serve direct routes to <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>, <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> and <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. Sofia and Plovdiv are the country's air travel hubs, while Varna and Burgas are the principal maritime trade ports. Varna is also scheduled to be the first station on EU territory to receive natural gas through the <a href="South%20Stream">South Stream</a> pipeline.

The population of Bulgaria is 7,364,570 people according to the 2011 national census. The majority of the population, or 72.5 percent, reside in urban areas; approximately one-sixth of the total population is concentrated in Sofia. <a href="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a> are the main ethnic group and comprise 84.8 percent of the population. <a href="Turks%20in%20Bulgaria">Turkish</a> and <a href="Roma%20in%20Bulgaria">Roma</a> minorities comprise 8.8 and 4.9 percent, respectively; some 40 smaller minorities comprise 0.7 percent, and 0.8 percent do not self-identify with an ethnic group.

All ethnic groups speak <a href="Bulgarian%20language">Bulgarian</a>, either as a first or as a second language. Bulgarian is the only language with official status and native for 85.2 percent of the population. The oldest written <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> language, Bulgarian is distinguishable from the other languages in this group through certain grammatical peculiarities such as the lack of <a href="noun%20cases">noun cases</a> and <a href="infinitives">infinitives</a>, and a suffixed <a href="definite%20article">definite article</a>.

Government estimates from 2003 put the literacy rate at 98.6 percent, with no significant difference between the sexes. Educational standards have been <a href="Education%20in%20Bulgaria">traditionally high</a>, although still far from European benchmarks and in continuing deterioration for the past decade. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had deteriorated. State expenditures for education are far below the European Union average. The <a href="Programme%20for%20International%20Student%20Assessment">PISA</a> study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be <a href="Functional%20illiteracy">functionally illiterate</a> in reading, maths and science. Bulgaria ranked 45th out of 72 countries surveyed. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%2C%20Youth%20and%20Science%20%28Bulgaria%29">Ministry of Education, Youth and Science</a> partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. The State provides free education in primary and secondary public schools. The educational process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. High schools can be technical, vocational, general or specialised in a certain discipline, while higher education consists of a 4-year <a href="Bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor</a> degree and a 1-year master's degree.

The Constitution of Bulgaria defines it as a <a href="secular%20state">secular state</a> with guaranteed religious freedom, but designates <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodoxy</a> as a "traditional" religion. The <a href="Bulgarian%20Orthodox%20Church">Bulgarian Orthodox Church</a> gained <a href="autocephaly">autocephalous</a> status in 927 AD, and currently has 12 dioceses and over 2,000 priests. More than three-quarters of Bulgarians subscribe to Eastern Orthodoxy. <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Muslims</a> are the second-largest community and constitute 10 percent of the religious makeup, although a majority of whom are not observant and find the use of <a href="Hijab">Islamic veils</a> in schools unacceptable. Less than three percent are affiliated with <a href="Religion%20in%20Bulgaria">other religions</a>, 11.8 percent do not self-identify with a religion and 21.8 percent refused to state their beliefs.

Bulgaria has <a href="Health%20in%20Bulgaria">a universal healthcare</a> system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing portion of the costs of <a href="primary%20health%20care">primary healthcare</a>. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly <a href="cardiovascular%20disease">cardiovascular disease</a>s, <a href="neoplasm">neoplasm</a>s and <a href="respiratory">respiratory</a> diseases.

Bulgaria is in a state of demographic crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The <a href="total%20fertility%20rate">total fertility rate</a> (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).

<a href="List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Bulgaria">Nine historical and natural objects</a> have been inscribed in the list of <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>s: the <a href="Madara%20Rider">Madara Rider</a>, the Thracian tombs in <a href="Thracian%20Tomb%20of%20Sveshtari">Sveshtari</a> and <a href="Thracian%20Tomb%20of%20Kazanlak">Kazanlak</a>, the <a href="Boyana%20Church">Boyana Church</a>, the <a href="Rila%20Monastery">Rila Monastery</a>, the <a href="Rock-hewn%20Churches%20of%20Ivanovo">Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo</a>, <a href="Pirin%20National%20Park">Pirin National Park</a>, <a href="Srebarna%20Nature%20Reserve">Sreburna Nature Reserve</a> and the ancient city of <a href="Nesebar">Nesebar</a>. <a href="Nestinarstvo">Nestinarstvo</a>, a ritual fire-dance of Thracian origin, is included in the list of <a href="UNESCO%20Intangible%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Lists">UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage</a>. Fire is an essential element of Bulgarian folklore, used to banish evil spirits and diseases. Bulgarian folklore personifies illnesses as witches and has a wide range of creatures, including <a href="Slavic%20dragon">lamya</a>, <a href="samodiva%20%28mythology%29">samodiva</a> (<a href="Supernatural%20beings%20in%20Slavic%20folklore">veela</a>) and <a href="Karakoncolos">karakondzhul</a>. Some of the customs and rituals against these spirits have survived and are still practised, most notably the <a href="kukeri">kukeri</a> and survakari. <a href="Martenitsa">Martenitsa</a> is also widely celebrated.

<a href="Slavic%20culture">Slavic culture</a> was centred in both the First and Second Bulgarian Empires during much of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The <a href="Preslav%20Literary%20School">Preslav</a>, <a href="Ohrid%20Literary%20School">Ohrid</a> and <a href="Tarnovo%20Literary%20School">Tarnovo</a> literary schools exerted considerable cultural influence over the Eastern Orthodox world. Many languages in Eastern Europe and Asia use <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> script, which originated in the Preslav Literary School around the 9th century. The medieval advancement in the arts and letters ended with the Ottoman conquest when many masterpieces were destroyed, and artistic activities did not re-emerge until the <a href="Bulgarian%20National%20Revival">National Revival</a> in the 19th century. After the Liberation, Bulgarian literature quickly adopted European literary styles such as <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> and <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolism</a>. Since the beginning of the 20th century, several Bulgarian authors, such as <a href="Ivan%20Vazov">Ivan Vazov</a>, <a href="Pencho%20Slaveykov">Pencho Slaveykov</a>, <a href="Peyo%20Yavorov">Peyo Yavorov</a>, <a href="Yordan%20Radichkov">Yordan Radichkov</a> and <a href="Tzvetan%20Todorov">Tzvetan Todorov</a> have gained prominence. In 1981 Bulgarian-born writer <a href="Elias%20Canetti">Elias Canetti</a> was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>.

Bulgarian folk music is by far the most extensive traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Eastern and Western influences. It contains Far Eastern, Oriental, medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities and modes. The music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments, such as <a href="gadulka">gadulka</a>, <a href="gaida">gaida</a> (<a href="bagpipe">bagpipe</a>), <a href="kaval">kaval</a> and <a href="davul">tupan</a>. One of its most distinguishing features is "extended rhythmical time", which has no equivalent in the rest of European music. The <a href="Bulgarian%20State%20Television%20Female%20Vocal%20Choir">State Television Female Vocal Choir</a> is the most famous performing folk ensemble, and received a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> in 1990. Bulgaria's written musical composition can be traced back to the early Middle Ages and the works of <a href="Yoan%20Kukuzel">Yoan Kukuzel</a> (c. 1280–1360). Classical music, opera and ballet are represented by composers <a href="Emanuil%20Manolov">Emanuil Manolov</a>, <a href="Pancho%20Vladigerov">Pancho Vladigerov</a> and <a href="Georgi%20Atanasov%20%28composer%29">Georgi Atanasov</a> and singers <a href="Ghena%20Dimitrova">Ghena Dimitrova</a>, <a href="Boris%20Christoff">Boris Hristov</a> and <a href="Nicolai%20Ghiaurov">Nikolay Gyaurov</a>. Bulgarian performers have gained popularity in several other genres like <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> (<a href="FSB%20%28band%29">FSB</a>), <a href="electropop">electropop</a> (<a href="Mira%20Aroyo">Mira Aroyo</a>) and <a href="jazz">jazz</a> (<a href="Milcho%20Leviev">Milcho Leviev</a>).

The religious visual arts heritage includes <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es, <a href="mural">mural</a>s and <a href="icon">icon</a>s, many produced by the medieval <a href="Painting%20of%20the%20Tarnovo%20Artistic%20School">Tarnovo Artistic School</a>. <a href="Vladimir%20Dimitrov">Vladimir Dimitrov</a>, <a href="Nikolay%20Diulgheroff">Nikolay Diulgheroff</a> and <a href="Christo">Christo</a> are some of the most famous modern Bulgarian artists. Film industry remains weak: in 2010, Bulgaria produced three feature films and two documentaries with public funding. Cultural events are advertised in the largest media outlets, including the <a href="Bulgarian%20National%20Radio">Bulgarian National Radio</a>, and daily newspapers "<a href="Dneven%20Trud">Dneven Trud</a>", "<a href="Dnevnik%20%28Bulgaria%29">Dnevnik</a>" and "<a href="24%20Chasa">24 Chasa</a>".

While major sections of <a href="Media%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria's media</a> are controlled by state entities, including <a href="Bulgarian%20National%20Television">Bulgarian National Television</a>, the <a href="Bulgarian%20National%20Radio">Bulgarian National Radio</a>, and the <a href="Bulgarian%20Telegraph%20Agency">Bulgarian Telegraph Agency</a>, reporting is generally deemed to be unbiased by direct government interference, although there is no specific legislation to maintain this. Written media has no legal restrictions,
and a large number of private television and radio stations also exist. Despite this, traditional Bulgarian media outlets are experiencing negative economic and political pressures, and instances of self-censorship have emerged. Meanwhile, internet media is growing in popularity due to its lack of censorship and the diversity of content and opinions it presents.

<a href="Bulgarian%20cuisine">Bulgarian cuisine</a> is similar to those of other Balkan countries and demonstrates a strong Turkish and Greek influence. <a href="Yogurt">Yogurt</a>, <a href="lukanka">lukanka</a>, <a href="banitsa">banitsa</a>, <a href="shopska%20salad">shopska salad</a>, <a href="lyutenitsa">lyutenitsa</a> and <a href="kozunak">kozunak</a> are among the best-known local foods. Oriental dishes such as <a href="moussaka">moussaka</a>, <a href="gyuvech">gyuvech</a>, and <a href="baklava">baklava</a> are also present. Meat consumption is lower than the European average, given a notable preference for a large variety of salads.

Bulgaria is also famous for its wines and spirits.
Until 1989, Bulgaria was the world's second-largest wine exporter. In 2016 it is the world 22nd in wine production. For 2016 Bulgaria produced 128m litres of wine, 62m litres expected for export, mainly to Romania, Poland and Russia. The 5 most popular grapes used for production of <a href="Bulgarian%20wine">Bulgarian wine</a> are <a href="Mavrud">Mavrud</a>, Rubin, <a href="Shiroka%20Melnishka%20Losa">Shiroka Melnishka Losa</a>, <a href="Dimiat">Dimiat</a>, <a href="Misket%20Cherven">Cherven Misket</a>.
<a href="Rakia">Rakia</a> is a traditional fruit <a href="brandy">brandy</a> which was consumed in Bulgaria as early as the 14th century.



Bulgaria performs well in sports such as <a href="wrestling">wrestling</a>, <a href="Olympic%20weightlifting">weight-lifting</a>, <a href="boxing">boxing</a>, gymnastics, <a href="volleyball">volleyball</a>, football and <a href="tennis">tennis</a>. The country fields one of the leading men's volleyball teams, ranked sixth in the world according to the 2013 <a href="FIVB">FIVB</a> rankings. <a href="Association%20football">Football</a> is by far the most popular sport.

Bryozoa

Bryozoa (also known as the Polyzoa, Ectoprocta or commonly as moss animals), are a <a href="phylum">phylum</a> of <a href="aquatic%20animal">aquatic</a> <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> animals. Typically about long, they are <a href="filter%20feeder">filter feeder</a>s that sieve food particles out of the water using a retractable <a href="lophophore">lophophore</a>, a "crown" of <a href="tentacle">tentacle</a>s lined with <a href="cilia">cilia</a>. Most <a href="Marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> species live in tropical waters, but a few occur in <a href="oceanic%20trench">oceanic trench</a>es, and others are found in <a href="Geographical%20pole">polar</a> waters. One <a href="class%20%28biology%29">class</a> lives only in a variety of <a href="freshwater">freshwater</a> environments, and a few members of a mostly marine class prefer <a href="brackish%20water">brackish water</a>. Over 4,000 living species are known. One <a href="genus">genus</a> is solitary and the rest are <a href="Colony%20%28biology%29">colonial</a>.

The phylum was originally called "Polyzoa", but this term was superseded by "Bryozoa" in 1831. Another group of animals discovered subsequently, whose filtering mechanism looked similar, was also included in "Bryozoa" until 1869, when the two groups were noted to be very different internally. The more recently discovered group was given the name <a href="Entoprocta">Entoprocta</a>, while the original "Bryozoa" were called "Ectoprocta". However, "Bryozoa" has remained the more widely used term for the latter group.

Individuals in bryozoan (ectoproct) colonies are called <a href="zooid">zooid</a>s, since they are not fully independent animals. All colonies contain autozooids, which are responsible for feeding and <a href="excretion">excretion</a>. Colonies of some <a href="class%20%28biology%29">classes</a> have various types of non-feeding specialist zooids, some of which are hatcheries for fertilized eggs, and some classes also have special zooids for defense of the colony. The class <a href="Cheilostomata">Cheilostomata</a> have the largest number of species, possibly because they have the widest range of specialist zooids. A few species can creep very slowly by using spiny defensive zooids as legs. Autozooids supply nutrients to non-feeding zooids by channels that vary between classes. All zooids, including those of the solitary species, consist of a "cystid" that provides the body wall and produces the <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> and a "<a href="polypide">polypide</a>" that contains the internal organs and the lophophore or other specialist extensions. Zooids have no special excretory organs, and the polypides of autozooids are scrapped when the polypides become overloaded by waste products; usually the body wall then grows a replacement polypide. In autozooids the gut is U-shaped, with the mouth inside the "crown" of tentacles and the anus outside it. Colonies take a variety of forms, including fans, bushes and sheets. The Cheilostomata produce <a href="biomineralization">mineralized</a> exoskeletons and form single-layered sheets which encrust over surfaces.

Zooids of all the freshwater species are simultaneous <a href="hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a>s. Although those of many marine species function first as males and then as females, their colonies always contain a combination of zooids that are in their male and female stages. All species emit <a href="sperm">sperm</a> into the water. Some also release <a href="ovum">ova</a> into the water, while others capture sperm via their tentacles to fertilize their ova internally. In some species the <a href="larva">larva</a>e have large <a href="yolk">yolk</a>s, go to feed, and quickly settle on a surface. Others produce larvae that have little yolk but swim and feed for a few days before settling. After settling, all larvae undergo a radical <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> that destroys and rebuilds almost all the internal tissues. Freshwater species also produce <a href="statoblast">statoblast</a>s that lie dormant until conditions are favorable, which enables a colony's lineage to survive even if severe conditions kill the mother colony.

Predators of marine bryozoans include <a href="nudibranch">nudibranch</a>s (sea slugs), fish, <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, <a href="pycnogonid">pycnogonid</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="mite">mite</a>s and <a href="starfish">starfish</a>. Freshwater bryozoans are preyed on by snails, insects, and fish. In <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, many populations of one freshwater species have been wiped out by an <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a> of snail. A fast-growing invasive bryozoan off the northeast and northwest coasts of the USA has reduced <a href="kelp">kelp</a> forests so much that it has affected local fish and invertebrate populations. Bryozoans have spread diseases to <a href="fish%20farm">fish farm</a>s and fishermen. Chemicals extracted from a marine bryozoan species have been investigated for treatment of cancer and <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, but analyses have not been encouraging.

Mineralized skeletons of bryozoans first appear in rocks from the Early <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a>, making it the last major phylum to appear in the fossil record. This has led researchers to suspect that bryozoans arose earlier but were initially unmineralized, and may have differed significantly from fossilized and modern forms. Early fossils are mainly of erect forms, but encrusting forms gradually became dominant. It is uncertain whether the phylum is <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a>. Bryozoans' evolutionary relationships to other phyla are also unclear, partly because scientists' view of the family tree of animals is mainly influenced by better-known phyla. Both <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> and <a href="molecular%20phylogeny">molecular phylogeny</a> analyses disagree over bryozoans' relationships with entoprocts, about whether bryozoans should be grouped with <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s and <a href="phoronid">phoronid</a>s in <a href="Lophophorata">Lophophorata</a>, and whether bryozoans should be considered <a href="protostome">protostome</a>s or <a href="deuterostome">deuterostome</a>s.

Bryozoans, <a href="Phoronida">phoronids</a> and <a href="Brachiopoda">brachiopods</a> <a href="Filter%20feeding">strain food out of the water</a> by means of a <a href="lophophore">lophophore</a>, a "crown" of hollow tentacles. Bryozoans form colonies consisting of <a href="Cloning">clones</a> called zooids that are typically about long. Phoronids resemble bryozoan zooids but are long and, although they often grow in clumps, do not form colonies consisting of clones. Brachiopods, generally thought to be closely related to bryozoans and phoronids, are distinguished by having shells rather like those of <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s. All three of these <a href="phylum">phyla</a> have a <a href="coelom">coelom</a>, an internal cavity lined by <a href="mesothelium">mesothelium</a>.
Some encrusting bryozoan colonies with <a href="biomineralization">mineralized</a> <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>s look very like small corals. However, bryozoan colonies are founded by an ancestrula, which is round rather than shaped like a normal zooid of that species. On the other hand, the founding polyp of a coral has a shape like that of its daughter polyps, and coral zooids have no <a href="coelom">coelom</a> or <a href="lophophore">lophophore</a>.

<a href="Entoprocta">Entoprocts</a>, another phylum of filter-feeders, look rather like bryozoans but their <a href="lophophore">lophophore</a>-like feeding structure has solid tentacles, their <a href="anus">anus</a> lies inside rather than outside the base of the "crown" and they have no <a href="coelom">coelom</a>.

All bryozoans are colonial except for one <a href="genus">genus</a>, "<a href="Monobryozoon">Monobryozoon</a>". Individual members of a bryozoan colony are about long and are known as "zooids", since they are not fully independent animals. All colonies contain feeding zooids, known as autozooids, and those of some groups also contain non-feeding specialist heterozooids; colony members are genetically identical and co-operate, rather like the organs of larger animals. What type of zooid grows where in a colony is determined by chemical signals from the colony as a whole or sometimes in response to the scent of predators or rival colonies.

The bodies of all types have two main parts. The "cystid" consists of the body wall and whatever type of <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> is <a href="secretion">secreted</a> by the <a href="Epidermis%20%28zoology%29">epidermis</a>. The exoskeleton may be organic (<a href="chitin">chitin</a>, <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a> or <a href="protein">protein</a>) or made of the mineral <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>. The body wall consists of the epidermis, <a href="basal%20lamina">basal lamina</a> (a mat of non-cellular material), <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a>, muscles, and the <a href="mesothelium">mesothelium</a> which lines the <a href="coelom">coelom</a> (main body cavity) – except that in one <a href="class%20%28biology%29">class</a>, the mesothelium is split into two separate layers, the inner one forming a membranous sac that floats freely and contains the coelom, and the outer one attached to the body wall and enclosing the membranous sac in a <a href="pseudocoelom">pseudocoelom</a>. The other main part of the bryozoan body, known as the "polypide" and situated almost entirely within the cystid, contains the nervous system, digestive system, some specialized muscles and the feeding apparatus or other specialized organs that take the place of the feeding apparatus.

The Bryozoa, known as "moss animals", currently contain about 5,000 known species. The different species can come together to form a colony that can attach to different kind of rock surfaces as well as shells and algae. Of the 5,000 species the 125 that have the most abundant population are known to attach themselves to the bottom of boats, pilings, piers and docks. These species are thought to be nuisance to boaters because they slow down the ship if they are attached to the bottom of the hull. However, there are species which have chemical compounds that can be used for medicine. One common species of the bryozoan is used for a serious anti cancer drug that is currently being used for testing.

The most common type of zooid is the feeding autozooid, in which the polypide bears a "crown" of hollow tentacles called a <a href="lophophore">lophophore</a>, which captures food particles from the water. In all colonies a large percentage of zooids are autozooids, and some consist entirely of autozooids, some of which also engage in reproduction.

The basic shape of the "crown" is a full circle. In the <a href="class%20%28biology%29">class</a> <a href="Phylactolaemata">Phylactolaemata</a> the crown appears U-shaped, but this impression is created by a deep dent in the rim of the crown, which has no gap in the fringe of tentacles. The sides of the tentacles bear fine hairs called <a href="cilia">cilia</a>, whose beating drives a water current from the tips of the tentacles to their bases, where it exits. Food particles that collide with the tentacles are trapped by <a href="mucus">mucus</a>, and further cilia on the inner surfaces of the tentacles convey the particles towards the mouth, which lies in the center of the base of the "crown". The method used by ectoprocts is known as "upstream collecting", as food particles are captured before they pass through the field of cilia that creates the feeding current. This method is also used by <a href="phoronid">phoronid</a>s, <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s and <a href="pterobranch">pterobranch</a>s.

The lophophore and mouth are mounted on a flexible tube, called the "invert" because it can be turned inside-out and withdrawn into the polypide, rather like the finger of a rubber glove; in this position the lophophore lies inside the invert and is folded like the spokes of an umbrella. The invert is withdrawn, sometimes within 60 <a href="millisecond">millisecond</a>s, by a pair of retractor muscles that are anchored at the far end of the cystid. Sensors at the tips of the tentacles may check for signs of danger before the invert and lophophore are fully extended. Extension is driven by an increase in internal fluid pressure, which species with flexible exoskeletons produce by contracting circular muscles that lie just inside the body wall, while species with a membranous sac use circular muscles to squeeze this. Some species with rigid exoskeletons have a flexible membrane that replaces part of the exoskeleton, and transverse muscles anchored on the far side of the exoskeleton increase the fluid pressure by pulling the membrane inwards. In others there is no gap in the protective skeleton, and the transverse muscles pull on a flexible sac which is connected to the water outside by a small pore; the expansion of the sac increases the pressure inside the body and pushes the invert and lophophore out. In some species the retracted invert and lophophore are protected by an operculum ("lid"), which is closed by muscles and opened by fluid pressure. In one <a href="class%20%28biology%29">class</a>, a hollow lobe called the "epistome" overhands the mouth.

The gut is U-shaped, running from the mouth, in the center of the lophophore, down into the animal's interior and then back to the <a href="anus">anus</a>, which is located on the invert, outside and usually below the lophophore. A network of strands of <a href="mesothelium">mesothelium</a> called "funiculi" ("little ropes") connects the mesothelium covering the gut with that lining the body wall. The wall of each strand is made of mesothelium, and surrounds a space filled with fluid, thought to be blood. A colony's zooids are connected, enabling autozooids to share food with each other and with any non-feeding heterozooids. The method of connection varies between the different classes of bryozoans, ranging from quite large gaps in the body walls to small pores through which nutrients are passed by funiculi.

There is a nerve ring round the pharynx (throat) and a <a href="ganglion">ganglion</a> that serves as a brain to one side of this. Nerves run from the ring and ganglion to the tentacles and to the rest of the body. Bryozoans have no specialized sense organs, but <a href="cilia">cilia</a> on the tentacles act as sensors. Members of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Bugula">Bugula</a>" <a href="phototropism">grow towards the sun</a>, and therefore must be able to detect light. In colonies of some species, signals are transmitted between zooids through nerves that pass through pores in the body walls, and coordinate activities such as feeding and the retraction of lophophores.

The solitary individuals of "Monobryozoon" are autozooids with pear-shaped bodies. The wider ends have up to 15 short, muscular projections by which the animals anchor themselves to sand or gravel and pull themselves through the sediments.

Some authorities use the term "avicularia" (pl. of "<a href="avicularium">avicularium</a>") to refer to any type of zooid in which the lophophore is replaced by an extension that serves some protective function, while others restrict the term to those that defend the colony by snapping at invaders and small predators, killing some and biting the <a href="appendage">appendage</a>s of others. In some species the snapping zooids are mounted on a peduncle (stalk), their bird-like appearance responsible for the term – <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> described these as like "the head and beak of a vulture in miniature, seated on a neck and capable of movement". Stalked avicularia are placed upside-down on their stalks. The "lower jaws" are modified versions of the opercula that protect the retracted lophophores in autozooids of some species, and are snapped shut "like a mousetrap" by similar muscles, while the beak-shaped upper jaw is the inverted body wall. In other species the avicularia are stationary box-like zooids laid the normal way up, so that the modified operculum snaps down against the body wall. In both types the modified operculum is opened by other muscles that attach to it, or by internal muscles that raise the fluid pressure by pulling on a flexible membrane. The actions of these snapping zooids are controlled by small, highly modified polypides that are located inside the "mouth" and bear tufts of short sensory <a href="cilia">cilia</a>. These zooids appear in various positions: some take the place of autozooids, some fit into small gaps between autozooids, and small avicularia may occur on the surfaces of other zooids.

In vibracula, regarded by some as a type of avicularia, the operculum is modified to form a long bristle that has a wide range of motion. They may function as defenses against predators and invaders, or as cleaners. In some species that form mobile colonies, vibracula around the edges are used as legs for burrowing and walking.

Kenozooids (from Greek κενος meaning "empty") consist only of the body wall and funicular strands crossing the interior, and no polypide. In some species they form the stems of branching structures, while in others they act as spacers that enable colonies to grow quickly in a new direction.

Spinozooids form defensive spines, and sometimes appear on top of autozooids. Gonozooids act as brood chambers for fertilized eggs. Some species have miniature nanozooids with small single-tentacled polypides, and these may grow on other zooids or within the body walls of autozooids that have degenerated.

Although zooids are microscopic, colonies range in size from to over . However, the majority are under across. The shapes of colonies vary widely, depend on the pattern of budding by which they grow, the variety of zooids present and the type and amount of skeletal material they <a href="secretion">secrete</a>.

Some marine species are bush-like or fan-like, supported by "trunks" and "branches" formed by kenozooids, with feeding autozooids growing from these. Colonies of these types are generally <a href="biomineralization">unmineralized</a> but may have <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>s made of <a href="chitin">chitin</a>. Others look like small <a href="coral">coral</a>s, producing heavy lime skeletons. Many species form colonies which consist of sheets of autozooids. These sheets may form leaves, tufts or, in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Thalmoporella">Thalmoporella</a>", structures that resemble an open head of lettuce.

The most common marine form, however, is encrusting, in which a one-layer sheet of zooids spreads over a hard surface or over seaweed. Some encrusting colonies may grow to over and contain about 2,000,000 zooids. These species generally have exoskeletons reinforced with <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>, and the openings through which the lophophores protrude are on the top or outer surface. The moss-like appearance of encrusting colonies is responsible for the phylum's name (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words βρυος "bryos" meaning "moss" and ζωον "zoon" meaning "animal"). Large colonies of encrusting species often have "<a href="chimney">chimney</a>s", gaps in the canopy of lophophores, through which they swiftly expel water that has been sieved, and thus avoid re-filtering water that is already exhausted. They are formed by patches of non-feeding heterozooids. New chimneys appear near the edges of expanding colonies, at points where the speed of the outflow is already high, and do not change position if the water flow changes.

Some freshwater species secrete a mass of gelatinous material, up to in diameter, to which the zooids stick. Other freshwater species have plant-like shapes with "trunks" and "branches", which may stand erect or spread over the surface. A few species can creep at about per day.

Each colony grows by <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexual</a> <a href="budding">budding</a> from a single zooid known as the ancestrula, which is round rather than shaped like a normal zooid. This occurs at the tips of "trunks" or "branches" in forms that have this structure. Encrusting colonies grow round their edges. In species with <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> exoskeletons, these do not mineralize until the zooids are fully grown. Colony lifespans range from one to about 12 years, and the short-lived species pass though several generations in one season.

Species that produce defensive zooids do so only when threats have already appeared, and may do so within 48 hours. The theory of "induced defenses" suggests that production of defenses is expensive and that colonies which defend themselves too early or too heavily will have reduced growth rates and lifespans. This "last minute" approach to defense is feasible because the loss of zooids to a single attack is unlikely to be significant. Colonies of some encrusting species also produce special heterozooids to limit the expansion of other encrusting organisms, especially other bryozoans. In some cases this response is more belligerent if the opposition is smaller, which suggests that zooids on the edge of a colony can somehow sense the size of the opponent. Some species consistently prevail against certain others, but most <a href="wikt%3Aturf%20war">turf war</a>s are indecisive and the combatants soon turn to growing in uncontested areas. Bryozoans competing for territory do not use the sophisticated techniques employed by <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s or <a href="coral">coral</a>s, possibly because the shortness of bryozoan lifespans makes heavy investment in turf wars unprofitable.

Bryozoans have contributed to carbonate sedimentation in marine life since the Ordovician period. Bryozoans take responsibility for many of the colony forms, which have evolved in different taxonomic groups and vary in sediment producing ability. The nine basic bryozoan colony-forms include: encrusting, dome-shaped, palmate, foliose, fenestrate, robust branching, delicate branching, articulated and free-living. Most of these sediments come from two distinct groups of colonies: domal, delicate branching, robust branching and palmate; and fenestrate. Fenestrate colonies generate rough particles both as sediment and components of stomatoporiods coral reefs. The delicate colonies however, create both coarse sediment and form the cores of deep-water, subphotic biogenic mounds. Nearly all post- bryozoan sediments are made up of growth forms, with the addition to free-living colonies which include significant numbers of various colonies. “In contrast to the Palaeozoic, post-Palaeozoic bryozoans generated sediment varying more widely with the size of their grains; they grow as they moved from mud, to sand, to gravel.”

The phylum was originally called "Polyzoa", but this name was soon replaced by Ehrenberg's term "Bryozoa". The name "Bryozoa" was originally applied only to the animals also known as "Ectoprocta", in which the <a href="anus">anus</a> lies outside the "crown" of tentacles (based on the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> prefix ἐκτο meaning "outside" and word πρωκτος meaning "anus"). After the discovery of the <a href="Entoprocta">Entoprocta</a>, in which the anus lies within a "crown" of tentacles (based on the Ancient Greek prefix ἐντο meaning "inside" and word πρωκτος meaning "anus"), the name "Bryozoa" was used at <a href="phylum">phylum</a> level to include the two <a href="class%20%28biology%29">classes</a> Ectoprocta and Entoprocta. However, in 1869 Hinrich Nitsche regarded the two groups as quite distinct for a variety of reasons, and coined the name "Ectoprocta" for Ehrenberg's "Bryozoa". Despite their apparently similar methods of feeding, they differed markedly anatomically; in addition to the different positions of the anus, ectoprocts have hollow tentacles and a <a href="coelom">coelom</a>, while entoprocts have solid tentacles and no coelom. Hence the two groups are now widely regarded as separate phyla, and the name "Bryozoa" is now synonymous with "Ectoprocta". This has remained the majority view ever since, although most publications have preferred the name "Bryozoa" rather than "Ectoprocta". Nevertheless, some notable scientists have continued to regard the "Ectoprocta" and Entoprocta as close relatives and group them under "Bryozoa".

The ambiguity about the scope of the name "Bryozoa" led to proposals in the 1960s and 1970s that it should be avoided and the unambiguous term "Ectoprocta" should be used. However, the change would have made it harder to find older works about in which the phylum was called "Bryozoa", and the desire to avoid ambiguity, if applied consistently to all classifications, would have necessitated renaming of several other phyla and many lower-level groups. In practice, zoological naming of split or merged groups of animals is complex and not completely consistent. Works since 2000 have used various names to resolve the ambiguity, including: "Bryozoa", "Ectoprocta", "Bryozoa (Ectoprocta)", and "Ectoprocta (Bryozoa)". Some have used more than one approach in the same work.

The common name "moss animals" is based on the Greek βρυόν (moss) and ζῷα (animals), and refers to the mossy appearance of encrusting species.
Up until recently (2008) there were "inadequately known and misunderstood type species belonging to the Cyclostome Bryozoan family Oncousoeciidae." (Taylor, Zaton 2008) Modern research and experiments have been done using low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy of uncoated type material to critically examine and perhaps revise the taxonomy of three genera belonging to this family, including "Oncousoecia", "Microeciella", and "Eurystrotos". This method permits data to be obtained that would be difficult to recognize with an optical microscope. The valid type species of "Oncousoecia" was found to be "Oncousoecia lobulata". This interpretation stabilizes "Oncousoecia" by establishing a type species that corresponds to the general usage of the genus. Fellow Oncousoeciid "Eurystrotos" is now believed to be not conspecific with "O. lobulata", as previously suggested, but shows enough similarities to be considered a junior synonym of "Oncousoecia". "Microeciella suborbicularus" has also been recently distinguished from "O. lobulata" and "O. dilatans", using this modern method of low vacuum scanning, with which it has been inaccurately synonymized with in the past. A new genus has also been recently discovered called "Junerossia" in the family Stomachetosellidae, along with 10 relatively new species of bryozoa such as "Alderina flaventa", "Corbulella extenuata", "Puellina septemcryptica", "Junerossia copiosa", "Calyptotheca kapaaensis", "Bryopesanser serratus", "Cribellopora souleorum", "Metacleidochasma verrucosa", "Disporella compta", and "Favosipora adunca".

Counts of formally described species range between 4,000 and 4,500. The Gymnolaemata and especially Cheilostomata have the greatest numbers of species, possibly because of their wide range of specialist zooids. Under the <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">Linnaean system of classification</a>, which is still used as a convenient way to label groups of organisms, living members of the <a href="phylum">phylum</a> Bryozoa are divided into:

Fossils of about 15,000 bryozoan species have been found. Bryozoans are among the three dominant groups of Paleozoic fossils. The oldest species with a <a href="biomineralization">mineralized</a> skeleton occurs in the Lower Ordovician. It is likely that the first bryozoans appeared much earlier and were entirely soft-bodied, and the Ordovician fossils record the appearance of mineralized skeletons in this phylum. By the Arenigian stage of the Early <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a>, about , all the modern <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">orders</a> of <a href="Stenolaemata">stenolaemates</a> were present, and the <a href="Ctenostomata">ctenostome</a> order of <a href="Gymnolaemata">gymnolaemates</a> had appeared by the Middle Ordovician, about . The Early Ordovician fossils may also represent forms that had already become significantly different from the original members of the phylum. Ctenostomes with phosphatized soft tissue are known from the Devonian. Other types of <a href="filter%20feeder">filter feeder</a>s appeared around the same time, which suggests that some change made the environment more favorable for this lifestyle. Fossils of <a href="Cheilostomata">cheilostomates</a>, another order of gymnolaemates, first appear in the Mid <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a>, about , and these have been the most abundant and diverse bryozoans from the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> to the present. Evidence compiled from the last 100 million years show that cheilostomates consistently grew over cyclostomates in territorial struggles, which may help to explain how cheilostomates replaced cyclostomates as the dominant marine bryozoans. Marine fossils from the <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> era, which ended , are mainly of erect forms, those from the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> are fairly equally divided by erect and encrusting forms, and more recent ones are predominantly encrusting. Fossils of the soft, freshwater <a href="Phylactolaemata">phylactolaemates</a> are very rare, appear in and after the Late Permian (which began about ) and consist entirely of their durable statoblasts. There are no known fossils of freshwater members of other classes.

Scientists are divided about whether the Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) are a <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> group (whether they include all and only a single ancestor species and all its descendants), about what are the phylum's closest relatives in the family tree of animals, and even about whether they should be regarded as members of the <a href="protostome">protostome</a>s or <a href="deuterostome">deuterostome</a>s, the two major groups that account for all moderately complex animals.

The traditional view is that the Bryozoa are a monophyletic group, in which the <a href="class%20%28biology%29">class</a> <a href="Phylactolaemata">Phylactolaemata</a> is most closely related to <a href="Stenolaemata">Stenolaemata</a> and <a href="Ctenostomata">Ctenostomata</a>, the classes that appear earliest in the fossil record. However, in 2005 a <a href="molecular%20phylogeny">molecular phylogeny</a> study that focused on phylactolaemates concluded that these are more closely related to the phylum <a href="Phoronid">Phoronid</a>a, and especially to the only phoronid species that is colonial, than they are to the other ectoproct classes. That implies that the Entoprocta are not monophyletic, as the Phoronida are a sub-group of ectoprocts but the standard definition of Entoprocta excludes the Phoronida. In 2009 another <a href="molecular%20phylogeny">molecular phylogeny</a> study, using a combination of genes from <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> and the <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a>, concluded that Bryozoa is a <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> phylum, in other words includes all the descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a bryozoan. The analysis also concluded that the <a href="class%20%28biology%29">classes</a> <a href="Phylactolaemata">Phylactolaemata</a>, <a href="Stenolaemata">Stenolaemata</a> and <a href="Gymnolaemata">Gymnolaemata</a> are also monophyletic, but could not determine whether <a href="Stenolaemata">Stenolaemata</a> are more closely related to Phylactolaemata or <a href="Gymnolaemata">Gymnolaemata</a>. The Gymnolaemata are traditionally divided into the soft-bodied <a href="Ctenostomata">Ctenostomata</a> and <a href="biomineralization">mineralized</a> Cheilostomata, but the 2009 analysis considered it more likely that neither of these <a href="order%20%28biology%29">orders</a> is monophyletic and that mineralized <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>s probably evolved more than once within the early Gymnolaemata.

Bryozoans' relationships with other phyla are uncertain and controversial. Traditional phylogeny, based on <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a> and on the development of the adult forms from <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s, has produced no enduring consensus about the position of ectoprocts. Attempts to reconstruct the family tree of animals have largely ignored ectoprocts and other "minor phyla", which have received little scientific study because they are generally tiny, have relatively simple body plans, and have little impact on human economies – despite the fact that the "minor phyla" include most of the variety in the evolutionary history of animals. In the opinion of Ruth Dewel, Judith Winston and Frank McKinney, "Our standard interpretation of bryozoan <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> and <a href="embryology">embryology</a> is a construct resulting from over 100 years of attempts to synthesize a single framework for all invertebrates," and takes little account of some peculiar features of ectoprocts. In ectoprocts, all of the larva's internal organs are destroyed during the metamorphosis to the adult form and the adult's organs are built from the larva's <a href="Epidermis%20%28skin%29">epidermis</a> and <a href="mesoderm">mesoderm</a>, while in other <a href="bilateria">bilateria</a>ns some organs including the gut are built from <a href="endoderm">endoderm</a>. In most bilaterian embryos the blastopore, a dent in the outer wall, deepens to become the larva's gut, but in ectoprocts the blastopore disappears and a new dent becomes the point from which the gut grows. The ectoproct coelom is formed by neither of the processes used by other bilaterians, <a href="enterocoely">enterocoely</a>, in which pouches that form on the wall of the gut become separate cavities, nor <a href="schizocoely">schizocoely</a>, in which the tissue between the gut and the body wall splits, forming paired cavities.

Molecular phylogeny, which attempts to work out the evolutionary family tree of organisms by comparing their <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a> and especially their <a href="gene">gene</a>s, has done much to clarify the relationships between the better-known <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> phyla. However, the shortage of genetic data about "minor phyla" such as bryozoans and <a href="Entoprocta">entoprocts</a> has left their relationships to other groups unclear.

When entoprocts were discovered in the 19th century, they and bryozoans (ectoprocts) were regarded as classes within the phylum Bryozoa, because both groups were <a href="Sessility%20%28zoology%29">sessile</a> animals that <a href="filter%20feeder">filter-fed</a> by means of a crown of tentacles that bore <a href="cilia">cilia</a>. However, from 1869 onwards increasing awareness of differences, including the position of the entoproct <a href="anus">anus</a> inside the feeding structure and the difference in the early <a href="Cleavage%20%28embryo%29">pattern of division</a> of cells in their <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s, caused scientists to regard the two groups as separate phyla, and "Bryozoa" became just an alternative name for ectoprocts, in which the anus is outside the feeding organ. A series of molecular phylogeny studies from 1996 to 2006 have also concluded that bryozoans (ectoprocts) and entoprocts are not sister groups. However, two well-known zoologists, Claus Nielsen and <a href="Thomas%20Cavalier-Smith">Thomas Cavalier-Smith</a>, maintain on anatomical and developmental grounds that bryozoans and entoprocts are member of the same phylum, Bryozoa. A molecular phylogeny study in 2007 also supported this old idea, while its conclusions about other phyla agreed with those of several other analyses.

By 1891 bryozoans (ectoprocts) were grouped with <a href="phoronid">phoronid</a>s in a super-phylum called "Tentaculata". In the 1970s comparisons between phoronid larvae and the <a href="cyphonautes">cyphonautes</a> larva of some gymnolaete bryozoans produced suggestions that the bryozoans, most of which are colonial, evolved from a semi-colonial species of phoronid. <a href="Brachiopod">Brachiopod</a>s were also assigned to the "Tentaculata", which were renamed <a href="Lophophorata">Lophophorata</a> as they all use a <a href="lophophore">lophophore</a> for filter feeding. Although the majority of scientists accept this, Claus Nielsen thinks these similarities are superficial. The Lophophorata are usually defined as animals with a lophophore, a three-part coelom and a U-shaped gut. In Nielsen's opinion, phoronids' and brachiopods' lophophores are more like those of <a href="pterobranch">pterobranch</a>s, which are members of the phylum <a href="Hemichordata">Hemichordata</a>. Bryozoan's tentacles bear cells with multiple <a href="cilia">cilia</a>, while the corresponding cells of phoronids', brachiopods' and pterobranchs' lophophores have one cilium per cell; and bryozoan tentacles have no hemal canal ("blood vessel"), which those of the other three phyla have.

If the grouping of bryozoans with phoronids and brachiopods into Lophophorata is correct, the next issue is whether the Lophophorata are <a href="protostome">protostome</a>s, along with most invertebrate phyla, or <a href="deuterostome">deuterostome</a>s, along with <a href="chordate">chordate</a>s, <a href="hemichordate">hemichordate</a>s and <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>s. The traditional view was that lophophorates were a mix of protostome and deuterostome features. Research from the 1970s onwards suggested they were deuterostomes, because of some features that were thought characteristic of deuterostomes: a three-part coelom; radial rather than spiral cleavage in the development of the embryo; and formation of the coelom by <a href="enterocoely">enterocoely</a>. However the coelom of ectoproct larvae shows no sign of division into three sections, and that of adult ectoprocts is different from that of other <a href="coelomate">coelomate</a> phyla as it is built anew from epidermis and mesoderm after metamorphosis has destroyed the larval coelom.

Molecular phylogeny analyses from 1995 onwards, using a variety of biochemical evidence and analytical techniques, placed the lophophorates as protostomes and closely related to <a href="annelid">annelid</a>s and <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s in a super-phylum called <a href="Lophotrochozoa">Lophotrochozoa</a>. "Total evidence" analyses, which used both morphological features and a relatively small set of genes, came to various conclusions, mostly favoring a close relationship between lophophorates and Lophotrochozoa. A study in 2008, using a larger set of genes, concluded that the lophophorates were closer to the Lophotrochozoa than to deuterostomes, but also that the lophophorates were not monophyletic. Instead, it concluded that brachiopods and phoronids formed a monophyletic group, but bryozoans (ectoprocts) were closest to entoprocts, supporting the original definition of "Bryozoa".

They are also the only major phylum of exclusively clonal animals and are all colonial. They are colonies of modular units known as zooids. Because they thrive in colonies, colonial growth allows them to develop unrestricted variations in form. Despite this, only a small number of basic growth forms have been found and have commonly reappeared throughout the history of the bryozoa.

The phylogenetic position of the ectoproct bryozoans remains uncertain, but it remains certain that they belong to the Protostomia and more specifically to the Lophoctrochozoa. This implies that the ectoproct larva is a trochophore with the corona being a homologue of the prototroch; this is supported from the similarity between the coronate larvae and the Type 1 pericalymma larvae of some molluscs and sipunculans, where the prototroch zone is expanded to cover the hyposphere.

A study of the mitochondrial DNA sequence suggests that the Bryozoa may be related to the <a href="Chaetognatha">Chaetognatha</a>.

Most species are <a href="filter%20feeder">filter feeder</a>s that sieve small particles, mainly <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> (microscopic floating plants), out of the water. The freshwater species "<a href="Plumatella%20emarginata">Plumatella emarginata</a>" feeds on <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s, <a href="green%20algae">green algae</a>, <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, non-<a href="photosynthetic">photosynthetic</a> bacteria, <a href="dinoflagellate">dinoflagellate</a>s, <a href="rotifer">rotifer</a>s, <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>, small <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s, and microscopic <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s. While the currents that bryozoans generate to draw food towards the mouth are well understood, the exact method of capture is still debated. All species also flick larger particles towards the mouth with a tentacle, and a few capture <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a> (planktonic animals) by using their tentacles as cages. In addition the tentacles, whose surface area is increased by <a href="microvilli">microvilli</a> (small hairs and pleats), absorb <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s dissolved in the water. Unwanted particles may be flicked away by tentacles or shut out by closing the mouth. A study in 2008 showed that both encrusting and erect colonies fed more quickly and grew faster in gentle than in strong currents.

In some species the first part of the stomach forms a muscular <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a> lined with <a href="chitin">chitin</a>ous teeth that crush armored prey such as <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s. Wave-like <a href="peristalsis">peristaltic</a> contractions move the food through the stomach for digestion. The final section of the stomach is lined with <a href="cilia">cilia</a> (minute hairs) that compress undigested solids, which then pass through the <a href="intestine">intestine</a> and out through the <a href="anus">anus</a>.

There are no <a href="nephridia">nephridia</a> ("little kidneys") or other <a href="excretory%20system">excretory</a> organs in bryozoa, and it is thought that <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> <a href="molecular%20diffusion">diffuses</a> out through the body wall and lophophore. More complex waste products are not excreted but accumulate in the <a href="polypide">polypide</a>, which degenerates after a few weeks. Some of the old polypide is recycled, but much of it remains as a large mass of dying cells containing accumulated wastes, and this is compressed into a "brown body". When the degeneration is complete, the cystid (outer part of the animal) produces a new polypide, and the brown body remains in the <a href="coelom">coelom</a>, or in the stomach of the new polypide and is expelled next time the animal <a href="defecate">defecate</a>s.

There are no respiratory organs, <a href="heart">heart</a> or <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s. instead zooids absorb oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide through diffusion. Bryozoa accomplish diffusion through the use of either a thin membrane (in the case of anascans and some polyzoa) or through psudopores located on the outer dermis of the zooid. The different bryozoan groups use various methods to share nutrients and oxygen between zooids: some have quite large gaps in the body walls, allowing the <a href="Coelom%23Coelomic%20fluid">coelomic fluid</a> to circulate freely; in others the funiculi (internal "little ropes") of adjacent zooids connect via small pores in the body wall.

Zooids of all phylactolaemate species are simultaneous <a href="hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a>s. Although those of many marine species are protandric, in other words function first as males and then as females, their colonies contain a combination of zooids that are in their male and female stages. In all species the <a href="ovary">ovaries</a> develop on the inside of the body wall, and the <a href="testes">testes</a> on the funiculus connecting the stomach to the body wall. Eggs and sperm are released into the coelom, and sperm exit into the water through pores in the tips of some of the tentacles, and then are captured by the feeding currents of zooids that are producing eggs. Some species' eggs are fertilized externally after being released through a pore between two tentacles, which in some cases is at the tip of a small projection called the "intertentacular organ" in the base of a pair of tentacles. Others' are fertilized internally, in the intertentacular organ or in the coelom. In ctenostomes the mother provides a brood chamber for the fertilized eggs, and her polypide disintegrates, providing nourishment to the <a href="embryo">embryo</a>. Stenolaemates produce specialized zooids to serve as brood chambers, and their eggs divide within this to produce up to 100 identical embryos.

The <a href="Cleavage%20%28embryo%29">cleavage</a> of bryozoan eggs is biradial, in other words the early stages are bilaterally symmetrical. It is unknown how the coleom forms, since the <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> from <a href="larva">larva</a> to adult destroys all of the larva's internal tissues. In many animals the <a href="blastopore">blastopore</a>, an opening in the surface of the early embryo, tunnels through to form the gut. However, in bryozoans the blastopore closes, and a new opening develops to create the mouth.

Bryozoan larvae vary in form, but all have a band of cilia round the body which enables them to swim, a tuft of cilia at the top, and an adhesive sac that everts and anchors them when they settle on a surface. Some gymnolaemate species produce cyphonautes larvae which have little yolk but a well-developed mouth and gut, and live as <a href="plankton">plankton</a> for a considerable time before settling. These larvae have triangular shells of chitin, with one corner at the top and the base open, forming a hood round the downward-facing mouth. In 2006 it was reported that the cilia of cyphonautes larvae use the same range of techniques as those of adults to capture food. Species that brood their embryos form larvae that are nourished by large <a href="yolk">yolk</a>s, have no gut and do not feed, and such larvae quickly settle on a surface. In all marine species the larvae produce cocoons in which they <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphose</a> completely after settling: the larva's <a href="Epidermis%20%28skin%29">epidermis</a> becomes the lining of the <a href="coelom">coelom</a>, and the internal tissues are converted to a food reserve that nourishes the developing zooid until it is ready to feed. The larvae of phylactolaemates produce multiple polypides, so that each new colony starts with several zooids. In all species the founder zooids then grow the new colonies by <a href="budding">budding</a> <a href="Cloning">clones</a> of themselves. In phylactolaemates, zooids die after producing several clones, so that living zooids are found only round the edges of a colony.

Phylactolaemates also reproduce asexually by a method that enables a colony's lineage to survive the variable and uncertain conditions of freshwater environments. Throughout summer and autumn they produce disc-shaped statoblasts, masses of cells that function as "survival pods" rather like the <a href="Sponge%23Asexual">gemmules of sponges</a>. Statoblasts form on the funiculus connected to the parent's gut, which nourishes them. As they grow, statoblasts develop protective <a href="Bivalve%20shell">bivalve-like</a> shells made of <a href="chitin">chitin</a>. When they mature, some statoblasts stick to the parent colony, some fall to the bottom ("sessoblasts"), some contain air spaces that enable them to float ("floatoblasts"), and some remain in the parent's cystid to re-build the colony if it dies. Statoblasts can remain dormant for considerable periods, and while dormant can survive harsh conditions such as freezing and <a href="desiccation">desiccation</a>. They can be transported across long distances by animals, floating vegetation, currents and winds, and even in the guts of larger animals. When conditions improve, the valves of the shell separate and the cells inside develop into a zooid that tries to form a new colony. "<a href="Plumatella%20emarginata">Plumatella emarginata</a>" produces both "sessoblasts", which enable the lineage to control a good territory even if hard times decimate the parent colonies, and "floatoblasts", which spread to new sites. New colonies of "<a href="Plumatella%20repens">Plumatella repens</a>" produce mainly "sessoblasts" while mature ones switch to "floatoblasts". A study estimated that one group of colonies in a patch measuring produced 800,000 statoblasts.
Cupuladriid Bryozoa are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. The sexually reproducing colonies (aclonal) are the result of a larval cupuladriid growing into an adult stage whereas the asexual colonies(clonal) are a result of a fragment of a colony of cupuladriids growing into its own colony. The different forms of reproduction in cupuladriids are achieved through a variety of methods depending on the morphology and classification of the zooid.

Most marine species live in tropical waters at depths less than . However, a few have been found in deep-sea <a href="Oceanic%20trench">trenches</a>, especially around <a href="cold%20seep">cold seep</a>s, and others near the <a href="Geographical%20pole">poles</a>. The great majority are <a href="Sessility%20%28zoology%29">sessile</a>. Encrusting forms are much the commonest of these in shallow seas, but erect forms become more common as the depth increases. A few forms such as <a href="Cristatella">Cristatella</a> can move, and an <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> species, Alcyonidium pelagosphaera, consists of floating colonies. The pelagic species is between 5.0 and 23.0 mm in diameter, has the shape of a hollow sphere and consists of a single layer of autozooids. It is still not known if these colonies are pelagic their whole life or only represents a temporarily and previously undescribed juvenile stage.

In 2014 it was reported that the bryozoan "<a href="Fenestrulina%20rugula">Fenestrulina rugula</a>" had become a dominant species in parts of Antarctica. <a href="Global%20warming">Global warming</a> has increased the rate of scouring by <a href="iceberg">iceberg</a>s, and this species is particularly adept at recolonizing scoured areas.

The phylactolaemates live in all types of freshwater environment – lakes and ponds, rivers and streams, and estuaries
 – and are among the most abundant sessile freshwater animals. Some ctenostomes are exclusively freshwater while others prefer brackish water but can survive in freshwater. Scientists' knowledge of freshwater bryozoan populations in many parts of the world is incomplete, even in some parts of Europe. It was long thought that some freshwater species occurred worldwide, but since 2002 all of these have been split into more localized species.

Bryozoans are an immobile species typically residing on hard natural stone including, but not limited to: grains, shells, and rocks. Such sediment is customarily found in freshwater type marine niches, although a majority of Bryozoans develop in marine landscapes. It is not uncommon for colonies to grow on sediment and various other solid pseudo-rock formations. They are native to all five oceans making them a more cosmopolitan species.

Bryozoans are generally associated with the term colonies. Once a Bryozoa settles on a hard substance, after its larval phase, it is physically capable of reproducing asexually through budding. The term colony literally stems from the word clones. These colonies can grow thousands of individual zooids in a relatively short period of time. Even though colonies of zooids grow through asexual reproduction, Bryozoans are hermaphrodites and colonies are started through sexual reproduction. When colonies grow too large, however, they can split in two. This is the only case where asexual reproduction results in a new colony separate from its predecessor. Most colonies are stationary. Indeed, these colonies tend to be settled on immobile substances such as sediment and coarse substances. There are, in fact, other colonies, that predominantly reside in freshwater, that are able to move to a new locale; nevertheless, this movement is extremely slow, maximum 1 meter per hour, and demands energy.

Marine species are common on <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s, but seldom a significant proportion of the total <a href="biomass">biomass</a>. In temperate waters, the skeletons of dead colonies form a significant component of shell <a href="gravel">gravel</a>s, and live ones are abundant in these areas. The marine lace-like bryozoan "<a href="Membranipora%20membranacea">Membranipora membranacea</a>" produces spines in response to predation by several species of <a href="nudibranch">nudibranch</a>s ("sea slugs"). Other predators on marine bryozoans include fish, <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, <a href="pycnogonid">pycnogonid</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="mite">mite</a>s and <a href="starfish">starfish</a>. In general marine <a href="echinoderms">echinoderms</a> and <a href="molluscs">molluscs</a> eat masses of zooids by gouging pieces of colonies, breaking their mineralized "houses", while most <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a> predators on bryozoans eat individual zooids.

In freshwater, bryozoans are among the most important <a href="filter%20feeder">filter feeder</a>s, along with <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s and <a href="mussel">mussel</a>s. Freshwater bryozoans are attacked by many predators, including snails, insects, and fish.

In <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> the <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a> "<a href="Pomacea%20canaliculata">Pomacea canaliculata</a>" (golden apple snail), which is generally a destructive <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>, has wiped out phylactolaemate populations wherever it has appeared. "P. canaliculata" also preys on a common freshwater gymnolaemate, but with less devastating effect. Indigenous snails do not feed on bryozoans.

Several species of the <a href="hydroid%20%28zoology%29">hydroid</a> family <a href="Zancleidae">Zancleidae</a> have symbiotic relationships with bryozoans, some of which are beneficial to the hydroids while others are <a href="parasite">parasitic</a>. Modifications appear in the shapes of some these hydroids, for example smaller tentacles or encrustation of the roots by bryozoans. The bryozoan "<a href="Alcyonidium%20nodosum">Alcyonidium nodosum</a>" protects the <a href="whelk">whelk</a> "<a href="Burnupena%20papyracea">Burnupena papyracea</a>" against predation by the powerful and voracious <a href="rock%20lobster">rock lobster</a> "<a href="Jasus%20lalandii">Jasus lalandii</a>". While whelk shells encrusted by the bryozoans are stronger than those without this reinforcement, chemical defenses produced by the bryozoans are probably the more significant deterrent.
In the <a href="Banc%20d%27Arguin">Banc d'Arguin</a> offshore <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a> the species "<a href="Acanthodesia%20commensale">Acanthodesia commensale</a>", which is generally growing attached to gravel and hard-substrate, has formed a non-obligate symbiotic relationship with <a href="hermit%20crabs">hermit crabs</a> of the species "Pseudopagurus cf. granulimanus" resulting in egg-size structures known as bryoliths. Nucleating on an empty gastropod shell, the bryozoan colonies form multilamellar skeletal crusts that produce spherical encrustations and extend the living chamber of the hermit crab through helicospiral tubular growth.

Some phylactolaemate species are parasitized by a group of <a href="myxozoa">myxozoa</a> that have also been found to cause <a href="Proliferative%20Kidney%20Disease">Proliferative Kidney Disease</a>, which is often fatal in <a href="salmonid">salmonid</a> fish, and has severely reduced wild fish populations in Europe and North America.

"Membranipora membranacea", whose colonies feed and grow exceptionally fast in a wide range of current speeds, was first noticed in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Maine">Gulf of Maine</a> in 1987 and quickly became the most abundant organism living on <a href="kelp">kelp</a>s. This <a href="invasive%20species">invasion</a> reduced the kelp population by breaking their fronds, so that its place as the dominant "vegetation" in some areas was taken by another invader, the large <a href="alga">alga</a> "<a href="Codium%20fragile">Codium fragile</a> tomentosoides". These changes reduced the area of habitat available for local fish and invertebrates. "M. membranacea" has also invaded the northwest coast of the US A few freshwater species have been also found thousands of kilometers from their native ranges. Some may have been transported naturally as statoblasts. Others more probably were spread by humans, for example on imported water plants or as stowaways on ships.

<a href="Fish%20farms">Fish farms</a> and hatcheries have lost stock to <a href="Proliferative%20Kidney%20Disease">Proliferative Kidney Disease</a>, which is caused by one or more <a href="myxozoan">myxozoan</a>s that use bryozoans as alternate hosts.

Some fishermen in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> have had to find other work because of a form of <a href="eczema">eczema</a> (a skin disease) known as "<a href="Dogger%20Bank%20itch">Dogger Bank itch</a>", caused by contact with bryozoans that have stuck to nets and lobster pots.

Marine bryozoans are often responsible for <a href="biofouling">biofouling</a> on ships' hulls, on docks and marinas, and on offshore structures. They are among the first colonizers of new or recently cleaned structures. Freshwater species are occasional nuisances in water pipes, drinking water purification equipment, sewage treatment facilities, and the cooling pipes of power stations.

A group of chemicals called <a href="bryostatin">bryostatin</a>s can be extracted from the marine bryozoan "<a href="Bugula%20neritina">Bugula neritina</a>". In 2001 pharmaceutical company <a href="GPC%20Biotech">GPC Biotech</a> licensed Bryostatin 1 from <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a> for commercial development as a treatment for cancer. GPC Biotech canceled development in 2003, saying that Bryostatin 1 showed little effectiveness and some toxic side-effects. In January 2008 a <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a> was submitted to the United States <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> to measure the safety and effectiveness of Bryostatin 1 in the treatment of <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20Disease">Alzheimer's Disease</a>. However, no participants had been recruited by the end of December 2008, when the study was scheduled for completion. About of bryozoans must be processed to extract of bryostatin. As a result, synthetic equivalents have been developed that are simpler to produce and apparently at least as effective.

<doc id="3417" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3417" title="Biennial plant">
Biennial plant

A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its biological lifecycle. In the first year, the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures), then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette. Many biennials require a cold treatment, or <a href="vernalization">vernalization</a>, before they will flower. During the next <a href="spring%20%28season%29">spring</a> or <a href="summer%20%28season%29">summer</a>, the stem of the biennial plant elongates greatly, or "bolts". This typically makes biennial vegetables such as <a href="spinach">spinach</a>, <a href="fennel">fennel</a> and <a href="lettuce">lettuce</a> unusable as food. The plant then flowers, producing <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s and <a href="seed">seed</a>s before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either <a href="perennial%20plant">perennial plant</a>s or <a href="annual%20plant">annual plant</a>s.

Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its life cycle rapidly (e.g., in three months instead of two years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were vernalized before they were planted in the ground. This behavior leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas.

From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown for just one year (and not grown on a second year to run to seed).

Examples of biennial plants are members of the <a href="onion">onion</a> family including <a href="leek">leek</a>, some members of the <a href="cabbage">cabbage</a> family, <a href="Verbascum%20thapsus">common mullein</a>, <a href="parsley">parsley</a>, fennel, "<a href="Lunaria">Lunaria</a>", <a href="silverbeet">silverbeet</a>, <a href="Rudbeckia%20hirta">Black-eyed Susan</a>, <a href="Sweet%20William">Sweet William</a>, <a href="Aletris">colic weed</a>, <a href="carrot">carrot</a>, and some <a href="hollyhock">hollyhock</a>s. Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, for example, <a href="foxglove">foxglove</a> and <a href="Matthiola%20incana">stock</a>.

<doc id="3419" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3419" title="Bay leaf">
Bay leaf

Bay leaf (plural bay leaves) refers to the aromatic leaves of several plants used in cooking. These include:

The leaves contain about 1.3% essential oils (ol. lauri folii), consisting of 45% eucalyptol, 12% other terpenes, 8-12% terpinyl acetate, 3–4% sesquiterpenes, 3% methyleugenol, and other α- and β-pinenes, phellandrene, linalool, geraniol, and terpineol, contains lauric acid also.

If eaten whole, bay leaves ("Laurus nobilis") are pungent and have a sharp, bitter taste. As with many spices and flavorings, the fragrance of the bay leaf is more noticeable than its taste. When dried, the fragrance is herbal, slightly floral, and somewhat similar to <a href="oregano">oregano</a> and <a href="thyme">thyme</a>. <a href="Myrcene">Myrcene</a>, which is a component of many essential oils used in perfumery, can be extracted from the bay leaf. They also contain <a href="eugenol">eugenol</a>.

In Indian and Pakistani cuisine, bay laurel leaves are sometimes used in place of <a href="Cinnamomum%20tamala">Indian bay leaf</a>, although they have a different flavor. They are most often used in rice dishes like "<a href="biryani">biryani</a>" and as an ingredient in "<a href="garam%20masala">garam masala</a>". Bay (laurel) leaves are frequently packaged as "tejpatta" (the Hindi term for Indian bay leaf), creating confusion between the two herbs.

In the Philippines, dried bay laurel leaves are added as a spice in the Filipino dish Adobo.

Bay leaves were used for flavoring by the ancient Greeks. They are a fixture in the cooking of many European cuisines (particularly those of the Mediterranean), as well as in the Americas. They are used in soups, stews, meat, seafood, vegetable dishes, and sauces. The leaves also flavor many classic French dishes. The leaves are most often used whole (sometimes in a "<a href="bouquet%20garni">bouquet garni</a>") and removed before serving (they can be abrasive in the digestive tract). Thai cuisine employs bay leaf (Thai name "bai kra wan") in a few Arab-influenced dishes, notably <a href="massaman%20curry">massaman curry</a>.

Bay leaves can also be crushed or ground before cooking. Crushed bay leaves impart more fragrance than whole leaves, but are more difficult to remove, and thus they are often used in a muslin bag or tea infuser. Ground bay laurel may be substituted for whole leaves, and does not need to be removed, but it is much stronger.

Bay leaves can also be used scattered in a <a href="pantry">pantry</a> to repel <a href="meal%20moth">meal moth</a>s, flies, cockroaches, mice, and <a href="silverfish">silverfish</a>.

Bay leaves have been used in entomology as the active ingredient in <a href="killing%20jar">killing jar</a>s. The crushed, fresh, young leaves are put into the jar under a layer of paper. The vapors they release kill insects slowly but effectively, and keep the specimens relaxed and easy to mount. The leaves discourage the growth of molds. They are not effective for killing large beetles and similar specimens, but insects that have been killed in a cyanide killing jar can be transferred to a laurel jar to await mounting. There is confusion in the literature about whether "Laurus nobilis" is a source of cyanide to any practical extent, but there is no evidence that cyanide is relevant to its value in killing jars. It certainly is rich in various essential oil components that could incapacitate insects in high concentrations; such compounds include <a href="Eucalyptol">1,8-cineole</a>, alpha-terpinyl acetate, and <a href="methyl%20eugenol">methyl eugenol</a>. It also is unclear to what extent the alleged effect of cyanide released by the crushed leaves has been mis-attributed to "Laurus nobilis" in confusion with the unrelated "<a href="Prunus%20laurocerasus">Prunus laurocerasus</a>", the so-called cherry laurel, which certainly does contain dangerous concentrations of cyanogenic glycocides together with the enzymes to generate the <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a> from the glycocides if the leaf is physically damaged.

Some members of the laurel family, as well as the unrelated but visually similar <a href="Kalmia%20latifolia">mountain laurel</a> and <a href="Prunus%20laurocerasus">cherry laurel</a>, have leaves that are poisonous to humans and livestock. While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their visual similarity to bay leaves has led to the oft-repeated belief that bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous. This is not true — bay leaves may be eaten without toxic effect. However, they remain unpleasantly stiff even after thorough cooking, and if swallowed whole or in large pieces, they may pose a risk of harming the digestive tract or causing choking. There have been cases of intestinal perforations caused by swallowing bay leaves, so unless the leaves in the recipe have been ground they should be removed from the food before serving; otherwise the risk of a surgical emergency remains. Thus, most recipes that use bay leaves will recommend their removal after the cooking process has finished.

<doc id="3422" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3422" title="Burgess Shale">
Burgess Shale

The Burgess Shale is a <a href="fossil">fossil</a>-bearing deposit exposed in the <a href="Canadian%20Rockies">Canadian Rockies</a> of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Canada. It is famous for the exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils. At (<a href="Cambrian%20Stage%205">Middle Cambrian</a>) old, it is one of the earliest fossil beds containing soft-part imprints.

The rock unit is a black <a href="shale">shale</a> and crops out at a number of localities near the town of <a href="Field%2C%20British%20Columbia">Field</a> in <a href="Yoho%20National%20Park">Yoho National Park</a> and the <a href="Kicking%20Horse%20Pass">Kicking Horse Pass</a>. Another outcrop is in <a href="Kootenay%20National%20Park">Kootenay National Park</a> 42 km to the south.

The Burgess Shale was discovered by <a href="palaeontologist">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Charles%20Doolittle%20Walcott">Charles Walcott</a> on 30 August 1909, towards the end of the season's fieldwork. He returned in 1910 with his sons, daughter, and wife, establishing a quarry on the flanks of Fossil Ridge. The significance of soft-bodied preservation, and the range of organisms he recognised as new to science, led him to return to the quarry almost every year until 1924. At that point, aged 74, he had amassed over 65,000 specimens. Describing the fossils was a vast task, pursued by Walcott until his death in 1927. Walcott, led by scientific opinion at the time, attempted to categorise all fossils into living taxa, and as a result, the fossils were regarded as little more than curiosities at the time. It was not until 1962 that a first-hand reinvestigation of the fossils was attempted, by Alberto Simonetta. This led scientists to recognise that Walcott had barely scratched the surface of information available in the Burgess Shale, and also made it clear that the organisms did not fit comfortably into modern groups.

Excavations were resumed at the <a href="Walcott%20Quarry">Walcott Quarry</a> by the <a href="Geological%20Survey%20of%20Canada">Geological Survey of Canada</a> under the persuasion of <a href="trilobite">trilobite</a> expert <a href="Harry%20Blackmore%20Whittington">Harry Blackmore Whittington</a>, and a new quarry, the Raymond, was established about 20 metres higher up Fossil Ridge. Whittington, with the help of research students <a href="Derek%20Briggs">Derek Briggs</a> and <a href="Simon%20Conway%20Morris">Simon Conway Morris</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, began a thorough reassessment of the Burgess Shale, and revealed that the fauna represented were much more diverse and unusual than Walcott had recognized. Indeed, many of the animals present had bizarre <a href="body%20form">anatomical features</a> and only the slightest resemblance to other known animals. Examples include "<a href="Opabinia">Opabinia</a>", with five eyes and a snout like a vacuum cleaner hose and "<a href="Hallucigenia">Hallucigenia</a>", which was originally reconstructed upside down, walking on bilaterally symmetrical spines.

With <a href="Parks%20Canada">Parks Canada</a> and <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> recognising the significance of the Burgess Shale, collecting fossils became politically more difficult from the mid-1970s. Collections continued to be made by the <a href="Royal%20Ontario%20Museum">Royal Ontario Museum</a>. The curator of invertebrate palaeontology, <a href="Desmond%20Collins">Desmond Collins</a>, identified a number of additional outcrops, <a href="stratigraphically">stratigraphically</a> both higher and lower than the original Walcott quarry. These localities continue to yield new organisms faster than they can be studied.

<a href="Stephen%20Jay%20Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a>'s book "<a href="Wonderful%20Life%20%28book%29">Wonderful Life</a>", published in 1989, brought the Burgess Shale fossils to the public's attention. Gould suggests that the extraordinary diversity of the fossils indicates that life forms at the time were much more disparate in body form than those that survive today, and that many of the unique lineages were evolutionary experiments that became extinct. Gould's interpretation of the diversity of Cambrian fauna relied heavily on <a href="Simon%20Conway%20Morris">Simon Conway Morris</a>'s reinterpretation of Charles Walcott's original publications. However, Conway Morris strongly disagreed with Gould's conclusions, arguing that almost all the Cambrian fauna could be classified into modern day <a href="Phylum">phyla</a>.

The Burgess Shale has attracted the interest of paleoclimatologists who want to study and predict long-term future changes in Earth's climate. According to Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee in the 2003 book "The Life and Death of Planet Earth", climatologists study the fossil records in the Burgess Shale to understand the climate of the <a href="Cambrian%20explosion">Cambrian explosion</a>, and use it to predict what Earth's climate would look like in the future when a warming and expanding Sun combined with declining <a href="Carbon%20dioxide">CO</a> and oxygen levels eventually heat the Earth toward temperatures not seen since the <a href="Archean">Archean</a> Eon 3 billion years ago, before the first plants and animals appeared, and therefore understand how and when the last living things will die out. See also <a href="Future%20of%20the%20Earth">Future of the Earth</a>.

After the Burgess Shale site was registered as a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> in 1980, it was included in the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks WHS designation in 1984.

In February 2014, the discovery was announced of another Burgess Shale outcrop in <a href="Kootenay%20National%20Park">Kootenay National Park</a> to the south. In just 15 days of field collecting in 2013, 50 animal species were unearthed at the new site.

The fossil-bearing deposits of the Burgess Shale correlate to the <a href="Stephen%20formation">Stephen formation</a>, a collection of slightly calcareous dark mudstones, about old. The beds were deposited at the base of a cliff about 160 m tall, below the depth agitated by waves during storms. This vertical cliff was composed of the calcareous reefs of the <a href="Cathedral%20escarpment">Cathedral Formation</a>, which probably formed shortly before the deposition of the Burgess Shale. The precise formation mechanism is not known for certain, but the most widely accepted hypothesis suggests that the edge of the Cathedral Formation reef became detached from the rest of the reef, slumping and being transported some distance — perhaps kilometers — away from the reef edge. Later reactivation of faults at the base of the formation led to its disintegration from about . This would have left a steep cliff, the bottom of which would be protected from tectonic decompression because the limestone of the Cathedral Formation is difficult to compress. This protection explains why fossils preserved further from the Cathedral Formation are impossible to work with — tectonic squeezing of the beds has produced a vertical cleavage that fractures the rocks, so they split perpendicular to the fossils. The Walcott quarry produced such spectacular fossils because it was so close to the Stephen Formation — indeed the quarry has now been excavated to the very edge of the Cambrian cliff.

It was originally thought that the Burgess Shale was deposited in <a href="anoxic%20event">anoxic</a> conditions, but mounting research shows that oxygen was continually present in the sediment. The anoxic setting had been thought to not only protect the newly dead organisms from decay, but it also created chemical conditions allowing the preservation of the soft parts of the organisms. Further, it reduced the abundance of burrowing organisms — burrows and trackways "are" found in beds containing soft-bodied organisms, but they are rare and generally of limited vertical extent. Brine seeps are an alternative hypothesis; see <a href="Burgess%20Shale%20type%20preservation">Burgess Shale type preservation</a> for a more thorough discussion.

The Burgess Shale Formation comprises 10 members, the most famous being the Walcott Quarry Shale Member comprising the greater phyllopod bed.

There are many other comparable Cambrian "<a href="lagerst%C3%A4tte">lagerstätte</a>n"; indeed such assemblages are far more common in the Cambrian than in any other period. This is mainly due to the limited extent of burrowing activity; as such <a href="bioturbation">bioturbation</a> <a href="Cambrian%20substrate%20revolution">became more prevalent</a> throughout the Cambrian, environments capable of preserving organisms' soft parts became much rarer. (The <a href="pre-Cambrian">pre-Cambrian</a> fossil record of animals is sparse and ambiguous.)

The biota of the Burgess Shale appears to be typical of Middle Cambrian deposits. Although the hard-part bearing organisms make up as little as 14% of the community, these same organisms are found in similar proportions in other Cambrian localities. This means that there is no reason to assume that the organisms without hard parts are exceptional in any way; indeed, many appear in other lagerstätten of different age and locations.

The biota consists of a range of organisms. Free-swimming (<a href="Nekton">nectonic</a>) organisms are relatively rare, with the majority of organisms being bottom dwelling (benthic) — either moving about (vagrant) or permanently attached to the sea floor (sessile). About two-thirds of the Burgess Shale organisms lived by feeding on the organic content in the muddy sea floor, while almost a third filtered out fine particles from the water column. Under 10% of organisms were predators or scavengers, although since these organisms were larger, the biomass was split equally among each of the filter feeding, deposit feeding, predatory and scavenging organisms.

Many Burgess Shale organisms represent <a href="stem-group">stem-group</a> members of the modern animal phyla, though crown-group representatives of certain phyla are also present.

The fossils of the Burgess Shale are preserved as black carbon films on black shales, and so are difficult to photograph; however, various photographic techniques can improve the quality of the images that can be acquired. Other techniques include backscatter SEM, elemental mapping and "<a href="camera%20lucida">camera lucida</a>" drawing.

Once images have been acquired, the effects of decay and <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> must be accounted for before a correct anatomical reconstruction can be made. A consideration of the combination of characters allows researchers to establish the taxonomic affinity.

Beavis and Butt-Head

Beavis and Butt-Head is an American <a href="animated%20sitcom">animated sitcom</a> created and designed by <a href="Mike%20Judge">Mike Judge</a>. The series originated from "<a href="Frog%20Baseball">Frog Baseball</a>", a 1992 short film by Judge originally aired on "<a href="Liquid%20Television">Liquid Television</a>". After seeing the short, <a href="MTV">MTV</a> signed Judge to develop the concept. The series first ran from March 8, 1993, to November 28, 1997. Then the series was renewed for an eighth season which aired from October 27 to December 29, 2011. In 1996, the series was adapted into the animated feature film "<a href="Beavis%20and%20Butt-Head%20Do%20America">Beavis and Butt-Head Do America</a>".

The show centers on two socially incompetent, <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>-loving teenage delinquents, <a href="Beavis">Beavis</a> and <a href="Butt-Head">Butt-Head</a> (both voiced by Judge), who go to school at Highland High in Highland, Texas. They have no apparent adult supervision at home, are dim-witted, under-educated and barely literate. Both lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Their most common shared activity is watching music videos, which they tend to judge by deeming them "cool," or by exclaiming, "This sucks!" (the latter is sometimes followed by the demand, "Change it!"). They also apply these judgments to other things that they encounter, and will usually deem something "cool" if it is associated with violence, sex, or the <a href="macabre">macabre</a>. Despite having no experience with women, their other signature traits are a shared obsession with sex, and their tendency to chuckle and giggle whenever they hear words or phrases that can even remotely be interpreted as sexual or <a href="scatology">scatological</a>.

Though Beavis and Butt-Head are in ninth grade at Highland High School, their stupidity leads to a demotion all the way down to kindergarten in the episode "Held Back," but they soon prove to be such an annoyance that the elementary school principal quickly re-promotes them back to Highland High.

Each episode features frequent interstitial scenes in which they critique music videos using commentary improvised by Judge. The remainder of the episode depicts the duo embarking on some kind of scheme or adventure. Their teachers at Highland High are often at a loss as to how to deal with them, and in many episodes, they skip school altogether. Their actions sometimes result in serious consequences, but often for others, for which they themselves show no remorse whatsoever.

Over its run, "Beavis and Butt-Head" drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society. It became the focus of criticism from social conservatives, such as <a href="Michael%20Medved">Michael Medved</a>, while others, such as <a href="David%20Letterman">David Letterman</a>, and the conservative magazine "<a href="National%20Review">National Review</a>," defended it as a cleverly subversive vehicle for social criticism and a particularly creative and intelligent comedy. Either way, the show captured the attention of many young television viewers in the United States and abroad and is often considered a classic piece of 1990s youth culture and <a href="Generation%20X">Generation X</a>. <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>, creators of "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>," cite the show as an influence and compared it to the <a href="blues">blues</a>. They met Mike Judge before the show aired.

In 1997, Dan Tobin of "<a href="The%20Phoenix%20%28newspaper%29">The Boston Phoenix</a>" commented on the series' humor, stating that it transformed "stupidity into a crusade, forcing us to acknowledge how little it really takes to make us laugh." In 1997, Ted Drozdowski of "<a href="The%20Phoenix%20%28newspaper%29">The Boston Phoenix</a>" described the 1997 "Beavis and Butt-Head" state as "reduced to self-parody of their self-parody." In December 2005, "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" even ranked the duo's distinct laughing at #66 on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases. In 2012, "TV Guide" ranked "Beavis and Butt-head" as one of the top 60 Greatest TV Cartoons of All Time.

Mike Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two – "Give Blood"/"Blood Drive" and "Door to Door" – which he described as "awful, I don't know why anybody liked it... I was burying my head in the sand."

Early installments gave them a juvenile obsession with fire and dangerous behavior, summed up with Beavis' chanting of "Fire! Fire!" The show was blamed for the death of a two-year-old in <a href="Moraine%2C%20Ohio">Moraine, Ohio</a> in October 1993. The girl's five-year-old brother set fire to his mother's mobile home with a <a href="Lighter">cigarette lighter</a>, killing the two-year-old. Because of this, MTV pulled the episode temporarily. The mother took the boy's bedroom door off its hinges so she could keep an eye on him. She later claimed that her son watched one of the fire-related segments shortly before he burned down the home. However, neighbors claimed that the family did not have cable television. This also raises the question of where the parents were and why the cigarette lighter was where he could reach it.

As a result, references to fire were removed from subsequent airings. The creators found a censorship <a href="loophole">loophole</a> and took delight in sometimes making Beavis scream things that sounded very similar to his previous "Fire! Fire!" (such as "Fryer! Fryer!" when he and Butt-Head are working the late shift at Burger World) and also having him almost say the forbidden word (such as one time when he sang "Liar, liar, pants on..." and pausing before "fire" ("Liar! Liar!"). There was also a music video where a man runs on fire in slow motion ("California" by <a href="Wax%20%28rock%20band%29">Wax</a>). Beavis is hypnotized by it and can barely say "fire". However, MTV eventually removed the episode entirely. References to fire were cut from earlier episodes — even the original tapes were altered permanently. Other episodes MTV opted not to rerun included "Stewart's House" and "Way Down Mexico Way". Copies of early episodes with the controversial content intact are rare. The ones that exist are made from home video recordings of the original broadcasts. In an interview included with the "Mike Judge Collection" DVD set, Judge said he is uncertain whether some of the earlier episodes still exist in their uncensored form.

When new episodes returned in 2011, MTV allowed Beavis to use the word "fire" once again uncensored. During the first video segment during "<a href="Werewolves%20of%20Highland">Werewolves of Highland</a>", the first new episode of the revival, Beavis utters the word "fire" a total of 7 times within 28 seconds, with Butt-head saying it once as well.

The show has also been blamed for animal cruelty and the death of a cat with fireworks. In the summer of 1993, Dick Zimmerman, a 44-year-old retired broadcasting executive from <a href="Larkspur%2C%20California">Larkspur, California</a>, happened to see the episode in which Butt-head joked, "Hey, Beavis, let's go over to Stewart's house and light [a firecracker] in his cat's butt." Five days later, a cat was found killed by a firecracker in nearby Santa Cruz. Zimmerman, winner of a $10 million state lottery in 1988, immediately put up a $5,000 reward for the perpetrators, told the press that "Beavis and Butt-Head" was responsible for the death, and started a letter-writing campaign against the show. By the fall, 4,000 people from around the country had joined his campaign.

In February 1994, watchdog group <a href="Morality%20in%20Media">Morality in Media</a> claimed that the death of eight-month-old Natalia Rivera, struck by a bowling ball thrown from an overpass onto a <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City, New Jersey</a> highway near the <a href="Holland%20Tunnel">Holland Tunnel</a> by 18-year-old Calvin J. Settle, was partially inspired by "Beavis and Butt-Head". The group said that Settle was influenced by "Ball Breakers", in which Beavis and Butt-Head loaded a bowling ball with explosives and dropped it from a rooftop. While Morality in Media claimed that the show inspired Settle's actions, the case's prosecutors did not. Later it was revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant that Settle did not have cable TV and did not watch the show.

In "Lightning Strikes", the show parodies blaming actions on youth culture. When asked by a reporter why they were flying a kite in a thunderstorm, the duo explained that they were inspired by a documentary about <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, who Butt-head describes as "some old dude with long hair and glasses". The reporter asks if it was <a href="Howard%20Stern">Howard Stern</a>, and when Butt-head answers "no", she asks if he has ever listened to Stern's radio program. The reporter continues asking them leading questions until they mention that they had watched rock music videos earlier in the day. The reporter then concludes on the air that the music videos are to blame for the duo's actions.

MTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00 p.m., and included a disclaimer, reminding viewers:
This was later changed to:
This disclaimer also appears before the opening of their <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> and <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super NES</a> game as well as their Windows game "<a href="Beavis%20and%20Butt-Head%20in%20Virtual%20Stupidity">Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity</a>".

They were famously lambasted by <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> senator <a href="Ernest%20Hollings">Fritz Hollings</a> as "Buffcoat and Beaver." This subsequently became a running gag on the show where adults mispronounced their names, Tom Anderson originally calling them "Butthole" and "Joe", and believing the two to be of Asian ethnicity (describing them to the police as "<a href="Oriental">Oriental</a>"). In later episodes, Tom Anderson uses the Hollings mispronunciation once, and on at least one occasion refers to them as "Penis and Butt-Munch". President Clinton called them "Beavis and Bum-head" in "Citizen Butt-head", as well as in the <a href="Beavis%20and%20Butt-head%20Do%20America">movie</a>, where an old lady (voiced by <a href="Cloris%20Leachman">Cloris Leachman</a>) consistently calls them "Travis" and "Bob-head". In "Incognito", when another student threatens to kill them, the duo uses this to their advantage, pretending to be exchange students named "Crevis and Bung-Head". The bully, seeing through the disguises, calls them "Beaver and Butt-Plug". In "Right On!", when the duo appear on the Gus Baker Show, host Gus Baker (a caricature of <a href="Rush%20Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>) introduces them as "Beavis and Buffcoat".

Beavis and Butt-head have been compared to <a href="Savant%20syndrome">idiot savants</a> because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by Mike Judge. With regard to criticisms of the two as "idiots", Judge responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny.

In 1996, a full-length movie featuring the duo titled "Beavis and Butt-Head Do America" was released in theaters. The movie features the voices of <a href="Bruce%20Willis">Bruce Willis</a>, <a href="Demi%20Moore">Demi Moore</a>, <a href="Cloris%20Leachman">Cloris Leachman</a>, <a href="Robert%20Stack">Robert Stack</a>, <a href="Eric%20Bogosian">Eric Bogosian</a>, <a href="Richard%20Linklater">Richard Linklater</a>, <a href="Greg%20Kinnear">Greg Kinnear</a> (in an uncredited role) and <a href="David%20Letterman">David Letterman</a> (credited as Earl Hofert). It gained mostly positive reviews from film critics and a "two thumbs up" from Siskel and Ebert. The film earned over $60 million at the domestic box office, a strong return for a film that cost only $12 million to produce.

During years, many fans had rumored the possibility of a sequel or follow-up to the film, tentatively titled "Beavis and Butt-Head: The Sequel" or "Beavis and Butt-Head 2". On August 31, 2009, during the promotion of "<a href="Extract%20%28film%29">Extract</a>", <a href="Mike%20Judge">Mike Judge</a> stated that he would like to see Beavis and Butt-Head on the big screen again. He also stated that if the sequel film were to happen, both Beavis and Butt-Head would be 60-year-old men.

On July 14, 2010, a spokesperson for MTV Networks informed a "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" reporter that Mike Judge was creating a new "Beavis and Butt-Head" series, that Judge would reprise his voice-acting roles for the show, and that the animation would be hand-drawn. According to <a href="TMZ.com">TMZ</a>, MTV had not asked <a href="Tracy%20Grandstaff">Tracy Grandstaff</a> to reprise her role as <a href="Daria%20Morgendorffer">Daria Morgendorffer</a>. Later, in a "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" interview, Judge was asked if "Daria" was coming back and he said, "No. There's sort of a <a href="Cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> in one episode. That'll be a surprise."

As in the old series, Beavis and Butt-head are high school students who, among other things, criticize contemporary music videos. In an interview with "Rolling Stone", MTV president Van Toffler said that the duo will also watch "<a href="Jersey%20Shore%20%28TV%20series%29">Jersey Shore</a>", <a href="Ultimate%20Fighting%20Championship">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> matches, and amateur videos from <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>, as well as give movie reviews. "The biggest change is obviously the references are updated, it's set in modern day, and there's going to be a movie review segment," Linn said. "Otherwise they're still true to their prior passions."

John Altschuler, formerly a writer for "<a href="King%20of%20the%20Hill">King of the Hill</a>", told a "Rolling Stone" reporter that he saw signs that Mike Judge was thinking of reviving "Beavis and Butt-head". On more than one occasion, Judge told the writers that one of their ideas for an episode of "King of the Hill" would work well for "Beavis and Butt-head"; eventually he concluded, "Maybe we should just actually make some good "Beavis and Butt-head" episodes." Later, a <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a> video convinced Van Toffler of the tenability of a "Beavis and Butt-head" revival: "I felt like there was a whole crop of new artists—and what the world sorely missed was the point-of-view that only Beavis and Butt-Head could bring."

As part of a promotional campaign for the new series, cinemas screening "<a href="Jackass%203D">Jackass 3D</a>" opened the <a href="feature%20film">feature film</a> with a <a href="3-D%20film">3-D</a> "Beavis and Butt-head" short subject. Months later, in a media presentation on February 2, 2010, MTV announced that the series would premiere in mid-2011. On July 21, 2011 Mike Judge spoke and fielded questions on a panel at <a href="Comic-Con%20International">Comic-Con International</a>. A preview of the episode "Holy Cornholio" was also shown. Judge told "Rolling Stone" that at least 24 episodes (12 half-hour programs) will definitely air. It was initially rumored that Judge was working on 30 new episodes for the network.

The new episodes debuted in the United States and Canada on October 27, 2011. The premiere was dubbed a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3 million total viewers. This number eventually dwindled to 900,000 by the season's end, mainly due to its challenging time slot pitted against regular prime time shows on other networks. From April 24, 2012 to May 1, 2013, the show remained on the bubble for renewal. No official decision had been made. According to Mike Judge, MTV's modern demographic are females 12–14 years old, and the network is looking for other networks to ship the show to.

The new shows aired in mainland Europe in April 2011. The main title card displays the title as "Mike Judge's Beavis and Butt-head" with Judge's name replacing the MTV logo.

<a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> aired the show as part of their animation block over Christmas in December 2011 but was not picked up for a new season nor syndication. This would be the second time the show has aired on Comedy Central, the first being between subsequent airings in 2004 and 2005.

On January 10, 2014, Mike Judge announced that, while he is busy working on "<a href="Silicon%20Valley%20%28TV%20series%29">Silicon Valley</a>", there is a chance of him pitching "Beavis and Butt-Head" to another network and that he wouldn't mind making more episodes. While giving an interview to <a href="Howard%20Stern">Howard Stern</a> on May 6, 2014, Judge mentioned that the show's ratings on MTV were second only to "Jersey Shore", but the show didn't fit MTV's target demographic of young women, which is why the revived series has not been brought back on MTV. He also said that MTV was close to selling it to another network, but it became "lost in deal stuff".

In interviews, Judge has stated his interest in producing a <a href="live-action">live-action</a> movie, and <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a> has expressed interest in the role of Beavis. In May 2008, Judge said that he previously hated the idea, but now believes that "maybe there's something there." During an interview for Collider on August 25, 2008, Judge said, "I like to keep the door open on "Beavis and Butt-Head", because it's my favorite thing that I've ever done. It's the thing I'm most proud of." However, he also added, "Another movie... the problem is it takes a year and half, two years, two and a half years—maybe—to do that right. And that's a pretty strong level of commitment. I'm going to look at that again. That comes up every three years." One of his ideas is bringing back the characters as old men, instead of teenagers. "I kind of think of them as being either 15 or in their 60s," he said. "I wouldn't mind doing something with them as these two dirty old men sitting on the couch." Judge added that he would not completely ignore the time that has passed in between. "At one point I thought Butt-Head might do okay on some really low-level sales job".

In 2016, Judge told <a href="RadioTimes.com">RadioTimes.com</a> that "Maybe it could be a live-action someday," and went on to speculate that Beavis might be homeless by now.

Starting in 1996, Beavis and Butthead episodes were released on VHS in heavily edited versions. The first official <a href="home%20video">home video</a> releases of "Beavis and Butt-Head" were two <a href="VHS">VHS</a> tapes titled "There Goes the Neighborhood" and "Work Sucks!", distributed by <a href="Sony">Sony</a> Music Video and MTV Home Video in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Each tape contained approximately eight episodes, each selected from the first four seasons. Eight more VHS compilations were released between 1996 and 1999 in the U.S., before the final volume, "Butt-O-Ween", was issued in October 1999.

The first Beavis and Butt-Head release on DVD was entitled Beavis and Butt-Head: The Final Judgement. It was released in the USA on July 2, 1997. The running time was 43 minutes, and the program included:

Program Start
"No Laughing"
"Scared Straight"
"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Huh-Huh"
"Manners Suck"
"Liar! Liar!"
"The Great Cornholio"
"The Final Judgement"

However, the series continued in Australia and U.K., with a further ten volumes being issued between 1999 and 2001.

When the series ended in the U.K., a further seven volumes were issued exclusively in Australia, meaning that over-all 28 volumes, all 200 original episodes were released on VHS except "Heroes", "Incognito", "Cow Tipping", "Canoe" and "True Crime".

Prior to the release of the VHS Volumes, a laserdisc titled "Beavis and Butt-Head: The Essential Collection" was issued in 1994, containing sixteen episodes from the second and third seasons.

All of the U.S. VHS Volumes were later issued on DVD in five two-disc sets through the <a href="Time%20Life">Time Life</a> organization. The DVD releases were titled "The Best of Beavis and Butt-Head". The third DVD release of Beavis and Butt-Head was two series of three-disc sets released by Time-Life in December 2002.

The first set in the series contained the same program content of six of the Beavis and Butt-Head VHS compilations previously released by Sony Music Video from 1994 to 1999: Butt-O-Ween, Beavis and Butt-Head Do Christmas, Innocence Lost, Chicks 'n' Stuff, Feel Our Pain, and Troubled Youth, with two VHS compilations combined into a single disc. The set was advertised considerably on networks such as Comedy Central and on the Time-Life website.

Sometime after the first release, a second set of Time-Life Beavis and Butt-Head DVDs was released. This set contained the programs of the remaining SMV VHS compilations: Work Sucks, There Goes the Neighborhood, The Final Judgement, Law-Abiding Citizens, and Hard Cash. Two of the discs in the set once again contained the program content of two of the VHS tapes, while the last disc (Hard Cash) contained only the content of the final VHS program, but did additionally include 4 of the music video segments from the original broadcasts with Beavis and Butt-Head commentating. The second Time-Life set was not advertised, and subsequently became rarer.

Paramount announced the release of a two-disc DVD set titled "The History of Beavis and Butt-Head" which was scheduled for release in September 2002 in the United States. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owned approval rights for video releases of the series. According to Judge, the "History" set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent. In all, half of the 32 episodes on "The History of Beavis and Butt-Head" weren't included on later releases of the series, including all but two episodes on the first disc.

Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date, only to be immediately recalled. The set started selling on <a href="eBay">eBay</a> at very high prices, sometimes over $300 USD, as well as fetching over $1000 USD in new condition on websites such as "Amazon.com".

MTV and <a href="Paramount%20home%20entertainment">Paramount Home Entertainment</a> released on November 8, 2005 a three-disc DVD compilation titled "", Volume 1. The DVD set includes 40 episodes and 11 music video segments from the original shows. The set was followed by Volume 2 and Volume 3. On January 27, 2008, MTV and <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> made all three collections available on the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>. A Blu-ray and DVD release of Season 8, titled "Beavis and Butt-Head – Volume 4", was released on February 15, 2012 in the U.S.

On February 14, 2017, MTV released "Beavis and Butt-Head - The Complete Collection", a 12-disc set containing all four previous released volumes of "The Mike Judge Collection", along with a special collector's edition of "Beavis and Butt-Head Do America".

Many music video segments and content from other third parties were never released due to licensing issues with the rights holders. Early episodes featuring Beavis and Butt-Head engaging in unusually cruel and criminal activities were never released due to Mike Judge and MTV's dislike of them.


From 1994 to 1996, <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> published a monthly "Beavis and Butt-Head" comic under the <a href="Marvel%20Absurd">Marvel Absurd</a> imprint by a variety of writers, but with each issue drawn by artist Rick Parker. It was also reprinted by Marvel UK, which created new editorial material.

The letters page was answered by Beavis and Butt-Head or one of their supporting characters. Instead of reviewing music videos, they reviewed (custom-made) pages from other Marvel Comics. In their review of a <a href="Ghost%20Rider">Ghost Rider</a> comic, Beavis tries to avoid using the word "fire" to describe the character's fiery skull.

In the comic, minor characters like Earl, Billy Bob, Clark Cobb, and Mistress Cora Anthrax would get repeated appearances; Earl was quite regular, and Anthrax was in two issues and got to answer a letter's page.

In 1997, a spin-off show based on their classmate Daria Morgendorffer, "<a href="Daria">Daria</a>", was created. Mike Judge was not credited as a producer of this series and has said he was not involved with it at all, except to give permission for the use of the character. The Daria character had been created for "Beavis and Butt-Head" by <a href="Glenn%20Eichler">Glenn Eichler</a> and originally designed by Bill Peckmann of J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. Eichler then became a producer for "Daria". In the first episode of "Daria", she and her family move from Beavis and Butt-Head's hometown of Highland to Lawndale—the only references to the original show is a single mention of Highland in the first episode, with Daria saying Lawndale can't be a second Highland "unless there's uranium in the drinking water here too".

The Bromeliales is the <a href="botanical%20name">botanical name</a> of an <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of <a href="flowering%20plants">flowering plants</a>. Such an order has been recognized by a few <a href="list%20of%20systems%20of%20plant%20taxonomy">systems</a> of plant taxonomy, with a various placement. It appears that it always has had the same <a href="circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscription</a>: 
consisting only of the family <a href="Bromeliaceae">Bromeliaceae</a>, the bromeliad or <a href="pineapple">pineapple</a> family. The order is not recognized in the <a href="APG%20II%20system">APG II system</a>, of 2003, which places the plants involved in the order <a href="Poales">Poales</a>. Some examples are:

Brassicales

The Brassicales (or Cruciales) are an <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s, belonging to the <a href="eurosids%20II">eurosids II</a> group of <a href="dicotyledon">dicotyledon</a>s under the <a href="APG%20II">APG II</a> system. One character common to many members of the order is the production of <a href="glucosinolate">glucosinolate</a> (mustard oil) compounds. Most systems of classification have included this order, although sometimes under the name Capparales (the name chosen depending on which is thought to have priority).

The order typically contains the following families:

Under the <a href="Cronquist%20system">Cronquist system</a>, the Brassicales were called the Capparales, and included among the "<a href="Dilleniidae">Dilleniidae</a>". The only families included were the <a href="Brassicaceae">Brassicaceae</a> and <a href="Capparaceae">Capparaceae</a> (treated as separate families), the <a href="Tovariaceae">Tovariaceae</a>, <a href="Resedaceae">Resedaceae</a>, and <a href="Moringaceae">Moringaceae</a>. Other taxa now included here were placed in various other orders.

The families Capparaceae and Brassicaceae are closely related. One group, consisting of "<a href="Cleome">Cleome</a>" and related genera, was traditionally included in the Capparaceae but doing so results in a <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> Capparaceae. Therefore, this group is generally now either included in the Brassicaceae or as its own family, <a href="Cleomaceae">Cleomaceae</a>.

Bulletin board system

A bulletin board system or BBS is a <a href="host%20%28network%29">computer server</a> running <a href="list%20of%20BBS%20software">software</a> that allows users to connect to the system using a <a href="terminal%20program">terminal program</a>. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as <a href="upload">upload</a>ing and <a href="download">download</a>ing software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through <a href="email">email</a>, public <a href="Internet%20forum">message boards</a>, and sometimes via direct <a href="synchronous%20conferencing">chatting</a>. Many BBSes also offer <a href="BBS%20door">on-line games</a> in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide <a href="chat%20room">chat room</a>s, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a>, <a href="social%20network%20service">social networks</a>, and other aspects of the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>. Low-cost, high-performance <a href="modem">modem</a>s drove the use of <a href="online%20service">online service</a>s and BBSes through the early 1990s. "<a href="Infoworld">Infoworld</a>" estimated that there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services such as <a href="CompuServe">CompuServe</a>.

The introduction of inexpensive <a href="Dial-up%20Internet%20access">dial-up internet service</a> and the <a href="Mosaic%20%28web%20browser%29">Mosaic web browser</a> offered ease of use and global access that BBS and online systems did not provide, and led to a rapid crash in the market starting in 1994. Over the next year, many of the <a href="List%20of%20BBS%20software">leading BBS software providers</a> went <a href="bankrupt">bankrupt</a> and tens of thousands of BBSes disappeared. Today, BBSing survives largely as a nostalgic hobby in most parts of the world, but it is still an extremely popular form of communication for Taiwanese youth (see <a href="PTT%20Bulletin%20Board%20System">PTT Bulletin Board System</a>) and in China. Most BBSes are now accessible over <a href="Telnet">Telnet</a> and typically offer free email accounts, FTP services, <a href="Internet%20Relay%20Chat">IRC</a> and all of the <a href="Communications%20protocol">protocols</a> commonly used on the Internet. Some offer access through <a href="packet%20switched%20network">packet switched network</a>s or <a href="packet%20radio">packet radio</a> connections.

A precursor to the public bulletin board system was <a href="Community%20Memory">Community Memory</a>, started in August 1973 in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>. Useful <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a>s did not exist at that time, and modems were both expensive and slow. Community Memory therefore ran on a <a href="mainframe%20computer">mainframe computer</a> and was accessed through terminals located in several <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a> neighborhoods. The poor quality of the original modem connecting the terminals to the mainframe prompted a user to invent the <a href="Pennywhistle%20modem">Pennywhistle modem</a>, whose design was highly influential in the mid-1970s.

Community Memory allowed the user to type messages into a <a href="computer%20terminal">computer terminal</a> after inserting a coin, and offered a "pure" bulletin board experience with public messages only (no email or other features). It did offer the ability to tag messages with keywords, which the user could use in searches. The system acted primarily in the form of a buy and sell system with the tags taking the place of the more traditional <a href="Classified%20advertising">classifications</a>. But users found ways to express themselves outside these bounds, and the system spontaneously created stories, poetry and other forms of communications. Unfortunately, the system was expensive to operate, and when their host machine became unavailable and a new one could not be found, the system closed in January 1975.

Similar functionality was available to most mainframe users, which might be considered a sort of ultra-local BBS when used in this fashion. Commercial systems, expressly intended to offer these features to the public, became available in the late 1970s and formed the <a href="online%20service">online service</a> market that lasted into the 1990s. One particularly influential example was <a href="PLATO%20%28computer%20system%29">PLATO</a>, which had thousands of users by the late 1970s, many of whom used the messaging and <a href="chat%20room">chat room</a> features of the system in the same way that would become common on BBSes.

Early modems were generally very simple devices using <a href="acoustic%20coupler">acoustic coupler</a>s to handle telephone operation. The user would first pick up the phone, dial a number, then press the handset into rubber cups on the top of the modem. Disconnecting at the end of a call required the user to pick up the handset and return it to the phone. Examples of direct-connecting modems did exist, and these often allowed the host computer to send it commands to answer or hang up calls, but these were very expensive devices used by large banks and similar companies.

With the introduction of <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a>s with expansion slots, like the <a href="S-100%20bus">S-100 bus</a> machines and <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a>, it became possible for the modem to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to pick up an incoming call, communicate with the user, and then hang up the call when the user logged off.

The first public <a href="dial-up">dial-up</a> BBS was developed by <a href="Ward%20Christensen">Ward Christensen</a> and <a href="Randy%20Suess">Randy Suess</a>. According to an early interview, when Chicago was snowed under during the <a href="Great%20Blizzard%20of%201978">Great Blizzard of 1978</a>, the two began preliminary work on the <a href="Computerized%20Bulletin%20Board%20System">Computerized Bulletin Board System</a>, or <a href="CBBS">CBBS</a>. The system came into existence largely through a fortuitous combination of Christensen having a spare S-100 bus computer and an early Hayes internal modem, and Suess's insistence that the machine be placed at his house in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> where it would be a local phone call to millions of users. Christensen patterned the system after the <a href="cork%20board">cork board</a> his local computer club used to post information like "need a ride". CBBS officially went online on 16 February 1978. CBBS, which kept a count of callers, reportedly connected 253,301 callers before it was finally retired.

A key innovation required for the popularization of the BBS was the <a href="Hayes%20Microcomputer%20Products%23The%20Smartmodem">Hayes Smartmodem</a>. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, and could not be used with other useful platforms like <a href="video%20terminal">video terminal</a>s. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.

Hayes' solution to the problem was to use a small <a href="microcontroller">microcontroller</a> to implement a system that examined the data flowing into the modem from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from the modem using the same data pins as all the rest of the data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem could pick up the phone, dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any operator intervention. The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.

The introduction of the Smartmodem led to the first real wave of BBS systems. Limited in both speed and storage capacity, these systems were normally dedicated solely to messaging, both private email and public forums. File transfers were painfully slow at these speeds, and file libraries were typically limited to text files containing lists of other BBS systems. These systems attracted a particular type of user who used the BBS as a unique type of communications medium, and when these local systems were crowded from the market in the 1990s, their loss was lamented for many years.

Speed improved with the introduction of 1200 <a href="Bits%20per%20second">bit/s</a> modems in the <a href="Modem%23Increasing%20speeds">early 1980s</a>, giving way to 2400 bit/s fairly rapidly. The improved performance led to a substantial increase in BBS popularity. Most of the information was displayed using ordinary <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> text or <a href="ANSI%20art">ANSI art</a>, but a number of systems attempted character-based <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a>s which began to be practical at 2400 bit/s.

There was a lengthy delay before 2400 bit/s gave way and 9600 bit/s models began to appear on the market. 9600 bit/s was not even established as a strong standard before <a href="V.32bis">V.32bis</a> at 14.4 kbit/s took over in the early 1990s. This period also saw the rapid rise in capacity and dramatic drop in price of <a href="hard%20drive">hard drive</a>s. By the late 1980s, many BBS systems had relatively significant file libraries, and this gave rise to leeching, users calling BBSes solely for their files. These users would tie up the modem for some time, leaving less time for other users, who got <a href="busy%20signal">busy signal</a>s. The resulting upheaval eliminated many of the pioneering message-centric systems.

This also gave rise to a new class of BBS systems, dedicated solely to file upload and downloads. These systems charged for access, typically a flat monthly fee, compared to the per-hour fees charged by "<a href="Event%20Horizons%20BBS">Event Horizons BBS</a>" and most online services. A host of 3rd party services sprang up to support these systems, offering simple credit card <a href="merchant%20account">merchant account</a> gateways for the payment of monthly fees, and entire file libraries on <a href="compact%20disk">compact disk</a> that made initial setup very easy. Early 1990s editions of "Boardwatch" were filled with ads for single-click install solutions dedicated to these new sysops. While this gave the market a bad reputation, it also led to its greatest success; during the early 1990s, there were a number of mid-sized software companies dedicated to BBS software, and the number of BBSes in service reached its peak.

Towards the early 1990s, the BBS industry became so popular that it spawned three monthly magazines, "<a href="Boardwatch">Boardwatch</a>", "<a href="BBS%20Magazine">BBS Magazine</a>", and in Asia and Australia, "<a href="Chips%20%27n%20Bits%20Magazine">Chips 'n Bits Magazine</a>" which devoted extensive coverage of the software and technology innovations and people behind them, and listings to US and worldwide BBSes. In addition, in the USA, a major monthly magazine, "<a href="Computer%20Shopper%20%28US%20magazine%29">Computer Shopper</a>", carried a list of BBSes along with a brief abstract of each of their offerings.

Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was considerable experimentation with ways to improve the BBS experience from its <a href="command%20line%20interface">command line interface</a> roots. Almost every popular system improved matters somewhat by adding ANSI-based color menus to make reading easier, and most also allowed cursor commands to offer command-line recall and similar features. Another common feature was the use of <a href="autocomplete">autocomplete</a> to make menu navigation simpler, a feature that would not re-appear on the web until decades later.

A number of systems also made forays into GUI-based interfaces, either using character graphics sent from the host, or using custom GUI-based terminal systems. The latter initially appeared, unsurprisingly, on the <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> and <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> platform, where <a href="TeleFinder">TeleFinder</a> and <a href="FirstClass">FirstClass</a> became very popular. FirstClass offered a host of features that would be difficult or impossible under a terminal-based solution, including bi-directional information flow and non-blocking operation that allowed the user to exchange files in both directions while continuing to use the message system and chat, all in separate windows. <a href="Skypix">Skypix</a> featured on Amiga a complete <a href="markup%20language">markup language</a>. It used a standardized set of icons to indicate mouse driven commands available online and to recognize different filetypes present on BBS storage media. It was capable to transmit data like images, audio files, and audio clips between users linked to same BBS or off-line if BBS was in the circuit of FidoNet organization.
On the PC, efforts were more oriented to extensions of the original terminal concept, with the GUI being described in the information on the host. One example was the <a href="Remote%20Imaging%20Protocol">Remote Imaging Protocol</a>, essentially a picture description system, which remained relatively obscure. Probably the ultimate development of this style of operation was the dynamic page implementation of the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> BBS (USCBBS) by Susan Biddlecomb, which predated the implementation of the <a href="HTML">HTML</a> <a href="Dynamic%20web%20page">Dynamic web page</a>. A complete Dynamic web page implementation was accomplished using <a href="The%20Bread%20Board%20System">TBBS</a> with a <a href="TDBS">TDBS</a> add-on presenting a complete menu system individually customized for each user.

The demand for complex ANSI and ASCII screens and larger file transfers taxed available <a href="channel%20capacity">channel capacity</a>, which in turn propelled demand for faster modems. 14.4 kbit/s modems were standard for a number of years while various companies attempted to introduce non-standard systems with higher performance, normally about 19.2 kbit/s. Another delay followed due to a long <a href="List%20of%20ITU-T%20V-Series%20Recommendations">V.34</a> standards process before 28.8 kbit/s was released, only to be quickly replaced by 33.6 kbit/s, and then 56 kbit/s.

These increasing speeds had the side effect of dramatically reducing the noticeable effects of channel efficiency. When modems were slow, considerable effort was put into developing the most efficient protocols and display systems possible. Running a general-purpose protocol like <a href="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> over a 1200 bit/s modem was a painful experience. With <a href="56%20kbit/s%20modem">56 kbit/s modem</a>s, however, the overhead was so greatly reduced as to be unnoticeable. Dial-up Internet service became widely available in 1994, and a must-have option for any general-use <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> by 1995.

What resulted was a <a href="perfect%20storm">perfect storm</a> that almost completely destroyed the BBS market through 1995. Technically, Internet service offered an enormous advantage over BBS systems, as a single connection to the user's <a href="Internet%20service%20provider">Internet service provider</a> allowed them to contact services around the world. In comparison, BBS systems relied on a direct point-to-point connection, so even dialing multiple local systems required multiple phone calls. Moreover, Internet protocols allowed that same single connection to be used to contact multiple services at the same time, say download files from an <a href="ftp">ftp</a> library while checking the weather on a local news web site. In comparison, a connection to a BBS allowed access only to the information on that system.

According to the <a href="FidoNet">FidoNet</a> Nodelist, BBSes reached their peak usage around 1996, which was the same period that the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a> and <a href="AOL">AOL</a> suddenly became mainstream. BBSes rapidly declined in popularity thereafter, and were replaced by systems using the Internet for connectivity. Some of the larger commercial BBSes, such as MaxMegabyte and <a href="ExecPC%20BBS">ExecPC BBS</a>, evolved into <a href="Internet%20Service%20Providers">Internet Service Providers</a>.

The website "<a href="textfiles.com">textfiles.com</a>" serves as an archive that documents the history of the BBS. The <a href="http%3A//bbslist.textfiles.com/">historical BBS list</a> on "textfiles.com" contains over 105,000 BBSes that have existed over a span of 20 years in North America alone. The owner of "textfiles.com", <a href="Jason%20Scott%20Sadofsky">Jason Scott</a>, also produced "", a <a href="DVD">DVD</a> film that chronicles the history of the BBS and features interviews with well-known people (mostly from the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>) from the heyday BBS era. As of 2016 an estimated 100 to 150 are still active, mostly for nostalgia.

Unlike modern websites and <a href="online%20services">online services</a> that are typically hosted by third-party companies in commercial <a href="data%20center">data center</a>s, BBS computers (especially for smaller boards) were typically operated from the SysOp's home. As such, access could be unreliable, and in many cases, only one user could be on the system at a time. Only larger BBSes with multiple phone lines using specialized hardware, multitasking software, or a <a href="LAN">LAN</a> connecting multiple computers, could host multiple simultaneous users.

The first BBSes used homebrew software, quite often written or customized by the SysOps themselves, running on early <a href="S-100%20bus">S-100 bus</a> <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a> systems such as the <a href="Altair%208800">Altair 8800</a>, <a href="IMSAI%208080">IMSAI 8080</a> and <a href="Cromemco">Cromemco</a> under the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system. Soon after, BBS software was being written for all of the major <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a> systems of the late 1970s era - the <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a>, <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit family</a>, <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore</a> and <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> being some of the most popular.

A few years later, in 1981, IBM introduced the first <a href="DOS">DOS</a> based <a href="IBM%20personal%20computer">IBM PC</a>, and due to the overwhelming popularity of PCs and their <a href="IBM%20PC%20Compatible">clones</a>, DOS soon became the operating system on which the majority of BBS programs were run. <a href="RBBS-PC">RBBS-PC</a>, <a href="porting">ported</a> over from the CP/M world, and "Fido" BBS, created by <a href="Tom%20Jennings">Tom Jennings</a> (who later founded <a href="FidoNet">FidoNet</a>) were the first notable DOS BBS programs. Many successful commercial BBS programs were developed for DOS, such as <a href="PCBoard">PCBoard</a> BBS, <a href="RemoteAccess">RemoteAccess</a> BBS, and <a href="Wildcat%21%20BBS">Wildcat! BBS</a>. Some popular <a href="freeware">freeware</a> BBS programs for DOS included <a href="Telegard">Telegard</a> BBS and <a href="Renegade%20%28BBS%29">Renegade BBS</a>, which both had early origins from leaked <a href="WWIV">WWIV</a> BBS source code. There were several dozen other BBS programs developed over the DOS era, and many were released under the <a href="shareware">shareware</a> concept, while some were released as <a href="freeware">freeware</a> including iniquity.

BBS systems on other systems remained popular, especially <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a>s, largely because they catered to the audience of users running those machines. The ubiquitous <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> (introduced in 1982) was a common platform in the 1980s. Popular commercial BBS programs were <a href="Blue%20Board%20%28software%29">Blue Board</a>, <a href="Ivory%20BBS">Ivory BBS</a>, <a href="Color64">Color64</a> and <a href="C-Net%20DS2">CNet 64</a>. In the early 1990s a small number of BBSes were also running on the Commodore <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a>. Popular BBS software for the Amiga were ABBS, <a href="Amiexpress">Amiexpress</a>, C-Net, StormforceBBS, <a href="Infinity%20%28software%29">Infinity</a> and Tempest. There was also a small faction of devoted Atari BBSes that used the <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 800</a>, then the 800XL, and eventually the 1040ST. The earlier machines generally lacked <a href="hard%20drive">hard drive</a> capabilities, which limited them primarily to messaging.

MS-DOS continued to be the most popular operating system for BBS use up until the mid-1990s, and in the early years most multi-node BBSes were running under a DOS based multitasker such as <a href="DESQview">DESQview</a> or consisted of multiple computers connected via a <a href="LAN">LAN</a>. In the late 1980s, a handful of BBS developers implemented multitasking communications routines inside their software, allowing multiple phone lines and users to connect to the same BBS computer. These included Galacticomm's <a href="MajorBBS">MajorBBS</a> (later WorldGroup), eSoft <a href="The%20Bread%20Board%20System">The Bread Board System</a> (TBBS), and <a href="Falken">Falken</a>. Other popular BBS's were <a href="Maximus%20%28BBS%29">Maximus</a> and Opus, with some associated applications such as BinkleyTerm being based on characters from the <a href="Berkeley%20Breathed">Berkley Breathed</a> cartoon strip of <a href="Bloom%20County">Bloom County</a>. Though most BBS software had been written in <a href="BASIC">BASIC</a> or <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a> (with some low-level routines written in <a href="assembly%20language">assembly language</a>), the <a href="C%20%28language%29">C</a> language was starting to gain popularity.

By 1995, many of the DOS-based BBSes had begun switching to modern <a href="Computer%20multitasking">multitasking</a> operating systems, such as <a href="OS/2">OS/2</a>, <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a>, and <a href="Linux">Linux</a>. One of the first graphics based BBS applications was <a href="Excalibur%20BBS">Excalibur BBS</a> with a low bandwidth applications that required its own client for efficiency. This led to one of the earliest implementations of Electronic Commerce in 1996 with replication of partner stores around the globe. TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include Internet hosting capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as <a href="Synchronet">Synchronet</a>, <a href="Mystic%20BBS">Mystic BBS</a>, EleBBS, <a href="Dave%27s%20own%20version%20of%20Citadel">DOC</a> or <a href="Wildcat%21%20BBS">Wildcat! BBS</a>, provide access using the <a href="Telnet">Telnet</a> protocol rather than dialup, or by using legacy DOS-based BBS software with a <a href="FOSSIL">FOSSIL</a>-to-Telnet redirector such as <a href="NetFoss">NetFoss</a>.

BBSes were generally text-based, rather than <a href="Graphical%20User%20Interface">GUI</a>-based, and early BBSes conversed using the simple <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> character set. However, some home computer manufacturers extended the ASCII character set to take advantage of the advanced color and graphics capabilities of their systems. BBS software authors included these extended character sets in their software, and terminal program authors included the ability to display them when a compatible system was called. Atari's native character set was known as <a href="ATASCII">ATASCII</a>, while most Commodore BBSes supported <a href="PETSCII">PETSCII</a>. PETSCII was also supported by the nationwide online service <a href="Quantum%20Link">Quantum Link</a>.

The use of these custom character sets was generally incompatible between manufacturers. Unless a caller was using terminal emulation software written for, and running on, the same type of system as the BBS, the session would simply fall back to simple ASCII output. For example, a Commodore 64 user calling an Atari BBS would use ASCII rather than the machine's native character set. As time progressed, most terminal programs began using the <a href="ANSI%20X3.64">ANSI</a> standard, but could use their native character set if it was available.

COCONET, a BBS system made by Coconut Computing, Inc., was released in 1988 and only supported a GUI (no text interface was initially available but eventually became available around 1990), and worked in EGA/VGA graphics mode, which made it stand out from the text-based BBS systems. COCONET's bitmap and vector graphics and support for multiple type fonts were inspired by the <a href="PLATO%20system">PLATO system</a>, and the graphics capabilities were based on what was available in the Borland BGI graphics library. A competing approach called <a href="Remote%20Imaging%20Protocol">Remote Imaging Protocol</a> (RIP) emerged and was promoted by Telegrafix in the early to mid-1990s but it never became widespread. An industry standard technology called <a href="NAPLPS">NAPLPS</a> was also considered, and although it became the underlying graphics technology behind the <a href="Prodigy%20%28online%20service%29">Prodigy service</a>, it never gained popularity in the BBS market. There were several GUI-based BBSes on the <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> platform, including <a href="TeleFinder">TeleFinder</a> and <a href="FirstClass">FirstClass</a>, but these remained widely used only in the Mac market.

In the UK, the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a> based OBBS software, available from <a href="Pace%20Micro%20Technology">Pace</a> for use with their modems, optionally allowed for color and graphics using the <a href="Teletext">Teletext</a> based graphics mode available on that platform. Other systems used the <a href="Viewdata">Viewdata</a> protocols made popular in the UK by <a href="British%20Telecom">British Telecom</a>'s <a href="Prestel">Prestel</a> service, and the on-line magazine <a href="Micronet800">Micronet 800</a> whom were busy giving away modems with their subscriptions.

The most popular form of online graphics was <a href="ANSI%20art">ANSI art</a>, which combined the <a href="Extended%20ASCII">IBM Extended ASCII</a> character set's blocks and symbols with <a href="ANSI%20X3.64">ANSI</a> <a href="escape%20sequence">escape sequence</a>s to allow changing colors on demand, provide cursor control and screen formatting, and even basic musical tones. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, most BBSes used ANSI to make elaborate welcome screens, and colorized menus, and thus, ANSI support was a sought-after feature in terminal client programs. The development of ANSI art became so popular that it spawned an entire BBS "<a href="artscene">artscene</a>" <a href="subculture">subculture</a> devoted to it.
The <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> "Skyline BBS" software was the first in 1987 featuring a script <a href="markup%20language">markup language</a> communication protocol called <a href="Skypix">Skypix</a> which was capable of giving the user a complete graphical interface, featuring rich graphic content, changeable fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound.

Today, most BBS software that is still actively supported, such as Worldgroup, <a href="Wildcat%21%20BBS">Wildcat! BBS</a> and <a href="Citadel/UX">Citadel/UX</a>, is Web-enabled, and the traditional text interface has been replaced (or operates concurrently) with a Web-based user interface. For those more nostalgic for the true BBS experience, one can use NetSerial (Windows) or <a href="DOSBox">DOSBox</a> (Windows/*nix) to redirect DOS COM port software to telnet, allowing them to connect to Telnet BBSes using 1980s and 1990s era modem <a href="terminal%20emulator">terminal emulation</a> software, like <a href="Telix">Telix</a>, <a href="Terminate%20%28software%29">Terminate</a>, <a href="Qmodem">Qmodem</a> and <a href="Procomm%20Plus">Procomm Plus</a>. Modern 32-bit terminal emulators such as mTelnet and <a href="Synchronet%23SyncTerm">SyncTerm</a> include native telnet support.

Since most early BBSes were run by computer hobbyists, they were typically technical in topic, with user communities revolving around hardware and software discussions.

As the BBS phenomenon grew, so did the popularity of special interest boards. Bulletin Board Systems could be found for almost every hobby and interest. Popular interests included politics, religion, music, <a href="matchmaker.com">dating</a>, and <a href="alternative%20lifestyle">alternative lifestyle</a>s. Many SysOps also adopted a <a href="Theme%20%28computing%29">theme</a> in which they customized their entire BBS (welcome screens, prompts, menus, and so on) to reflect that theme. Common themes were based on <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a>, or were intended to give the user the illusion of being somewhere else, such as in a <a href="sanatorium">sanatorium</a>, wizard's castle, or on a <a href="pirate%20ship">pirate ship</a>.

In the early days, the file download library consisted of files that the SysOps obtained themselves from other BBSes and friends. Many BBSes inspected every file uploaded to their public file download library to ensure that the material did not violate copyright law. As time went on, <a href="shareware">shareware</a> CD-ROMs were sold with up to thousands of files on each <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a>. Small BBSes copied each file individually to their hard drive. Some systems used a CD-ROM drive to make the files available. Advanced BBSes used Multiple CD-ROM disc changer units that switched 6 CD-ROM disks on demand for the caller(s). Large systems used all 26 DOS drive letters with multi-disk changers housing tens of thousands of copyright-free shareware or freeware files available to all callers. These BBSes were generally more family friendly, avoiding the seedier side of BBSes. Access to these systems varied from single to multiple modem lines with some requiring little or no confirmed registration.

Some BBSes, called elite, WaReZ or pirate boards, were exclusively used for distributing <a href="copyright%20infringement%20of%20software">cracked software</a>, <a href="phreaking">phreaking</a>, and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to upload and download files at once. Most elite BBSes used some form of new user verification, where new users would have to apply for membership and attempt to prove that they were not a law enforcement officer or a "<a href="lamer">lamer</a>." The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and gave rise to the <a href="slang">slang</a> known today as <a href="leet">leet</a>speak.

Another common type of board was the "support BBS" run by a manufacturer of computer products or software. These boards were dedicated to supporting users of the company's products with question and answer forums, news and updates, and downloads. Most of them were not a free call. Today, these services have moved to the web.

Some general purpose Bulletin Board Systems had special levels of access that were given to those who paid extra money, uploaded useful files or knew the SysOp personally. These specialty and pay BBSes usually had something special to offer their users such as large file libraries, <a href="warez">warez</a>, <a href="pornography">pornography</a>, <a href="chat%20room">chat room</a>s or <a href="Internet">Internet</a> access.

Pay BBSes such as The <a href="WELL%20%28virtual%20community%29">WELL</a> and Echo NYC (now Internet forums rather than dial-up), <a href="ExecPC%20BBS">ExecPC</a>, PsudNetwork and <a href="MindVox">MindVox</a> (which folded in 1996) were admired for their tight-knit communities and quality discussion forums. However, many free BBSes also maintained close knit communities, and some even had annual or bi-annual events where users would travel great distances to meet face-to-face with their on-line friends. These events were especially popular with BBSes that offered <a href="chat%20room">chat room</a>s.

Some of the BBSes that provided access to illegal content faced opposition. On July 12, 1985, in conjunction with a <a href="credit%20card%20fraud">credit card fraud</a> investigation, the <a href="Middlesex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Middlesex County, NJ</a> Sheriff's department raided and seized The Private Sector BBS, which was the official BBS for <a href="grey%20hat">grey hat</a> hacker quarterly <a href="2600%20Magazine">2600 Magazine</a> at the time. The notorious <a href="Rusty%20n%20Edie%27s%20BBS">Rusty n Edie's BBS</a>, in <a href="Boardman%2C%20Ohio">Boardman, Ohio</a>, was raided by the FBI in January 1993 for trading unlicensed software, and later sued by <a href="Playboy">Playboy</a> for copyright infringement in November 1997. In <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint, Michigan</a>, a 21-year-old man was charged with distributing <a href="child%20pornography">child pornography</a> through his BBS in March 1996.

Most early BBSes operated as individual systems. Information contained on that BBS never left the system, and users would only interact with the information and user community on that BBS alone. However, as BBSes became more widespread, there evolved a desire to connect systems together to share messages and files with distant systems and users. The largest such network was <a href="FidoNet">FidoNet</a>.

As is it was prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist SysOp to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a <a href="store%20and%20forward">store and forward</a> network. Private email (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with <a href="ARC%20%28file%20format%29">ARC</a> or <a href="ZIP%20%28file%20format%29">ZIP</a> and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a dialup <a href="Xmodem">Xmodem</a> session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could take days, especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.

FidoNet was platform-independent and would work with any BBS that was written to use it. BBSes that did not have integrated FidoNet capability could usually add it using an external FidoNet <a href="front%20end%20processor%20%28program%29">front-end</a> mailer such as <a href="FrontDoor">FrontDoor</a>, BinkleyTerm, InterMail or D'Bridge, and a mail processor such as <a href="FastEcho">FastEcho</a> or <a href="Squish%20%28FidoNet%29">Squish</a>. The front-end mailer would conduct the periodic FidoNet transfers, while the mail processor would usually run just before and just after the mailer ran. This program would scan for and pack up new outgoing messages, and then unpack, sort and "toss" the incoming messages into a BBS user's local email box or into the BBS's local message bases reserved for Echomail. As such, these mail processors were commonly called "scanner/tosser/packers."

Many other BBS networks followed the example of FidoNet, using the same standards and the same software. These were called FidoNet Technology Networks (FTNs). They were usually smaller and targeted at selected audiences. Some networks used <a href="QWK%20%28file%20format%29">QWK</a> doors, and others such as <a href="RelayNet">RelayNet</a> (RIME) and <a href="WWIVnet">WWIVnet</a> used non-Fido software and standards.

Before commercial Internet access became common, these <a href="computer%20network">networks</a> of BBSes provided regional and international <a href="e-mail">e-mail</a> and message bases. Some even provided <a href="Gateway%20%28computer%20networking%29">gateways</a>, such as UFGATE, by which members could send/receive e-mail to/from the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> via <a href="UUCP">UUCP</a>, and many FidoNet discussion groups were shared via gateway to <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a>. Elaborate schemes allowed users to download binary files, search <a href="Gopher%20%28protocol%29">gopherspace</a>, and interact with distant <a href="Computer%20program">programs</a>, all using plain text e-mail.

As the volume of FidoNet Mail increased and newsgroups from the early days of the Internet became available, satellite data downstream services became viable for larger systems. The satellite service provided access to FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups in large volumes at a reasonable fee. By connecting a small dish & receiver, a constant downstream of thousands of FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups could be received. The local BBS only needed to upload new outgoing messages via the modem network back to the satellite service. This method drastically reduced phone data transfers while dramatically increasing the number of message forums.

FidoNet is still in use today, though in a much smaller form, and many Echomail groups are still shared with Usenet via FidoNet to Usenet gateways. Widespread abuse of Usenet with <a href="spam%20%28electronic%29">spam</a> and <a href="pornography">pornography</a> has led to many of these FidoNet gateways to cease operation completely.

Much of the <a href="shareware">shareware</a> movement was started via user distribution of software through BBSes. A notable example was <a href="Phil%20Katz">Phil Katz</a>'s PKARC (and later <a href="PKZIP">PKZIP</a>, using the same ".zip" <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> that <a href="WinZip">WinZip</a> and other popular archivers now use); also other concepts of software distribution like <a href="freeware">freeware</a>, <a href="postcardware">postcardware</a> like <a href="JPEGview">JPEGview</a> and <a href="donationware">donationware</a> like <a href="Red%20Ryder%20%28software%29">Red Ryder</a> for the Macintosh first appeared on BBS sites. <a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a> from <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a> and nearly all <a href="3D%20Realms">Apogee Software</a> games were distributed as shareware (Apogee is, in fact, credited for adding an order form to a shareware demo). The Internet has largely erased the distinction of shareware - most users now download the software directly from the developer's website rather than receiving it from another BBS user 'sharing' it. Today shareware is commonly used to mean electronically distributed software from a small developer.

Many commercial BBS software companies that continue to support their old BBS software products switched to the shareware model or made it entirely free. Some companies were able to make the move to the Internet and provide commercial products with BBS capabilities.

A classic BBS had:

String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)

The String Quartet No. 16 in <a href="F%20major">F major</a>, <a href="Opus%20number">op.</a> 135, by <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> was written in October 1826 and was the last major work he completed. Only the final movement of the <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%2013%20%28Beethoven%29">Quartet op. 130</a>, written as a replacement for the <a href="Gro%C3%9Fe%20Fuge">Große Fuge</a>, was composed later. The op. 135 quartet was premiered by the <a href="Schuppanzigh%20Quartet">Schuppanzigh Quartet</a> in March 1828, one year after Beethoven's death. 

The work is on a smaller scale than the other <a href="Late%20string%20quartets%20%28Beethoven%29">late quartets</a>. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript "Muß es sein?" (Must it be?) to which he responds, with the faster main theme of the movement, "Es muß sein!" (It must be!). The whole movement is headed "Der schwer gefaßte Entschluß" ("The Difficult Decision").

<doc id="3436" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3436" title="Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)">
Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)

The Symphony No. 9 in <a href="D%20minor">D minor</a>, <a href="Opus%20number">Op.</a> 125, is the final complete <a href="symphony">symphony</a> composed from 1822 to 1824 by the German composer <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>. It was first performed in Vienna on 7 May 1824. The symphony is one of the best-known works in <a href="Common%20practice%20period">common practice music</a>. It is widely viewed by <a href="music%20criticism">critics</a> as one of Beethoven's greatest <a href="List%20of%20compositions%20by%20Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">works</a>, the pinnacle of musical <a href="Classical%20period%20%28music%29">Classicism</a>, and one of the greatest compositions in the western musical canon. The symphony was the first example of a major composer using voices in a symphony (thus making it a <a href="choral%20symphony">choral symphony</a>). The words are sung during the final <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movement</a> by four vocal soloists and a <a href="choir">chorus</a>. They were taken from the "<a href="Ode%20to%20Joy">Ode to Joy</a>", a poem written by <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a> in 1785 and revised in 1803, with text additions made by the composer. In the 2010s, it stands as one of the most performed symphonies in the world.

In 2001, Beethoven's original, hand-written manuscript of the score, held by the <a href="Berlin%20State%20Library">Berlin State Library</a>, was added to the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="Memory%20of%20the%20World%20Programme">Memory of the World Programme</a> Heritage list, becoming the first musical score so honoured.

The <a href="Philharmonic%20Society%20of%20London">Philharmonic Society of London</a> originally commissioned the symphony in 1817. The main composition work was done between autumn 1822 and the completion of the autograph in February 1824. The symphony emerged from other pieces by Beethoven that, while completed works in their own right, are also in some sense "sketches" (rough outlines) for the future symphony. The <a href="Choral%20Fantasy%20%28Beethoven%29">Choral Fantasy</a> Opus. 80 (1808), basically a <a href="piano%20concerto">piano concerto</a> movement, brings in a choir and vocal soloists near the end for the climax. The vocal forces sing a theme first played instrumentally, and this theme is reminiscent of the corresponding theme in the Ninth Symphony (for a detailed comparison, see <a href="Choral%20Fantasy%20%28Beethoven%29">Choral Fantasy</a>). Going further back, an earlier version of the Choral Fantasy theme is found in the song "Gegenliebe" (Returned Love) for piano and high voice, which dates from before 1795. According to Robert W. Gutman, Mozart's K. 222 Offertory in D minor, "Misericordias Domini", written in 1775, contains a melody that foreshadows "Ode to Joy".

Although his major works had primarily been premiered in Vienna, Beethoven was keen to have his latest composition performed in Berlin as soon as possible after finishing it, as he thought that musical taste in Vienna had become dominated by Italian composers such as <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Rossini</a>. When his friends and financiers heard this, they urged him to premiere the symphony in Vienna in the form of a petition signed by a number of prominent Viennese music patrons and performers. Beethoven was flattered by the adoration of Vienna, so the Ninth Symphony was premiered on 7 May 1824 in the <a href="Theater%20am%20K%C3%A4rntnertor">Theater am Kärntnertor</a> in Vienna along with the overture "<a href="The%20Consecration%20of%20the%20House%20%28overture%29">The Consecration of the House</a>" () and three parts of the "<a href="Missa%20solemnis%20%28Beethoven%29">Missa solemnis</a>" (the Kyrie, Credo, and Agnus Dei). This was the composer's first onstage appearance in 12 years; the hall was packed with an eager audience and a number of musicians.

The premiere of Symphony No. 9 involved the largest orchestra ever assembled by Beethoven and required the combined efforts of the Kärntnertor house orchestra, the Vienna Music Society (<a href="Gesellschaft%20der%20Musikfreunde">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</a>), and a select group of capable amateurs. While no complete list of premiere performers exists, many of Vienna's most elite performers are known to have participated. The <a href="soprano">soprano</a> and <a href="alto">alto</a> parts were sung by two famous young singers: <a href="Henriette%20Sontag">Henriette Sontag</a> and <a href="Caroline%20Unger">Caroline Unger</a>. German soprano Henriette Sontag (1806–1854) was eighteen years old when Beethoven personally recruited her to perform in the premiere of the Ninth. Also personally recruited by Beethoven, 20-year-old <a href="contralto">contralto</a> Caroline Unger (1803–1877), a native of Vienna, had gained critical praise in 1821 appearing in Rossini's "<a href="Tancredi">Tancredi</a>". After performing in Beethoven's 1824 premiere, Unger then found fame in Italy and Paris. Italian composers <a href="Gaetano%20Donizetti">Donizetti</a> and <a href="Vincenzo%20Bellini">Bellini</a> were known to have written roles specifically for her voice.

Although the performance was officially directed by <a href="Michael%20Umlauf">Michael Umlauf</a>, the theatre's <a href="Kapellmeister">Kapellmeister</a>, Beethoven shared the stage with him. However, two years earlier, Umlauf had watched as the composer's attempt to conduct a <a href="dress%20rehearsal">dress rehearsal</a> of his opera "<a href="Fidelio">Fidelio</a>" ended in disaster. So this time, he instructed the singers and musicians to ignore the almost totally deaf Beethoven. At the beginning of every part, Beethoven, who sat by the stage, gave the <a href="tempo">tempo</a>s. He was turning the pages of his <a href="sheet%20music">score</a> and beating time for an orchestra he could not hear. There are a number of anecdotes about the premiere of the Ninth. Based on the testimony of the participants, there are suggestions that it was underrehearsed (there were only two full rehearsals) and rather scrappy in execution. On the other hand, the premiere was a great success. In any case, Beethoven was not to blame, as violinist <a href="Joseph%20B%C3%B6hm">Joseph Böhm</a> recalled: "Beethoven directed the piece himself; that is, he stood before the lectern and gesticulated furiously. At times he rose, at other times he shrank to the ground, he moved as if he wanted to play all the instruments himself and sing for the whole chorus. All the musicians minded his rhythm alone while playing".

When the audience applauded—testimonies differ over whether at the end of the <a href="scherzo">scherzo</a> or symphony—Beethoven was several measures off and still conducting. Because of that, the contralto Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to accept the audience's cheers and applause. According to one witness, "the public received the musical hero with the utmost respect and sympathy, listened to his wonderful, gigantic creations with the most absorbed attention, and broke out in jubilant applause, often during sections, and repeatedly at the end of them." The audience acclaimed him through <a href="standing%20ovation">standing ovation</a>s five times; there were handkerchiefs in the air, hats, raised hands, so that Beethoven, who could not hear the applause, could at least see the ovations.

The first German edition was printed by <a href="Schott%20Music">B. Schott's Söhne</a> (Mainz) in 1826. The <a href="Breitkopf%20%26amp%3B%20H%C3%A4rtel">Breitkopf & Härtel</a> edition dating from 1864 has been used widely by orchestras. In 1997 <a href="B%C3%A4renreiter">Bärenreiter</a> published an edition by <a href="Jonathan%20Del%20Mar">Jonathan Del Mar</a>. According to Del Mar, this edition corrects nearly 3,000 mistakes in the Breitkopf edition, some of which were "remarkable". <a href="David%20Benjamin%20Levy">David Levy</a>, however, criticized this edition, saying that it could create "quite possibly false" traditions. Breitkopf also published a new edition by Peter Hauschild in 2005.

The symphony is scored for the following orchestra. These are by far the largest forces needed for any Beethoven symphony; at the premiere, Beethoven augmented them further by assigning two players to each wind part.

<a href="Woodwind">Woodwind</a>s

<a href="Brass%20instrument">Brass</a>

<a href="Percussion">Percussion</a>

<a href="Vocal%20music">Voice</a>s (fourth movement only)

<a href="String%20section">Strings</a>

The symphony is in four movements, marked as follows:

Beethoven changes the usual pattern of <a href="Classical%20music%20era">Classical</a> symphonies in placing the <a href="scherzo">scherzo</a> movement before the slow movement (in symphonies, slow movements are usually placed before scherzo). This was the first time he did this in a symphony, although he had done so in some previous works (including the <a href="string%20quartet">quartets</a> Op. 18 no. 5, the "Archduke" <a href="piano%20trio">piano trio</a> Op. 97, the <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%2029%20%28Beethoven%29">"Hammerklavier"</a> piano sonata Op. 106). <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, too, had used this arrangement in a number of his own works such as the <a href="String%20Quartets%2C%20Op.%2033%20%28Haydn%29%23Opus%2033%20No.%202">String Quartet No. 30</a> in E major.

The first movement is marked with the performance instructions "Allegro ma non troppo, un poco <a href="maestoso">maestoso</a>", in Italian, as was common with Classical music. This translates roughly as "Quickly but not too fast, a little majestic". The duration of a typical performance is about 15 minutes. The first movement is in <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> without an exposition repeat. The opening theme, played "pianissimo" over string tremolos, so much resembles the sound of an orchestra tuning that many commentators have suggested that was Beethoven's inspiration—but from within that musical "limbo" emerges a theme of power and clarity that later drives the movement. At the outset of the <a href="Recapitulation%20%28music%29">recapitulation</a> (which repeats the main melodic themes), the theme returns "fortissimo" in D major, rather than the opening's key of D minor. The introduction also uses the <a href="mediant">mediant</a> to <a href="tonic%20%28music%29">tonic</a> relationship (e.g., the key a third up from the tonic, thus the key of F# in the context of a piece in the "home key" of D minor. This further distorts the tonic key until, finally, the <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a> plays in its lowest register. At the movement's end, the <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> employs the <a href="chromatic%20fourth">chromatic fourth</a>.

The second movement has the Italian performance instructions "Scherzo: Molto vivace – Presto" (scherzo: very lively – very fast). The duration is about 12 minutes, but this may vary depending on whether two frequently omitted repeats are played. The second movement is a <a href="scherzo">scherzo and trio</a>. It is also in D minor, with the introduction bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%2029%20%28Beethoven%29">"Hammerklavier"</a> piano sonata, written a few years earlier. At times during the piece, Beethoven specifies one downbeat every three measures—perhaps because of the fast tempo—with the direction "ritmo di tre battute" (rhythm of three beats) and one beat every four measures with the direction "ritmo di quattro battute" (rhythm of four beats). Beethoven had been criticized before for failing to adhere to standard Classical form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics. Normally, a scherzo is in triple time. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time, but punctuated it in a way that, when coupled with the tempo, makes it sound as if it is in quadruple time.

While adhering to the standard <a href="ternary%20form">compound ternary design</a> (three-part structure) of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure; it is a complete <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a>. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition (the statement of the main melodic themes) starts out with a <a href="fugue">fugue</a> before modulating to the key of <a href="C%20major">C major</a> for the second part. The exposition then repeats before a short development section, where Beethoven explores other ideas. The recapitulation (repeating of the melodic themes heard in the opening of the movement) further develops the exposition's themes, also containing <a href="timpani">timpani</a> solos. A new development section leads to the repeat of the recapitulation, and the scherzo concludes with a brief <a href="Coda%20%28music%29%23Codetta">codetta</a>.
The contrasting trio section is in D major and in duple time. The trio is the first time the <a href="trombone">trombone</a>s play. Following the trio, the second occurrence of the scherzo, unlike the first, plays through without any repetition, after which there is a brief reprise of the trio, and the movement ends with an abrupt coda.

The third movement has the Italian performance instructions "Adagio molto e cantabile – Andante moderato – Tempo primo – Andante moderato – Adagio – Lo stesso tempo" (slowly and with a singing style – moderate walking pace – back to the first tempo – moderate walking pace – back to the first tempo). The duration is about 16 minutes. This is a lyrical, slow movement in B major, which is a <a href="minor%20sixth">minor sixth</a> away from the symphony's main key of D minor. It is in a loose <a href="variation%20%28music%29">variation</a> form, with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melodic ideas. The first variation, like the theme, is in 4/4 time, the second in 12/8. The variations are separated by passages in 3/4, the first in D major, the second in G major, The Third In E major, the Fourth in F♯ major, and the fifth in B major. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud fanfares from the full orchestra are answered by octaves by the first violins. A prominent <a href="French%20horn">French horn</a> solo is assigned to the fourth player.

Presto; Allegro molto assai (Alla marcia); Andante maestoso; Allegro energico, sempre ben marcato (very fast; quite fast (like a march); majestic walking tempo; fast and energetic, and always well accented). The duration is approximately 24 minutes.

The famous choral finale is Beethoven's musical representation of universal brotherhood. American pianist and music scholar <a href="Charles%20Rosen">Charles Rosen</a> has characterized it as a symphony within a symphony, played without interruption. This "inner symphony" follows the same overall pattern as the Ninth Symphony as a whole. The scheme is as follows:


The movement has a thematic unity in which every part is based on either the main theme, the "Seid umschlungen" theme, or some combination of the two.

The first "movement within a movement" itself is organized into sections:


The text is largely taken from <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Schiller</a>'s "<a href="Ode%20to%20Joy">Ode to Joy</a>", with a few additional introductory words written specifically by Beethoven (shown in italics).
The text, without repeats, is shown below, with a translation into English. The score includes many repeats. For the full libretto, including all repetitions, see German Wikisource.
Towards the end of the movement, the choir sings the last four lines of the main theme, concluding with ""Alle Menschen"" before the soloists sing for one last time the song of joy at a slower tempo. The chorus repeats parts of ""Seid umschlungen, Millionen!"", then quietly sings, ""Tochter aus Elysium"", and finally, ""Freude, schöner Götterfunken, Götterfunken!"".

Music critics almost universally consider the Ninth Symphony one of Beethoven's greatest works, and among the greatest musical works ever written. The finale, however, has had its detractors. "Early critics rejected [the finale] as cryptic and eccentric, the product of a deaf and aging composer." <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a> complained about the vocal writing; in a letter he wrote to Clarina Maffei dated 20 April 1878, he said the symphony was "marvelous in its first three movements, very badly set in the last. No one will ever surpass the sublimity of the first movement, but it will be an easy task to write as badly for voices as is done in the last movement."

Conductors in the "<a href="historically%20informed%20performance">historically informed performance</a>" movement, notably <a href="Roger%20Norrington">Roger Norrington</a>, have used Beethoven's suggested tempos, to mixed reviews. <a href="Benjamin%20Zander">Benjamin Zander</a> has made a case for following Beethoven's metronome markings, both in writing and in performances with the <a href="Boston%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Boston Philharmonic Orchestra</a> and Philharmonia Orchestra of London. While one account holds that Beethoven's metronome still exists and was tested and found accurate, a recent study finds that his metronome was likely damaged and out of calibration.

A number of conductors have made alterations in the instrumentation of the symphony. Notably, <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> doubled many woodwind passages, a modification greatly extended by <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a>, who revised the orchestration of the Ninth to make it sound like what he believed Beethoven would have wanted if given a modern orchestra. Wagner's Dresden performance of 1864 was the first to place the chorus and the solo singers behind the orchestra as has since become standard; previous conductors placed them between the orchestra and the audience.

Beethoven's writing for horns and trumpets throughout the symphony (mostly the 2nd horn and 2nd trumpet) is sometimes altered by performers to avoid large leaps (those of a 12th or more), as these are very difficult to perform on brass instruments and may be consistently and flawlessly executed only by highly proficient musicians.

Beethoven's indication that the 2nd bassoon should double the basses in measures 115–164 of the finale was not included in the Breitkopf parts, though it was included in the full score.

The British premiere was presented on 21 March 1825 by its commissioners, the <a href="Philharmonic%20Society%20of%20London">Philharmonic Society of London</a>, at its <a href="Argyll%20Rooms">Argyll Rooms</a> conducted by <a href="George%20Thomas%20Smart">Sir George Smart</a> and with the choral part sung in Italian. The American premiere was presented on 20 May 1846 by the newly formed <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a> at <a href="Castle%20Garden">Castle Garden</a> (in an attempt to raise funds for a new concert hall), conducted by the English-born <a href="George%20Loder">George Loder</a> with the choral part translated into English for the first time. The <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Choir">London Philharmonic Choir</a> debuted on 15 May 1947 performing the Ninth Symphony with the <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a> under the baton of <a href="Victor%20de%20Sabata">Victor de Sabata</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>. In 1951 <a href="Wilhelm%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler">Wilhelm Furtwängler</a> and the <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth Festival</a> Orchestra reopened the Bayreuth Festival with a performance of the symphony, after the Allies temporarily suspended the Festival following the Second World War.

Political significance has attached to Beethoven's Ninth: <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> conducted a version of the 9th at the <a href="Konzerthaus%20Berlin">Schauspielhaus</a> in East Berlin, with "" (Freedom) replacing "" (Joy), to celebrate the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Berlin%20Wall">fall of the Berlin Wall</a> during Christmas 1989. This concert was performed by an orchestra and chorus made up of many nationalities: from both Germanies, the <a href="Bavarian%20Radio%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra</a> and Chorus, the Chorus of the <a href="Berlin%20Radio%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20%28East%20Berlin%29">Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra</a>, and members of the <a href="S%C3%A4chsische%20Staatskapelle%20Dresden">Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden</a>, the Philharmonischer Kinderchor Dresden; from the Soviet Union, members of the orchestra of the <a href="Kirov%20Theatre">Kirov Theatre</a>; from the United Kingdom, members of the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>; from the USA, members of the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a>; and from France, members of the <a href="Orchestre%20de%20Paris">Orchestre de Paris</a>. Soloists were <a href="June%20Anderson">June Anderson</a>, soprano, <a href="Sarah%20Walker%20%28mezzo-soprano%29">Sarah Walker</a>, mezzo-soprano, <a href="Klaus%20K%C3%B6nig">Klaus König</a>, tenor, and <a href="Jan-Hendrik%20Rootering">Jan-Hendrik Rootering</a>, bass. It was the last time that Bernstein conducted the symphony; he died ten months later.

American conductor <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> made his first recording of the Beethoven Ninth in 1964 with the New York Philharmonic, for <a href="Columbia%20Masterworks">Columbia Masterworks</a>, with soloists <a href="Martina%20Arroyo">Martina Arroyo</a> (soprano), <a href="Regina%20Sarfaty">Regina Sarfaty</a> (mezzo), <a href="Nicholas%20di%20Virgilio">Nicholas di Virgilio</a> (tenor), Norman Scott (bass), and the <a href="Juilliard">Juilliard</a> Chorus. It was later reissued on CD. It was the first of three complete recordings of the Ninth that Bernstein made. He made his second recording of the piece with the <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic">Vienna Philharmonic</a> for <a href="Deutsche%20Grammophon">Deutsche Grammophon</a>, in 1979. This second one featured <a href="Gwyneth%20Jones%20%28soprano%29">Gwyneth Jones</a> (soprano), <a href="Hanna%20Schwarz">Hanna Schwarz</a> (mezzo), <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Kollo">René Kollo</a> (tenor), and <a href="Kurt%20Moll">Kurt Moll</a> (bass), with the chorus of the <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Vienna State Opera</a>. Sir <a href="Georg%20Solti">Georg Solti</a> recorded the symphony with the <a href="Chicago%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Chicago Symphony Orchestra</a> and <a href="Chicago%20Symphony%20Chorus">Chicago Symphony Chorus</a> on two occasions: first in 1972 with soloists <a href="Pilar%20Lorengar">Pilar Lorengar</a>, <a href="Yvonne%20Minton">Yvonne Minton</a>, <a href="Stuart%20Burrows">Stuart Burrows</a>, and <a href="Martti%20Talvela">Martti Talvela</a>; and again in 1986 with soloists <a href="Jessye%20Norman">Jessye Norman</a>, Reinhild Runkel, Robert Schunk, and <a href="Hans%20Sotin">Hans Sotin</a>. On both occasions, the chorus was prepared by <a href="Margaret%20Hillis">Margaret Hillis</a>. The second recording won the <a href="Grammy%20Awards%20of%201988">1987 Grammy Award</a> for Best Orchestral Performance.
There have been various attempts to record the Ninth to come closer to what Beethoven's contemporaries would have heard, i.e., with "period instruments". <a href="Roger%20Norrington">Roger Norrington</a> conducting the <a href="London%20Classical%20Players">London Classical Players</a> recorded it with period instruments for a 1987 release by EMI Records (rereleased in 1997 under the Virgin Classics label). <a href="Benjamin%20Zander">Benjamin Zander</a> made a 1992 recording of the Ninth with the <a href="Boston%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Boston Philharmonic Orchestra</a> and noted soprano Dominique Labelle (who first performed the work with Robert Shaw), following Beethoven's own metronome markings. Twelve years later after Norrington, <a href="Philippe%20Herreweghe">Philippe Herreweghe</a> recorded the Ninth with his <a href="period%20instruments">period-instrument</a> <a href="Orchestre%20des%20Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es">Orchestre des Champs-Élysées</a> and his <a href="Collegium%20Vocale%20Gent">Collegium Vocale</a> chorus for <a href="Harmonia%20Mundi">Harmonia Mundi</a> in 1999. Sir <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a> recorded his period-instrument version of the Ninth Symphony, conducting his <a href="Monteverdi%20Choir">Monteverdi Choir</a> and <a href="Orchestre%20R%C3%A9volutionnaire%20et%20Romantique">Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique</a> in 1992. It was first released by <a href="Deutsche%20Grammophon">Deutsche Grammophon</a> in 1994 on their early music Archiv Produktion label as part of his complete cycle of the Beethoven symphonies. His soloists included <a href="%C4%BDuba%20Orgon%C3%A1%C5%A1ov%C3%A1">Ľuba Orgonášová</a>, <a href="Anne%20Sofie%20von%20Otter">Anne Sofie von Otter</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Rolfe%20Johnson">Anthony Rolfe Johnson</a> and <a href="Gilles%20Cachemaille">Gilles Cachemaille</a>. An additional period-instrument recording by <a href="Christopher%20Hogwood">Christopher Hogwood</a> and the <a href="Academy%20of%20Ancient%20Music">Academy of Ancient Music</a> was released in 1997 under the label <a href="%C3%89ditions%20de%20l%27Oiseau-Lyre">Éditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre</a>.

At 79 minutes, one of the longest Ninths recorded is <a href="Karl%20B%C3%B6hm">Karl Böhm</a>'s, conducting the <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic">Vienna Philharmonic</a> in 1981 with <a href="Jessye%20Norman">Jessye Norman</a> and <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a> among the soloists.

Many later composers of the Romantic period and beyond were influenced specifically by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

An important theme in the finale of Johannes Brahms' <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Brahms%29">Symphony No. 1 in C minor</a> is related to the "Ode to Joy" theme from the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. When this was pointed out to <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>, he is reputed to have retorted "Any fool can see that!" Brahms's first symphony was, at times, both praised and derided as "Beethoven's Tenth".

The Ninth Symphony influenced the forms that <a href="Anton%20Bruckner">Bruckner</a> used for the movements of his symphonies. Bruckner's <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Bruckner%29">Symphony No. 3</a> is in the same D minor key as Beethoven's 9th and makes substantial use of thematic ideas from it. The colossal slow movement of Bruckner's <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Bruckner%29">Symphony No. 7</a>, "as usual", takes the same A–B–A–B–A form as the 3rd movement of Beethoven's symphony, and also uses some figuration from it.

In the opening notes of the third movement of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k%29">Symphony No. 9</a> (The "New World"), <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Antonín Dvořák</a> pays homage to the <a href="scherzo">scherzo</a> of this symphony with his falling fourths and timpani strokes.

Likewise, <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Béla Bartók</a> borrows the opening motif of the <a href="Scherzo">Scherzo</a> from Beethoven's Ninth symphony to introduce the second movement Scherzo in his own, Four Orchestral Pieces, Op. 12 (<a href="Andr%C3%A1s%20Sz%C5%91ll%C5%91sy">Sz</a> 51).

One legend is that the <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a> was deliberately designed to have a 74-minute playing so that it could accommodate Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. <a href="Kees%20Immink">Kees Immink</a>, Philips' chief engineer, who developed the CD, recalls that a commercial <a href="tug-of-war%23Terminology">tug-of-war</a> between the development partners, Sony and Philips, led to a settlement in a neutral 12-cm diameter format. The 1951 performance of the Ninth Symphony conducted by <a href="Wilhelm%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler">Furtwängler</a> was brought forward as the perfect excuse for the change, and was put forth in a Philips news release celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Compact Disc as the reason for the 74-minute length.

In the film "<a href="The%20Pervert%27s%20Guide%20to%20Ideology">The Pervert's Guide to Ideology</a>", the psychoanalytical Communist philosopher <a href="Slavoj%20%C5%BDi%C5%BEek">Slavoj Žižek</a> comments on the use of the Ode by <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>, <a href="Bolshevism">Bolshevism</a>, the Chinese <a href="Cultural%20Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, the East-West German Olympic team, <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>, <a href="Abimael%20Guzm%C3%A1n">Abimael Guzmán</a> (leader of the <a href="Shining%20Path">Shining Path</a>), and the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a> and the <a href="Symbols%20of%20the%20European%20Union">European Union</a>.

During the division of Germany in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the "Ode to Joy" segment of the symphony was also played in lieu of an anthem at the Olympic Games for the <a href="Unified%20Team%20of%20Germany">Unified Team of Germany</a> between 1956 and 1968. In 1972, the musical backing (without the words) was adopted as the <a href="Anthem%20of%20Europe">Anthem of Europe</a> by the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a> and subsequently by the <a href="European%20Communities">European Communities</a> (now the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>) in 1985. The "Ode to Joy" was used as the national anthem of <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> between 1974 and 1979, as "<a href="Rise%2C%20O%20Voices%20of%20Rhodesia">Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia</a>".

In 1907, the Presbyterian pastor <a href="Henry%20van%20Dyke">Henry van Dyke</a> wrote the hymn "<a href="The%20Hymn%20of%20Joy">Joyful, Joyful, we adore thee</a>" while staying at <a href="Williams%20College">Williams College</a>. The hymn is commonly sung in English-language churches to the "Ode to Joy" melody from this symphony.

The <a href="Trade%20unions%20in%20Germany">German</a> <a href="workers%27%20movement">workers' movement</a> began the tradition of performing the Ninth Symphony on <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a> in 1918. Performances started at 11pm so that the symphony's finale would be played at the beginning of the new year. This tradition continued during the Nazi period and was also observed by East Germany after the war.

The Ninth Symphony is traditionally performed throughout Japan at the end of the year. In December 2009, for example, there were 55 performances of the symphony by various major orchestras and choirs in Japan.

It was introduced to Japan during World War I by German prisoners held at the <a href="Band%C5%8D%20prisoner-of-war%20camp">Bandō prisoner-of-war camp</a>. Japanese orchestras, notably the <a href="NHK%20Symphony%20Orchestra">NHK Symphony Orchestra</a>, began performing the symphony in 1925 and during World War II, the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Imperial government</a> promoted performances of the symphony, including on New Year's Eve. In an effort to capitalize on its popularity, orchestras and choruses undergoing economic hard times during Japan's reconstruction, performed the piece at year's end. In the 1960s, these year-end performances of the symphony became more widespread, and included the participation of local choirs and orchestras, firmly establishing a tradition that continues today.

Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)

<a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Opus%20number">Opus</a> 1 is a set of three <a href="piano%20trio">piano trio</a>s (written for <a href="piano">piano</a>, <a href="violin">violin</a>, and <a href="cello">cello</a>), first performed in 1795 in the house of <a href="Karl%20Alois%20Johann-Nepomuk%20Vinzenz%2C%20F%C3%BCrst%20Lichnowsky">Prince Lichnowsky</a>, to whom they are dedicated. The trios were published in 1795.

Despite the Op. 1 designation, these trios were not Beethoven's first published compositions; this 
distinction belongs rather to his <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven%23Background%20and%20early%20life">"Dressler Variations" for keyboard (WoO 63)</a>. Clearly he recognized these compositions as the earliest ones he had produced that were substantial enough (and marketable enough) to fill out a first major publication to introduce his style of writing to the musical public. 




Unlike the other piano trios in this opus, the third trio does not have a scherzo as its third movement but a minuet instead.

This third piano trio was later reworked by Beethoven into the <a href="String%20Quintet%2C%20Op.%20104%20%28Beethoven%29">C minor string quintet, Op. 104</a>.

Piano Trios, Op. 70 (Beethoven)

Opus 70 is a set of two <a href="Piano%20Trio">Piano Trio</a>s by <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>, written for <a href="piano">piano</a>, <a href="violin">violin</a>, and <a href="cello">cello</a>. Both trios were composed during Beethoven's stay at Countess Marie von Erdödy's estate, and both are dedicated to her for her hospitality. They were published in 1809.

The first, in D major, known as the "Ghost", is one of his best known works in the genre (rivaled only by the "<a href="Piano%20Trio%20No.%207%20%28Beethoven%29">Archduke Trio</a>"). The D major trio features themes found in the second movement of <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's Symphony No. 2</a>. The <a href="AllMusic">All-Music Guide</a> states that "because of its strangely scored and undeniably eerie-sounding slow movement, it was dubbed the 'Ghost' Trio. The name has stuck with the work ever since. The ghostly music may have had its roots in sketches for a Macbeth opera that Beethoven was contemplating at the time."

These pieces are representative of Beethoven's "Middle" stylistic period, which went from roughly 1803 to 1812, and which included many of his most famous works. Beethoven wrote the two piano trios while spending the summer of 1808 in <a href="Heiligenstadt%2C%20Vienna">Heiligenstadt, Vienna</a>, where he had completed his <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Beethoven%29">Symphony No. 5</a> the previous summer. He wrote the two trios immediately after finishing his "Sinfonia pastorale", <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Beethoven%29">Symphony No. 6</a>. This was a period of uncertainty in Beethoven's life, in particular because he had no dependable source of income at the time.

Although these two trios are sometimes numbered as "No. 5" and "No. 6", the numbering of Beethoven's twelve piano trios is not standardized, and in other sources the two Op. 70 trios may be shown as having different numbers, if any.



The second movement is in <a href="double%20variation">double variation</a> form.

Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)

The Piano Trio in <a href="B-flat%20major">B-flat major</a>, <a href="Opus%20number">Op</a>. 97, by <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> is a <a href="piano%20trio">piano trio</a> completed in 1811. It is commonly referred to as the Archduke Trio, because it was dedicated to <a href="Archduke%20Rudolf%20of%20Austria%20%281788%E2%80%931831%29">Archduke Rudolph of Austria</a>, the youngest of twelve children of <a href="Leopold%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Rudolf was an amateur pianist and a patron, friend, and composition student of Beethoven. Beethoven dedicated a total of fourteen compositions to the Archduke, who dedicated one of his own to Beethoven in return.

The trio was written late in the Beethoven's so-called "middle period". He began composing it in the summer of 1810, and completed it in March 1811.

Although the "Archduke Trio" is sometimes numbered as "No. 7", the numbering of Beethoven's twelve piano trios is not standardized, and in other sources the Op. 97 trio may be shown as having a different number, if any.

The first public performance was given by Beethoven himself, <a href="Ignaz%20Schuppanzigh">Ignaz Schuppanzigh</a> (violin) and <a href="Josef%20Linke">Josef Linke</a> (cello) at the Viennese hotel "Zum römischen Kaiser" on 11 April 1814, as his deafness continued to encroach upon his ability as a performer. After a repeat of the work a few weeks later, Beethoven did not appear again in public as a pianist.

The violinist and composer <a href="Louis%20Spohr">Louis Spohr</a> witnessed a rehearsal of the work, and wrote: "On account of his deafness there was scarcely anything left of the virtuosity of the artist which had formerly been so greatly admired. In "forte" passages the poor deaf man pounded on the keys until the strings jangled, and in "piano" he played so softly that whole groups of notes were omitted, so that the music was unintelligible unless one could look into the pianoforte part. I was deeply saddened at so hard a fate."

The pianist and composer <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Ignaz Moscheles</a> attended the first performance, and wrote about the work: "In the case of how many compositions is the word "new" misapplied! But never in Beethoven's, and least of all in this, which again is full of originality. His playing, aside from its intellectual element, satisfied me less, being wanting in clarity and precision; but I observed many traces of the grand style of playing which I had long recognized in his compositions."

The work is in four <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movements</a>:


A typical performance runs approximately 40 minutes in length.

Violin Sonata No. 5 (Beethoven)

The Violin Sonata No. 5 in <a href="F%20major">F major</a>, Opus 24, is a <a href="violin%20sonata">violin sonata</a> by <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>. It is often known as the "Spring Sonata" ("Frühlingssonate"), and was published in <a href="1801%20in%20music">1801</a>. Its dedicatee was <a href="Count%20Moritz%20von%20Fries">Count Moritz von Fries</a>, a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the <a href="String%20Quintet%2C%20Op.%2029%20%28Beethoven%29">C major string quintet</a> and the <a href="Violin%20Sonata%20No.%204%20%28Beethoven%29">fourth violin sonata</a>—as well as his later <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Beethoven%29">seventh symphony</a>.

The work is in four movements:


The "Scherzo" and its trio are particularly brief. The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform. The name "Spring Sonata" was given to it after Beethoven's death.

The "Allegro" movement is featured in the stage show "<a href="Fame%20%28musical%29">Fame</a>".

Barratry (common law)

Barratry ( ) is a legal term with several meanings. In <a href="common%20law">common law</a>, barratry is the offense committed by people who are "overly officious in instigating or encouraging prosecution of groundless litigation" or who bring "repeated or persistent acts of litigation" for the purposes of profit or harassment. It is a crime in some jurisdictions. If litigation is for the purpose of silencing critics, it is known as a <a href="strategic%20lawsuit%20against%20public%20participation">strategic lawsuit against public participation</a> (SLAPP). Jurisdictions that otherwise have no barratry laws may have SLAPP laws.

In Australia, the term barratry is predominantly used in the first sense of a frivolous or harassing litigant. The concept has fallen into disuse in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>.

The offence of being a common barrator was abolished in New South Wales by Section 4A of the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993.

In Canada, barratry, alongside all <a href="Common%20law%20offence">common law offences</a> except <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a>, were abolished by the 1953 consolidation of the <a href="Criminal%20Code%20%28Canada%29">Criminal Code</a>.

In <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a> the <a href="common%20law%20offence">common law offence</a> of being a common barrator was abolished by section 13(1)(a) of the <a href="Criminal%20Law%20Act%201967">Criminal Law Act 1967</a>.

Being a common barrator was an offence under the <a href="common%20law">common law</a> of England. It was classified as a <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a>. It consisted of "persistently stirring up quarrels in the Courts or out of them". It is uncertain whether, in the ordinary way, persons charged with commission of the offence were dealt with by <a href="indictment">indictment</a>.

In 1966, the <a href="Law%20Commission%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Law Commission</a> recommended for the offence to be abolished. It said that there had been no indictments for this offence for "many years" and that, as an indictable misdemeanor, it was "wholly obsolete". Its recommendation was implemented by the Criminal Law Act 1967.

In Scots law, barratry referred to the crime committed by a judge who is induced by bribery to pronounce judgment.

Several jurisdictions in the United States have declared barratry (in the sense of a frivolous or harassing litigant) to be a <a href="crime">crime</a> as part of their <a href="tort%20reform">tort reform</a> efforts. For example, in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a>s of <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, barratry is a <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a>. In <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, barratry is a misdemeanor on the first conviction, but a <a href="felony">felony</a> on subsequent convictions.


In his "<a href="Inferno%20%28Dante%29">Inferno</a>", Canto XXI, <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a> places barrators in the Eighth Circle, fifth bolgia of <a href="Hell">Hell</a>.

Bomber

A bomber is a <a href="combat%20aircraft">combat aircraft</a> designed to attack ground and naval targets by dropping <a href="air-to-ground%20weaponry">air-to-ground weaponry</a> (such as <a href="bombshells">bombshells</a>), firing <a href="aerial%20torpedo">torpedoes</a> and bullets or deploying <a href="air-launched%20cruise%20missile">air-launched cruise missile</a>s.

<a href="Strategic%20bombing">Strategic bombing</a> is done by <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a>s primarily designed for long-range bombing missions against <a href="strategic%20target">strategic target</a>s such as supply bases, bridges, factories, shipyards, and cities themselves, in order to diminish the enemy's ability to wage war by limiting access to resources through crippling infrastructure or reducing industrial output. Current examples include the strategic <a href="nuclear%20bomb">nuclear-armed</a> <a href="strategic%20bomber">strategic bomber</a>s: <a href="B-2%20Spirit">B-2 Spirit</a>, <a href="B-52%20Stratofortress">B-52 Stratofortress</a>, <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-95">Tupolev Tu-95</a> 'Bear', <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-22M">Tupolev Tu-22M</a> 'Backfire'; historically notable examples are the: <a href="Gotha%20G.IV">Gotha G.IV</a>, <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a>, <a href="Heinkel%20He-111">Heinkel He-111</a>, <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Junkers Ju 88</a>, <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a>, <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a>, <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a>, and <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-16">Tupolev Tu-16</a> 'Badger'.

<a href="Tactical%20bombing">Tactical bombing</a>, aimed at countering enemy military activity and in supporting offensive operations, is typically assigned to smaller aircraft operating at shorter ranges, typically near the troops on the ground or against enemy shipping. This role is filled by <a href="tactical%20bomber">tactical bomber</a> class, which crosses and blurs with various other aircraft categories: <a href="light%20bomber">light bomber</a>s, <a href="medium%20bomber">medium bomber</a>s, <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s, <a href="interdictor">interdictor</a>s, <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a>s, <a href="attack%20aircraft">attack aircraft</a>, <a href="multirole%20combat%20aircraft">multirole combat aircraft</a>, and others.


The first use of an air-dropped bomb (actually a hand grenade) was carried out by Italian Lieutenant <a href="Giulio%20Gavotti">Giulio Gavotti</a> during the <a href="Italo-Turkish%20War">1911 Italo-Turkish war in Libya</a>, although his plane was not designed for the task of bombing, and his improvised attack had little impact.

In 1912, during the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a>, <a href="Bulgarian%20Air%20Force">Bulgarian Air Force</a> <a href="Aviator">pilot</a> <a href="Christo%20Toprakchiev">Christo Toprakchiev</a> suggested the use of aircraft to drop "bombs" (called <a href="grenade">grenade</a>s in the Bulgarian army at this time) on Turkish positions. <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">Captain</a> <a href="Simeon%20Petrov">Simeon Petrov</a> developed the idea and created several <a href="prototype">prototype</a>s by adapting different types of grenades and increasing their payload.

On 16 October 1912, observer <a href="Prodan%20Tarakchiev">Prodan Tarakchiev</a> dropped two of those bombs on the <a href="Turkey">Turkish</a> railway station of Karağaç (near the besieged <a href="Edirne">Edirne</a>) from an <a href="Albatros%20Flugzeugwerke">Albatros</a> F.2 aircraft piloted by <a href="Radul%20Milkov">Radul Milkov</a>, for the first time in this campaign. This is deemed to be the first use of an aircraft as a bomber.
The first heavier-than-air aircraft purposely designed for bombing were the <a href="Italy">Italian</a> <a href="Caproni%20Ca%2030">Caproni Ca 30</a> and <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="Bristol%20T.B.8">Bristol T.B.8</a>, both of 1913. The Bristol T.B.8 was an early <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> single <a href="Piston%20engine">engined</a> <a href="biplane">biplane</a> built by the <a href="Bristol%20Aeroplane%20Company">Bristol Aeroplane Company</a>. They were fitted with a prismatic <a href="Bombsight">Bombsight</a> in the front <a href="cockpit">cockpit</a> and a cylindrical bomb carrier in the lower forward fuselage capable of carrying twelve 10 lb (4.5 kg) bombs, which could be dropped singly or as a salvo as required.

The aircraft was purchased for use both by the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC), and three T.B.8s, that were being displayed in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> during December 1913 fitted with bombing equipment, were sent to France following the outbreak of war. Under the command of <a href="Charles%20Rumney%20Samson">Charles Rumney Samson</a>, a bombing attack on <a href="Germany">German</a> gun batteries at <a href="Middelkerke">Middelkerke</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> was executed on 25 November 1914.

The dirigible, or airship, was developed in the early 20th century. Early airships were prone to disaster, but slowly the airship became more dependable, with a more rigid structure and stronger skin. Prior to the outbreak of war, <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>s, a larger and more streamlined form of <a href="airship">airship</a> designed by German Count <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Zeppelin">Ferdinand von Zeppelin</a>, were outfitted to carry bombs to attack targets at long range. These were the first long range, strategic bombers. Although the German air arm was strong, with a total of 123 airships by the end of the war, they were vulnerable to attack and engine failure, as well as navigational issues. German airships inflicted little damage on all 51 raids, with 557 Britons killed and 1,358 injured. The German Navy lost 53 of its 73 airships, and the German Army lost 26 of its 50 ships.

The Caproni Ca 30 was built by <a href="Gianni%20Caproni">Gianni Caproni</a> in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. It was a twin-boom <a href="biplane">biplane</a> with three 67 kW (80 hp) <a href="Gnome%20rotary%20engine">Gnome rotary engine</a>s and first flew in October <a href="1914%20in%20aviation">1914</a>. Test flights revealed power to be insufficient and the engine layout unworkable, and Caproni soon adopted a more conventional approach installing three 81 kW (110 hp) <a href="Fiat%20A.10">Fiat A.10</a>s. The improved design was bought by the <a href="Italian%20Army">Italian Army</a> and it was delivered in quantity from August <a href="1915%20in%20aviation">1915</a>.

While mainly used as a <a href="Trainer%20%28aircraft%29">trainer</a>, Avro 504s were also briefly used as bombers at the start of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> by the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> (RNAS) when they were used for raids on the German airship sheds.

Bombing raids and interdiction operations were mainly carried out by French and British forces during the War as the <a href="Luftstreitkr%C3%A4fte">German air arm</a> was forced to concentrate its resources on a defensive strategy. Notably, bombing campaigns formed a part of the British offensive at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Neuve%20Chapelle">Battle of Neuve Chapelle</a> in 1915, with <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> squadrons attacking German railway 
stations in an attempt to hinder the logistical supply of the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German army</a>. The early, improvised attempts at bombing that characterized the early part of the war slowly gave way to a more organized and systematic approach to strategic and tactical bombing, pioneered by various air power strategists of the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Entente</a>, especially Major <a href="Hugh%20Trenchard">Hugh Trenchard</a>; he was the first to advocate that there should be "... sustained [strategic bombing] attacks with a view to interrupting the enemy's railway communications ... in conjunction with the main operations of the Allied Armies."

When the war started, bombing was very crude (hand-held bombs were thrown over the side) yet by the end of the war long-range bombers equipped with complex mechanical bombing computers were being built, 
designed to carry large loads to destroy enemy industrial targets. The most important bombers used in World War I were the French <a href="Breguet%2014">Breguet 14</a>, British <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH-4">de Havilland DH-4</a>, German <a href="Albatros%20C.III">Albatros C.III</a> and Russian 
<a href="Sikorsky%20Ilya%20Muromets">Sikorsky Ilya Muromets</a>. The <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> <a href="Sikorsky%20Ilya%20Muromets">Sikorsky Ilya Muromets</a>, was the first four-engine bomber to equip a dedicated strategic bombing unit during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. This heavy bomber was unrivaled in the early stages of the war, as the Central Powers had no comparable aircraft until much later.

Long range bombing raids were carried out at night by multi-engine <a href="biplane">biplane</a>s such as the <a href="Gotha%20G.IV">Gotha G.IV</a> (whose name was synonymous with all multi-engine German bombers) and later the <a href="Handley%20Page%20Type%20O">Handley Page Type O</a>; the majority of bombing was done by single-engined biplanes with one or two crew members flying short distances to attack enemy lines and immediate hinterland. As the effectiveness of a bomber was dependent on the weight and accuracy of its bomb load, ever larger bombers were developed starting in World War I, while considerable money was spent developing suitable bombsights.

With engine power as a major limitation, combined with the desire for accuracy and other operational factors, bomber designs tended to be tailored to specific roles. By the start of the war this included:


Bombers are not intended to attack other aircraft although most were fitted with defensive weapons. World War II saw the beginning of the widespread use of high speed bombers which dispensed with defensive weapons to be able to attain higher speed, such as with the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a>, a philosophy that continued with many Cold War bombers.

Some smaller designs have been used as the basis for <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a>s, and a number of fighters, such as the <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> were used as ground attack aircraft, replacing earlier conventional light bombers that proved unable to defend themselves while carrying a useful bomb load.

At the start of the Cold War, bombers were the only means of carrying <a href="Nuclear%20warfare">nuclear</a> weapons to enemy targets, and had the role of <a href="deterrence%20theory">deterrence</a>. With the advent of guided air-to-air missiles, bombers needed to avoid interception. High-speed and high-altitude flying became a means of evading detection and attack. Designs such as the <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> could fly faster or higher than contemporary fighters. When surface-to-air missiles became capable of hitting high-flying bombers, bombers were flown at low altitudes to evade radar detection and interception.

Once "stand off" nuclear weapon designs were developed, bombers did not need to pass over the target to make an attack; they could fire and turn away to escape the blast. Nuclear strike aircraft were generally finished in bare metal or <a href="anti-flash%20white">anti-flash white</a> to minimize absorption of <a href="thermal%20radiation">thermal radiation</a> from the <a href="Effects%20of%20nuclear%20explosions">flash</a> of a <a href="nuclear%20explosion">nuclear explosion</a>. The need to drop conventional bombs remained in conflicts with non-nuclear powers, such as the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> or <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>.

The development of large strategic bombers stagnated in the later part of the Cold War because of spiraling costs and the development of the <a href="Intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">Intercontinental ballistic missile</a> (ICBM) – which was felt to have similar deterrent value while being impossible to intercept. Because of this, the United States Air Force <a href="XB-70%20Valkyrie">XB-70 Valkyrie</a> program was cancelled in the early 1960s; the later <a href="B-1%20Lancer">B-1B Lancer</a> and <a href="B-2%20Spirit">B-2 Spirit</a> aircraft entered service only after protracted political and development problems. Their high cost meant that few were built and the 1950s-designed B-52s are projected to remain in use until the 2040s. Similarly, the Soviet Union used the intermediate-range <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-22M">Tu-22M</a> 'Backfire'in the 1970s, but their <a href="Mach%20number">Mach 3</a> bomber project stalled. The Mach 2 <a href="Tu-160">Tu-160 'Blackjack'</a> was built only in tiny numbers, leaving the 1950s Tupolev Tu-16 and <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-95">Tu-95</a> 'Bear' heavy bombers to continue being used into the 21st century.
The <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> strategic bombing force largely came to an end when the <a href="V%20bomber">V bomber</a> force was phased out; the last of which left service in 1983. The French <a href="Mirage%20IV">Mirage IV</a> bomber version was retired in 1996, although the Mirage 2000N and the Rafale have taken on this role. The only other nation that fields strategic bombing forces is <a href="China">China</a>, which has a number of <a href="Xian%20H-6">Xian H-6</a>s.

In modern air forces, the distinction between bombers, fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that "look" like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Indeed, the design qualities that make an effective low-level attack aircraft make for a distinctly inferior air superiority fighter, and vice versa. Conversely, many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks,' despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.

At present, the U.S. and Russia are involved in developing replacements for their legacy bomber fleets, the USAF with the <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20B-21">Northrop Grumman B-21</a> and the Russian Air Force with the <a href="PAK%20DA">PAK DA</a>. A 1999 USAF report calls for the US bomber fleet to remain in service until the late 2030s-early 2040s, and the B-21 is scheduled to reach deployment in the 2020s. The U.S. is also considering another <a href="2037%20Bomber">bomber in 2037</a>. The B-21, however, required to provide an answer to the fifth generation defense systems (such as <a href="SA-21%20Growler">SA-21 Growler</a>s, <a href="bistatic%20radar">bistatic radar</a> and <a href="active%20electronically%20scanned%20array">active electronically scanned array</a> radar). Also, it has been chosen to be able to stand against rising superpowers and other countries with semi-advanced military capability. Finally, a third reason is the role of long-term air support for areas with a low threat level (Iraq, Afghanistan), the latter referred to as close air support for the global <a href="war%20on%20terror">war on terror</a> (CAS for GWOT). The B-21 would thus be able to stay for extended periods on a same location (called persistence).

Cue sports

Cue sports (sometimes written cuesports), also known as billiard sports, 
are a wide variety of <a href="Game%20of%20skill">games of skill</a> generally played with a <a href="cue%20stick">cue stick</a>, which is used to strike <a href="billiard%20ball">billiard ball</a>s and thereby cause them to move around a <a href="Baize">cloth</a>-covered <a href="billiards%20table">billiards table</a> bounded by elastic bumpers known as .

Historically, the umbrella term was billiards. While that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games, the word's usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world. For example, in <a href="British%20English">British</a> and <a href="Australian%20English">Australian English</a>, "billiards" usually refers exclusively to the game of <a href="English%20billiards">English billiards</a>, while in <a href="American%20English">American</a> and <a href="Canadian%20English">Canadian English</a> it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games, or to all cue games in general, depending upon <a href="List%20of%20dialects%20of%20the%20English%20language">dialect</a> and context.

There are 3 major subdivisions of games within cue sports:


There are other variants that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games played with disks instead of balls.

Billiards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the body of <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, in her billiard table cover in 1586, through its many mentions in the works of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, including the famous line "let's to billiards" in "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>" (1606–07), and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as: <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a>, <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>, <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a>, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, French president <a href="Jules%20Gr%C3%A9vy">Jules Grévy</a>, <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href="George%20Armstrong%20Custer">George Armstrong Custer</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>, <a href="W.%20C.%20Fields">W.C. Fields</a>, <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>, and <a href="Jackie%20Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a>.

All cue sports are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stick-and-ball <a href="lawn%20game">lawn game</a>s (retroactively termed <a href="ground%20billiards">ground billiards</a>), and as such to be related to the historical games <a href="jeu%20de%20mail">jeu de mail</a> and <a href="palle-malle">palle-malle</a>, and modern <a href="trucco">trucco</a>, <a href="croquet">croquet</a> and golf, and more distantly to the stickless <a href="bocce">bocce</a> and <a href="bowls%20%28sport%29">bowls</a>.
The word "billiard" may have evolved from the French word "billart" or "billette", meaning "stick", in reference to the , an implement similar to a <a href="Golf%20club%20%28equipment%29">golf club</a>, which was the forerunner to the modern <a href="Cue%20stick">cue</a>; the term's origin may have also been from French "bille", meaning "ball". The modern term "cue sports" can be used to encompass the ancestral mace games, and even the modern cueless variants, such as finger billiards, for historical reasons. "Cue" itself came from "queue", the French word for a <a href="tail">tail</a>. This refers to the early practice of using the tail of the mace to strike the ball when it lay against a .
A recognizable form of billiards was played outdoors in the 1340s, and was reminiscent of croquet. King <a href="Louis%20XI%20of%20France">Louis XI of France</a> (1461–1483) had the first known indoor billiard table. <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a> further refined and popularized the game, and it swiftly spread among the French nobility. While the game had long been played on the ground, this version appears to have died out in the 17th century, in favor of croquet, golf and bowling games, while table billiards had grown in popularity as an indoor activity. <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, claimed that her "table de billiard" had been taken away by those who eventually became her executioners (and who covered her body with the table's cloth). In 1588, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a>, owned a "billyard bord coered with a greene cloth... three billyard sticks and 11 balls of yvery". Billiards grew to the extent that by 1727, it was being played in almost every Paris café, and was played by the French nobility until the <a href="French%20Revolution">Revolution</a>. In England, the game was developing into a very popular activity for members of the gentry.

By 1670, the thin butt end of the mace began to be used not only for shots under the cushion (which itself was originally only there as a preventative method to stop balls from rolling off), but players increasingly preferred it for other shots as well. The cue as it is known today was finally developed by about 1800.

Initially, the mace was used to push the balls, rather than strike them. The newly developed striking cue provided a new challenge. Cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow the balls to rebound, in order to enhance the appeal of the game. After a transitional period where only the better players would use cues, the cue came to be the first choice of equipment.

The demand for tables and other equipment was initially met in Europe by John Thurston and other furniture makers of the era. The early balls were made from wood and <a href="clay">clay</a>, but the rich preferred to use <a href="ivory">ivory</a>.

Early billiard games involved various pieces of additional equipment, including the "arch" (related to the croquet hoop), "port" (a different hoop) and "king" (a pin or skittle near the arch) in the 1770s, but other game variants, relying on the cushions (and eventually on pockets cut into them), were being formed that would go on to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards.
The early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of the <a href="carom%20billiards">carom or carambole billiards</a> category – what most non-<a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> and non-US speakers mean by the word "billiards". These games, which once completely dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in many areas over the last few generations, are games played with three or sometimes four balls, on a table without holes (and without obstructions or targets in most cases), in which the goal is generally to strike one with a , then have the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the cushions and strike a second object ball. Variations include <a href="three-cushion">three-cushion</a>, <a href="Balkline%20and%20straight%20rail">straight rail and the balkline variants</a>, <a href="cushion%20caroms">cushion caroms</a>, <a href="five-pins">five-pins</a>, and <a href="Four-ball%20billiards">four-ball</a>, among others.

Over time, a type of obstacle returned, originally as a hazard and later as a target, in the form of <a href="Billiards%20table%23Pocket%20billiards%20tables">pockets</a>, or holes partly cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions, leading to the rise of <a href="pocket%20billiards">pocket billiards</a>, including "pool" games such as eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool and <a href="one-pocket">one-pocket</a>; <a href="Russian%20pyramid">Russian pyramid</a>; <a href="snooker">snooker</a>; <a href="English%20billiards">English billiards</a> and others.

In the United States pool and billiards had died out for a bit, but between 1878 and 1956 pool and billiards became very popular. Players in annual championships began to receive their own <a href="cigarette%20card">cigarette card</a>s. This was mainly due to the fact that it was a popular pastime for troops to take their minds off from battle. However, by the end of World War II pool and billiards began to die down once again. It was not until 1961 when the film "The Hustler" came out that sparked a new interest in the game. Now the game is generally a well-known game and has many players of all different skill levels.

The games with regulated international professional competition, if not others, have been referred to as "sports" or "sporting" events, not simply "games", since 1893 at the latest. Quite a variety of particular games (i.e., sets of rules and equipment) are the subject of present-day competition, including many of those already mentioned, with competition being especially broad in nine-ball, snooker, three-cushion and eight-ball.

Snooker, though technically a pocket billiards variant and closely related in its equipment and origin to the game of English billiards, is a professional sport organized at the international level, and its rules bear little resemblance to those of modern pool, pyramid and other such games.

A "Billiards" category encompassing pool, snooker and carom was featured in the 2005 <a href="World%20Games">World Games</a>, held in <a href="Duisburg">Duisburg</a>, Germany, and the 2006 <a href="Asian%20Games">Asian Games</a> also saw the <a href="Cue%20sports%20at%20the%202006%20Asian%20Games">introduction of a "Cue sports" category</a>.

Billiard balls vary from game to game, in size, design and quantity.

<a href="Russian%20pyramid">Russian pyramid</a> and <a href="Kaisa%20%28billiards%29">kaisa</a> have a size of 68 mm ( in). In Russian pyramid there are sixteen balls, as in pool, but fifteen are white and numbered, and the is usually red. In Kaisa, five balls are used: the yellow (called the "kaisa" in Finnish), two red object balls, and the two white cue balls (usually differentiated by one cue ball having a dot or other marking on it and each of which serves as an object ball for the opponent).

Carom billiards balls are larger than pool balls, having a diameter of 61.5 mm ( in), and come as a set of two cue balls (one colored or marked) and an object ball (or two object balls in the case of the game <a href="Four-ball%20billiards">four-ball</a>).

American-style pool balls are 57 mm ( in), are used in many pool games found throughout the world, come in sets of two of object balls, seven and seven , an and a ; the balls are racked differently for different games (some of which do not use the entire ball set). Blackball (English-style eight-ball) sets are similar, but have unmarked of (or ) and balls instead of solids and stripes, and at 56 mm ( in) are smaller than the American-style; they are used principally in Britain, Ireland, and some <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries, though not exclusively, since they are unsuited for playing nine-ball.

Snooker balls are smaller than American-style pool balls with a diameter of 52.5 mm ( in), and come in sets of 22 (15 reds, 6 "", and a cue ball). English billiard balls are the same size as snooker balls and come in sets of three balls (two cue balls and a red, an object ball). Other games, such as <a href="bumper%20pool">bumper pool</a>, have custom ball sets.

Billiard balls have been made from many different materials since the start of the game, including clay, <a href="bakelite">bakelite</a>, <a href="celluloid">celluloid</a>, <a href="crystallite">crystallite</a>, <a href="ivory">ivory</a>, plastic, steel and wood. The dominant material from 1627 until the early 20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was <a href="celluloid">celluloid</a>, invented by <a href="John%20Wesley%20Hyatt">John Wesley Hyatt</a> in 1868, but the material was volatile, sometimes exploding during manufacture and was highly flammable.

There are many sizes and styles of pool and <a href="billiards%20table">billiard table</a>s. Generally, tables are <a href="rectangle">rectangle</a>s twice as long as they are wide. Most pool tables are known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side. Full-size snooker and English billiard tables are long on the longest side. <a href="Pool%20hall">Pool hall</a>s tend to have tables and cater to the serious pool player. <a href="Public%20house">Pubs</a> will typically use tables which are often coin-operated. Formerly, tables were common, but such tables are now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games. The slates on modern carom tables are usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface.

The length of the pool table will typically be a function of space, with many homeowners purchasing an table as a compromise. Full-size pool tables are 4.5 by (interior dimensions). High-quality tables have a made of thick slate, in three pieces to prevent warping and changes due to temperature and humidity. Smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate. Pocket billiards tables of all types normally have six pockets, three on each side (four corner pockets, and two side or middle pockets).

All types of tables are covered with billiard cloth (often called "felt", but actually a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called <a href="baize">baize</a>). Cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century.

Bar or tavern tables, which get a lot of play, use "slower", more durable cloth. The cloth used in upscale <a href="pool%20halls">pool (and snooker) halls</a> and home <a href="billiard%20room">billiard room</a>s is "faster" (i.e., provides less friction, allowing the balls to roll farther across the table ), and competition-quality pool cloth is made from 100% <a href="worsted">worsted wool</a>. Snooker cloth traditionally has a nap (consistent fiber directionality) and balls behave differently when rolling against versus along with the nap.

The cloth of the billiard table has traditionally been green, reflecting its origin (originally the grass of ancestral lawn games), and has been so colored since the 16th century, but it is also produced in other colors such as red and blue.

The cloth was earlier said to be the most important part of the game, most likely because of the reflection of the game's origin. The players were stubborn in the fact that the cloth should not be ripped. They even made women continue to use maces after cues were invented, for fear that they would rip the cloth with the sharper cues.

A <a href="Rack%20%28billiards%29">rack</a> is the name given to a frame (usually wood, plastic or aluminium) used to organize billiard balls at the beginning of a game. This is traditionally triangular in shape, but varies with the type of billiards played. There are two main types of racks; the more common triangular shape which is used for eight-ball and straight pool and the diamond-shaped rack used for nine-ball.

There are several other types of less common rack types that are also used, based on a "template" to hold the billiard balls tightly together. Most commonly it is a thin plastic sheet with diamond-shaped cut-outs that hold the balls that is placed on the table with the balls set on top of the rack. The rack is used to set up the "break" and removed before the "break shot" occurs.

Billiards games are mostly played with a stick known as a cue. A cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic resin. High quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood, generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker.

The end of the cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a player's hand. The of the cue is of smaller circumference, usually tapering to an terminus called a (usually made of fiberglass or brass in better cues), where a rounded leather is affixed, flush with the ferrule, to make final contact with balls. The tip, in conjunction with chalk, can be used to impart <a href="Cue%20sports%20techniques%23Sidespin%20%28english%29">spin</a> to the cue ball when it is not hit in its center.

Cheap cues are generally made of pine, low-grade maple (and formerly often of <a href="Gonystylus">ramin</a>, which is now endangered), or other low-quality wood, with inferior plastic ferrules. A quality cue can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns. Many modern cues are also made, like <a href="Golf%20club%20%28equipment%29">golf club</a>s, with high-tech materials such as woven graphite. Skilled players may use more than one cue during a game, including a separate generally lighter cue for the opening break shot (because of cue speed gained from a lighter stick) and another, shorter cue with a special tip for .

The mechanical bridge, sometimes called a "rake", "crutch", "bridge stick" or simply "bridge", and in the UK a "rest", is used to extend a player's reach on a shot where the cue ball is too far away for normal hand bridging. It consists of a stick with a grooved metal or plastic head which the cue slides on. Many amateurs refuse to use the mechanical bridge based on the perception that to do so is unmanly. However, many aficionados and most professionals employ the bridge whenever the intended shot so requires.

Some players, especially current or former snooker players, use a screw-on cue butt extension instead of or in addition to the mechanical bridge.

Bridge head design is varied, and not all designs (especially those with cue shaft-enclosing rings, or wheels on the bottom of the head), are broadly tournament-approved.

In Italy a longer, thicker cue is typically available for this kind of tricky shot.

For snooker they are normally available in three forms, their use depending on how the player is hampered; the standard rest is a simple cross, the 'spider' has a raised arch around 12 cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most awkward of shots, the 'giraffe' (or 'swan' in England) which has a raised arch much like the 'spider' but with a slender arm reaching out around 15 cm with the groove.

Chalk is applied to the tip of the cue stick, ideally before every shot, to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit, no (unintentional slippage between the cue tip and the struck ball) occurs. Cue tip chalk is not actually the substance typically referred to as "<a href="chalk">chalk</a>" (generally <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>), but any of several proprietary compounds, with a <a href="silicate">silicate</a> base. It was around the time of the Industrial Revolution that newer compounds formed that provided better grip for the ball. This is when the English began to experiment with side spin or applying curl to the ball. This was shortly introduced to the American players and is how the term "putting English on the ball" came to be. "Chalk" may also refer to a cone of fine, white ; like <a href="talc">talc</a> (talcum powder) it can be used to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting, for a smoother stroke. Some brands of hand chalk actually are made of compressed talc. (Tip chalk is not used for this purpose because it is abrasive, hand-staining and difficult to apply.) Many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk or talc because of the messiness of these powders; buildup of particles on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth cleaning.

Cue tip chalk (invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro <a href="William%20A.%20Spinks">William A. Spinks</a> and chemist <a href="William%20Hoskins%20%28inventor%29">William Hoskins</a> in 1897) is made by crushing <a href="silica">silica</a> and the abrasive substance <a href="corundum">corundum</a> or aloxite (aluminium <a href="oxide">oxide</a>), into a powder. It is combined with dye (originally and most commonly green or blue-green, like traditional <a href="Baize">billiard cloth</a>, but available today, like the cloth, in many colors) and a binder (glue). Each manufacturer's brand has different qualities, which can significantly affect play. High humidity can also impair the effectiveness of chalk. Harder, drier compounds are generally considered superior by most players.

There are two main varieties of billiard games: carom and pocket. The main carom billiards games are <a href="straight%20rail">straight rail</a>, <a href="balkline%20and%20straight%20rail">balkline</a> and especially <a href="three%20cushion">three cushion</a> billiards. All are played on a pocketless table with three balls; two cue balls and one object ball. In all, players shoot a cue ball so that it makes contact with the opponent's cue ball as well as the object ball. Others of multinational interest are <a href="Four-ball%20billiards">four-ball</a> and <a href="five-pins">five-pins</a>.

The most globally popular of the large variety of pocket games are <a href="pool%20%28cue%20sports%29">Pool</a> and <a href="snooker">snooker</a>. <a href="English%20billiards">English billiards</a>, with some features of carom billiards, was one of the two most-competitive cue sports, along with balkline, at the turn of the previous century and is still enjoyed today especially in <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries. <a href="Russian%20pyramid">Russian pyramid</a> and its variants like <a href="kaisa%20%28billiards%29">kaisa</a> are popular in the former <a href="Eastern%20bloc">Eastern bloc</a>.

In straight rail, a player scores a point and may continue shooting each time his cue ball makes contact with both other balls.

Although a difficult and subtle game, some of the best players of straight billiards developed the skill to the balls in a corner or along the same rail for the purpose of playing a series of to score a seemingly limitless number of points.

The first straight rail professional tournament was held in 1879 where <a href="Jacob%20Schaefer%2C%20Sr.">Jacob Schaefer, Sr.</a> scored 690 points in a single turn (that is, 690 separate strokes without a miss). With the balls repetitively hit and barely moving in endless "nursing", there was little for the fans to watch.

In light of these phenomenal skill developments in straight rail, the game of balkline soon developed to make it impossible for a player to keep the balls gathered in one part of the table for long, greatly limiting the effectiveness of nurse shots. A (not to be confused with , which pertains to the game of <a href="English%20billiards">English billiards</a>) is a line parallel to one end of a billiards table. In the "games" of balkline – 18.1 and 18.2 (pronounced "eighteen-point-two") balkline, among other more obscure variations – the players have to drive at least one object ball past a balkline set at from each rail, after one or two points have been scored, respectively.

A more elegant solution was three-cushion billiards, which requires a player to make contact with the other two balls on the table "and" contact three rail cushions in the process. This is difficult enough that even the best players can only manage to average one to two points per turn.
This is sometimes described as "hardest to learn" and "require most skill" of all billiards. Even quite good Pool or Snooker players may attempt an hour or more to score a single three cushion point, without even managing an accidental score.

There are many variations of games played on a standard pool table. Popular pool games include <a href="eight-ball">eight-ball</a>, <a href="nine-ball">nine-ball</a>, <a href="straight%20pool">straight pool</a> and <a href="one-pocket">one-pocket</a>. Even within games types (e.g. <a href="eight-ball">eight-ball</a>), there may be variations, and people may play recreationally using relaxed or local rules. A few of the more popular examples of pool games are given below.

In eight-ball and nine-ball, the object is to sink object balls until one can legally pocket the winning <a href="%3Awikt%3Aeponym">eponym</a>ous "". Well-known but waning in popularity is straight pool, in which players seek to continue sinking balls, rack after rack if they can, to reach a pre-determined winning score (typically 150). Related to nine-ball, another well-known game is <a href="Rotation%20%28pool%29">rotation</a>, where the lowest-numbered object ball on the table must be struck first, although any object ball may be pocketed (i.e., combination shot). Each pocketed ball is worth its number, and the player with the highest score at the end of the rack is the winner. Since there are only 120 points available (1 + 2 + 3 ⋯ + 15 = 120), scoring 61 points leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up. In both one-pocket and bank pool, the players must sink a set number of balls; respectively, all in a particular , or all by . In snooker, players score points by alternately potting and various special "".


<a href="Speed%20pool">Speed pool</a> is a standard billiards game where the balls must be pocketed in as little time as possible. Rules vary greatly from tournament to tournament. The <a href="International%20Speed%20Pool%20Challenge">International Speed Pool Challenge</a> has been held annually since 2006.

Dating to approximately 1800, English billiards, called simply billiards in many <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">former British colonies</a> and in the UK where it originated, was originally called the "winning and losing carambole game", folding in the names of three predecessor games, "the winning game", "the losing game" and "the carambole game" (an early form of <a href="straight%20rail">straight rail</a>), that combined to form it. The game features both (caroms) and the pocketing of balls as objects of play. English billiards requires two and a red . The object of the game is to score either a fixed number of points, or score the most points within a set time frame, determined at the start of the game.

Snooker is a pocket billiards game originated by <a href="History%20of%20the%20British%20Army">British officers</a> stationed in <a href="Colonial%20India">India</a> during the 19th century, based on earlier pool games such as black pool and life pool. The name of the game became generalized to also describe one of its prime strategies: to "" the opposing player by causing that player to foul or leave an opening to be exploited.

In the United Kingdom, snooker is by far the most popular cue sport at the competitive level, and major national pastime along with association football and <a href="cricket">cricket</a>. It is played in many <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries as well, especially in Asia. Snooker is uncommon in North America, where pool games such as eight-ball and nine-ball dominate, and Latin America and <a href="Continental%20Europe">Continental Europe</a>, where carom games dominate. The first <a href="World%20Snooker%20Championship">World Snooker Championship</a> was held in 1927, and it has been held annually since then with few exceptions. The <a href="World%20Professional%20Billiards%20and%20Snooker%20Association">World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association</a> (WPBSA) was established in 1968 to regulate the professional game, while the <a href="International%20Billiards%20and%20Snooker%20Federation">International Billiards and Snooker Federation</a> (IBSF) regulates the amateur games.

Technically a form of pocket billiards, snooker has its own worldwide sporting community separate from that of pool.

These combine aspects of carom and pocket billiards, and are played on tables with pockets (often as s not targets).

These are variations using small disks instead of balls, and light-weight cue sticks.

Bursa

Bursa is a large city in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, located in northwestern <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, within the <a href="Marmara%20Region">Marmara Region</a>. It is the <a href="list%20of%20cities%20in%20Turkey">fourth most populous</a> city in Turkey and one of the most industrialized metropolitan centres in the country. The city is also the administrative centre of <a href="Bursa%20Province">Bursa Province</a>.

Bursa was the first major and second overall capital of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman State</a> between 1335 and 1363. The city was referred to as (<a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish</a>: خداوندگار, meaning "God's gift") during the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> period, while a more recent nickname is (meaning "Green Bursa") in reference to the parks and gardens located across its urban fabric, as well as to the vast and richly varied forests of the surrounding region. The <a href="ski%20resort">ski resort</a> of <a href="Uluda%C4%9F">Mount Uludağ</a> towers over it. The mountain was called the <a href="Mysia">Mysia</a>n <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Olympus</a> by the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a> who lived there before. Bursa has rather orderly urban growth and borders a fertile plain. The <a href="mausoleums">mausoleums</a> of the early <a href="Ottoman%20Dynasty">Ottoman sultans</a> are located in Bursa and the city's main landmarks include numerous edifices built throughout the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> period. Bursa also has <a href="thermal%20bath">thermal bath</a>s and several museums, including a museum of <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a>.

The <a href="shadow%20play">shadow play</a> characters <a href="Karag%C3%B6z%20and%20Hacivat">Karagöz and Hacivat</a> are based on historic personalities who lived and died in Bursa. Bursa is also home to some of the most famous <a href="Cuisine%20of%20Turkey">Turkish dishes</a> such as <a href="%C4%B0skender%20kebap">İskender kebap</a>, specially candied <a href="marron%20glac%C3%A9">marron glacé</a>s, <a href="peach">peach</a>es and <a href="Turkish%20Delight">Turkish Delight</a>. Bursa houses the <a href="Uluda%C4%9F%20University">Uludağ University</a>, and its population can claim one of the highest overall levels of education in Turkey. The historic towns of <a href="%C4%B0znik">İznik</a> (<a href="Nicaea">Nicaea</a>), <a href="Mudanya">Mudanya</a> and <a href="Zeytinba%C4%9F%C4%B1">Zeytinbağı</a> are all situated in <a href="Bursa%20Province">Bursa Province</a>.

In 2015, Bursa had a population of 2,340,000, while <a href="Bursa%20Province">Bursa Province</a> had 2,842,000 inhabitants.

The earliest known human settlement near Bursa's current location was at Ilıpınar Höyüğü around 5200 BC. It was followed by the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> city of <a href="Cius">Cius</a>, which <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a> granted to <a href="Prusias%20I%20of%20Bithynia">Prusias I</a>, the King of <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a>, in 202 BC. Prusias rebuilt the city and renamed it Prusa (; sometimes rendered as Prussa). After 128 years of Bithynian rule, <a href="Nicomedes%20IV%20of%20Bithynia">Nicomedes IV</a>, the last King of <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a>, bequeathed the entire kingdom to the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in 74 BC. An early <a href="Bursa%20Treasure">Roman Treasure</a> was found in the vicinity of Bursa in the early 20th century. Composed of a woman's silver toilet articles, it is now in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>.

Bursa became the first major capital city of the early <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> following its capture from the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a> in 1326. As a result, the city witnessed a considerable amount of urban growth throughout the 14th century. After conquering <a href="Edirne">Edirne</a> (Adrianople) in <a href="East%20Thrace">East Thrace</a>, the Ottomans turned it into the new capital city in 1363, but Bursa retained its spiritual and commercial importance in the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman sultan <a href="Bayezid%20I">Bayezid I</a> built the <a href="Bayezid%20I%20Mosque">Bayezid Külliyesi</a> (Bayezid I theological complex) in Bursa between 1390 and 1395 and the <a href="Bursa%20Grand%20Mosque">Ulu Cami (Grand Mosque)</a> between 1396 and 1400. Bursa remained to be the most important administrative and commercial centre in the empire until <a href="Mehmed%20II">Mehmed II</a> <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">conquered</a> <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1453. The population of Bursa was 45,000 in 1487.

During the Ottoman period, Bursa continued to be the source of most royal <a href="silk">silk</a> products. Aside from the local silk production, the city imported raw silk from <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and occasionally from <a href="China">China</a>, and was the main production centre for the kaftans, pillows, embroidery and other silk products for the Ottoman palaces until the 17th century.

Following the foundation of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Turkey">Republic of Turkey</a> in 1923, Bursa became one of the industrial centres of the country. The economic development of the city was followed by population growth and Bursa became the 4th most populous city in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>.

The city has traditionally been a pole of attraction, and was a major centre for refugees from various ethnic backgrounds who immigrated to <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> from the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> during the loss of the <a href="Ottoman%20territories%20in%20Europe">Ottoman territories in Europe</a> between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most recent arrival of <a href="Turks%20in%20Europe%23Balkan%20Turks">Balkan Turks</a> took place in the 1940s until the 1990s, when the <a href="Todor%20Zhivkov">communist regime</a> in <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> expelled approximately 150,000 <a href="Bulgarian%20Turks%20in%20Turkey">Bulgarian Turks</a> to Turkey. About one-third of these 150,000 Bulgarian Turkish refugees eventually settled in Bursa.

Bursa is settled on the northwestern slopes of <a href="Uluda%C4%9F">Mount Uludağ</a> in the southern <a href="Marmara%20Region">Marmara Region</a>. It is the capital city of <a href="Bursa%20Province">Bursa Province</a> bordered by the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a> and <a href="Yalova">Yalova</a> to the north; <a href="%C4%B0zmit">Kocaeli</a> and <a href="Sakarya%20Province">Sakarya</a> to the northeast; <a href="Bilecik">Bilecik</a> to the east; and <a href="K%C3%BCtahya">Kütahya</a> and <a href="Bal%C4%B1kesir">Balıkesir</a> to the south.

Bursa has a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>: Csa) under the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a> classification, and dry-hot summer temperate climate (Csa) <a href="Trewartha%20climate%20classification">Trewartha</a> classification. The city has hot, dry summers that last from June until September. Winters are cold and damp, also containing the most rainfall. There can be snow on the ground which will last for a week or two.

The <a href="textile%20industry">textile</a> and <a href="food%20industry">food</a> industries are equally strong, with <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>, <a href="Pepsi%20Cola">Pepsi Cola</a> and other beverage brands, as well as fresh and <a href="canned%20food">canned food</a> industries being present in the city's organized industrial zones.

The top 10 industry corporations in the Bursa province are as follows:


Apart from its large automotive industry, Bursa also produces a substantial amount of dairy products (by ), processed food (by ), and beverages (by ).

Traditionally, Bursa was famous for being the largest centre of <a href="silk">silk</a> trade in the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> and later the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> empires, during the period of the lucrative <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>. The city is still a major centre for textiles in Turkey and is home to the Bursa International Textiles and Trade Centre (, or ). Bursa was also known for its fertile soil and agricultural activities, which have decreased in the recent decades due to the heavy industrialization of the city.

Bursa is a major centre for tourism. One of the most popular <a href="skiing">skiing</a> resorts of Turkey is located at <a href="Uluda%C4%9F">Mount Uludağ</a>, just next to the city proper. Bursa's thermal baths have been used for therapeutical purposes since <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> times. Apart from the baths that are operated by hotels, <a href="Uluda%C4%9F%20University">Uludağ University</a> has a <a href="physical%20therapy">physical therapy</a> centre which also makes use of thermal water.

Bursa has a <a href="rapid%20transit">metro</a> (<a href="Bursaray">Bursaray</a>), <a href="Trams%20in%20Bursa">trams</a> and bus system for inner-city public transport, while taxi cabs are also available. Bursa's <a href="Yeni%C5%9Fehir%20Airport">Yenişehir Airport</a> is away from the city centre. The citizens of Bursa also prefer Istanbul's airports such as <a href="Istanbul%20Atat%C3%BCrk%20Airport">Atatürk International Airport</a> and <a href="Sabiha%20G%C3%B6k%C3%A7en%20International%20Airport">Sabiha Gökçen International Airport</a> for flights to foreign countries, due to Istanbul's proximity to Bursa. There are numerous daily bus and ferry services between the two cities.

The long <a href="Bursa%20Uluda%C4%9F%20Gondola">Bursa Uludağ Gondola</a> () connects Bursa with the ski resort areas high on the mountain <a href="Uluda%C4%9F">Uludağ</a>.

The only railway station in Bursa is the <a href="Harmanc%C4%B1k">Harmancık</a> station on the <a href="Bal%C4%B1kesir">Balıkesir</a>-<a href="K%C3%BCtahya">Kütahya</a> railway, which was opened in 1930.
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bursa, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 62 min. 12% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 18 min, while 31% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.1 km, while 17% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. 

Bursa has two public universities and one private university. <a href="Uluda%C4%9F%20University">Uludağ University</a>, founded in 1975, is the oldest institution of higher education in the city. Founded first as the Bursa University then renamed Uludağ University in 1982, the university has a student body of 47,000, one of the largest in Turkey. <a href="Bursa%20Technical%20University">Bursa Technical University</a> is the second public university of Bursa and was established in 2010, beginning education in the 2011–2012 academic year.

The first private university of Bursa was the <a href="Bursa%20Orhangazi%20University">Bursa Orhangazi University</a>, which started education in the 2012–2013 academic year. However, Orhangazi University was shut down by the Turkish Government after the failed coup attempt of July 2016. <a href="Istanbul%20Commerce%20University">Istanbul Commerce University</a> has opened graduate programs in Bursa in 2013.

The city has one professional football club, <a href="Bursaspor">Bursaspor</a>, which competes in the Turkish Super League, the top-tier of Turkish football. As of December 21, the team plays their home games at "The Timsah Arena" stadium (literally meaning Crocodile Arena), which has a sitting capacity of 45,000. <a href="Bursaspor">Bursaspor</a> has won its first league title in the 2009–10 Turkish Super League season, becoming the second Anatolian club to ever win the league title after Trabzonspor. Today Bursaspor is considered one of the five biggest football clubs in Turkey along with Galatasaray SK, Fenerbahçe, Beşiktaş, and Trabzonspor.

The city has a professional <a href="basketball">basketball</a> team in the <a href="Turkish%20Basketball%20League">Turkish Basketball League</a>, <a href="Tofa%C5%9F%20S.K.">Tofaş S.K.</a>, which was among the most successful teams.

<a href="Bursa%20Grand%20Mosque">Ulu Cami</a> is the largest mosque in Bursa and a landmark of early <a href="Ottoman%20architecture">Ottoman architecture</a>, which carried many elements from the <a href="Anatolian%20Seljuk%20Sultanate">Seljuk</a> architecture. Ordered by Sultan <a href="Bayezid%20I">Bayezid I</a>, the mosque was designed and built by architect Ali Neccar in 1396–1400. It is a large and rectangular building, with a total of twenty domes that are arranged in four rows of five, and are supported by 12 columns. Supposedly the twenty domes were built instead of the twenty separate mosques which Sultan <a href="Bayezid%20I">Bayezid I</a> had promised for winning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nicopolis">Battle of Nicopolis</a> in 1396. The mosque has two <a href="minaret">minaret</a>s.

Inside the mosque there are 192 monumental wall inscriptions written by the famous <a href="Islamic%20calligraphy">calligraphers</a> of that period. There is also a fountain (<a href="%C5%9Fad%C4%B1rvan">şadırvan</a>) where worshipers can perform <a href="Wudu">ritual ablutions</a> before prayer; the dome over the şadırvan is capped by a skylight which creates a soft, serene light below; thus playing an important role in the illumination of the large building.

The horizontally spacious and dimly lit interior is designed to feel peaceful and contemplative. The subdivisions of space formed by multiple domes and pillars create a sense of privacy and even intimacy. This atmosphere contrasts with the later Ottoman mosques (see for example the works of <a href="Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a>'s chief architect <a href="Mimar%20Sinan">Mimar Sinan</a>.) The mosques that were built after the <a href="fall%20of%20Constantinople">conquest of Constantinople</a> (<a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>) by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, and influenced by the design of the 6th century Byzantine basilica of <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>, had increasingly elevated and large central domes, which create a vertical emphasis that is intended to be more overwhelming; in order to convey the divine power of Allah, the majesty of the Ottoman Sultan, and the governmental authority of the Ottoman State.

The Bahamas

The Bahamas (), known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, is an <a href="archipelagic%20state">archipelagic state</a> within the <a href="Lucayan%20Archipelago">Lucayan Archipelago</a>. It consists of more than 700 <a href="island">island</a>s, <a href="cay">cay</a>s, and <a href="islet">islet</a>s in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and is located north of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> (<a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> and the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>); northwest of the <a href="Turks%20and%20Caicos%20Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>; southeast of the <a href="US">US</a> state of <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and east of the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>. The capital is <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a> on the island of <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a>. The designation of "the Bahamas" can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the <a href="Turks%20and%20Caicos%20Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the <a href="Royal%20Bahamas%20Defence%20Force">Royal Bahamas Defence Force</a>, the Bahamas territory encompasses of ocean space.

The Bahamas is the site of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Columbus</a>' first landfall in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> in 1492. At that time, the islands were inhabited by the <a href="Lucayan%20people">Lucayan</a>, a branch of the <a href="Arawakan">Arawakan</a>-speaking <a href="Ta%C3%ADno%20people">Taino</a> people. Although the Spanish never colonised The Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English</a> colonists from <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> settled on the island of <a href="Eleuthera">Eleuthera</a>.

The Bahamas became a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a> in 1718, when the British clamped down on <a href="piracy">piracy</a>. After the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American War of Independence</a>, the Crown resettled thousands of <a href="American%20Loyalists">American Loyalists</a> in the Bahamas; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves: the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> resettled Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships; <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">American slaves</a> and Seminoles escaped here from Florida; and the government freed American slaves carried on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather. Today <a href="Afro-Bahamians">the descendants of slaves and free Africans</a> make up nearly 90% of the population; issues related to the slavery years are part of society.

The Bahamas became an independent <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a> in 1973, retaining the British monarch, then and currently <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, as its head of state. In terms of <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> (following the United States and Canada), with an economy based on tourism and finance.

The name "Bahamas" is mostly likely derived from either the <a href="Ta%C3%ADno%20language">Taíno</a> ' ("big upper middle land"), which was a term for the region used by the indigenous Native Americans, or from the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> ' ("shallow water or sea" or "") reflecting the shallow waters of the area. Alternatively, it may originate from "", a local name of unclear meaning.

A peculiarity of the name is that the word "The" is a formal part of the abbreviated name and is, therefore, capitalised. So in contrast to "the Congo" and "the United Kingdom", it is proper to write "The Bahamas".

<a href="Ta%C3%ADno%20people">Taino</a> people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas from <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> and <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> around the 11th century, having migrated there from South America. They came to be known as the <a href="Lucayan%20people">Lucayan people</a>. An estimated 30,000 Lucayan inhabited the Bahamas at the time of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>' arrival in 1492.

Columbus's first landfall in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayan as "<a href="Guanahani">Guanahani</a>"). Some researchers believe this site to be present-day <a href="San%20Salvador%20Island">San Salvador Island</a> (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas. An alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on <a href="Samana%20Cay">Samana Cay</a>, according to calculations made in 1986 by "<a href="National%20Geographic%20%28magazine%29">National Geographic</a>" writer and editor <a href="Joseph%20Judge">Joseph Judge</a>, based on Columbus's log. Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayan and exchanged goods with them.

The Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> for use as forced labour. The slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting <a href="Infectious%20disease">diseases</a> to which they had no <a href="immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a>; half of the Taino died from <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> alone. The population of the Bahamas was severely diminished.

In 1648, the <a href="Eleutherian%20Adventurers">Eleutherian Adventurers</a>, led by <a href="William%20Sayle">William Sayle</a>, migrated from <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. These English Puritans established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named <a href="Eleuthera">Eleuthera</a>—the name derives from the Greek word for freedom. They later settled <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a>, naming it Sayle's Island after one of their leaders. To survive, the settlers <a href="Wrecking%20%28shipwreck%29%23The%20Bahamas">salvaged goods from wrecks</a>.

In 1670 <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">King Charles II</a> granted the islands to the <a href="Lords%20Proprietors">Lords Proprietors</a> of the Carolinas in North America. They rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing <a href="Governor%23British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">governors</a>, and administering the country. In 1684 Spanish <a href="privateer">corsair</a> Juan de Alcon <a href="Raid%20on%20Charles%20Town">raided the capital</a>, Charles Town (later renamed <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>). In 1703 a joint Franco-Spanish expedition <a href="Raid%20on%20Nassau">briefly occupied</a> the Bahamian capital during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>.

During proprietary rule, the Bahamas became a haven for <a href="Piracy">pirates</a>, including the infamous <a href="Blackbeard">Blackbeard</a> (c.1680–1718). To put an end to the '<a href="Pirates%27%20republic">Pirates' republic</a>' and restore orderly government, Britain made the Bahamas a <a href="British%20overseas%20territories">crown colony</a> in 1718 under the royal governorship of <a href="Woodes%20Rogers">Woodes Rogers</a>. After a difficult struggle, he succeeded in suppressing piracy. In 1720, Rogers led local <a href="militia">militia</a> to drive off a <a href="Battle%20of%20Nassau%20%281720%29">Spanish attack</a>.

During the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American War of Independence</a> in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for American naval forces under the command of Commodore <a href="Esek%20Hopkins">Esek Hopkins</a>. <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">US Marines</a> occupied the capital of Nassau for a <a href="fortnight">fortnight</a>.

In 1782, following the British defeat at <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">Yorktown</a>, a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau. The city <a href="Capture%20of%20The%20Bahamas%20%281782%29">surrendered without a fight</a>. Spain returned possession of the Bahamas to Britain the following year, under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a>. Before the news was received, however, the <a href="Capture%20of%20the%20Bahamas%20%281783%29">islands were recaptured</a> by a small British force led by <a href="Andrew%20Deveaux">Andrew Deveaux</a>.

After American independence, the British resettled some 7,300 <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalists</a> with their slaves in the Bahamas, and granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent. These Loyalists, who included Deveaux, established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. European Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory.

In 1807, the British abolished the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">slave trade</a>, followed by the United States the next year. During the following decades, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> intercepted the trade; they resettled in the Bahamas thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships.

In the 1820s during the period of the <a href="Seminole%20Wars">Seminole Wars</a> in Florida, hundreds of American slaves and African Seminoles escaped from <a href="Cape%20Florida">Cape Florida</a> to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest <a href="Andros%20Island">Andros Island</a>, where they developed the village of Red Bays. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 <a href="sloop">sloop</a>s, with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at <a href="Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park">Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park</a>. Some of their descendants in Red Bays continue African Seminole traditions in basket making and grave marking.

The United States' <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>, which administers the National <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> Network to Freedom, is working with the African Bahamian Museum and Research Center (ABAC) in Nassau on development to identify Red Bays as a site related to American slaves' search for freedom. The museum has researched and documented the African Seminoles' escape from southern Florida. It plans to develop interpretive programs at historical sites in Red Bay associated with the period of their settlement in the Bahamas.

In 1818, the Home Office in London had ruled that "any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the <a href="British%20West%20Indies">British West Indies</a> would be manumitted." This led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by US nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835. The American slave ships "Comet" and "Encomium" used in the United States domestic <a href="coastwise%20slave%20trade">coastwise slave trade</a>, were wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively. When wreckers took the masters, passengers and slaves into Nassau, customs officers seized the slaves and British colonial officials freed them, over the protests of the Americans. There were 165 slaves on the "Comet" and 48 on the "Encomium". Britain finally paid an indemnity to the United States in those two cases in 1855, under the Treaty of Claims of 1853, which settled several compensation cases between the two nations.

Slavery was <a href="Slavery%20Abolition%20Act%201833">abolished in the British Empire</a> on 1 August 1834. After that British colonial officials freed 78 American slaves from the "<a href="Enterprise%20%28slave%20ship%29">Enterprise</a>", which went into Bermuda in 1835; and 38 from the "Hermosa", which wrecked off Abaco Island in 1840. The most notable case was that of the "Creole" in 1841: as a result of a <a href="slave%20revolt">slave revolt</a> on board, the leaders ordered the American brig to Nassau. It was carrying 135 slaves from Virginia destined for sale in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. The Bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands. The "<a href="Creole%20case">Creole</a>" <a href="Creole%20case">case</a> has been described as the "most successful slave revolt in U.S. history".

These incidents, in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Great Britain</a>. They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. But, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that Britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress, as part of the international trade. The United States worried that the success of the "Creole" slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.

In August 1940, after his abdication of the British throne, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Windsor">Duke of Windsor</a> was installed as <a href="Governor%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Governor of the Bahamas</a>, arriving with his wife, the <a href="Wallis%20Simpson">Duchess</a>. Although disheartened at the condition of Government House, they "tried to make the best of a bad situation". He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as "a third-class British colony".

He opened the small local parliament on 29 October 1940. The couple visited the "Out Islands" that November, on <a href="Axel%20Wenner-Gren">Axel Wenner-Gren</a>'s yacht, which caused controversy; the <a href="British%20Foreign%20Office">British Foreign Office</a> strenuously objected because they had been advised (mistakenly) by United States intelligence that Wenner-Gren was a close friend of the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> commander <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> of Nazi Germany.

The Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-European peoples of the Empire. He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a> in June 1942, when there was a "full-scale riot". Ziegler said that the Duke blamed the trouble on "mischief makers – <a href="communists">communists</a>" and "men of Central European <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft".

The Duke resigned the post on 16 March 1945.

Modern political development began after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The British Parliament authorised the islands as internally self-governing in 1964, with <a href="Sir%20Roland%20Symonette">Sir Roland Symonette</a>, of the <a href="United%20Bahamian%20Party">United Bahamian Party</a>, as the first Premier.

A new constitution granting the Bahamas internal autonomy went into effect on 7 January 1964. In 1967, <a href="Lynden%20Pindling">Lynden Pindling</a> of the <a href="Progressive%20Liberal%20Party">Progressive Liberal Party</a>, became the first native born Premier of the majority native Bahamian colony; in 1968 the title of the position was changed to <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Prime Minister</a>. In 1968, Pindling announced that the Bahamas would seek full independence. A new constitution giving the Bahamas increased control over its own affairs was adopted in 1968.

The <a href="British%20House%20of%20Lords">British House of Lords</a> voted to give the Bahamas its independence on 22 June 1973. <a href="Prince%20Charles">Prince Charles</a> delivered the official documents to <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Lynden%20Pindling">Lynden Pindling</a>, officially declaring the Bahamas a fully independent nation on 10 July 1973. It joined the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> on the same day. <a href="Sir%20Milo%20Butler">Sir Milo Butler</a> was appointed the first <a href="Governor-General%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Governor-General of the Bahamas</a> (the official representative of <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>) shortly after independence. The Bahamas joined the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> and the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> on 22 August 1973, and it joined the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> on 18 September 1973.

Based on the twin pillars of tourism and <a href="offshore%20finance">offshore finance</a>, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. Significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti continue to be issues.

The <a href="University%20of%20the%20Bahamas">University of The Bahamas</a> (UB) is the national higher education/tertiary system. Offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, UB has three campuses, and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas. The University of the Bahamas was chartered on November 10, 2016

The country lies between latitudes <a href="20th%20parallel%20north">20°</a> and <a href="28th%20parallel%20north">28°N</a>, and longitudes <a href="72nd%20meridian%20west">72°</a> and <a href="80th%20meridian%20west">80°W</a>.

In 1864, the <a href="Governor%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Governor of the Bahamas</a> reported that there were 29 islands, 661 cays, and 2,387 rocks in the colony.

The closest island to the United States is <a href="Bimini">Bimini</a>, which is also known as the gateway to the Bahamas. The island of <a href="Abaco%20Islands">Abaco</a> is to the east of <a href="Grand%20Bahama">Grand Bahama</a>. The southeasternmost island is <a href="Inagua">Inagua</a>. The largest island is <a href="Andros%20Island">Andros Island</a>.

All the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than . The highest point in the country is <a href="Mount%20Alvernia">Mount Alvernia</a> (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island. It has an elevation of .

To the southeast, the <a href="Turks%20and%20Caicos%20Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>, and three more extensive submarine features called <a href="Mouchoir%20Bank">Mouchoir Bank</a>, <a href="Silver%20Bank">Silver Bank</a> and <a href="Navidad%20Bank">Navidad Bank</a>, are geographically a continuation of the Bahamas.

The climate of the Bahamas is <a href="tropical%20savannah%20climate">tropical savannah climate</a> or "Aw" according to <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>. The low latitude, warm tropical <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, and low <a href="elevation">elevation</a> give the Bahamas a warm and winterless climate. As such, there has never been a frost or freeze reported in the Bahamas, although every few decades low temperatures can fall below for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes off the North American mainland. There is only an 8 °C difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days of sunlight annually.

Tropical storms and hurricanes can on occasion impact the Bahamas. In 1992, <a href="Hurricane%20Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a> passed over the northern portions of the islands, and <a href="Hurricane%20Floyd">Hurricane Floyd</a> passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999.

The Bahamas Platform, which includes the Bahamas, Southern Florida, Northern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos, and the <a href="Blake%20Plateau">Blake Plateau</a>, formed about 150 <a href="megaannum">Ma</a>, not long after the formation of the <a href="North%20Atlantic">North Atlantic</a>. The 6.4 km thick <a href="limestone">limestone</a>s, which predominately make up The Bahamas, date back to the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. These limestones would have been deposited in shallow seas, assumed to be a stretched and thinned portion of the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American continental crust</a>. Sediments were forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight. Thus, the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands. Then, at about 80 Ma, the area became flooded by the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>. The resulted in the drowning of the Blake Plateau, the separation of The Bahamas from Cuba and Florida, the separation of the southeastern Bahamas into separate banks, the creation of the <a href="Cay%20Sal%20Bank">Cay Sal Bank</a>, plus the <a href="Bahama%20Banks">Little and Great Bahama Banks</a>. Sedimentation from the "carbonate factory" of each bank, or <a href="atoll">atoll</a>, continues today at the rate of about 2 cm per <a href="kyr">kyr</a>. <a href="Coral%20reef">Coral reef</a>s form the "retaining walls" of these atolls, within which <a href="oolite">oolite</a>s and <a href="pellets%20%28petrology%29">pellets</a> form.

Coral growth was greater through the <a href="Tertiary%20%28geology%29">Tertiary</a>, until the start of the <a href="Ice%20Ages">Ice Ages</a>, and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36 m. In fact, an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one, 30 m below sea level. Oolites form when oceanic water penetrate the shallow banks, increasing the temperature about 3 °C and the salinity by 0.5 per cent. <a href="Cementation%20%28geology%29">Cemented</a> <a href="ooid">ooid</a>s are referred to as grapestone. Additionally, giant <a href="stromatolite">stromatolite</a>s are found off the <a href="Exuma%20Cays">Exuma Cays</a>.

<a href="Sea%20level%20change">Sea level change</a>s resulted in a drop in sea level, causing wind blown oolite to form <a href="sand%20dune">sand dune</a>s with distinct <a href="cross-bedding">cross-bedding</a>. Overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges, which become rapidly <a href="lithified">lithified</a> through the action of rainwater. Most islands have ridges ranging from 30 to 45 m, though Cat Island has a ridge 60 m in height. The land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swamps.

<a href="Solution%20weathering">Solution weathering</a> of the limestone results in a "Bahamian <a href="Karst">Karst</a>" topography. This includes <a href="pothole%20%28geology%29">potholes</a>, <a href="Blue%20hole">Blue hole</a>s such as <a href="Dean%27s%20Blue%20Hole">Dean's Blue Hole</a>, <a href="sinkhole">sinkhole</a>s, <a href="beachrock">beachrock</a> such as the <a href="Bimini%20Road">Bimini Road</a> ("pavements of Atlantis"), <a href="caliche">limestone crust</a>, caves due to the lack of rivers, and <a href="sea%20caves">sea caves</a>. Several blue holes are aligned along the South Andros <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">Fault</a> line. <a href="Tidal%20flat">Tidal flat</a>s and <a href="tidal%20creek">tidal creek</a>s are common, but the more impressive drainage patterns are formed by troughs and canyons such as <a href="Great%20Bahama%20Canyon">Great Bahama Canyon</a> with the evidence of <a href="turbidity%20current">turbidity current</a>s and <a href="turbidite">turbidite</a> deposition.

The Bahamas is a <a href="Parliamentary%20system">parliamentary</a> <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> headed by <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in her role as Queen of the Bahamas. Political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom and the <a href="Westminster%20system">Westminster system</a>. The Bahamas is a member of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> as a <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>, retaining the Queen as <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> (represented by a <a href="List%20of%20Governors-General%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Governor-General</a>).

<a href="Legislature">Legislative power</a> is vested In a <a href="bicameralism">bicameral</a> <a href="parliament">parliament</a>, which consists of a 38-member <a href="House%20of%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Bahamas">House of Assembly</a> (the <a href="lower%20house">lower house</a>), with members elected from <a href="Plurality%20voting%20system">single-member districts</a>, and a 16-member <a href="Parliament%20of%20The%20Bahamas%23Senate">Senate</a>, with members appointed by the Governor-General, including nine on the advice of the Prime Minister, four on the advice of the <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition">Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition</a>, and three on the advice of the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. The House of Assembly carries out all major legislative functions. As under the Westminster system, the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament and call a general election at any time within a five-year term.

The <a href="Prime%20Minister">Prime Minister</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a> and is the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Assembly. <a href="Executive%20%28government%29">Executive power</a> is exercised by the Cabinet, selected by the Prime Minister and drawn from his supporters in the House of Assembly. The current Governor-General is <a href="Dame%20Marguerite%20Pindling">Dame Marguerite Pindling</a>, and the current <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20government%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Prime Minister</a> is <a href="The%20Right%20Honourable">The Rt. Hon.</a> <a href="Hubert%20Minnis">Hubert Minnis</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">M.P.</a>.

Constitutional safeguards include <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20press">press</a>, <a href="Freedom%20of%20religion">worship</a>, <a href="Freedom%20of%20movement">movement</a> and <a href="Freedom%20of%20association">association</a>. The <a href="Judiciary%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Judiciary of the Bahamas</a> is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on <a href="English%20law">English law</a>.

The Bahamas has a <a href="two-party%20system">two-party system</a> dominated by the <a href="centre-left">centre-left</a> <a href="Progressive%20Liberal%20Party">Progressive Liberal Party</a> and the <a href="centre-right">centre-right</a> <a href="Free%20National%20Movement">Free National Movement</a>. A handful of splinter parties have been unable to win election to parliament. These parties have included the <a href="Bahamas%20Democratic%20Movement">Bahamas Democratic Movement</a>, the Coalition for Democratic Reform, Bahamian Nationalist Party and the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Alliance%20%28Bahamas%29">Democratic National Alliance</a>.

The Bahamas has strong bilateral relationships with the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, represented by an ambassador in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> and <a href="High%20Commissioner">High Commissioner</a> in <a href="London">London</a>. The Bahamas also associates closely with other nations of the <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean Community</a> (CARICOM).

Its military is the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (the RBDF), the navy of the Bahamas which includes a land unit called Commando Squadron (Regiment) and an Air Wing (Air Force). Under the Defence Act, the RBDF has been mandated, in the name of the <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20The%20Bahamas">Queen</a>, to defend the Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, provide assistance and relief in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of the Bahamas, and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force is also a member of the Caribbean Community (<a href="Caricom">CARICOM</a>)'s Regional Security Task Force.

The RBDF came into existence on 31 March 1980. Their duties include defending the Bahamas, stopping <a href="Illegal%20drug%20trade">drug smuggling</a>, illegal immigration and poaching, and providing assistance to mariners. The Defence Force has a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 3 aircraft and over 1,100 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women.
The districts of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a> (which holds 70% of the national population), whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed the "Local Government Act" to facilitate the establishment of Family Island Administrators, Local Government Districts, Local District Councillors and Local Town Committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of Central Government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections being held every five years. There are 110 Councillors and 281 Town Committee members are elected to represent the various districts.

Each Councillor or Town Committee member is responsible for the proper use of public funds for the maintenance and development of their constituency.

The Bahamas uses <a href="Right-%20and%20left-hand%20traffic">drive-on-the-Left</a> traffic rules throughout the Commonwealth.

The districts other than New Providence are:
The colours embodied in the design of the Bahamian flag symbolise the strength of the Bahamian people; the design reflects aspects of the natural environment (sun and sea) and the economic and social development. The flag is a black equilateral triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made up of two colours on three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine.

The coat of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a <a href="marlin">marlin</a> and a <a href="flamingo">flamingo</a>, which are the national animals of the Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands.

On top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the "<a href="Santa%20Maria%20%28ship%29">Santa María</a>" of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is the national motto:
""Forward, Upward, Onward Together."" 

The <a href="Tecoma%20stans">yellow elder</a> was chosen as the national flower of the Bahamas because it is native to the Bahama islands, and it blooms throughout the year.

Selection of the yellow elder over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members of all four of New Providence's garden clubs of the 1970s—the Nassau Garden Club, the Carver Garden Club, the International Garden Club and the <a href="Young%20Women%27s%20Christian%20Association">Y.W.C.A.</a> Garden Club.

They reasoned that other flowers grown there—such as the <a href="bougainvillea">bougainvillea</a>, <a href="hibiscus">hibiscus</a> and <a href="Delonix%20regia">poinciana</a>—had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a>) and also the yellow elder is native to the family islands.

By <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20per%20capita">the terms of GDP per capita</a>, the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. It was revealed in the <a href="Panama%20Papers">Panama Papers</a> that The Bahamas is the jurisdiction with the most offshore entities or companies.

The Bahamas relies on <a href="tourism">tourism</a> to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for over 60% of the Bahamian GDP, but provides jobs for more than half the country's workforce. The Bahamas attracted 5.8 million visitors in 2012, more than 70% of whom were cruise visitors.

After tourism, the next most important economic sector is banking and international financial services, accounting for some 15% of GDP.

The government has adopted incentives to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions of key financial institutions, including the <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Central Bank of the Bahamas</a> (CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Central Bank administers restrictions and <a href="Capital%20control">controls on capital</a> and money market instruments. The <a href="Bahamas%20Securities%20Exchange">Bahamas International Securities Exchange</a> consists of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector has been limited.
The economy has a very competitive tax regime. The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, <a href="VAT">VAT</a>, licence fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer. In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%.

Agriculture is the third largest sector of the Bahamian economy, representing 5–7% of total GDP. An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Major crops include <a href="onion">onion</a>s, <a href="okra">okra</a>, <a href="tomato">tomato</a>es, <a href="Orange%20%28fruit%29">oranges</a>, <a href="grapefruit">grapefruit</a>, <a href="cucumber">cucumber</a>s, <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a>, <a href="lemon">lemon</a>s, <a href="Lime%20%28fruit%29">lime</a>s, and <a href="sweet%20potato">sweet potato</a>es.

The Bahamas has an estimated population of , of which 25.9% are under 14, 67.2% 15 to 64 and 6.9% over 65. It has a population growth rate of 0.925% (2010), with a birth rate of 17.81/1,000 population, death rate of 9.35/1,000, and net migration rate of −2.13 migrant(s)/1,000 population. The <a href="infant%20mortality%20rate">infant mortality rate</a> is 23.21 deaths/1,000 live births. Residents have a life expectancy at birth of 69.87 years: 73.49 years for females, 66.32 years for males. The total fertility rate is 2.0 children born/woman (2010).

The most populous islands are New Providence, where Nassau, the capital and largest city, is located; and Grand Bahama, home to the second largest city of <a href="Freeport%2C%20Bahamas">Freeport</a>.

According to the 99% response rate obtained from the race question on the 2010 Census questionnaire, 90.6% of the population identified themselves as being Black, 4.7% White and 2.1% of a mixed race (Black and White). according to the CIA Handbook. Other sources indicate whites number up to 12 to 15%, The Bahamas Guide, World Population Review. Three centuries prior, in 1722 when the first official census of the Bahamas was taken, 74% of the population was White and 26% Black.
Since the colonial era of plantations, Africans or Afro-Bahamians have been the largest ethnic group in the Bahamas, whose primary ancestry was based in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. The first Africans to arrive to the Bahamas were freed slaves from <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>; they arrived with the <a href="Eleutheran%20Adventurers">Eleutheran Adventurers</a> looking for new lives.

The <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>an community in the Bahamas is also largely of African descent and numbers about 80,000. Due to an extremely high immigration of Haitians to the Bahamas, the Bahamian government started deporting illegal Haitian immigrants to their homeland in late 2014.

The White Bahamian population are mainly the descendants of the <a href="Puritan">English Puritans</a> looking to flee religious persecution in England and <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">American Loyalists</a> escaping the <a href="Revolutionary%20War%20%28United%20States%29">American Revolution</a> who arrived in 1649 and 1783, respectively. Many Southern Loyalists went to the <a href="Abaco%20Islands">Abaco Islands</a>, half of whose population was of European descent as of 1985. The term "white" is usually used to identify Bahamians with Anglo ancestry, as well as "light-skinned" Afro-Bahamians. Sometimes Bahamians use the term "Conchy Joe" to describe people of Anglo descent.

A small portion of the Euro-Bahamian population is descended from <a href="Greece">Greek</a> labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s. They make up less than 1% of the nation's population, but have still preserved their distinct <a href="Greek%20Bahamians">Greek Bahamian</a> culture.

Bahamians typically identify themselves simply as either "black" or "white".

The <a href="official%20language">official language</a> of the Bahamas is English. Many Bahamians also speak an <a href="English-based%20creole%20languages">English-based creole language</a> commonly referred to as "<a href="Bahamian%20Creole">Bahamian dialect</a>" (known simply as "dialect") or as "Bahamianese." James Catalyn, a Bahamian writer and actor was the first to coin the latter name in a poem and has since promoted its usage. Both are used as autoglossonyms. <a href="Haitian%20Creole">Haitian Creole</a>, a <a href="French-based%20creole%20languages">French-based creole language</a> is spoken by Haitians and their descendants, who make up of about 25% of the total population. It is known simply as "Creole" to differentiate languages.

According to International Religious Freedom Report 2008 prepared by United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the islands' population is predominantly <a href="Christian">Christian</a>. <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> denominations are widespread and collectively account for more than 70% of the population, with <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a> representing 35% of the population, <a href="Anglicans">Anglicans</a> 15%, <a href="Pentecostals">Pentecostals</a> 8%, <a href="Church%20of%20God%20%28Holiness%29">Church of God</a> 5%, <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventists">Seventh-day Adventists</a> 5% and <a href="Methodists">Methodists</a> 4%. There is also a significant <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> community accounting for about 14%. There are also smaller communities of <a href="Jews">Jews</a>, <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s, <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Baha'is</a>, <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>s, <a href="Rastafari">Rastafari</a>ans and practitioners of <a href="Obeah">Obeah</a>.

In the less developed outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called "straw", is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called "Voodoo dolls", even though such dolls are the result of the American imagination and not based on historic fact.

A form of folk magic (<a href="obeah">obeah</a>) is practiced by some Bahamians, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of the Bahamas. The practice of obeah is illegal in the Bahamas and punishable by law.

<a href="Junkanoo">Junkanoo</a> is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of 'rushing', music, dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> and <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day">New Year's Day</a>. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.

<a href="Regatta">Regatta</a>s are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned <a href="Boat">work boats</a>, as well as an onshore festival.

Many dishes are associated with <a href="Bahamian%20cuisine">Bahamian cuisine</a>, which reflects Caribbean, African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the "Pineapple Fest" in Gregory Town, <a href="Eleuthera">Eleuthera</a> or the "Crab Fest" on Andros. Other significant traditions include <a href="story%20telling">story telling</a>.

Bahamians have created a rich literature of poetry, short stories, plays and short fictional works. Common themes in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, (3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways and (5) an appreciation of beauty. Some contributing writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis and Winston Saunders.

Bahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, folklore and legend. The most well-known folklore and legends in the Bahamas includes Lusca in Andros Bahamas, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas, the Chickcharnies of Andro Bahamas, and the Lost City of Atlantis on Bimini Bahamas.

Sport is a significant part of Bahamian culture. The national sport is <a href="Cricket">Cricket</a>. Cricket has been played in the Bahamas from 1846. It is the oldest sport being played in the country today. The <a href="Bahamas%20Cricket%20Association">Bahamas Cricket Association</a> was formed in 1936 as an organised body. From the 1940s to the 1970s, cricket was played amongst many Bahamians. Bahamas is not a part of the <a href="West%20Indies%20Cricket%20Board">West Indies Cricket Board</a>, so players are not eligible to play for the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies cricket team</a>. The late 1970s saw the game begin to decline in the country as teachers, who had previously come from the United Kingdom with a passion for cricket were replaced by teachers who had been trained in the United States. The Bahamian Physical education teachers had no knowledge of the game and instead taught <a href="Track%20and%20field">track & field</a>, <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, <a href="softball">softball</a>, <a href="volleyball">volleyball</a> and <a href="Association%20football">football</a> where primary and high schools compete against each other. Today cricket is still enjoyed by a few locals and immigrants in the country usually from <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> and <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>. Cricket is played on Saturdays and Sundays at Windsor Park and Haynes Oval.

The only other sporting event that began before <a href="cricket">cricket</a> was <a href="horse%20racing">horse racing</a>, which started in 1796. The most popular spectator sports are those imported from United States, such as <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, <a href="American%20football">American football</a> and <a href="baseball">baseball</a> rather than Great Britain due to the country's close proximity to the United States. Unlike their other Caribbean counterparts, <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a>, and <a href="netball">netball</a> have proven to be more popular.

<a href="Dexter%20Cambridge">Dexter Cambridge</a>, <a href="Rick%20Fox">Rick Fox</a>, <a href="Ian%20Lockhart">Ian Lockhart</a> and <a href="Buddy%20Hield">Buddy Hield</a> are a few Bahamians who joined Bahamian <a href="Mychal%20Thompson">Mychal Thompson</a> of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> in the NBA ranks, Over the years <a href="American%20football">American football</a> has become much more popular than <a href="association%20football">association football</a>, though not implemented in the high school system yet. Leagues for teens and adults have been developed by the Bahamas American Football Federation. However association football, commonly known as <a href="Association%20football">'soccer'</a> in the country, is still a very popular sport amongst high school pupils. Leagues are governed by the <a href="Bahamas%20Football%20Association">Bahamas Football Association</a>. Recently the Bahamian government has been working closely with <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> of London to promote the sport in the country as well as promoting the Bahamas in the European market. In 2013 'Spurs' became the first Premier League club to play an exhibition match in the Bahamas to face the <a href="Jamaica%20national%20football%20team">Jamaica national football team</a>. <a href="Joe%20Lewis%20%28British%20businessman%29">Joe Lewis</a>, the owner of the <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> club, is based in the Bahamas.

Other popular sports are <a href="Swimming%20%28sport%29">swimming</a>, <a href="tennis">tennis</a> and <a href="boxing">boxing</a> where Bahamians have enjoyed some degree of success at the international level. Other sports such as <a href="golf">golf</a>, <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>, <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> <a href="beach%20soccer">beach soccer</a> and <a href="netball">netball</a> are considered growing sports. <a href="Athletics%20%28sport%29">Athletics</a> commonly known as <a href="track%20and%20field">track and field</a> in the country is the most successful sport by far amongst Bahamians. Bahamians have a strong tradition in the <a href="Sprint%20%28running%29">sprints</a> and jumps.

Baker Island

Baker Island is an uninhabited <a href="atoll">atoll</a> located just north of the <a href="equator">equator</a> in the central <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> about southwest of <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>. The island lies almost halfway between <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Its nearest neighbor is <a href="Howland%20Island">Howland Island</a>, to the north-northwest; both have been territories of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> since 1857, though the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> considered them part of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> between 1897 and 1936.

Located at . the island covers , with of coastline. The <a href="climate">climate</a> is <a href="equatorial%20climate">equatorial</a>, with little rainfall, constant wind, and strong sunshine. The terrain is low-lying and sandy: a <a href="coral%20island">coral island</a> surrounded by a narrow <a href="fringing%20reef">fringing reef</a> with a depressed central area devoid of a <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a> with its highest point being above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>.

The island now forms the Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge and is an <a href="Territories%20of%20the%20United%20States">unincorporated</a> and <a href="unorganized%20territory">unorganized territory</a> of the U.S. which vouches for its <a href="Defense%20%28military%29">defense</a>. It is visited annually by the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>. For statistical purposes, Baker is grouped with the <a href="United%20States%20Minor%20Outlying%20Islands">United States Minor Outlying Islands</a>. Baker Island is also the last piece of land that experiences the <a href="New%20Year">New Year</a> (earliest time zone).

A cemetery and rubble from earlier settlements are located near the middle of the west coast, where the boat landing area is located. There are no ports or harbors, with anchorage prohibited offshore. The narrow fringing reef surrounding the island can be a maritime hazard, so there is a <a href="day%20beacon">day beacon</a> near the old village site. Baker's abandoned <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> runway, long, is completely covered with vegetation and is unserviceable.

The United States claims an <a href="Exclusive%20Economic%20Zone">Exclusive Economic Zone</a> of and <a href="territorial%20waters">territorial sea</a> of around Baker Island.

During a 1935–1942 colonization attempt, the island was most likely on Hawaii time, which was then 10.5 hours behind <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>. Since it is uninhabited the island's time zone is unspecified, but it lies within a <a href="Nautical%20time">nautical time zone</a> 12 hours behind UTC.

Baker was discovered in 1818 by Captain Elisha Folger of the <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a> whaling ship "Equator", who called the island "New Nantucket". In August 1825 Baker was sighted by Captain <a href="Starbuck%20%28whaling%20family%29%23Obed%20Starbuck">Obed Starbuck</a> of the "Loper", also a Nantucket whaler. The island is named for Michael Baker, who visited the island in 1834. Other references state that he visited in 1832, and again on August 14, 1839, in the <a href="whaler">whaler</a> "Gideon Howland", to bury an American seaman. Captain Baker claimed the island in 1855, then he sold his interest to a group who later formed the American Guano Company.

The United States took possession of the island in 1857, claiming it under the <a href="Guano%20Islands%20Act">Guano Islands Act</a> of 1856. Its <a href="guano">guano</a> deposits were mined by the American Guano Company from 1859 to 1878. On 7 December 1886, it sold all its rights to the British firm <a href="John%20T.%20Arundel">John T. Arundel</a> and Company, which made the island its headquarters for guano digging operations in the Pacific from 1886 to 1891. Arundel applied in 1897 to the British Colonial Office for a licence to work the island on the presumption that the USA had abandoned their claim. The United Kingdom then considered Baker Island as a British territory, while never formally annexing it. The United States raised the question at the beginning of the 1920s and after some diplomatic exchanges, they launched in 1935 the <a href="American%20Equatorial%20Islands%20Colonization%20Project">American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project</a> and issued on May 1936 Executive Order 7358 to clarify their sovereignty.

This short-lived attempt at colonization, via the <a href="American%20Equatorial%20Islands%20Colonization%20Project">American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project</a>, begun when American colonists arrived aboard the USCGC "<a href="USCGC%20Itasca%20%281929%29">Itasca</a>", the same vessel that brought colonists to neighboring <a href="Howland%20Island">Howland Island</a>, on April 3, 1935. They built a lighthouse and substantial dwellings, and they attempted to grow various plants. The settlement was named <a href="Meyerton%2C%20Baker%20Island">Meyerton</a>, after Captain H.A. Meyer of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, who helped establish the camps in 1935. One sad-looking clump of coconut palms was jokingly called King-Doyle Park after two well-known citizens of Hawaii who visited on the "Taney" in 1938. This clump was the best on the island, planted near a water seep, but the dry climate and seabirds, eager for anything upon which to perch, did not give the trees or shrubs much of a chance to survive. King-Doyle Park was later adopted as a geographic name by the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">USGS</a>. Its population was four American civilians, all of whom were evacuated in 1942 after <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese air and naval attacks. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> it was occupied by the U.S. military.

On August 11, 1943, a US Army defense force arrived on Baker Island as part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kwajalein%23Gilbert%20and%20Marshall%20Islands%20campaign">Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign</a>. In September 1943 a airfield was opened and was subsequently used as a staging base by <a href="Seventh%20Air%20Force">Seventh Air Force</a> <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> bombers for attacks on <a href="Mili%20Atoll">Mili Atoll</a>. The <a href="45th%20Fighter%20Squadron">45th Fighter Squadron</a> operating <a href="Curtis%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40</a> fighters operated from the airfield from September 1 - November 27, 1943. By January 1, 1944 the airfield was abandoned.

<a href="LORAN">LORAN</a> radio navigation station Baker was a radio operations base in operation from September 1944 to July 1946. The station unit number was 91 and the radio call sign was NRN-1.

Baker has no natural fresh water sources. It is treeless, with sparse vegetation consisting of four kinds of grass, prostrate vines and low-growing shrubs. The island is primarily a nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat for seabirds, shorebirds, and marine wildlife.

Several varieties of shorebirds and other species inhabit the island and nearby waters, some considered endangered. The <a href="ruddy%20turnstone">ruddy turnstone</a>, <a href="bar-tailed%20godwit">bar-tailed godwit</a>, <a href="sanderling">sanderling</a> and <a href="Pacific%20golden%20plover">Pacific golden plover</a> are considered species of least concern. The <a href="bristle-thighed%20curlew">bristle-thighed curlew</a> is considered vulnerable on the national conservation priority scheme. <a href="Green%20turtles">Green turtles</a> and <a href="hawksbill%20turtle">hawksbill turtle</a>s, both critically endangered, can be found along the reef.

Seabird species such as the <a href="lesser%20frigatebird">lesser frigatebird</a>, <a href="brown%20noddy">brown noddy</a> and <a href="sooty%20tern">sooty tern</a> use the island for nesting and roosting. The island is also believed to be a rest stop for arctic-breeding shorebirds.

On June 27, 1974, Secretary of the Interior <a href="Rogers%20Morton">Rogers Morton</a> created Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge which was expanded in 2009 to add submerged lands within of the island. The refuge now includes of land and of water. Baker, along with six other islands, was administered by the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> as part of the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex. In January 2009, that entity was redesignated the <a href="Pacific%20Remote%20Islands%20Marine%20National%20Monument">Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument</a> by President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>.

Environmental challenges include abandoned military debris from <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and illegal fishing offshore. <a href="Invasive%20species">Invasive exotics</a> introduced by human activity, including cockroaches and <a href="coconut">coconut palm</a>s, have also displaced native wildlife. <a href="Feral%20cats">Feral cats</a>, first introduced in 1937, were eradicated in 1965.

Public entry to the island is only by special use permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and it is generally restricted to scientists and educators. Representatives from the agency visit the island on average once every two years, usually coordinating transportation with a <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">NOAA</a> vessel.

Debris from past human occupation is scattered throughout the island and in offshore waters. Most is from the U.S. military occupation of the island from 1942 to 1946. The most noticeable remnant is the airstrip. It is completely overgrown with vegetation and is unusable. In the northeast section, apparently the main camp area, are the remains of several buildings and heavy equipment. Five wooden antenna poles about in height remain standing in the camp. Debris from several crashed airplanes and large equipment such as bulldozers is scattered around the island. Numerous bulldozer excavations containing the remnants of metal, fuel and water drums are scattered about the north central portion and northern edge of the island. The Navy reported the loss of 11 landing craft in the surf during World War II.

Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to <a href="United%20Nations%20peacekeeping">United Nations peacekeeping</a> forces.

The etymology of "Bangladesh" (Country of Bengal) can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such as "Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo" by <a href="Kazi%20Nazrul%20Islam">Kazi Nazrul Islam</a> and "Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy" by <a href="Rabindranath%20Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, used the term. The term "Bangladesh" was often written as two words, "Bangla Desh", in the past. Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a>. The term "Bangla" is a major name for both the <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> region and the <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali language</a>. The earliest references to the term date to the <a href="Nesari">Nesari plate</a> in 805 AD. The term "Vangaladesa" is found in 11th century South Indian records.

The term gained official status during the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Bengal">Sultanate of Bengal</a> in the 14th century. <a href="Shamsuddin%20Ilyas%20Shah">Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah</a> proclaimed himself as the first "<a href="Shah">Shah</a> of Bangala" in 1342. The word "Bangla" became the most common name for the region during the Islamic period. The <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a> referred to the region as "Bengala" in the 16th century.

The origins of the term "Bangla" are unclear, with theories pointing to a <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> <a href="Proto-Dravidian%20language">proto-Dravidian</a> tribe, the <a href="Austric">Austric</a> word "Bonga" (Sun god), and the Iron Age <a href="Vanga%20Kingdom">Vanga Kingdom</a>. The Indo-Aryan suffix "Desh" is derived from the Sanskrit word "deśha", which means "land" or "country". Hence, the name "Bangladesh" means "Land of Bengal" or "Country of Bengal".

<a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> tools found in Bangladesh indicate human habitation for over 20,000 years, and remnants of <a href="Copper%20Age">Copper Age</a> settlements date back 4,000 years. Ancient Bengal was settled by <a href="Austroasiatic">Austroasiatic</a>s, <a href="Tibeto-Burman">Tibeto-Burman</a>s, Dravidians and <a href="Rigvedic%20tribes">Indo-Aryans</a> in consecutive waves of migration. <a href="Archaeology">Archaeological evidence</a> confirms that by the second millennium BCE, <a href="rice">rice</a>-cultivating communities inhabited the region. By the 11th century people lived in systemically-aligned housing, buried their dead, and manufactured copper ornaments and black and red pottery. The <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a>, <a href="Brahmaputra">Brahmaputra</a> and <a href="Meghna">Meghna</a> rivers were natural arteries for communication and transportation, and <a href="Estuary">estuaries</a> on the Bay of Bengal permitted <a href="maritime%20industry">maritime</a> trade. The early <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> saw the development of metal weaponry, <a href="coin">coin</a>age, agriculture and <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a>. Major urban settlements formed during the late Iron Age, in the mid-<a href="first%20millennium%20BCE">first millennium BCE</a>, when the <a href="Northern%20Black%20Polished%20Ware">Northern Black Polished Ware</a> culture developed. In 1879, <a href="Alexander%20Cunningham">Alexander Cunningham</a> identified <a href="Mahasthangarh">Mahasthangarh</a> as the capital of the <a href="Pundra%20Kingdom">Pundra Kingdom</a> mentioned in the "<a href="Rigveda">Rigveda</a>".

<a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Greek and Roman</a> records of the ancient <a href="Gangaridai">Gangaridai</a> Kingdom, which (according to legend) deterred the invasion of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, are linked to the fort city in <a href="Wari-Bateshwar%20ruins">Wari-Bateshwar</a>. The site is also identified with the prosperous trading center of Souanagoura listed on <a href="Ptolemy%27s%20world%20map">Ptolemy's world map</a>. Roman geographers noted a large <a href="seaport">seaport</a> in southeastern Bengal, corresponding to the present-day <a href="Chittagong%20District">Chittagong</a> region.

Ancient <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> and <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> states which ruled Bangladesh included the <a href="Vanga%20Kingdom">Vanga</a>, <a href="Samatata">Samatata</a> and Pundra kingdoms, the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Maurya</a> and <a href="Gupta%20Empire">Gupta Empire</a>s, the <a href="Varman%20dynasty">Varman dynasty</a>, <a href="Shashanka">Shashanka</a>'s kingdom, the <a href="Khadga%20dynasty">Khadga</a> and <a href="Candra%20dynasty">Candra dynasties</a>, the <a href="Pala%20Empire">Pala Empire</a>, the <a href="Sena%20dynasty">Sena dynasty</a>, the <a href="Harikela">Harikela</a> kingdom and the <a href="Deva%20dynasty">Deva dynasty</a>. These states had well-developed currencies, banking, shipping, architecture and art, and the ancient universities of <a href="Bikrampur">Bikrampur</a> and <a href="Mainamati">Mainamati</a> hosted scholars and students from other parts of Asia. <a href="Xuanzang">Xuanzang</a> of China was a noted scholar who resided at the <a href="Somapura%20Mahavihara">Somapura Mahavihara</a> (the largest monastery in ancient India), and <a href="Atisa">Atisa</a> traveled from Bengal to <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a> to preach Buddhism. The earliest form of the <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali language</a> began to the emerge during the eighth century.

Early Muslim explorers and missionaries arrived in Bengal late in the first millennium CE. The Islamic conquest of Bengal began with the 1204 invasion by <a href="Bakhtiar%20Khilji">Bakhtiar Khilji</a>; after annexing Bengal to the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>, Khilji waged a <a href="Islamic%20invasion%20of%20Tibet">military campaign in Tibet</a>. Bengal was ruled by the Delhi Sultanate for a century by governors from the <a href="Khilji%20dynasty">Khilji</a>, <a href="Mamluk%20dynasty%20%28Delhi%29">Mamluk</a>, Balban and <a href="Tughluq%20dynasty">Tughluq dynasties</a>. During the 14th century, an independent <a href="Bengal%20Sultanate">Bengal Sultanate</a> was established by rebel governors. The sultanate's ruling houses included the <a href="Ilyas%20Shahi%20dynasty">Ilyas Shahi</a>, <a href="Jalaluddin%20Muhammad%20Shah">Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah</a>, <a href="Hussain%20Shahi%20dynasty">Hussain Shahi</a>, <a href="Suri%20dynasty">Suri</a> and <a href="Karrani%20dynasty">Karrani dynasties</a>, and the era saw the introduction of a distinct mosque architecture and the <a href="History%20of%20the%20taka">tangka currency</a>. The <a href="Arakan">Arakan</a> region was brought under Bengali hegemony. The Bengal Sultanate was visited by explorers <a href="Ibn%20Battuta">Ibn Battuta</a>, <a href="Admiral%20Zheng%20He">Admiral Zheng He</a> and <a href="Niccolo%20De%20Conti">Niccolo De Conti</a>. During the late 16th century, the <a href="Baro-Bhuyan">Baro-Bhuyan</a> (a confederation of Muslim and Hindu aristocrats) ruled eastern Bengal; its leader was the Mansad-e-Ala, a title held by <a href="Isa%20Khan">Isa Khan</a> and his son <a href="Musa%20Khan">Musa Khan</a>. The Khan dynasty are considered local heroes for resisting North Indian invasions with their river navies.

The <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a> controlled Bengal by the 17th century. During the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Akbar">Emperor Akbar</a>, the Bengali agrarian calendar was reformed to facilitate tax collection. The Mughals established Dhaka as a fort city and commercial metropolis, and it was the capital of <a href="Mughal%20Bengal">Mughal Bengal</a> for 75 years. In 1666, the Mughals expelled the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mrauk%20U">Arakanese</a> from Chittagong. Mughal Bengal attracted foreign traders for its <a href="muslin">muslin</a> and <a href="silk">silk</a> goods, and the <a href="Armenians%20in%20Bangladesh">Armenians</a> were a notable merchant community. A <a href="Portuguese%20settlement%20in%20Chittagong">Portuguese settlement in Chittagong</a> flourished in the southeast, and a <a href="Dutch%20settlement%20in%20Rajshahi">Dutch settlement in Rajshahi</a> existed in the north. During the 18th century, the <a href="Nawabs%20of%20Bengal">Nawabs of Bengal</a> became the region's "de facto" rulers. The Nawabs forged alliances with European colonial companies, which made the region relatively prosperous early in the century.

The <a href="Bengali%20Muslim">Bengali Muslim</a> population was a product of conversion and religious evolution, and their pre-Islamic beliefs included elements of Buddhism and Hinduism. The construction of mosques, Islamic academies (madrasas) and Sufi monasteries (<a href="khanqah">khanqah</a>s) facilitated conversion, and <a href="Islamic%20cosmology">Islamic cosmology</a> played a significant role in developing Bengali Muslim society. Scholars have theorized that Bengalis were attracted to Islam by its egalitarian social order, which contrasted with the Hindu caste system. By the 15th century, Muslim poets were writing in the Bengali language. Notable medieval Bengali Muslim poets included <a href="Daulat%20Qazi">Daulat Qazi</a>, <a href="Abdul%20Hakim%20%28poet%29">Abdul Hakim</a> and <a href="Alaol">Alaol</a>. <a href="Syncretic">Syncretic</a> cults, such as the <a href="Baul">Baul</a> movement, emerged on the fringes of Bengali Muslim society. The <a href="Persianate">Persianate</a> culture was signifcant in Bengal, where cities like <a href="Sonargaon">Sonargaon</a> became the easternmost centers of Persian influence.

After the 1757 <a href="Battle%20of%20Plassey">Battle of Plassey</a>, Bengal was the first region of the Indian subcontinent conquered by the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a>. The company formed the <a href="Bengal%20Presidency">Presidency of Fort William</a>, which administered the region until 1858. A notable aspect of <a href="company%20rule%20in%20India">company rule</a> was the <a href="Permanent%20Settlement">Permanent Settlement</a>, which established the feudal <a href="zamindar">zamindar</a>i system. A number of famines, including the <a href="great%20Bengal%20famine%20of%201770">great Bengal famine of 1770</a>, occurred under company rule. Several rebellions broke out during the early 19th century (including one led by <a href="Titumir">Titumir</a>), but British rule displaced the Muslim ruling class. A conservative Islamic cleric, <a href="Haji%20Shariatullah">Haji Shariatullah</a>, sought to overthrow the British by propagating Islamic revivalism. Several towns in Bangladesh participated in the <a href="Indian%20Mutiny">Indian Mutiny</a> and pledged allegiance to the last Mughal emperor, <a href="Bahadur%20Shah%20Zafar">Bahadur Shah Zafar</a>, who was later exiled to neighboring Burma.
The challenge posed to company rule by the failed Indian Mutiny led to the creation of the <a href="British%20Indian%20Empire">British Indian Empire</a> as a <a href="crown%20colony">crown colony</a>, and the first <a href="Eastern%20Bengal%20Railway">railway</a> was built in 1862. <a href="Syed%20Ahmed%20Khan">Syed Ahmed Khan</a> and <a href="Ram%20Mohan%20Roy">Ram Mohan Roy</a> promoted modern and <a href="liberal%20education">liberal education</a> on the subcontinent, inspiring the <a href="Aligarh%20movement">Aligarh movement</a> and the <a href="Bengal%20Renaissance">Bengal Renaissance</a>. During the late 19th century, novelists, social reformers and feminists emerged from Muslim Bengali society. <a href="Electricity">Electricity</a> and municipal water systems were introduced in the 1890s; <a href="Movie%20theater">cinemas</a> opened in many towns during the early 20th century. East Bengal's <a href="plantation%20economy">plantation economy</a> was important to the British Empire, particularly its <a href="jute">jute</a> and <a href="Tea%20production%20in%20Bangladesh">tea</a>. The British established <a href="free%20port">tax-free river port</a>s, such as the <a href="Port%20of%20Narayanganj">Port of Narayanganj</a>, and large seaports like the <a href="Port%20of%20Chittagong">Port of Chittagong</a>.

Social tensions also increased under British rule, particularly between wealthy Hindus and the Muslim-majority population. The Permanent Settlement made millions of Muslim peasants tenants of Hindu estates, and resentment of the Hindu landed gentry grew. Supported by the Muslim aristocracy, the British government created the province of <a href="Eastern%20Bengal%20and%20Assam">Eastern Bengal and Assam</a> in 1905; the new province received increased investment in education, transport and industry. However, the <a href="Partition%20of%20Bengal%20%281905%29">first partition of Bengal</a> created an uproar in <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> and the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a>. In response to growing Hindu nationalism, the <a href="All%20India%20Muslim%20League">All India Muslim League</a> was formed in Dhaka during the 1906 All India Muhammadan Educational Conference. The British government reorganized the provinces in 1912, reuniting East and West Bengal and making <a href="Assam%20Province">Assam</a> a second province.
The Raj was slow to allow self-rule in the colonial subcontinent. It established the <a href="Bengal%20Legislative%20Council">Bengal Legislative Council</a> in 1862, and the council's native Bengali representation increased during the early 20th century. The <a href="Bengal%20Provincial%20Muslim%20League">Bengal Provincial Muslim League</a> was formed in 1913 to advocate <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> for Bengali Muslims within a constitutional framework. During the 1920s, the league was divided into factions supporting the <a href="Khilafat%20movement">Khilafat movement</a> and favoring cooperation with the British to achieve self-rule. Segments of the Bengali elite supported <a href="Mustafa%20Kemal%20Ataturk">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</a> <a href="Secularism%20in%20Turkey">secularist</a> forces. In 1929, the <a href="Praja%20Party">All Bengal Tenants Association</a> was formed in the Bengal Legislative Council to counter the influence of the Hindu landed gentry, and the <a href="Indian%20Independence%20Movement">Indian Independence</a> and <a href="Pakistan%20Movement">Pakistan Movement</a>s strengthened during the early 20th century. After the <a href="Morley-Minto%20Reforms">Morley-Minto Reforms</a> and the <a href="Government%20of%20India%20Act%2C%201919">diarchy</a> era in the <a href="legislatures%20of%20British%20India">legislatures of British India</a>, the British government promised <a href="Government%20of%20India%20Act%2C%201935">limited provincial autonomy</a> in 1935. The <a href="Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly">Bengal Legislative Assembly</a>, British India's largest legislature, was established in 1937.
Although it won a majority of seats in 1937, the Bengal Congress boycotted the legislature. <a href="A.%20K.%20Fazlul%20Huq">A. K. Fazlul Huq</a> of the <a href="Krishak%20Sramik%20Party">Krishak Praja Party</a> was elected as the first <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Bengal">Prime Minister of Bengal</a>. In 1940 Huq supported the <a href="Lahore%20Resolution">Lahore Resolution</a>, which envisaged independent states in the northwestern and eastern Muslim-majority regions of the subcontinent. The first Huq ministry, a coalition with the Bengal Provincial Muslim League, lasted until 1941; it was followed by a Huq coalition with the <a href="Hindu%20Mahasabha">Hindu Mahasabha</a> which lasted until 1943. Huq was succeeded by <a href="Khawaja%20Nazimuddin">Khawaja Nazimuddin</a>, who grappled with the effects of the <a href="Burma%20Campaign">Burma Campaign</a>, the <a href="Bengal%20famine%20of%201943">Bengal famine of 1943</a> and the <a href="Quit%20India">Quit India</a> movement. In 1946, the Bengal Provincial Muslim League won the provincial election, taking 113 of the 250-seat assembly (the largest Muslim League mandate in British India). <a href="H.%20S.%20Suhrawardy">H. S. Suhrawardy</a>, who made a final futile effort for a <a href="United%20Bengal">United Bengal</a> in 1946, was the last premier of Bengal.

The 3 June 1947 <a href="Mountbatten%20Plan">Mountbatten Plan</a> outlined the <a href="partition%20of%20British%20India">partition of British India</a>. On 20 June, the Bengal Legislative Assembly met to decide on the partition of Bengal. At the preliminary joint meeting, it was decided (120 votes to 90) that if the province remained united it should join the <a href="Constituent%20Assembly%20of%20Pakistan">Constituent Assembly of Pakistan</a>. At a separate meeting of legislators from <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a>, it was decided (58 votes to 21) that the province should be partitioned and West Bengal should join the <a href="Constituent%20Assembly%20of%20India">Constituent Assembly of India</a>. At another meeting of legislators from <a href="East%20Bengal">East Bengal</a>, it was decided (106 votes to 35) that the province should not be partitioned and (107 votes to 34) that East Bengal should join the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan if Bengal was partitioned. On 6 July, the <a href="Sylhet%20Division">Sylhet region</a> of Assam voted in a <a href="Sylhet%20referendum%2C%201947">referendum to join East Bengal</a>.

<a href="Cyril%20Radcliffe">Cyril Radcliffe</a> was tasked with drawing the borders of Pakistan and India, and the <a href="Radcliffe%20Line">Radcliffe Line</a> established the borders of present-day Bangladesh. The <a href="Dominion%20of%20Pakistan">Dominion of Pakistan</a> was created on 14 August 1947.

East Bengal, with Dhaka its capital, was the most populous province of the 1947 <a href="State%20of%20Pakistan">Pakistani federation</a> (led by <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Pakistan">Governor General</a> <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a>, who promised freedom of religion and secular democracy in the new state). East Bengal was also Pakistan's most cosmopolitan province, home to peoples of different faiths, cultures and ethnic groups. Partition gave increased economic opportunity to East Bengalis, producing an urban population during the 1950s.

<a href="Khawaja%20Nazimuddin">Khawaja Nazimuddin</a> was East Bengal's first <a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20East%20Bengal">chief minister</a> with <a href="Frederick%20Chalmers%20Bourne">Frederick Chalmers Bourne</a> its governor. The <a href="All%20Pakistan%20Awami%20Muslim%20League">All Pakistan Awami Muslim League</a> was formed in 1949 as a centre-left alternative to the centre-right All Pakistan Muslim League. In 1950, the <a href="East%20Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly">East Bengal Legislative Assembly</a> enacted <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a>, abolishing the Permanent Settlement and the <a href="zamindar">zamindar</a>i system. The 1952 <a href="Bengali%20Language%20Movement">Bengali Language Movement</a> was the first sign of friction between the country's geographically-separated wings. The Awami Muslim League was renamed the more-secular <a href="Awami%20League">Awami League</a> in 1953. The first constituent assembly was dissolved in 1954; this was challenged by its East Bengali speaker, <a href="Maulvi%20Tamizuddin%20Khan">Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan</a>. The <a href="United%20Front%20%28East%20Pakistan%29">United Front</a> coalition swept aside the Muslim League in a landslide victory in the 1954 <a href="East%20Bengali%20legislative%20election%2C%201954">East Bengali legislative election</a>. The following year, East Bengal was renamed <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a> as part of the <a href="One%20Unit">One Unit</a> program and the province became a vital part of the <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a>.
Pakistan adopted its first constitution in 1956. Three Bengalis were its Prime Minister until 1957: Nazimuddin, <a href="Mohammad%20Ali%20of%20Bogra">Mohammad Ali of Bogra</a> and Suhrawardy. None of the three completed their terms, and resigned from office. The <a href="Pakistan%20Army">Pakistan Army</a> imposed <a href="1958%20Pakistani%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">military rule in 1958</a>, and <a href="Ayub%20Khan%20%28general%29">Ayub Khan</a> was the country's strongman for 11 years. Political repression increased after the coup. Khan introduced a new constitution in 1962, replacing Pakistan's parliamentary system with a presidential and gubernatorial system (based on <a href="electoral%20college">electoral college</a> selection) known as Basic Democracy. In 1962 Dhaka became the seat of the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Pakistan">National Assembly of Pakistan</a>, a move seen as appeasing increased Bengali nationalism. The Pakistani government built the controversial <a href="Kaptai%20Dam">Kaptai Dam</a>, displacing the <a href="Chakma%20people">Chakma people</a> from their indigenous homeland in the <a href="Chittagong%20Hill%20Tracts">Chittagong Hill Tracts</a>. During the <a href="Pakistani%20presidential%20election%2C%201965">1965 presidential election</a>, <a href="Fatima%20Jinnah">Fatima Jinnah</a> lost to Ayub Khan despite support from the Combined Opposition alliance (which included the Awami League). The <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201965">Indo-Pakistani War of 1965</a> blocked cross-border transport links with neighboring India in what is described as a second partition. In 1966, Awami League leader <a href="Sheikh%20Mujibur%20Rahman">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> announced a <a href="six%20point%20movement">six point movement</a> for a federal parliamentary democracy.
According to senior <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> officials, Pakistan practiced extensive <a href="economic%20discrimination">economic discrimination</a> against East Pakistan: greater government spending on West Pakistan, financial transfers from East to West Pakistan and the use of East Pakistan's foreign-exchange surpluses to finance West Pakistani imports; East Pakistan generated 70 percent of Pakistan's export revenue with its jute and tea. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested for treason in the <a href="Agartala%20Conspiracy%20Case">Agartala Conspiracy Case</a>, and was released during the <a href="1969%20uprising%20in%20East%20Pakistan">1969 uprising in East Pakistan</a> which resulted in Ayub Khan's resignation. General <a href="Yahya%20Khan">Yahya Khan</a> assumed power, reintroducing martial law.

Ethnic and linguistic discrimination was common in Pakistan's civil and military services, in which Bengalis were under-represented. Fifteen percent of Pakistani central-government offices were occupied by East Pakistanis, who formed 10 percent of the military. Cultural discrimination also prevailed, making East Pakistan forge a distinct political identity. Pakistan banned Bengali literature and music in state media, including the works of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. A <a href="1970%20Bhola%20cyclone">cyclone</a> devastated the coast of East Pakistan in 1970, killing an estimated 500,000 people, and the central government was criticized for its poor response. After the December 1970 elections, calls for the independence of East Bengal became louder; the Bengali-nationalist Awami League won 167 of 169 East Pakistani seats in the National Assembly. The League claimed the right to form a government and develop a new constitution, but was strongly opposed by the Pakistani military and the <a href="Pakistan%20Peoples%20Party">Pakistan Peoples Party</a> (led by <a href="Zulfikar%20Ali%20Bhutto">Zulfikar Ali Bhutto</a>).

The Bengali population was angered when <a href="Prime%20Minister-elect">Prime Minister-elect</a> Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was prevented from taking office. <a href="Civil%20disobedience">Civil disobedience</a> erupted across East Pakistan, with calls for independence. Rahman addressed a <a href="7th%20March%20Speech%20of%20Sheikh%20Mujibur%20Rahman">pro-independence rally</a> in <a href="Dhaka">Dacca</a> on 7 March 1971. The <a href="Flag%20of%20Bangladesh">Bangladeshi flag</a> was raised for the first time on 23 March, Pakistan's <a href="Republic%20Day%20%28Pakistan%29">Republic Day</a>. During the night of 25 March, the Pakistani <a href="military%20junta">military junta</a> led by <a href="Yahya%20Khan">Yahya Khan</a> launched <a href="Operation%20Searchlight">Operation Searchlight</a> (a sustained military assault on East Pakistan) and held Rahman in military custody. The <a href="Pakistan%20Army">Pakistan Army</a>, with help from supporting militias, massacred Bengali <a href="1971%20Dhaka%20University%20massacre">students</a>, <a href="1971%20killing%20of%20Bengali%20intellectuals">intellectuals</a>, politicians, civil servants and military defectors in the <a href="1971%20Bangladesh%20genocide">1971 Bangladesh genocide</a>. Several million refugees fled to neighboring <a href="India">India</a>. Estimates of the number killed during the war range from 300,000 to three million. Global public opinion turned against Pakistan as news of the atrocities spread; the Bangladesh movement was supported by prominent political and cultural figures in the West, including <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a>, <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>, <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a>, <a href="Victoria%20Ocampo">Victoria Ocampo</a> and <a href="Andre%20Malraux">Andre Malraux</a>. The <a href="Concert%20for%20Bangla%20Desh">Concert for Bangla Desh</a> was held at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in New York City to raise funds for Bangladeshi refugees. The first major <a href="benefit%20concert">benefit concert</a> in history, it was organized by Harrison and Indian Bengali sitarist <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a>.

During the Bangladesh Liberation War, Bengali nationalists declared independence and formed the <a href="Mukti%20Bahini">Mukti Bahini</a> (the Bangladeshi National Liberation Army). The <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20Bangladesh">Provisional Government of Bangladesh</a> was established on 17 April 1971, converting the 469 elected members of the Pakistani national assembly and East Pakistani provincial assembly into the <a href="Constituent%20Assembly%20of%20Bangladesh">Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh</a>. The provisional government issued the <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Bangladeshi%20Independence">Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence</a>, which was the country's interim constitution and declared "equality, human dignity and social justice" as its fundamental principles. Due to Rahman's detention, the acting president was <a href="Syed%20Nazrul%20Islam">Syed Nazrul Islam</a>. <a href="Tajuddin%20Ahmad">Tajuddin Ahmad</a> was Bangladesh's first prime minister. The military wing of the provisional government was the <a href="Bangladesh%20Forces">Bangladesh Forces</a>. Led by General <a href="M.%20A.%20G.%20Osmani">M. A. G. Osmani</a> and eleven <a href="List%20of%20sectors%20in%20Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War">sector commanders</a>, the forces held the Bengali countryside during the war and conducted wide-ranging <a href="Guerrilla%20war">guerrilla operations</a> against Pakistani forces. Neighboring India and its leader, <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> (a longtime nemesis of Pakistan), provided crucial support to the Bangladesh Forces and intervened in support of the provisional government on 3 December 1971. The <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and the United States dispatched naval forces to the Bay of Bengal in a <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> standoff during the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201971">Indo-Pakistani War</a>. The nine-month war ended with the <a href="Surrender%20of%20Pakistan">surrender of Pakistan's military</a> to the Bangladesh-India Allied Forces on 16 December 1971. Under international pressure, Pakistan released Rahman from imprisonment on 8 January 1972 and he was flown by the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> to a million-strong homecoming in Dacca. Indian troops were withdrawn by 12 March 1972, three months after the war ended.

The cause of Bangladeshi self-determination was recognized around the world. By the time of its admission to UN membership in August 1972, the new state was recognized by 86 countries. Pakistan recognized Bangladesh in 1974 after pressure from most of the <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim world</a>.

The constituent assembly adopted Bangladesh's constitution on 4 November 1972, establishing a secular, multiparty parliamentary democracy. The new constitution included references to <a href="socialism">socialism</a>, and Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman <a href="nationalized">nationalized</a> major industries in 1972. A major reconstruction and rehabilitation program was launched. The Awami League won the country's first general election in 1973, securing a large majority in the <a href="Jatiyo%20Sangshad">Jatiyo Sangshad</a>. Bangladesh joined the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, the UN, the <a href="Organisation%20of%20Islamic%20Cooperation">OIC</a> and the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>, and Rahman strengthened ties with India. Amid growing agitation by the opposition <a href="National%20Awami%20Party">National Awami Party</a> and <a href="Jashod">National Socialist Party</a>, he became increasingly authoritarian. Rahman amended the constitution, giving himself more emergency powers (including the suspension of fundamental rights). The <a href="Bangladesh%20famine%20of%201974">Bangladesh famine of 1974</a> also worsened the political situation.

In January 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman introduced <a href="One-party%20state">one-party socialist rule</a> under <a href="Bangladesh%20Krishak%20Sramik%20Awami%20League">BAKSAL</a>. Rahman banned all newspapers except four state-owned publications, and amended the constitution to increase his power. He was <a href="Assassination%20of%20Sheikh%20Mujibur%20Rahman">assassinated</a> during a coup on 15 August 1975. <a href="Martial%20law">Martial law</a> was declared, and the presidency passed to the <a href="usurper">usurper</a> <a href="Khondaker%20Mostaq%20Ahmad">Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad</a> for four months. Ahmad is widely regarded as a <a href="quisling">quisling</a> by Bangladeshis. Tajuddin Ahmad, the nation's first prime minister, and four other independence leaders were assassinated on 4 November 1975. Chief Justice <a href="Abu%20Sadat%20Mohammad%20Sayem">Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem</a> was installed as president by the military on 6 November 1975. Bangladesh was governed by a <a href="military%20junta">military junta</a> led by the <a href="Chief%20Martial%20Law%20Administrator">Chief Martial Law Administrator</a> for three years. In 1977, Army chief <a href="Ziaur%20Rahman">Ziaur Rahman</a> became president. Rahman reinstated <a href="multiparty">multiparty</a> politics, <a href="privatization">privatized</a> industries and newspapers, established <a href="Bangladesh%20Export%20Processing%20Zone%20Authority">BEPZA</a> and held the country's second general election in 1979. A <a href="semi-presidential">semi-presidential</a> system evolved, with the <a href="Bangladesh%20Nationalist%20Party">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> (BNP) governing until 1982. Rahman was assassinated in 1981, and was succeeded by <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20Bangladesh">Vice President</a> <a href="Abdus%20Sattar%20%28president%29">Abdus Sattar</a>. Sattar received 65.5 percent of the vote in the <a href="Bangladeshi%20presidential%20election%2C%201981">1981 presidential election</a>.

After a year in office, Sattar was overthrown in the <a href="1982%20Bangladesh%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1982 Bangladesh coup d'état</a>. Chief Justice <a href="A.%20F.%20M.%20Ahsanuddin%20Chowdhury">A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury</a> was installed as president, but army chief <a href="Hussain%20Muhammad%20Ershad">Hussain Muhammad Ershad</a> became the country's "de facto" leader and assumed the presidency in 1983. Ershad lifted martial law in 1986. He governed with four successive prime ministers (<a href="Ataur%20Rahman%20Khan">Ataur Rahman Khan</a>, <a href="Mizanur%20Rahman%20Chowdhury">Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury</a>, <a href="Moudud%20Ahmed">Moudud Ahmed</a> and <a href="Kazi%20Zafar%20Ahmed">Kazi Zafar Ahmed</a>) and a parliament dominated by his <a href="Jatiya%20Party%20%28Ershad%29">Jatiyo Party</a>. General elections were held in 1986 and 1988, although the latter was boycotted by the opposition BNP and Awami League. Ershad pursued administrative decentralization, dividing the country into 64 districts, and pushed Parliament to make Islam the state religion in 1988. A <a href="1990%20Mass%20Uprising%20in%20Bangladesh">1990 mass uprising</a> forced him to resign, and Chief Justice <a href="Shahabuddin%20Ahmed">Shahabuddin Ahmed</a> led the country's first caretaker government as part of the transition to parliamentary rule.

After the 1991 general election, the twelfth amendment to the constitution restored the parliamentary republic and <a href="Begum%20Khaleda%20Zia">Begum Khaleda Zia</a> became Bangladesh's first female prime minister. Zia, a former first lady, led a BNP government from 1990 to 1996. In 1991 her finance minister, <a href="Saifur%20Rahman">Saifur Rahman</a>, began a major program to liberalize the Bangladeshi economy.

After an Awami League initiative, the BNP introduced a system of <a href="caretaker%20government%20of%20Bangladesh">caretaker governments</a> to oversee the transfer of power. Justice <a href="Muhammad%20Habibur%20Rahman">Muhammad Habibur Rahman</a> was the first <a href="Chief%20Adviser%20of%20Bangladesh">Chief Adviser of Bangladesh</a>, and oversaw the 1996 election. The Awami League, led by <a href="Sheikh%20Hasina">Sheikh Hasina</a>, won the seventh general election. Hasina's first term was highlighted by the <a href="Chittagong%20Hill%20Tracts%20Peace%20Accord">Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord</a> and a <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> water-sharing treaty with India. The second caretaker government, led by Chief Adviser Justice <a href="Latifur%20Rahman">Latifur Rahman</a>, oversaw the eighth general election in 2001 which returned Begum Zia and the BNP to power. The second Zia ministry saw improved economic growth, but political turmoil gripped the country between 2004 and 2006. A radical Islamist militant group, the <a href="Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen%20Bangladesh">JMB</a>, carried out a series of bombings. Amid widespread political unrest the Bangladeshi military urged President <a href="Iajuddin%20Ahmed">Iajuddin Ahmed</a> to impose a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> and a caretaker government, led by technocrat <a href="Fakhruddin%20Ahmed">Fakhruddin Ahmed</a>, was installed.

Emergency rule lasted for two years, until the ninth general election in 2008 which returned Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League to power. In 2010, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Bangladesh">Supreme Court</a> ruled martial law illegal and affirmed <a href="Secularism">secular</a> principles in the constitution. The following year, the Awami League abolished the caretaker-government system. The 2014 general election was boycotted by the BNP, giving the Awami League a decisive victory.

The geography of Bangladesh is divided between three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile <a href="Ganges-Brahmaputra%20delta">Ganges-Brahmaputra delta</a>; the northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the <a href="Madhupur%20tract">Madhupur</a> and the <a href="Barind%20Tract">Barind</a> plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to <a href="evergreen">evergreen</a> hill ranges. The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name <a href="Padma%20River">Padma</a> or "Pôdda"), <a href="Brahmaputra%20River">Brahmaputra</a> (<a href="Jamuna%20River%20%28Bangladesh%29">Jamuna</a> or "Jomuna"), and <a href="Meghna%20River">Meghna</a> rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>. Bangladesh has 57 <a href="trans-boundary%20river">trans-boundary river</a>s, making the resolution of water issues to be politically complicated, in most cases, as the country is a lower <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian</a> state to India.

Bangladesh is predominately rich fertile flat land. Most parts of it is less than above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by . 17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems. The country's <a href="haor">haor</a> wetlands are of significance to global environmental science.

In southeastern Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. Construction of cross dams has induced a natural accretion of silt, creating new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began promoting the development of this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has become a multi-agency endeavor, building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. It was expected that by fall 2010, the program would have allotted some to 21,000 families.
With an elevation of , the highest peak of Bangladesh is <a href="Keokradong">Keokradong</a>, near the border with <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>.

Bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions, each named after their respective divisional headquarters: <a href="Barisal%20Division">Barisal</a>, Chittagong, <a href="Dhaka%20Division">Dhaka</a>, <a href="Khulna%20Division">Khulna</a>, <a href="Mymensingh%20Division">Mymensingh</a>, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.

Divisions are subdivided into districts ("zila"). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into "upazila" (subdistricts) or "thana". The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several "<a href="Union%20Councils%20of%20Bangladesh">unions</a>", with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into "mahallas".

There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.
Straddling the <a href="Tropic%20of%20Cancer">Tropic of Cancer</a>, Bangladesh's climate is tropical with a mild winter from October to March, and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below , with a record low of in the north west city of <a href="Dinajpur">Dinajpur</a> on 3 February 1905. A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall.

Natural calamities, such as <a href="Floods%20in%20Bangladesh">floods</a>, <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>s, <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es, and <a href="tidal%20bore">tidal bore</a>s occur almost every year, combined with the effects of <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, <a href="Soils%20retrogression%20and%20degradation">soil degradation</a> and <a href="erosion">erosion</a>. The <a href="List%20of%20Bangladesh%20tropical%20cyclones">cyclones</a> of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, the <a href="1991%20Bangladesh%20cyclone">latter</a> killing some 140,000 people.

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw <a href="1998%20Bangladesh%20floods">the most severe flooding</a> in modern world history. As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and <a href="Meghna">Meghna</a> spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, of road and of embankment, 1,000 people were killed and 30 million more made homeless, 135,000 cattle killed, of land destroyed and of roads damaged or destroyed. Effectively, two-thirds of the country was underwater.
The severity of the flooding was attributed to unusually high <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> rains, the shedding off of equally unusually large amounts of melt water from the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, and the widespread cutting down of trees (that would have intercepted rain water) for firewood or animal husbandry.

Bangladesh is now widely recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to <a href="Climate%20change%20in%20Bangladesh">climate change</a>. Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health and shelter. It is believed that in the coming decades the rising sea level alone will create more than 20 million <a href="climate%20refugee">climate refugee</a>s.

Bangladesh is prone to <a href="flood">flood</a>s, tornadoes and <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>s. Also, there is evidence that earthquakes pose a threat to the country, and that tectonics have caused rivers to shift course suddenly and dramatically. It has also been shown that rainy-season flooding in Bangladesh, on the world's largest river delta, can push the underlying crust down by as much as 6 centimetres, and possibly perturb faults.

Bangladeshi water is frequently contaminated with <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> because of the high arsenic content of the soil—up to 77 million people are <a href="arsenic%20contamination%20of%20groundwater">exposed to toxic arsenic</a> from drinking water.

Bangladesh ratified the Rio <a href="Convention%20on%20Biological%20Diversity">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> on 3 May 1994. , the country was set to revise its <a href="Biodiversity%20action%20plan">National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan</a>.

Bangladesh is located in the <a href="Indomalaya%20ecozone">Indomalaya ecozone</a>. Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerous <a href="List%20of%20rivers%20in%20Bangladesh">rivers and tributaries</a>, lakes, <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moist <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous forest</a>s, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile <a href="alluvial">alluvial</a> soil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of <a href="mango">mango</a>, <a href="jackfruit">jackfruit</a>, <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a>, <a href="betel%20nut">betel nut</a>, <a href="coconut">coconut</a> and <a href="date%20palm">date palm</a>. The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants. Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. <a href="Nymphaeaceae">Water lilies</a> and <a href="Nelumbo%20nucifera">lotuses</a> grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has <a href="List%20of%20protected%20areas%20of%20Bangladesh">50 wildlife sanctuaries</a>.

Bangladesh is home to much of the <a href="Sundarbans">Sundarbans</a>, the world's largest <a href="mangrove%20forest">mangrove forest</a>, covering an area of 6,000 km in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries–the <a href="Sundarbans%20South%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">South</a>, <a href="Sundarbans%20East%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">East</a> and <a href="Sundarbans%20West%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">West</a> zones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, which is a unique ecosystem. It also includes <a href="tropical%20and%20subtropical%20coniferous%20forests">tropical and subtropical coniferous forests</a>, a <a href="freshwater%20swamp%20forest">freshwater swamp forest</a> and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern <a href="Chittagong%20Division">Chittagong region</a> covers evergreen and semi evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along the districts of Gazipur, <a href="Tangail">Tangail</a> and <a href="Mymensingh">Mymensingh</a>. <a href="St.%20Martin%27s%20Island">St. Martin's Island</a> is the only <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a> in the country.

Bangladesh has an abundance of <a href="Wildlife%20in%20Bangladesh">wildlife</a> in its forests, marshes, woodlands and hills. The vast majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 km. The <a href="Bengal%20tiger">Bengal tiger</a>, <a href="clouded%20leopard">clouded leopard</a>, <a href="saltwater%20crocodile">saltwater crocodile</a>, <a href="black%20panther">black panther</a> and <a href="fishing%20cat">fishing cat</a> are among the chief predators in the Sundarbans. Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to the <a href="Asian%20elephant">Asian elephant</a>, <a href="hoolock%20gibbon">hoolock gibbon</a>, <a href="Asian%20black%20bear">Asian black bear</a> and <a href="oriental%20pied%20hornbill">oriental pied hornbill</a>.

The <a href="Chital">Chital</a> deer are widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include the <a href="black%20giant%20squirrel">black giant squirrel</a>, <a href="capped%20langur">capped langur</a>, <a href="Bengal%20fox">Bengal fox</a>, <a href="sambar%20deer">sambar deer</a>, <a href="jungle%20cat">jungle cat</a>, <a href="king%20cobra">king cobra</a>, <a href="wild%20boar">wild boar</a>, <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>s, <a href="pangolin">pangolin</a>s, <a href="Python%20%28genus%29">pythons</a> and <a href="Asian%20water%20monitor">water monitors</a>. Bangladesh has one of the largest population of <a href="Irrawaddy%20dolphins">Irrawaddy dolphins</a> and <a href="South%20Asian%20river%20dolphin">Ganges dolphins</a>. A 2009 census found 6,000 Irrawaddy dolphins inhabiting the littoral rivers of Bangladesh. The country has numerous species of <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s (53), reptiles (139), <a href="marine%20reptile">marine reptile</a>s (19) and <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s (5). It also has <a href="List%20of%20birds%20of%20Bangladesh">628 species of birds</a>.

Several animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one horned and two horned <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a> and common <a href="peafowl">peafowl</a>. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, hence limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. Though many areas are protected under law, a large portion of Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. The <a href="Bangladesh%20Environment%20Conservation%20Act">Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act</a> was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as <a href="Ecologically%20Critical%20Area">Ecologically Critical Area</a>s, including wetlands, forests and rivers. The <a href="Sundarbans%20tiger%20project">Sundarbans Tiger Project</a> and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bangladesh">Constitution of Bangladesh</a> established a <a href="unitary%20state">unitary</a>, <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>-style <a href="parliamentary%20republic">parliamentary republic</a> with <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>. A <a href="member%20of%20parliament">member of parliament</a> supported by a parliamentary majority (usually the chair of the largest party) is the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Bangladesh">Prime Minister</a>, the <a href="Government%20of%20Bangladesh">head of government</a> and of the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Bangladesh">cabinet</a>. Bangladesh is governed by a 350-member parliament, known as the <a href="Jatiyo%20Sangshad">Jatiyo Sangshad</a>. Three hundred of its members are elected on a <a href="first%20past%20the%20post">first past the post</a> basis, and 50 seats are reserved for female nominees by political parties. Although parliamentary <a href="Elections%20in%20Bangladesh">elections</a> are scheduled every five years, they have often been delayed by political crises, emergency rule or <a href="Military%20coups%20in%20Bangladesh">martial law</a>. The <a href="President%20of%20Bangladesh">President of Bangladesh</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>. From 1975 to 1990 the presidency had executive powers, but it has been reduced to a largely-ceremonial role by the <a href="Amendments%20to%20the%20Constitution%20of%20Bangladesh">Twelfth Amendment</a> to the constitution.

In 2011, the <a href="Amendments%20to%20the%20Constitution%20of%20Bangladesh">Fifteenth Amendment</a> mandated the "highest punishment" for <a href="usurper">usurper</a>s. The amendment was controversial for abolishing the <a href="caretaker%20government%20of%20Bangladesh">caretaker-government system</a>, which had been a neutral administration during election periods since the 1990s. The <a href="Bangladesh%20general%20election%2C%202014">2014 national election</a> was boycotted by the largest opposition party, which argued that a free election could not be held without a neutral interim government. The Jatiyo Sangshad is restrained from holding <a href="no-confidence">no-confidence</a> motions, <a href="crossing%20the%20floor">floor crossing</a> and <a href="free%20vote">free vote</a>s by <a href="Article%2070%20of%20the%20Constitution%20of%20Bangladesh">Article 70 of the constitution</a>. <a href="Human%20rights%20in%20Bangladesh">Human-rights</a> violations have increased due to the growing power of security forces—particularly the <a href="Rapid%20Action%20Battalion">Rapid Action Battalion</a>, which is accused of arbitrary arrests, summary executions and <a href="Forced%20disappearance%20in%20Bangladesh">forced disappearances</a>.

Bangladesh's legal system is based on <a href="common%20law">common law</a>, and its principal source of laws are <a href="acts%20of%20Parliament">acts of Parliament</a>. The <a href="Bangladesh%20Code">Bangladesh Code</a> includes a list of all laws in force in the country. The code begins in 1836, and most of its listed laws were crafted under the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> by the <a href="Bengal%20Legislative%20Council">Bengal Legislative Council</a>, the <a href="Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly">Bengal Legislative Assembly</a>, the <a href="Eastern%20Bengal%20and%20Assam%20Legislative%20Council">Eastern Bengal and Assam Legislative Council</a>, the <a href="Imperial%20Legislative%20Council">Imperial Legislative Council</a> and the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a>; one example is the <a href="The%20Penal%20Code%2C%201860%20%28Bangladesh%29">1860 Penal Code</a>. From 1947 to 1971, laws were enacted by Pakistan's <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Pakistan">national assembly</a> and the <a href="East%20Pakistan%20Provincial%20Assembly">East Pakistani legislature</a>. The <a href="Constituent%20Assembly%20of%20Bangladesh">Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh</a> was the country's provisional parliament until 1973, when the first elected Jatiyo Sangshad was sworn in. Although most of Bangladesh's laws were compiled in <a href="English%20language">English</a>, after a 1987 government directive laws are now primarily written in <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali</a>. Marriage, divorce and inheritance are governed by <a href="Islamic%20law">Islamic</a>, <a href="Hindu%20law">Hindu</a> and Christian <a href="family%20law">family law</a>. The judiciary is often influenced by legal developments in the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, such as the <a href="Legitimate%20expectation">doctrine of legitimate expectation</a>.

The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Bangladesh">Supreme Court of Bangladesh</a>, including its <a href="High%20Court%20Division">High Court</a> and Appellate Divisions, is the high court of the land. The head of the judiciary is the <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Bangladesh">Chief Justice of Bangladesh</a>, who sits on the Supreme Court. The courts have wide latitude in <a href="judicial%20review%20in%20Bangladesh">judicial review</a>, and judicial <a href="precedent">precedent</a> is supported by the Article 111 of the constitution. The <a href="Judiciary%20of%20Bangladesh">judiciary</a> includes district and metropolitan courts, which are divided into civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog. The <a href="Bangladesh%20Judicial%20Service%20Commission">Bangladesh Judicial Service Commission</a> is an independent body responsible for judicial appointments, salaries and discipline.

The Bangladesh Armed Forces have inherited the institutional framework of the <a href="British%20military">British military</a> and the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">British Indian Army</a>. It was formed in 1971 from the military regiments of East Pakistan. In 2012 the <a href="Bangladesh%20Army">army</a> strength was around 300,000, including reservists, the Air Force (22,000) and the Navy (24,000). In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been the world's largest contributor to <a href="United%20Nations%20peacekeeping">UN peacekeeping force</a>s. In February 2015, the country made major deployments to <a href="Cote%20d%27Ivoire">Côte d'Ivoire</a>, <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="Darfur">Darfur</a>, the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, the <a href="Golan%20Heights">Golan Heights</a>, <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>, <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a> and <a href="South%20Sudan">South Sudan</a>.

The <a href="Bangladesh%20Navy">Bangladesh Navy</a> has the third-largest fleet (after India and Thailand) of <a href="countries%20dependent%20on%20the%20Bay%20of%20Bengal">countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal</a>, including <a href="guided-missile%20frigate">guided-missile frigate</a>s, <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s, <a href="Cutter%20%28boat%29">cutter</a>s and aircraft. The <a href="Bangladesh%20Air%20Force">Bangladesh Air Force</a> is equipped with several Russian multi-role fighter jets. Bangladesh cooperates defensively with the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States Armed Forces</a>, participating in the <a href="Cooperation%20Afloat%20Readiness%20and%20Training">Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training</a> (CARAT) exercises. Ties between the Bangladeshi and the <a href="Indian%20military">Indian military</a> have increased, with high-level visits by the military chiefs of both countries. Eighty percent of Bangladesh's military equipment comes from <a href="China">China</a>.

The first major intergovernmental organization joined by Bangladesh was the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> in 1972. The country joined the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> in 1974, and has been elected twice to the <a href="UN%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a>. Ambassador <a href="Humayun%20Rashid%20Choudhury">Humayun Rashid Choudhury</a> was elected president of the <a href="UN%20General%20Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> in 1986. Bangladesh relies on <a href="multilateralism">multilateral</a> diplomacy in the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a>. It is a major contributor to <a href="UN%20peacekeeping">UN peacekeeping</a>, providing 113,000 personnel to 54 UN missions in the Middle East, the Balkans, Africa and the Caribbean in 2014.

In addition to membership in the Commonwealth and the United Nations, Bangladesh pioneered regional cooperation in <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>. Bangladesh is a founding member of the <a href="South%20Asian%20Association%20for%20Regional%20Cooperation">South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation</a> (SAARC), an organization designed to strengthen relations and promote economic and cultural growth among its members. It has hosted several summits, and two Bangladeshi diplomats were the organization's secretary-general.

Bangladesh joined the <a href="Organization%20of%20Islamic%20Cooperation">Organization of Islamic Cooperation</a> (OIC) in 1973. It has hosted the summit of OIC foreign ministers, which addresses issues, conflicts and disputes affecting <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim-majority countries</a>. Bangladesh is a founding member of the <a href="Developing%208%20Countries">Developing 8 Countries</a>, a bloc of eight Muslim-majority republics.

<a href="Japan">Japan</a> is Bangladesh's largest economic-aid provider, and the countries have common political goals. The <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> has longstanding <a href="Bangladesh-United%20Kingdom%20relations">economic, cultural and military links</a> with Bangladesh. The <a href="United%20States">United States</a> is a major <a href="Bangladesh-United%20States%20relations">economic and security partner</a>, including its largest export market and foreign investor. Seventy-six percent of <a href="Bangladeshis">Bangladeshis</a> viewed the United States favorably in 2014, one of the highest ratings among <a href="Asia">Asia</a>n countries. The <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> is Bangladesh's largest regional market, conducting <a href="public%20diplomacy">public diplomacy</a> and providing development assistance.

Relations with other countries are generally positive. Shared democratic values ease relations with Western countries, and similar economic concerns forge ties to other <a href="developing%20countries">developing countries</a>. Despite poor working conditions and war affecting overseas <a href="Bangladeshis%20in%20the%20Middle%20East">Bangladeshi workers</a>, relations with <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>ern countries are friendly and bounded by religion and culture; more than a million Bangladeshis are employed in the region. In 2016, the <a href="king%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia">king of Saudi Arabia</a> called Bangladesh "one of the most important Muslim countries".

Bangladesh's most politically-important bilateral relationship is with neighboring <a href="India">India</a>. In 2015, major Indian newspapers called Bangladesh a "trusted friend". Bangladesh and India are South Asia's largest trading partners. The countries are forging regional economic and infrastructure projects, such as a regional motor-vehicle agreement in <a href="eastern%20South%20Asia">eastern South Asia</a> and a coastal shipping agreement in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>. <a href="Bangladesh-India%20relations">Indo-Bangladesh relations</a> have a shared cultural heritage and democratic values and a history of support for <a href="Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War">Bangladeshi independence</a>. Despite political goodwill, <a href="Deaths%20along%20the%20Bangladesh%E2%80%93India%20border">border killings of Bangladeshi civilians</a> and the lack of a comprehensive water-sharing agreement for 54 trans-boundary rivers are major issues. In 2017, India joined Russia and China in refusing to condemn Myanmar's atrocities against the <a href="Rohingya">Rohingya</a>, which contradicted with Bangladesh's demand for recognizing Rohingya human rights. However, the Indian air force delivered aid shipments for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. The rise of <a href="Hindu%20extremism">Hindu extremism</a> and <a href="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> in India has also affected Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi <a href="beef">beef</a> and <a href="leather">leather</a> industries have seen increased prices due to the Indian <a href="Bharatiya%20Janata%20Party">BJP</a> government's Hindu nationalist campaign against the export of beef and cattle skin.

<a href="Bangladesh-China%20relations">Sino-Bangladesh relations</a> date to the 1950s and are relatively warm, despite the Chinese leadership siding with Pakistan during Bangladesh's war of independence. China and Bangladesh established bilateral relations in 1976 which have significantly strengthened, and the country is considered a cost-effective source of arms for the Bangladeshi military. Since the 1980s 80 percent of Bangladesh's military equipment has been supplied by China (often with generous credit terms), and China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner. Both countries are part of the <a href="BCIM%20Forum">BCIM Forum</a>.
The neighbouring country of <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> was one of first countries to recognize Bangladesh. Despite common regional interests, Bangladesh-Myanmar relations have been strained by the <a href="Rohingya">Rohingya</a> refugee issue and the isolationist policies of the Myanmar military. In 2012, the countries came to terms at the <a href="International%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20Law%20of%20the%20Sea">International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea</a> over maritime disputes in the Bay of Bengal. In 2016 and 2017, relations with Myanmar again strained as over 400,000 <a href="Rohingya%20refugees%20in%20Bangladesh">Rohingya refugees</a> entered Bangladesh after atrocities. The parliament, government and civil society of Bangladesh have been at the forefront of <a href="International%20reaction%20to%20the%202016-17%20Rohingya%20exodus">international criticism</a> against Myanmar for military operations against the Rohingya, which the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> has described as <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>.

Pakistan and Bangladesh have a US$550 million trade relationship, particularly in Pakistani <a href="cotton">cotton</a> imports for the Bangladeshi textile industry. Although Bangladeshi and Pakistani businesses have invested in each other, diplomatic relations are strained because of Pakistani denial of the <a href="1971%20Bangladesh%20genocide">1971 Bangladesh genocide</a>.

Bangladeshi aid agencies work in many developing countries. An example is <a href="BRAC%20%28NGO%29">BRAC</a> in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, which benefits 12 million people in that country. Bangladesh has a record of <a href="nuclear%20nonproliferation">nuclear nonproliferation</a> as a party to the <a href="Nuclear%20Nonproliferation%20Treaty">Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty</a> (NPT) and the <a href="Comprehensive%20Test%20Ban%20Treaty">Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</a> (CTBT). It is a state party to the <a href="Rome%20Statute%20of%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court">Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court</a>.

Bangladeshi foreign policy is influenced by the principle of "friendship to all and malice to none", first articulated by Bengali statesman <a href="H.%20S.%20Suhrawardy">H. S. Suhrawardy</a> in 1957. Suhrawardy led East and West Pakistan to join the <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a>, <a href="CENTO">CENTO</a> and the <a href="Regional%20Cooperation%20for%20Development">Regional Cooperation for Development</a>.

<a href="Laws%20in%20Bangladesh">Rights in Bangladesh</a> are enshrined in the country's constitution. However, government and security forces have flouted constitutional principles and have been accused of <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> abuses. Bangladesh is ranked "partly free" in <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a>'s "<a href="Freedom%20in%20the%20World">Freedom in the World</a>" report, but its press is ranked "not free". According to the British <a href="Economist%20Intelligence%20Unit">Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, the country has a <a href="hybrid%20regime">hybrid regime</a>: the third of four rankings in its <a href="Democracy%20Index">Democracy Index</a>. Bangladesh was the third-most-peaceful South Asian country in the 2015 <a href="Global%20Peace%20Index">Global Peace Index</a>. <a href="Civil%20society">Civil society</a> and <a href="media%20in%20Bangladesh">media in Bangladesh</a> have been attacked by the ruling <a href="Bangladesh%20Awami%20League">Awami League</a> government and <a href="Islamic%20extremist">Islamic extremist</a>s.
According to National Human Rights Commission chairman Mizanur Rahman, 70% of alleged human-rights violations are committed by law-enforcement agencies. Targets have included <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> winner <a href="Muhammad%20Yunus">Muhammad Yunus</a> and the <a href="Grameen%20Bank">Grameen Bank</a>, <a href="Attacks%20on%20secularists%20in%20Bangladesh">secularist bloggers</a> and independent and pro-opposition newspapers and television networks. The United Nations is concerned about government "measures that restrict freedom of expression and democratic space".

Bangladeshi security forces, particularly the <a href="Rapid%20Action%20Battalion">Rapid Action Battalion</a> (RAB), have received international condemnation for human-rights abuses (including <a href="enforced%20disappearances">enforced disappearances</a>, <a href="torture">torture</a> and <a href="extrajudicial%20killing">extrajudicial killing</a>s). Over 1,000 people have been said to have been victims of extrajudicial killings by RAB since its inception under the last <a href="Bangladesh%20Nationalist%20Party">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> government. The RAB has been called a "death squad" by <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>, which have called for the force to be disbanded. The British and American governments have been criticized for funding and engaging the force in counter-terrorism operations.

The Bangladeshi government has not fully implemented the <a href="Chittagong%20Hill%20Tracts%20Peace%20Accord">Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord</a>. The Hill Tracts region remains heavily <a href="militarized">militarized</a>, despite a peace treaty with <a href="indigenous%20people">indigenous people</a> forged by the <a href="Parbatya%20Chattagram%20Jana%20Samhati%20Samiti">United People's Party of the Chittagong Hill Tracts</a>.

<a href="Secularism">Secularism</a> is protected by the <a href="constitution%20of%20Bangladesh">constitution of Bangladesh</a>, and religious parties are barred from contesting elections; however, the government is accused of courting religious extremist groups. Islam's ambiguous position as the "de facto" <a href="state%20religion">state religion</a> has been criticized by the United Nations. Despite relative harmony, religious minorities have faced occasional persecution. The Hindu and <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> communities have experienced <a href="religious%20violence">religious violence</a> from Islamic groups, notably the <a href="Bangladesh%20Jamaat-e-Islami">Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami</a> and its student wing (<a href="Bangladesh%20Islami%20Chhatra%20Shibir">Shibir</a>). Islamic far-right candidates peaked at 12 percent of the vote in 2001, falling to four percent in 2008. <a href="Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a> is outlawed by section 377 of the criminal code, and is punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment.

Bangladesh was 14th on <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a>'s 2014 <a href="Corruption%20Perceptions%20Index">Corruption Perceptions Index</a>. In 2015, bribes made up 3.7 percent of the national budget. The country's <a href="Anti-Corruption%20Commission%20%28Bangladesh%29">Anti-Corruption Commission</a> was active during the <a href="2006%E2%80%9308%20Bangladeshi%20political%20crisis">2006–08 Bangladeshi political crisis</a>, indicting many leading politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen for <a href="Graft%20%28politics%29">graft</a>. After it assumed power in 2009, the Awami League government reduced the commission's independent power to investigate and prosecute. Land administration was the sector with the most bribery in 2015, followed by education, police
and water supply.

Bangladesh, a <a href="developing%20country">developing country</a> with a market-based <a href="mixed%20economy">mixed economy</a>, is one of the <a href="Next%20Eleven">Next Eleven</a> <a href="emerging%20markets">emerging markets</a>. Its per-capita income was in 2014, with a <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> of $209 billion. Bangladesh has the third-largest South Asian economy (after India and Pakistan) and the second-highest <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20foreign%20exchange%20reserves">foreign-exchange reserves</a> (after India). The <a href="Bangladeshi%20diaspora">Bangladeshi diaspora</a> contributed $15.31 billion in <a href="Remittance%20to%20Bangladesh">remittances</a> in 2015.

During its first five years of independence Bangladesh adopted socialist policies, an Awami League blunder. The subsequent military regime and BNP and Jatiya Party governments restored free markets and promoted the country's private sector. In 1991, finance minister <a href="Saifur%20Rahman">Saifur Rahman</a> introduced a programme of <a href="economic%20liberalization">economic liberalization</a>. The Bangladeshi private sector has rapidly expanded, with a number of <a href="List%20of%20conglomerates%20in%20Bangladesh">conglomerates</a> driving the economy. Major industries include textiles, <a href="pharmaceuticals">pharmaceuticals</a>, shipbuilding, steel, electronics, energy, construction materials, chemicals, ceramics, food processing and leather goods. <a href="Export-oriented%20industrialization">Export-oriented industrialization</a> has increased, with <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> 2014–15 exports of $30 billion. Most export earnings are from the <a href="Bangladesh%20textile%20industry">garment-manufacturing industry</a>. Bangladesh also has <a href="social%20enterprise">social enterprise</a>s, including the Nobel Peace Prize-winning <a href="Grameen%20Bank">Grameen Bank</a> and <a href="BRAC%20%28NGO%29">BRAC</a> (the world's largest <a href="non-governmental%20organisation">non-governmental organisation</a>).

However, an insufficient power supply is a significant obstacle to Bangladesh's economic development. According to the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>, poor governance, corruption and weak public institutions are also major challenges. In April 2010, <a href="Standard%20%26amp%3B%20Poor%27s">Standard & Poor's</a> gave Bangladesh a BB- long-term <a href="credit%20rating">credit rating</a>, below India's but above those of Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

The country is notable for its <a href="soil%20fertility">soil fertility</a> land, including the <a href="Ganges%20Delta">Ganges Delta</a>, <a href="Sylhet%20Division">Sylhet Division</a> and the <a href="Chittagong%20Hill%20Tracts">Chittagong Hill Tracts</a>. Agriculture is the largest sector of the economy, making up 18.6 percent of Bangladesh's GDP in November 2010 and employing about 45 percent of the workforce. The agricultural sector impacts employment generation, poverty alleviation, <a href="human%20resources">human resources</a> development and <a href="food%20security">food security</a>. More Bangladeshis earn their living from agriculture than from any other sector. The country is among the top producers of <a href="rice">rice</a> (fourth), <a href="potatoes">potatoes</a> (seventh), <a href="tropical%20fruits">tropical fruits</a> (sixth), jute (second), and farmed fish (fifth).

Bangladesh has planned to import hydropower from <a href="Energy%20in%20Bhutan">Bhutan</a> and <a href="Energy%20in%20Nepal">Nepal</a>. Nuclear energy is being developed with Russian support in the <a href="Ruppur%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant">Ruppur Nuclear Power Plant</a> project. The country ranks fifth worldwide in the number of <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a> <a href="green%20job">green job</a>s, and solar panels are increasingly used to power urban and off-grid rural areas.

An estimated 98 percent of the country's population had access to <a href="improved%20water%20source">improved water source</a>s in 2004 (a high percentage for a low-income country), achieved largely through the construction of <a href="hand%20pump">hand pump</a>s with support from external donors. However, in 1993 it was discovered that much of Bangladesh's groundwater (the source of drinking water for 97 percent of the rural population and a significant share of the urban population) is naturally contaminated with arsenic.

Another challenge is low cost recovery due to low tariffs and poor <a href="economic%20efficiency">economic efficiency</a>, especially in urban areas (where water revenue does not cover operating costs). An estimated 56 percent of the population had access to adequate sanitation facilities in 2010. <a href="Community-led%20total%20sanitation">Community-led total sanitation</a>, addressing the problem of <a href="open%20defecation">open defecation</a> in rural areas, is credited with improving public health since its introduction in 2000.

Bangladesh is the world's <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20population">eighth-most-populous</a> nation. In 1951, its population was 44 million. Bangladesh is the most densely-populated large country in the world, ranking 11th in population density when small countries and city-states are included.

The country's population-growth rate was among the highest in the world in the 1960s and 1970s, when its population grew from 65 to 110 million. With the promotion of <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a> in the 1980s, Bangladesh's growth rate began to slow.

Bangladesh's 2015 literacy rate rose to 71 percent due to education modernization and improved funding, with 16,087 schools and 2,363 colleges receiving Monthly Pay Order (MPO) facilities. According to education minister <a href="Nurul%20Islam%20Nahid">Nurul Islam Nahid</a>, 27,558 madrasas and technical and vocational institutions were enlisted for the facility. 6,036 educational institutions were outside MPO coverage, and the government enlisted 1,624 private schools for MPO in 2010.

Health and education levels remain relatively low, although they have improved as poverty levels have decreased. In rural areas, village doctors with little or no formal training constitute 62 percent of healthcare providers practising "modern medicine"; formally-trained providers make up four percent of the total health workforce. A Future Health Systems survey indicated significant deficiencies in the treatment practices of village doctors, with widespread harmful and inappropriate drug prescribing. Receiving health care from informal providers is encouraged.

A 2007 study of 1,000 households in rural Bangladesh found that direct payments to formal and informal healthcare providers and indirect costs (loss of earnings because of illness) associated with illness were deterrents to accessing healthcare from qualified providers. A community survey of 6,183 individuals in rural Bangladesh found a gender difference in treatment-seeking behaviour, with women less likely to seek treatment than to men. The use of skilled birth attendant (SBA) services, however, rose from 2005 to 2007 among women from all socioeconomic <a href="Quantile">quintiles</a> except the highest. A health watch, a pilot community-empowerment tool, was successfully developed and implemented in south-eastern Bangladesh to improve the uptake and monitoring of public-health services.

Bangladesh's poor health conditions are attributed to the lack of healthcare provision by the government. According to a 2010 World Bank report, 2009 healthcare spending was 3.35 percent of the country's GDP. The number of hospital beds is 3 per 10,000 population. Government spending on healthcare that year was 7.9 percent of the total budget; out-of-pocket expenditures totaled 96.5 percent.

<a href="Malnutrition">Malnutrition</a> has been a persistent problem in Bangladesh, with the World Bank ranking the country first in the number of malnourished children worldwide. Twenty-six percent of the population (two-thirds of children under the age of five) are undernourished, and 46 percent of children are moderately or severely underweight. Forty-three to 60 percent of children under five are smaller than normal; one in five preschool children are vitamin-A deficient, and one in two are anemic. More than 45 percent of rural families and 76 percent of urban families were below the acceptable caloric-intake level.

The Bangladeshi press is diverse, outspoken and privately owned. Over 200 newspapers are published in the country. <a href="Bangladesh%20Betar">Bangladesh Betar</a> is the state-run radio service. The <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> operates the popular <a href="BBC%20Bangla">BBC Bangla</a> news and current affairs service. Bengali broadcasts from <a href="Voice%20of%20America">Voice of America</a> are also very popular. <a href="Bangladesh%20Television">Bangladesh Television</a> (BTV) is the state-owned television network. There more than 20 privately owned television networks, including several <a href="news%20channel">news channel</a>s. <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20media">Freedom of the media</a> remains a major concern, due to government attempts at censorship and the harassment of journalists.

The <a href="cinema%20of%20Bangladesh">cinema of Bangladesh</a> dates back to 1898, when films began screening at the Crown Theatre in Dhaka. The first bioscope on the subcontinent was established in Dhaka that year. The <a href="Dhaka%20Nawab%20Family">Dhaka Nawab Family</a> patronized the production of several <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>s in the 1920s and 30s.

The first feature film in East Pakistan, "<a href="Mukh%20O%20Mukhosh">Mukh O Mukhosh</a>", was released in 1956. During the 1960s, 25–30 films were produced annually in Dhaka. By the 2000s, Bangladesh produced 80–100 films a year. While the Bangladeshi film industry has achieved limited commercial success, the country has produced notable independent filmmakers. <a href="Zahir%20Raihan">Zahir Raihan</a> was a prominent documentary-maker who was assassinated in 1971. The late <a href="Tareque%20Masud">Tareque Masud</a> is regarded as one of Bangladesh's outstanding directors due to his numerous productions on historical and social issues. Masud was honored by <a href="FIPRESCI">FIPRESCI</a> at the 2002 <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> for his film "<a href="Matir%20Moina">The Clay Bird</a>". <a href="Tanvir%20Mokammel">Tanvir Mokammel</a>, <a href="Mostofa%20Sarwar%20Farooki">Mostofa Sarwar Farooki</a>, Humayun Ahmed, <a href="Alamgir%20Kabir%20%28film%20maker%29">Alamgir Kabir</a>, and <a href="Chashi%20Nazrul%20Islam">Chashi Nazrul Islam</a> are some of the prominent directors of Bangladeshi cinema.

<a href="Cycle%20rickshaw">Cycle rickshaw</a>s are the most popular form of public transport in Bangladesh. Dhaka, the nation's biggest city, is nicknamed the "Rickshaw Capital of the World". Rickshaws also ply the streets of other major cities, as well as the countryside.
Bangladeshi rickshaws are decorated with colorful posters and boards, often depicting movie stars, national monuments or religious icons. <a href="Rickshaw%20art">Rickshaw art</a> is considered a form of <a href="neo-romanticism">neo-romanticism</a>. This unique trend started in Rajshahi and Dhaka in the 1950s. Each region of Bangladesh has a distinct style of rickshaw art. For example, rickshaw art in Chittagong and Comilla are dominated by floral scenery and Arabic texts.
Auto-rickshaws are widely seen in urban centers. Cycle-driven carts are found in many parts of the country. Bangladeshi rickshaw art has received international fame, and has been called "people's art".

Rickshaw driving provides employment for many poor Bangladeshis coming from rural areas.

The <a href="Varendra%20Research%20Museum">Varendra Research Museum</a> is the oldest museum in Bangladesh. It houses important collections from both the pre-Islamic and Islamic periods, including the sculptures of the Pala-Sena School of Art and the Indus Valley Civilization; as well as Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian manuscripts and inscriptions.

In ancient times, manuscripts were written on palm leaves, tree barks, parchment vellum and terracotta plates and preserved at monasteries known as "<a href="vihara">vihara</a>s". The Hussain Shahi dynasty established royal libraries during the Bengal Sultanate. Libraries were established in each district of Bengal by the zamindar gentry during the Bengal Renaissance in the 19th-century. The trend of establishing libraries continued until the beginning of World War II. In 1854, four major public libraries were opened, including the Bogra Woodburn Library, the Rangpur Public Library, the Jessore Institute Public Library and the Barisal Public Library.

The <a href="Northbrook%20Hall">Northbrook Hall Public Library</a> was established in Dhaka in 1882 in honour of <a href="Lord%20Northbrook">Lord Northbrook</a>, the Governor-General.

Barbados

Barbados ( or ) is an <a href="island%20country">island country</a> in the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>, in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> region of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. It is in length and up to in width, covering an area of . It is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic and east of the <a href="Windward%20Islands">Windward Islands</a> and the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>; therein, it is about east of the islands of <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a> and north-east of <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>. Barbados is outside of the principal Atlantic <a href="hurricane%20belt">hurricane belt</a>. Its capital and largest city is <a href="Bridgetown%2C%20Barbados">Bridgetown</a>.

Inhabited by <a href="Island%20Caribs">Kalinago</a> people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other <a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a>s, Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Spain">Spanish Crown</a>. It first appeared in a Spanish map in 1511. The Portuguese visited the island in 1536, but they left it unclaimed, with their only remnants being an introduction of wild hogs for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited. An English ship, the "Olive Blossom", arrived in Barbados in 1625; its men took possession of it in the name of <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">King James I</a>. In 1627, the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and it became an <a href="English%20overseas%20possessions">English</a> and later <a href="British%20colonisation%20of%20the%20Americas%23British%20Caribbean%20colonies">British colony</a>. As a wealthy sugar colony, it became an English centre of the <a href="African%20slave%20trade">African slave trade</a> until that trade was outlawed in <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">1807</a>, with final emancipation of slaves in Barbados occurring over a period of years from <a href="Slavery%20Abolition%20Act%201833">1833</a>.

In 1966, Barbados became an independent state and <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a> with the British Monarch (presently Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>) as hereditary <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>. It has a population of people, predominantly of African descent. Despite being classified as an Atlantic island, Barbados is considered to be a part of the Caribbean, where it is ranked as a leading tourist destination. Forty percent of the tourists come from the UK, with the US and Canada making up the next large groups of visitors to the island. In 2016, <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a>'s <a href="Corruption%20Perceptions%20Index">Corruption Perceptions Index</a> ranked Barbados sixth in <a href="the%20Americas">the Americas</a> after <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>.

The name Barbados is either the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> word "Os" "Barbados" or the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> equivalent "Los" "Barbados", both meaning "the bearded ones". It is unclear whether "bearded" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded <a href="fig-tree">fig-tree</a> ("<a href="Ficus%20citrifolia">Ficus citrifolia</a>"), indigenous to the island, or to the allegedly bearded <a href="Island%20Caribs">Caribs</a> once inhabiting the island, or, more fancifully, to a visual impression of a beard formed by the sea foam that sprays over the outlying reefs. In 1519, a map produced by the <a href="Genoa">Genoese</a> mapmaker <a href="Visconte%20Maggiolo">Visconte Maggiolo</a> showed and named Barbados in its correct position. Furthermore, the island of <a href="Barbuda">Barbuda</a> in the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leewards</a> is very similar in name and was once named "Las Barbudas" by the Spanish.

It is uncertain which European nation arrived first in Barbados. One lesser known source points to earlier-revealed works predating contemporary sources indicating it could have been the Spanish. Others believe the <a href="History%20of%20Portugal%20%281415-1542%29">Portuguese</a>, en route to <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, were the first Europeans to come upon the island.

The original name for Barbados in the Pre-Columbian era was "Ichirouganaim" according to accounts by descendants of the indigenous <a href="Arawakan%20languages">Arawakan</a>-speaking tribes in other regional areas, with possible translations including "Red land with white teeth", "Redstone island with teeth outside (reefs)", or simply "Teeth".

Colloquially Barbadians refer to their home island as "Bim" or other nicknames associated with Barbados includes "Bimshire". The origin is uncertain but several theories exist. The <a href="National%20Cultural%20Foundation">National Cultural Foundation</a> of Barbados says that "Bim" was a word commonly used by <a href="slave">slave</a>s and that it derives from the <a href="Igbo%20language">Igbo</a> term "bém" from "bé mụ́" meaning 'my home, kindred, kind', the Igbo phoneme /e/ in the Igbo orthography is very close to [ ɪ ]. The name could have arisen due to the relatively large percentage of enslaved <a href="Igbo%20people">Igbo people</a> from modern-day southeastern <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> arriving in Barbados in the 18th century.

The words 'Bim' and 'Bimshire' are recorded in the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" and "<a href="Chambers%20Dictionary">Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionaries</a>". Another possible source for 'Bim' is reported to be in the "Agricultural Reporter" of 25 April 1868, where the Rev. N. Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, <a href="Abel%20Hendy%20Jones%20Greenidge">Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge</a>) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were "Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Bimshire". Lastly, in the "Daily Argosy" (of Demerara, i.e. Guyana) of 1652 there is a reference to Bim as a possible corruption of 'Byam', the name of a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as 'Bims' and that this became a word for all Barbadians.

<a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a> settlement of Barbados dates to about the 4th to 7th centuries AD, by a group known as the <a href="Saladoid">Saladoid</a>-Barrancoid. The <a href="Arawaks">Arawaks</a> from South America became dominant around 800 AD, and maintained that status until around 1200. In the 13th century, the <a href="Kalinago">Kalinago</a> (<a href="Island%20Caribs">Island Caribs</a>) arrived from South America.

The <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a> briefly claimed Barbados from the late 16th to the 17th centuries. The Arawaks are believed to have fled to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Spanish and Portuguese made little impact and left the island uninhabited. Some Arawaks migrated from <a href="British%20Guiana">British Guiana</a> (modern-day Guyana) in the 19th century and continue to live in Barbados.

In the very early years (1620–1640s) the majority of the labour was provided by European indentured servants, mainly <a href="English%20people">English</a>, <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> and <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a>, with <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">African slaves</a> and Amerindian slaves providing little of the workforce. During the <a href="Interregnum%20%28England%29">Cromwellian era</a> (1650s) this included a large number of prisoners-of-war, vagrants and people who were illicitly kidnapped, who were forcibly transported to the island and sold as servants. These last two groups were predominately Irish, as several thousand were infamously rounded up by English merchants and sold into servitude in Barbados and other Caribbean islands during this period. Cultivation of tobacco, cotton, <a href="ginger">ginger</a> and <a href="indigo">indigo</a> was thus handled primarily by European indentured labour until the start of the <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a> industry in the 1640s and the growing reliance and importation of enslaved Africans. Persecuted persons of <a href="Spanish%20and%20Portuguese%20Jews">Jewish faith</a> during the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">inquisition</a> also settled to Barbados. From its English settlement and as Barbados' economy grew, Barbados maintained a relatively large measure of local autonomy first as a <a href="proprietary%20colony">proprietary colony</a> and later a <a href="crown%20colony">crown colony</a>. The <a href="Barbados%20House%20of%20Assembly">House of Assembly</a> began meeting in 1639. Among the island's earliest leading figures was the Anglo-Dutch <a href="William%20Courten">Sir William Courten</a>.

The <a href="Great%20Hurricane%20of%201780">1780 hurricane</a> killed over 4,000 people on Barbados. In 1854, a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemic killed over 20,000 inhabitants. At emancipation in 1833, the size of the slave population was approximately 83,000. Between 1946 and 1980, Barbados' rate of population growth was diminished by one-third because of emigration to Britain.
The settlement was established as a <a href="proprietary%20colony">proprietary colony</a> and funded by Sir <a href="William%20Courten">William Courten</a>, a <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> merchant who acquired the title to Barbados and several other islands. So the first colonists were actually tenants and much of the profits of their labour returned to Courten and his company.

The first English ship, which had arrived on 14 May 1625, was captained by John Powell. The first settlement began on 17 February 1627, near what is now <a href="Holetown">Holetown</a> (formerly Jamestown), by a group led by John Powell's younger brother, Henry, consisting of 80 settlers and 10 English labourers. The latter were young <a href="indentured%20labour">indentured labour</a>ers who according to some sources had been abducted, effectively making them slaves.

Courten's title was transferred to <a href="James%20Hay%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Carlisle">James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle</a>, in what was called the "Great Barbados Robbery." Carlisle then chose as governor <a href="Henry%20Hawley%20%28governor%29">Henry Hawley</a>, who established the <a href="Barbados%20House%20of%20Assembly">House of Assembly</a> in 1639, in an effort to appease the planters, who might otherwise have opposed his controversial appointment.

In the period 1640–60, the West Indies attracted over two-thirds of the total number of English emigrants to the Americas. By 1650 there were 44,000 settlers in the West Indies, as compared to 12,000 on the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake</a> and 23,000 in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. Most English arrivals were indentured. After five years of labour, they were given "freedom dues" of about ₤10, usually in goods. (Before the mid-1630s, they also received 5 to 10 acres of land, but after that time the island filled and there was no more free land.) Around the time of Cromwell a number of rebels and criminals were also transported there. Timothy Meads of Warwickshire was one of the rebels sent to Barbados at that time, before he received compensation for servitude of 1000 acres of land in North Carolina in 1666. Parish registers from the 1650s show, for the white population, four times as many deaths as marriages. The death rate was very high.

Before this, the mainstay of the infant colony's economy was the growth export of tobacco, but tobacco prices eventually fell in the 1630s, as Chesapeake production expanded.

Around the same time, fighting during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms">War of the Three Kingdoms</a> and the <a href="Interregnum%20%28England%29">Interregnum</a> spilled over into Barbados and Barbadian territorial waters. The island was not <a href="English%20Revolution%20in%20the%20Colonies">involved in the war</a> until after the execution of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, when the island's government fell under the control of Royalists (ironically the Governor, Philip Bell, remaining loyal to <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> while the Barbadian <a href="House%20of%20Assembly">House of Assembly</a>, under the influence of Humphrey Walrond, supported <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>). To try to bring the recalcitrant colony to heel, the <a href="Rump%20Parliament%23Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth Parliament</a> passed an act on 3 October 1650 prohibiting trade between England and Barbados, and because the island also traded with the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, further <a href="navigation%20acts">navigation acts</a> were passed prohibiting any but English vessels trading with <a href="Dutch%20colonies%23Atlantic">Dutch colonies</a>. These acts were a precursor to the <a href="First%20Anglo-Dutch%20War">First Anglo-Dutch War</a>. The <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth of England</a> sent an invasion force under the command of <a href="George%20Ayscue">Sir George Ayscue</a>, which arrived in October 1651. After some skirmishing, the Royalists in the House of Assembly led by <a href="Francis%20Willoughby%2C%205th%20Baron%20Willoughby%20of%20Parham">Lord Willoughby</a> surrendered. The conditions of the surrender were incorporated into the <a href="Charter%20of%20Barbados">Charter of Barbados</a> (Treaty of Oistins), which was signed at the Mermaid's Inn, <a href="Oistins">Oistins</a>, on 17 January 1652.

The introduction of <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a> from <a href="Dutch%20Brazil">Dutch Brazil</a> in 1640 completely transformed society and the economy. Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries. One group instrumental in ensuring the early success of the industry were the <a href="Sephardi%20Jews">Sephardic Jews</a>, who had originally been expelled from the <a href="Iberian%20peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a>, to end up in <a href="Dutch%20Brazil">Dutch Brazil</a>. As the effects of the new crop increased, so did the shift in the ethnic composition of Barbados and surrounding islands. The workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a great deal of heavy labour. At first, Dutch traders supplied the equipment, financing, and African slaves, in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe. In 1644 the population of Barbados was estimated at 30,000, of which about 800 were of African descent, with the remainder mainly of English descent. These English smallholders were eventually bought out and the island filled up with large African slave-worked sugar plantations. By 1660 there was near parity with 27,000 blacks and 26,000 whites. By 1666 at least 12,000 white smallholders had been bought out, died, or left the island. Many of the remaining whites were increasingly poor. By 1680 there were 17 slaves for every indentured servant. By 1700, there were 15,000 free whites and 50,000 enslaved blacks.

Due to the increased implementation of <a href="Barbados%20Slave%20Code">slave codes</a>, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and ruling planter class, the island became increasingly unattractive to <a href="redlegs">poor whites</a>. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. One early advocate of slave rights in Barbados was the visiting Quaker preacher <a href="Alice%20Curwen">Alice Curwen</a> in 1677: "For I am perswaded, that if they whom thou call'st thy Slaves, be Upright-hearted to God, the Lord God Almighty will set them Free in a way that thou knowest not; for there is none set free but in Christ Jesus, for all other Freedom will prove but a Bondage."

Barbados is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the other <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> Islands. Barbados is the easternmost island in the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. It is flat in comparison to its island neighbours to the west, the <a href="Windward%20Islands">Windward Islands</a>. The island rises gently to the central highland region, with the high point of the nation being <a href="Mount%20Hillaby">Mount Hillaby</a> in the geological Scotland District above sea level.

In the parish of <a href="Saint%20Michael%2C%20Barbados">Saint Michael</a> lies Barbados' capital and main city, <a href="Bridgetown">Bridgetown</a>. Other major towns scattered across the island include <a href="Holetown">Holetown</a>, in the parish of <a href="Saint%20James%2C%20Barbados">Saint James</a>; <a href="Oistins">Oistins</a>, in the parish of <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Barbados">Christ Church</a>; and <a href="Speightstown">Speightstown</a>, in the parish of <a href="Saint%20Peter%2C%20Barbados">Saint Peter</a>.

Barbados lies on the boundary of the <a href="South%20American%20plate">South American</a> and the <a href="Caribbean%20Plate">Caribbean Plate</a>s. The <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the South American plate beneath the Caribbean plate scrapes sediment from the South American plate and deposits it above the subduction zone forming an <a href="Accretionary%20wedge">accretionary prism</a>. The rate of this depositing of material allows Barbados to rise at a rate of about per 1,000 years. This subduction means <a href="Geology">geologically</a> the island is composed of <a href="coral">coral</a> roughly thick, where reefs formed above the sediment. The land slopes in a series of "terraces" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. A large proportion of the island is circled by <a href="coral%20reefs">coral reefs</a>.

The erosion of limestone in the northeast of the island, in the Scotland District, has resulted in the formation of various caves and <a href="Gully">gullies</a>, some of which have become popular tourist attractions such as <a href="Harrison%27s%20Cave">Harrison's Cave</a> and Welchman Hall Gully. On the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> east coast of the island <a href="coastal%20landforms">coastal landforms</a>, including stacks, have been created due to the limestone composition of the area. Also notable in the island is the rocky cape known as <a href="Pico%20Teneriffe%20%28Barbados%29">Pico Teneriffe</a> or Pico de Tenerife, which is named after the fact that the island of <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> in <a href="Spain">Spain</a> is the first land east of Barbados according to the belief of the locals.

The country generally experiences two seasons, one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall. Known as the "<a href="wet%20season">wet season</a>", this period runs from June to November. By contrast, the "<a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>" runs from December to May. Annual precipitation ranges between .
From December to May the average temperatures range from , while between June and November, they range from .

On the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> scale, much of Barbados is regarded as a <a href="tropical%20monsoon%20climate">tropical monsoon climate</a> (Am). However, gentle breezes of abound throughout the year and give Barbados a <a href="climate">climate</a> which is moderately tropical.

Infrequent natural hazards include earthquakes, <a href="landslip">landslip</a>s and <a href="hurricanes">hurricanes</a>. Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a>s and <a href="hurricanes">hurricanes</a> during the rainy season. Its location in the south-east of the Caribbean region puts the country just outside the principal <a href="hurricane%20strike%20zone">hurricane strike zone</a>. On average, a major hurricane strikes about once every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was <a href="Hurricane%20Janet">Hurricane Janet</a> in 1955; in 2010 the island was struck by <a href="Hurricane%20Tomas">Hurricane Tomas</a>, but this caused only minor damage across the country.

Barbados is susceptible to environmental pressures. As one of the world's most <a href="List%20of%20island%20countries%20by%20population%20density">densely populated isles</a>, the government worked during the 1990s to aggressively integrate the growing south coast of the island into the Bridgetown Sewage Treatment Plant to reduce contamination of offshore coral reefs. As of the first decade of the 21st century, a second treatment plant has been proposed along the island's west coast. Being so densely populated, Barbados has made great efforts to protect its underground <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>s.

As a coral-limestone island, Barbados is highly permeable to seepage of surface water into the earth. The government has placed great emphasis on protecting the catchment areas that lead directly into the huge network of underground aquifers and streams. On occasion illegal squatters have breached these areas, and the government has removed squatters to preserve the cleanliness of the underground springs which provide the island's drinking water.

The government has placed a huge emphasis on keeping Barbados clean with the aim of protecting the environment and preserving offshore coral reefs which surround the island. Many initiatives to mitigate human pressures on the coastal regions of Barbados and seas come from the Coastal Zone Management Unit (CZMU). Barbados has nearly of coral reefs just offshore and two protected marine parks have been established off the west coast. Overfishing is another threat which faces Barbados.

Barbados is host to four species of nesting turtles (<a href="green%20turtles">green turtles</a>, <a href="Loggerhead%20sea%20turtle">loggerheads</a>, <a href="hawksbill%20turtle">hawksbill turtle</a>s, and <a href="leatherbacks">leatherbacks</a>) and has the second-largest hawksbill turtle breeding population in the Caribbean. The driving of vehicles on beaches can crush nests buried in the sand and such activity should be avoided in nesting areas.

Though on the opposite side of the Atlantic, and some west of Africa, Barbados is one of many places in the American continent that experience heightened levels of <a href="mineral%20dust">mineral dust</a> from the <a href="Sahara%20Desert">Sahara Desert</a>. Some particularly intense dust episodes have been blamed partly for the impacts on the health of coral reefs surrounding Barbados or <a href="asthmatic">asthmatic</a> episodes, but evidence has not wholly supported the former such claim.

Barbados is also the host to the <a href="green%20monkey">green monkey</a>. The green monkey is found in West Africa from Senegal to the Volta River. It has been introduced to the Cape Verde islands off north-western Africa, and the West Indian islands of Saint Kitts, Nevis, Saint Martin, and Barbados. It was introduced to the West Indies in the late 17th century when slave trade ships travelled to the Caribbean from West Africa.

Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> and <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">parliamentary democracy</a> modelled on the British <a href="Westminster%20system">Westminster system</a>.

During the 1990s at the suggestion of <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>'s <a href="Patrick%20Manning">Patrick Manning</a>, Barbados attempted a <a href="political%20union">political union</a> with Trinidad and Tobago and <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>. The project stalled after the then prime minister of Barbados, <a href="Lloyd%20Erskine%20Sandiford">Lloyd Erskine Sandiford</a>, became ill and his <a href="Democratic%20Labour%20Party%20%28Barbados%29">Democratic Labour Party</a> lost the next general election. Barbados continues to share close ties with Trinidad and Tobago and with Guyana, claiming the highest number of Guyanese immigrants after the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Barbados functions as a <a href="two-party%20system">two-party system</a>. The dominant political parties are the <a href="Democratic%20Labour%20Party%20%28Barbados%29">Democratic Labour Party</a> and the opposition <a href="Barbados%20Labour%20Party">Barbados Labour Party</a>. Since Independence the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) has governed from 1976 to 1986 and from September 1994 to 2008. The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) held office 1966 to 1976, from 1986 to 1994, and has formed the government from January 2008 to present.

Barbados is an original member (1995) of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organisation">World Trade Organisation</a> (WTO) and participates actively in its work. It grants at least MFN treatment to all its trading partners. As of December 2007, Barbados is linked by an <a href="Economic%20Partnership%20Agreement">Economic Partnership Agreement</a> with the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a>. The pact involves the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) subgroup of the <a href="African%2C%20Caribbean%20and%20Pacific%20Group%20of%20States">African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States</a> (ACP). CARIFORUM is the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>.

Trade policy has also sought to protect a small number of domestic activities, mostly food production, from foreign competition, while recognising that most domestic needs are best met by imports.

On 6 July 1994, at the Sherbourne Conference Centre, St. Michael, Barbados, representatives of eight (8) countries signed the Double Taxation Relief (CARICOM) Treaties 1994. The countries which were represented were: Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.

On 19 August 1994 a representative of the Government of Guyana signed a similar treaty.

In 2013, CARICOM called for European nations to pay <a href="reparations%20for%20slavery">reparations for slavery</a> and established an official reparations commission.

The <a href="Barbados%20Defence%20Force">Barbados Defence Force</a> has roughly 600 members. Within it, 12- to 18-year-olds make up the Barbados Cadet Corps. The defence preparations of the island nation are closely tied to defence treaties with the United Kingdom, the United States, and the People's Republic of China.

The <a href="Royal%20Barbados%20Police%20Force">Royal Barbados Police Force</a> is the sole law enforcement agency on the island of Barbados.

Barbados is <a href="Administrative%20division">divided</a> into 11 parishes:
St. George and St. Thomas are in the middle of the country and are the only parishes without coastlines.

<a href="LGBT%20rights%20by%20country%20or%20territory">Homosexual acts</a> are illegal in Barbados and the colonial era law bears a maximum sentence of life in prison; however the law is rarely enforced.

Barbados is the 53rd <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28nominal%29%20per%20capita">richest country in the world</a> in terms of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, has a well-developed <a href="mixed%20economy">mixed economy</a>, and a moderately high <a href="standard%20of%20living">standard of living</a>.

Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a> cultivation and related activities, but since the late 1970s and early 1980s it has diversified into the manufacturing and tourism sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. Since the 1990s the Barbados Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. The island saw a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes. This slowed during the 2008 economic crisis.

Recent government administrations have continued efforts to reduce unemployment, encourage <a href="foreign%20direct%20investment">foreign direct investment</a>, and privatise remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment was reduced to 10.7% in 2003. However, it has since increased to 11.9% in second quarter, 2015.

The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean Community</a> (especially <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>), the United Kingdom and the United States.

Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada <a href="Canadian%20dollar">CA$</a> 25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian foreign direct investment (FDI). Businessman <a href="Eugene%20Melnyk">Eugene Melnyk</a> of Toronto, Canada, is said to be one of Barbados' richest permanent residents.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as "Bajan") are of <a href="Afro-Caribbean">Afro-Caribbean</a> descent ("<a href="Afro-Barbadian">Afro-Bajans</a>") and mixed-descent. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans ("Anglo-Bajans" / "Euro-Bajans") mainly from the United Kingdom and Ireland, along with Asians, predominantly Chinese and Indians (both Hindu and Muslim).
Other groups in Barbados include people from the United Kingdom, United States and Canada.

Children in school uniform ride for free on the government buses and for $1.50 on the ZRs. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown.

Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally owned and operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national companies.

The island's lone airport is the <a href="Grantley%20Adams%20International%20Airport">Grantley Adams International Airport</a>. It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the eastern Caribbean. In the first decade of the 21st century it underwent a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.

There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and maritime traffic is regulated by the <a href="Barbados%20Port%20Authority">Barbados Port Authority</a>.

Bassas da India

Bassas da India is an uninhabited, roughly circular French <a href="atoll">atoll</a> that is part of the <a href="French%20Southern%20and%20Antarctic%20Lands">French Southern and Antarctic Lands</a>. Located in the southern <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a>, about halfway between <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> and <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> (about further east) and around northwest of <a href="Europa%20Island">Europa Island</a>, the rim of the atoll averages around 100 m in width and encloses a shallow lagoon of depth no greater than 15 m. Overall, the atoll is about in diameter, rising steeply from the <a href="seabed">seabed</a> 3000 m below to encircle an area (including lagoon) of . Its <a href="exclusive%20economic%20zone">exclusive economic zone</a> (EEZ), in size, is <a href="Contiguity">contiguous</a> with that of Europa Island.

The atoll consists of ten barren rocky islets, with no vegetation, totalling 0.2 km² (.077 sq mi) in area. Those on the north and east sides are 2.1 to 3 m high, while those on the west and south sides are 1.2 m high. The reef, whose coastline measures , is completely covered by the sea from three hours before <a href="Tide">high tide</a> to three hours afterward. The region is also subject to <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>s, making the atoll a long-time maritime hazard and the site of numerous shipwrecks.

<a href="Jaguar%20Seamount">Jaguar Seamount</a> and <a href="Hall%20Tablemount">Hall Tablemount</a> lie, respectively, about 40 and 70 km further southwest.

The Bassas da India was first recorded by <a href="Portuguese%20explorers">Portuguese explorers</a> in the early sixteenth century as the ""Baixo da" Judia" (""Jewess" Shoals"). The "Judia" (""Jewess"", for the ancestry of its owner <a href="Fern%C3%A3o%20de%20Loronha">Fernão de Loronha</a>) was the Portuguese ship that discovered the feature by running aground on it in 1506. The name became "Bassas da India" due to transcription errors by cartographers. The "Santiago" broke up on the shoal in 1585.

It was rediscovered by the "Europa" in 1774, whence the name "Europa Rocks". The "Malay" was lost 27 July 1842 on the Europa Rocks.

In 1897, the shoal became a <a href="Third%20French%20Republic">French</a> possession, later being placed under the administration of a commissioner residing in <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> in 1968. <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> became independent in 1960 and claims sovereignty over the shoal since 1972.

<a href="Mooring%20%28watercraft%29">Mooring</a> at Bassas da India requires a permit from the French Government. Fishing without such a permit may result in the boat being expelled or even confiscated.
Several illegal tourism charters departing from Mozambique or South Africa have been seized since 2013 by the <a href="French%20navy">French navy</a>.

Belarus

Belarus (; , "Bielaruś" or "Biełaruś", ; ), officially the Republic of Belarus (; ), formerly known by its <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> name Byelorussia or Belorussia (), is a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a> in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> bordered by <a href="Russia">Russia</a> to the northeast, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> to the south, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> to the west, and <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> to the northwest. Its capital and most populous city is <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>. Over 40% of its is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the <a href="Principality%20of%20Polotsk">Principality of Polotsk</a> (11th to 14th centuries), the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>.

In the aftermath of the 1917 <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, Belarus declared independence as the <a href="Belarusian%20People%27s%20Republic">Belarusian People's Republic</a>, which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The <a href="Socialist%20Soviet%20Republic%20of%20Byelorussia">Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia</a> became a founding <a href="Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">constituent republic of the Soviet Union</a> in 1922 and was renamed as the <a href="Byelorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> (Byelorussian SSR). Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a> of 1919–1921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Second Polish Republic</a> were reintegrated into it after the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Poland">Soviet invasion of Poland</a>, and were finalized after World War II. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a third of its population and more than half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, along with the Soviet Union and the <a href="Ukrainian%20SSR">Ukrainian SSR</a>.

The parliament of the republic declared the <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> of Belarus on 1990, and during the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a>, Belarus declared independence on 1991. <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> has served as the country's president since 1994. Belarus has been labeled "Europe's last dictatorship" by some Western journalists, on account of Lukashenko's self-described <a href="authoritarian">authoritarian</a> style of government. Lukashenko continued a number of Soviet-era policies, such as <a href="state%20ownership">state ownership</a> of large sections of the economy. Elections under Lukashenko's rule have been widely criticized as unfair by the west; and according to many countries and organizations, political opposition has been violently suppressed. Belarus's <a href="Democracy%20Index">Democracy Index</a> rating was the lowest in Europe until 2014 (when it was passed by Russia), the country is labelled as "not free" by <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a>, as "repressed" in the <a href="Index%20of%20Economic%20Freedom">Index of Economic Freedom</a>, and is rated as by far the worst country for <a href="press%20freedom">press freedom</a> in Europe in the <a href="Press%20Freedom%20Index">2013–14 Press Freedom Index</a> published by <a href="Reporters%20Without%20Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>, which ranks Belarus 157th out of 180 nations.

In 2000 Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, with some hints of forming a <a href="Union%20State">Union State</a>. Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49 million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic <a href="Belarusians">Belarusian</a>, with sizable minorities of <a href="Russians">Russians</a>, <a href="Poles">Poles</a> and <a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a>. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian</a> and <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">Constitution of Belarus</a> does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is <a href="Belarusian%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Christianity</a>. The second-most widespread religion, <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Belarus">Roman Catholicism</a>, has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20Belarus">national holidays</a>. Belarus is the only European country to retain <a href="capital%20punishment%20by%20country">capital punishment</a> in both <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20Belarus">law</a> and <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20Europe">practice</a>. Belarus is a member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> since its founding, the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>, <a href="Collective%20Security%20Treaty%20Organization">CSTO</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20Economic%20Union">EEU</a>, and the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>. Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> but nevertheless maintains a <a href="Belarus%E2%80%93European%20Union%20relations">bilateral relationship with the organisation</a>, and likewise participates in two EU projects: the <a href="Central%20European%20Initiative">Central European Initiative</a> and the <a href="Baku%20Initiative">Baku Initiative</a>.

The name "Belarus" is closely related with the term "Belaya Rus' ", i.e., "<a href="White%20Rus%27">White Rus'</a>". There are several claims to the origin of the name "White Rus'." An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old <a href="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a>n lands within the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> that had been populated mostly by early Christianized <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a>, as opposed to <a href="Black%20Ruthenia">Black Ruthenia</a>, which was predominantly inhabited by pagan <a href="Balts">Balts</a>.

An alternate explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local Slavic population. A third theory suggests that the old Rus' lands that were not conquered by the <a href="Tatars">Tatars</a> (i.e., Polatsk, Vitsiebsk and Mahilyow) had been referred to as "white". Other sources claim that, before 1267, the land not conquered by the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a> was considered "White Rus'".

The name <a href="Rus%27%20%28region%29">Rus'</a> is often conflated with its Latin forms <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a>, thus Belarus is often referred to as "White Russia" or "White Ruthenia". The name first appeared in <a href="Medieval%20German%20literature">German</a> and <a href="Medieval%20Latin%20literature">Latin</a> <a href="medieval%20literature">medieval literature</a>; the chronicles of <a href="Jan%20of%20Czarnk%C3%B3w">Jan of Czarnków</a> mention the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke <a href="Jogaila">Jogaila</a> and his mother at "" in 1381. In some languages, including German and <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>, the country is generally called "White Russia" to this day (' and ' respectively).

The Latin term "Alba Russia" was used again by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VI">Pope Pius VI</a> in 1783 to recognize the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> there, exclaiming "." The first known use of "White Russia" to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir <a href="Jerome%20Horsey">Jerome Horsey</a>, who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court. During the 17th century, the Russian <a href="tsar">tsar</a>s used "White Rus" to describe the lands added from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
The term "Belorussia" (, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, "Russia") first rose in the days of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled "the Tsar of All the Russias", as "Russia" or the "Russian Empire" was formed by three parts of Russia—the <a href="Great%20Russia">Great</a>, <a href="Little%20Russia">Little</a>, and <a href="White%20Russia">White</a>. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.

After the <a href="Bolshevik%20Revolution">Bolshevik Revolution</a> in 1917, the term "White Russia" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term "Byelorussia" was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, "Byelorussia" became commonly used in the regions of <a href="Bia%C5%82ystok">Białystok</a> and <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a> during the interwar period.

The term "Byelorussia" (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20Belarus">Supreme Soviet</a> of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called "Republic of Belarus" ( spelled in Russian), as well its abridged form should be "Belarus". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian language</a> forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991–93. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">Constitution of Belarus</a>.

Accordingly, the name "Byelorussia" was replaced by "Belarus" in English. Likewise, the adjective "Belorussian" or "Byelorussian" was replaced by "Belarusian" in English. "Belarusian" is closer to the original Russian term of '. Belarusian intelligentsia in the <a href="Stalin%20era">Stalin era</a> attempted to change the name from "Byelorussia" to a form of "Krivia" because of the supposed connection with Russia. Some nationalists object to the name for the same reason. Several local newspapers kept the old name of the country in Russian in their names, for example ', which is the localized publication of a popular Russian newspaper. Also, those who wish for Belarus to be reunited with Russia continue to use "Belorussia". Officially, the full name of the country is "Republic of Belarus" (, , ).

From 5000 to 2000 BC, <a href="Bandkeramik">Bandkeramik</a> cultures predominated. In addition, remains from the <a href="Dnieper-Donets%20culture">Dnieper-Donets culture</a> were found in Belarus and parts of <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a> and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BC, and by 500 AD, Slavs had taken up residence, which was circumscribed by the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> who roamed its outskirts. Invaders from Asia, among whom were the <a href="Huns">Huns</a> and <a href="Avars%20%28Carpathians%29">Avars</a>, swept through c. 400–600 AD, but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence.

The region that is now Belarus was first settled by <a href="Baltic%20peoples">Baltic</a> tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by Slavic tribes. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts but the gradual assimilation of the Balts into Slavic culture was peaceful in nature.

In the 9th century some principalities arose on the territory of modern Belarus. Among them was the Principality of Polatsk that for most of the time was effectively an independent State (apart from about 20 years when it was a Vassal of Kievan Rus'). The Principality of Polatsk was the first nation state to be established on the land of Belarus.

Many early Russian principalities were virtually razed or severely affected by a major <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Rus%27">Mongol invasion</a> in the 13th century, but the lands of Belarus avoided the brunt of the invasion and were eventually absorbed by the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>.

The Grand Duchy of Lithuania developed from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Lithuania">Lithuanian Kingdom</a> (<a href="Mindaugas">King Mindaugas</a>, 1253) which territory started its existence between Nemunas and Neris rivers and existed in the center of Europe in the 13th–18th centuries and comprised entire territories of contemporary Belarus, Ukraine, partially Poland, Lithuania and Latvia and stretched from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.

Incorporation into The Grand Duchy of Lithuania resulted in an economic, political and ethno-cultural unification of Belarusian lands. Of the principalities held by the Duchy, nine of them were settled by a population that would eventually become Belarusian people. During this time, the Duchy was involved in several military campaigns, including fighting on the side of Poland against the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Grunwald">Battle of Grunwald</a> in 1410; the joint victory allowed the Duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of Eastern Europe.

On 2 February 1386, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281025%E2%80%931385%29">Kingdom of Poland</a> were joined in a <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a> through a <a href="Union%20of%20Krewo">marriage of their rulers</a>. This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, <a href="Union%20of%20Lublin">created in 1569</a>. In 1696, <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a> replaced Belarusian as the official language and Belarusian was outlawed.

The <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow">Muscovites</a>, led by <a href="Ivan%20III%20of%20Russia">Ivan III of Moscow</a>, began military campaigns in 1486 in an attempt to incorporate the lands of Kievan Rus', specifically the territories of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.

The union between Poland and Lithuania ended in 1795 with the <a href="partitions%20of%20Poland">partitioning of Poland</a> by Imperial Russia, <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, and <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. The Belarusian territories acquired by the Russian Empire under the reign of <a href="Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia">Catherine II</a> were included into the <a href="Belarusian%20Governorate">Belarusian Governorate</a> () in 1796 and held until their occupation by the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Although under <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I</a> and <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III</a> the national cultures were repressed due to the policies of de-<a href="Polonization">Polonization</a> and <a href="Russification">Russification</a>, which included the return to <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Christianity</a> of Belorusian <a href="Union%20of%20Brest">Uniates</a>.

In a <a href="Russification">Russification</a> drive in the 1840s, <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I</a> prohibited use of the Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded in a <a href="January%20Uprising">revolt</a>, led by Kalinowski. After the failed revolt, the Russian government reintroduced the use of <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic</a> to Belarusian in 1864 and no documents in Belarusian were permitted by the Russian government until 1905.

During the negotiations of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a>, Belarus first declared independence under German occupation on 1918, forming the <a href="Belarusian%20People%27s%20Republic">Belarusian People's Republic</a>. Immediately afterwards, the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a> ignited, and the territory of Belarus was divided between Poland and Soviet Russia.

A part of Belarus under Russian rule emerged as the <a href="Byelorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> (Byelorussian SSR) in 1919. Soon thereafter it merged to form the <a href="Lithuanian%E2%80%93Belorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR</a>. The contested lands were divided between Poland and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> after the war ended in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet agricultural and economic policies, including <a href="collectivization">collectivization</a> and <a href="Five-Year%20Plans%20for%20the%20National%20Economy%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">five-year plans for the national economy</a>, led to famine and political repression.

In 1939, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland, marking the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Soviets invaded and annexed much of eastern Poland, which had been part of the country since the <a href="Peace%20of%20Riga">Peace of Riga</a> two decades earlier. Much of the northern section of this area was added to the Byelorussian SSR, and now constitutes <a href="West%20Belarus">West Belarus</a>. The Soviet-controlled Byelorussian People's Council officially took control of the territories, whose populations consisted of a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews, on 28 October 1939 in <a href="Bia%C5%82ystok">Białystok</a>. Nazi Germany <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">invaded the Soviet Union</a> in 1941. The <a href="Brest%20Fortress">Brest Fortress</a>, which had been annexed in 1939, at this time was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts that happened during the war. Statistically, the Byelorussian SSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II; it <a href="Occupation%20of%20Belarus%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">remained in Nazi hands</a> until 1944. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. The Nazi "<a href="Generalplan%20Ost">Generalplan Ost</a>" called for the extermination, expulsion or enslavement of most or all Belarusians for the purpose of providing more <a href="Lebensraum">living space</a> in the <a href="Drang%20nach%20Osten">East</a> for Germans.

<a href="World%20War%20II%20casualties%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Casualties</a> were estimated to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Belarus">Jewish population of Belarus</a> was devastated during <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> and never recovered. The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971. It was also after this conflict that the final borders of Belarus were set by Stalin when parts of Belarusian territory were given to the recently annexed Lithuania.

After the war, Belarus was among the 51 founding countries of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">United Nations Charter</a> and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the UN, on top of the Soviet Union's vote. Vigorous postwar reconstruction promptly followed the end of the war and the Byelorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in western USSR, creating jobs and attracting ethnic Russians. The borders of the Byelorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn and became known as the <a href="Curzon%20Line">Curzon Line</a>.

<a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> implemented a policy of <a href="Sovietization">Sovietization</a> to isolate the Byelorussian SSR from <a href="Western%20world">Western influences</a>. This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Byelorussian SSR government. The official use of the <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian language</a> and other cultural aspects were limited by <a href="Politics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Moscow</a>. After Stalin's death in 1953, <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> continued his predecessor's <a href="cultural%20hegemony">cultural hegemony</a> program, stating, "The sooner we all start speaking Russian, the faster we shall build communism."

In 1986, the Byelorussian SSR was exposed to significant <a href="nuclear%20fallout">nuclear fallout</a> from the explosion at the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl</a> power plant in the neighboring <a href="Ukrainian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Ukrainian SSR</a>.

In June 1988, the archaeologist and leader of the <a href="Conservative%20Christian%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20BPF">Christian Conservative Party of the BPF</a> <a href="Zyanon%20Paznyak">Zyanon Paznyak</a> discovered <a href="mass%20grave">mass grave</a>s of victims executed in 1937–41 at <a href="Kurapaty">Kurapaty</a>, near Minsk. Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people, causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence.
In March 1990, elections for seats in the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet">Supreme Soviet</a> of the Byelorussian SSR took place. Though the pro-independence <a href="Belarusian%20Popular%20Front">Belarusian Popular Front</a> took only 10% of the seats, the populace was content with the selection of the delegates. Belarus declared itself sovereign on 1990 by issuing the <a href="Declaration%20of%20State%20Sovereignty%20of%20the%20Belarusian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic</a>.

With the support of the Communist Party, the country's name was changed to the Republic of Belarus on 1991. <a href="Stanislau%20Shushkevich">Stanislav Shushkevich</a>, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, met with <a href="Boris%20Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> of Russia and <a href="Leonid%20Kravchuk">Leonid Kravchuk</a> of Ukraine on 1991 in <a href="Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa%20Forest">Belavezhskaya Pushcha</a> to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>.

A <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">national constitution</a> was adopted in March 1994 in which the functions of prime minister were given to the <a href="President%20of%20Belarus">President of Belarus</a>.

Two-round elections for the presidency on ( 1994 and 1994) catapulted the formerly unknown <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> into national prominence. He garnered 45% of the vote in the first round and 80% in the second, defeating <a href="Vyachaslau%20Kebich">Vyacheslav Kebich</a> who received 14% of the vote. Lukashenko was re-elected <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202001">in 2001</a>, <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">in 2006</a>, <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202010">in 2010</a> and again <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202015">in 2015</a>. Western governments, <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>, and <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> have criticized Lukashenko's <a href="authoritarian">authoritarian</a> style of government.

Since 2014, following years of embrace of Russian influence in the country, Lukashenko has pressed a revival of Belarusian identity, following the Russian <a href="Annexation%20of%20Crimea%20by%20the%20Russian%20Federation">annexation of Crimea</a> and <a href="Russian%20military%20intervention%20in%20Ukraine%20%282014%E2%80%93present%29">military intervention in Eastern Ukraine</a>. For the first time, he delivered a speech in <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian</a> (rather than Russian, which most people use), in which he said, "We are not Russian—we are Belarusians", and later encouraged the use of Belarusian. Trade disputes, a border dispute, and a much relaxed official attitude to dissident voices are all part of a weakening of the longtime warm relationship with Russia.

Belarus lies between latitudes <a href="51st%20parallel%20north">51°</a> and <a href="57th%20parallel%20north">57° N</a>, and longitudes <a href="23rd%20meridian%20east">23°</a> and <a href="33rd%20meridian%20east">33° E</a>. Its extension from north to south is , from west to east is . It is <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked</a>, relatively flat, and contains large tracts of <a href="marsh">marsh</a>y land. About 40% of Belarus is covered by forests.

Many streams and 11,000 lakes are found in Belarus. Three major rivers run through the country: the <a href="Neman%20River">Neman</a>, the <a href="Pripyat%20River">Pripyat</a>, and the <a href="Dnieper%20River">Dnieper</a>. The Neman flows westward towards the Baltic sea and the Pripyat flows eastward to the Dnieper; the Dnieper flows southward towards the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>.

The highest point is <a href="Dzyarzhynskaya%20Hara">Dzyarzhynskaya Hara</a> (Dzyarzhynsk Hill) at , and the lowest point is on the Neman River at . The average elevation of Belarus is <a href="above%20mean%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>. The climate features mild to cold winters, with average January minimum temperatures ranging from in southwest (<a href="Brest%2C%20Belarus">Brest</a>) to in northeast (<a href="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a>), and cool and moist summers with an average temperature of . Belarus has an average annual rainfall of . The country is in the transitional zone between <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a>s and <a href="Oceanic%20climate">maritime climates</a>.

Natural resources include <a href="peat">peat</a> deposits, small quantities of oil and natural gas, <a href="granite">granite</a>, dolomite (<a href="limestone">limestone</a>), <a href="marl">marl</a>, chalk, sand, gravel, and clay. About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl nuclear disaster</a> entered Belarusian territory, and about a fifth of Belarusian land (principally farmland and forests in the southeastern regions) was affected by radiation fallout. The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas, especially through the use of <a href="caesium">caesium</a> binders and <a href="rapeseed">rapeseed</a> cultivation, which are meant to decrease soil levels of <a href="caesium-137">caesium-137</a>.

Belarus borders five countries: <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> to the north, <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> to the northwest, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> to the west, <a href="Russia">Russia</a> to the north and the east, and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> to the south. Treaties in 1995 and 1996 demarcated Belarus's borders with Latvia and Lithuania, and Belarus ratified a 1997 treaty establishing the Belarus-Ukraine border in 2009. Belarus and Lithuania ratified final border demarcation documents in February 2007.

Belarus is a <a href="presidential%20system">presidential</a> republic, governed by a <a href="President%20of%20Belarus">president</a> and the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Belarus">National Assembly</a>. The <a href="term%20of%20office">term</a> for each presidency is five years. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could serve for only two terms as president, but a <a href="Belarusian%20referendum%2C%202004">change in the constitution in 2004</a> eliminated term limits. <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> has been the president of Belarus since 1994. In 1996, Lukashenko called for a controversial vote to extend the presidential term from five to seven years, and as a result <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202001">the election</a> that was supposed to occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. The <a href="Belarusian%20referendum%2C%201996">referendum on the extension</a> was denounced as a "fantastic" fake by the chief electoral officer, <a href="Viktar%20Hanchar">Viktar Hanchar</a>, who was removed from the office for official matters only during the campaign. The National Assembly is a <a href="bicameralism">bicameral parliament</a> comprising the 110-member <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Belarus">House of Representatives</a> (the lower house) and the 64-member <a href="Council%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">Council of the Republic</a> (the upper house).

The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the <a href="List%20of%20Belarusian%20Prime%20Ministers">prime minister</a>, make constitutional amendments, call for a <a href="Motion%20of%20Confidence">vote of confidence</a> on the prime minister, and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy. The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the constitution.

The government includes a Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister and five deputy prime ministers. The members of this council need not be members of the legislature and are appointed by the president. The judiciary comprises the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Belarus">Supreme Court</a> and specialized courts such as the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Belarus">Constitutional Court</a>, which deals with specific issues related to constitutional and business law. The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic. For criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court. The Belarusian Constitution forbids the use of special extrajudicial courts.

In the <a href="Belarusian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202012">2012 parliamentary election</a>, 105 of the 110 members elected to the House of Representatives were not affiliated with any political party. The <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Belarus">Communist Party of Belarus</a> won 3 seats, and the <a href="Agrarian%20Party%20%28Belarus%29">Agrarian Party</a> and <a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20Labour%20and%20Justice">Republican Party of Labour and Justice</a>, one each. Most non-partisans represent a wide scope of social organizations such as workers' collectives, public associations, and civil society organizations, similar to the composition of the Soviet legislature.

There has been ongoing formation of a future Union State with <a href="Russia">Russia</a>.

Neither the pro-Lukashenko parties, such as the <a href="Belarusian%20Socialist%20Sporting%20Party">Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party</a> and the <a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20Labour%20and%20Justice">Republican Party of Labour and Justice</a>, nor the <a href="People%27s%20Coalition%205%20Plus">People's Coalition 5 Plus</a> opposition parties, such as the <a href="Partyja%20BPF">Belarusian People's Front</a> and the <a href="United%20Civil%20Party%20of%20Belarus">United Civil Party of Belarus</a>, won any seats in the <a href="Elections%20in%20Belarus%23Elections%20of%202004">2004 elections</a>. Groups such as the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) declared the election "un-free" because of the opposition parties' poor results and media bias in favor of the government.

In the <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">2006 presidential election</a>, Lukashenko was opposed by <a href="Alaksandar%20Milinkievi%C4%8D">Alaksandar Milinkievič</a>, who represented a coalition of opposition parties, and by <a href="Alaksandar%20Kazulin">Alaksandar Kazulin</a> of the Social Democrats. Kazulin was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the <a href="All%20Belarusian%20People%27s%20Assembly">All Belarusian People's Assembly</a>. Lukashenko won the election with 80% of the vote; the Russian Federation and the CIS deemed the vote open and fair while the OSCE and other organizations called the election unfair.

After the December completion of the <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202010">2010 presidential election</a>, Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% of the vote in elections. The runner-up opposition leader <a href="Andrei%20Sannikov">Andrei Sannikov</a> received less than 3% of the vote; independent observers criticized the election as fraudulent. When opposition protesters took to the streets in <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>, many people, including most rival presidential candidates, were beaten and arrested by the state militia. Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years. Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand-clapping.

The judicial system in Belarus lacks independence and is subject to political interference. Corrupt practices such as bribery often took place during tender processes, and <a href="whistleblower">whistleblower</a> protection and national <a href="ombudsman">ombudsman</a> are lacking in Belarus's anti-corruption system. However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, and the government has made some progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office.

Lukashenko has described himself as having an "authoritarian ruling style". Western countries have described Belarus under Lukashenko as a dictatorship; the government has accused the same Western powers of trying to oust Lukashenko. The <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a> has barred Belarus from membership since 1997 for undemocratic voting and election irregularities in the November 1996 constitutional referendum and parliament by-elections.

The Belarusian government is also criticized for human rights violations and its persecution of non-governmental organisations, independent journalists, national minorities, and opposition politicians. In a testimony to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations</a>, former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">United States Secretary of State</a> <a href="Condoleezza%20Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a> labeled Belarus as one of the world's six "<a href="outposts%20of%20tyranny">outposts of tyranny</a>". In response, the Belarusian government called the assessment "quite far from reality". The <a href="Viasna%20Human%20Rights%20Centre">Viasna Human Rights Centre</a> lists 11 political prisoners currently detained in Belarus. Among them is the human rights activist <a href="Ales%20Bialiatski">Ales Bialiatski</a>, Vice President of <a href="International%20Federation%20for%20Human%20Rights">International Federation for Human Rights</a> and head of Viasna.

Lukashenko announced a new law in 2014 that will prohibit <a href="kolkhoz">kolkhoz</a> workers (around 9% of total work force) from leaving their jobs at will—a change of job and living location will require permission from governors. The law was compared with <a href="serfdom">serfdom</a> by Lukashenko himself. Similar regulations were introduced for the forestry industry in 2012.

The Byelorussian SSR was one of the two Soviet republics that joined the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> along with the Ukrainian SSR as one of the original 51 members in 1945. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, under international law, Belarus became the internationally recognized successor state to the Byelorussian SSR, retaining its UN membership.

Belarus and Russia have been close trading partners and diplomatic allies since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Belarus is dependent on Russia for imports of raw materials and for its export market.

The <a href="union%20of%20Russia%20and%20Belarus">union of Russia and Belarus</a>, a supranational confederation, was established in a 1996–99 series of treaties that called for monetary union, equal rights, single citizenship, and a common foreign and defense policy. However, the future of the union has been placed in doubt because of Belarus's repeated delays of monetary union, the lack of a referendum date for the draft constitution, and a <a href="2007%20Russia%E2%80%93Belarus%20energy%20dispute">dispute over the petroleum trade</a>.

On 11 December 2007, reports emerged that a framework for the new state was discussed between both countries. On 2008, Belarusian President Lukashenko said that he had named <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Russia">Russian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> the "prime minister" of the Russia-Belarus alliance. The significance of this act was not immediately clear; some incorrectly speculated that Putin would become president of a unified state of Russia and Belarus after stepping down as Russian president in May 2008.

Belarus was a founding member of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a> (CIS). Belarus has trade agreements with several <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> member states (despite other member states' travel ban on Lukashenko and top officials), including neighboring Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Travel bans imposed by the European Union have been lifted in the past in order to allow Lukashenko to attend diplomatic meetings and also to engage his government and opposition groups in dialogue.

Bilateral relations with the United States are strained because the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. Department of State</a> supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also because the Belarusian government has made it increasingly difficult for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the <a href="Belarus%20Democracy%20Act%20of%202004">Belarus Democracy Act</a>, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.

Sino-Belarusian relations have improved, strengthened by the visit of President Lukashenko to China in October 2005. Belarus also has strong ties with <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, considered a key partner in the Middle East. In addition to the CIS, Belarus is a member of the <a href="Eurasian%20Economic%20Community">Eurasian Economic Community</a>, the <a href="Collective%20Security%20Treaty%20Organisation">Collective Security Treaty Organisation</a>, the international <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a> since 1998, and the <a href="Organization%20on%20Security%20and%20Cooperation%20in%20Europe">Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> (OSCE). As an OSCE member state, Belarus's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the <a href="U.S.%20Helsinki%20Commission">U.S. Helsinki Commission</a>.

Belarus is included in the European Union's <a href="European%20Neighbourhood%20Policy">European Neighbourhood Policy</a> (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.

On 15 February 2016 the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> announced the easing of sanctions against Belarus during a meeting by 28 EU foreign ministers at a regular session of the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Council of the European Union</a>.

Major General <a href="Andrei%20Ravkov">Andrei Ravkov</a> heads the Ministry of Defence, and Alexander Lukashenko (as president) serves as Commander-in-Chief. The armed forces were formed in 1992 using parts of the former <a href="Soviet%20Armed%20Forces">Soviet Armed Forces</a> on the new republic's territory. The transformation of the ex-Soviet forces into the Armed Forces of Belarus, which was completed in 1997, reduced the number of its soldiers by 30,000 and restructured its leadership and military formations.

Most of Belarus's service members are <a href="conscription">conscripts</a>, who serve for 12 months if they have higher education or 18 months if they do not. Demographic decreases in the Belarusians of conscription age have increased the importance of contract soldiers, who numbered 12,000 in 2001. In 2005, about 1.4% of Belarus's gross domestic product was devoted to military expenditure.

Belarus has not expressed a desire to join <a href="NATO">NATO</a> but has participated in the Individual Partnership Program since 1997, and Belarus provides refueling and airspace support for the <a href="ISAF">ISAF</a> mission in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Belarus first began to cooperate with NATO upon signing documents to participate in their Partnership for Peace Program in 1995. However, Belarus cannot join NATO because it is a member of the <a href="Collective%20Security%20Treaty%20Organisation">Collective Security Treaty Organisation</a>. Tensions between NATO and Belarus peaked after the March 2006 presidential election in Belarus.

Belarus is divided into six <a href="Oblast">regions</a> (, ), which are named after the cities that serve as their administrative centers.

Each region has a provincial legislative authority, called a region council (, ), which is elected by its residents, and a provincial executive authority called a region administration (, ), whose chairman is appointed by the president. Regions are further subdivided into "<a href="raion">raion</a>s", commonly translated as "districts" (, ).

Each "raion" has its own legislative authority, or "raion" council, (, ) elected by its residents, and an executive authority or "raion" administration appointed by higher executive powers. The six regions are divided into 118 "raions".

The city of Minsk is split into nine districts and enjoys special status as the nation's capital. It is run by an executive committee and has been granted a charter of self-rule.

In 2014 the share of manufacturing in GDP was 37%, more than two thirds of this amount falls on manufacturing industries. The number of people employed in industry is 32.7% of the working population. The growth rate is much lower than for the economy as a whole – about 1.9% in 2014.

At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Belarus was one of the world's most industrially developed states by percentage of GDP as well as the richest CIS member-state.
In 2015, 39.3% of Belarusians were employed by state-controlled companies, 57.2% were employed by private companies (in which the government has a 21.1% stake) and 3.5% were employed by foreign companies. The country relies on Russia for various imports, including petroleum. Important agricultural products include potatoes and cattle byproducts, including meat. In 1994, Belarus's main exports included heavy machinery (especially <a href="Belarus%20%28tractor%29">tractors</a>), agricultural products, and energy products.
Economically, Belarus involved itself in the CIS, <a href="Eurasian%20Economic%20Community">Eurasian Economic Community</a>, and <a href="Union%20State">Union with Russia</a>.

In the 1990s, however, industrial production plunged due to decreases in imports, investment, and demand for Belarusian products from its trading partners. GDP only began to rise in 1996; the country was the fastest-recovering former Soviet republic in the terms of its economy. In 2006, GDP amounted to in <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a> (PPP) dollars (estimate), or about $8,100 per capita. In 2005, GDP increased by 9.9%; the inflation rate averaged 9.5%.

In 2006, Belarus's largest trading partner was Russia, accounting for nearly half of total trade, with the European Union the next largest trading partner, with nearly a third of foreign trade. As of 2015, 38% of Belarusian exported goods go to Russia and 56% of imported goods come from Russia.

Due to its failure to protect labor rights, including passing laws forbidding unemployment or working outside of state-controlled sectors, Belarus lost its EU <a href="Generalized%20System%20of%20Preferences">Generalized System of Preferences</a> status on 2007, which raised tariff rates to their prior <a href="most%20favored%20nation">most favored nation</a> levels. Belarus applied to become a member of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> in 1993.

The labor force consists of more than four million people, among whom women hold slightly more jobs than men. In 2005, nearly a quarter of the population was employed by industrial factories. Employment is also high in agriculture, manufacturing sales, trading goods, and education. The unemployment rate, according to government statistics, was 1.5% in 2005. There were 679,000 unemployed Belarusians, two-thirds of whom were women. The unemployment rate has been in decline since 2003, and the overall rate of employment is the highest since statistics were first compiled in 1995.

Until 1 July 2016, the currency of Belarus was the <a href="Belarusian%20ruble">Belarusian ruble</a> (BYR). The currency was introduced in May 1992, replacing the <a href="Soviet%20ruble">Soviet ruble</a>. The first coins of the Republic of Belarus were issued on 27 December 1996. The ruble was reintroduced with new values in 2000 and has been in use ever since. As part of the <a href="Union%20State">Union of Russia and Belarus</a>, both states have discussed using a single currency along the same lines as the Euro. This led to a proposal that the Belarusian ruble be discontinued in favor of the <a href="Russian%20ruble">Russian ruble</a> (RUB), starting as early as 2008. The <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">National Bank of Belarus</a> abandoned pegging the Belarusian ruble to the Russian ruble in August 2007.

A new currency, the <a href="new%20Belarusian%20ruble">new Belarusian ruble</a> (<a href="ISO%204217">ISO 4217</a> code: BYN) was introduced in July 2016, replacing the <a href="Belarusian%20ruble">Belarusian ruble</a> in a rate of 1:10,000 (10,000 old rubles = 1 new ruble). From 1 July until 31 December 2016, the old and new currencies will be in <a href="parallel%20circulation">parallel circulation</a> and series 2000 notes and coins can be exchanged for series 2009 from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021. This <a href="redenomination">redenomination</a> can be considered an effort to fight the high inflation rate.

The banking system of Belarus consists of two level: Central Bank (National Bank of the Republic of Belarus) and 25 commercial banks. On 23 May 2011, the Belarusian ruble depreciated 56% against the United States dollar. The depreciation was even steeper on the black market and financial collapse seemed imminent as citizens rushed to exchange their rubles for dollars, euros, durable goods, and canned goods. On 1 June 2011, Belarus requested an economic rescue package from the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>.

According to the National Statistical Committee, as of January 2016, the population is 9.49 million people. Ethnic <a href="Belarusians">Belarusians</a> constitute 83.7% of Belarus's total population. The next largest ethnic groups are: <a href="Russians">Russians</a> (8.3%), <a href="Poles">Poles</a> (3.1%), and <a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a> (1.7%).
Belarus has a population density of about 50 people per square kilometer (127 per sq mi); 70% of its total population is concentrated in urban areas. <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>, the nation's capital and largest city, was home to 1,937,900 residents . <a href="Gomel">Gomel</a>, with a population of 481,000, is the second-largest city and serves as the capital of the <a href="Homiel%20Voblast">Homiel Voblast</a>. Other large cities are <a href="Mogilev">Mogilev</a> (365,100), <a href="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a> (342,400), <a href="Hrodna">Hrodna</a> (314,800) and <a href="Brest%2C%20Belarus">Brest</a> (298,300).

Like many other eastern European countries, Belarus has a negative population growth rate and a negative natural growth rate. In 2007, Belarus's population declined by 0.41% and its <a href="Total%20fertility%20rate">fertility rate</a> was 1.22, well <a href="Sub-replacement%20fertility">below the replacement rate</a>. Its <a href="net%20migration%20rate">net migration rate</a> is +0.38 per 1,000, indicating that Belarus experiences slightly more immigration than emigration. , 69.9% of Belarus's population is aged 14 to 64; 15.5% is under 14, and 14.6% is 65 or older. Its population is also aging; the median age of 30–34 is estimated to rise to between 60 and 64 in 2050. There are about 0.87 males per female in Belarus. The average life expectancy is 72.15 (66.53 years for men and 78.1 years for women). Over 99% of Belarusians aged 15 and older are <a href="literate">literate</a>.

Belarus' two official languages are Russian and <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian</a>; Russian is the main language, used by 72% of the population, while Belarusian, the official first language, is spoken by 11.9%. Minorities also speak <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Yiddish">Eastern Yiddish</a>. Belarusian, although not as widely used as Russian, is the mother tongue of 53.2% of the population, whereas Russian is the mother tongue of only 41.5%.

Minorities also practice <a href="Greek%20Catholicism">Greek Catholicism</a>, Judaism, Islam and Neopaganism. Overall, 48.3% of the population is Orthodox Christian, 41.1% is not religious, 7.1% is Catholic and 3.3% follows other religions.

Belarus's Catholic minority is concentrated in the western part of the country, especially around <a href="Hrodna">Hrodna</a>, is made up of a mixture of Belarusians and the country's <a href="Poles">Polish</a> and <a href="Lithuanian%20people">Lithuanian</a> minorities. In a statement to the media regarding Belarusian-Vatican ties, President Lukashenko stated that Orthodox and Catholic believers are the "two main confessions in our country".

Belarus was once a major center of European Jews, with 10% of the population being <a href="history%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Belarus">Jewish</a>. But since the mid-20th century, the number of Jews has been reduced by the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, deportation, and emigration, so that today it is a very small minority of less than one percent. The <a href="Lipka%20Tatars">Lipka Tatars</a>, numbering over 15,000, are predominantly <a href="Islam%20in%20Belarus">Muslims</a>. According to Article 16 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">Constitution</a>, Belarus has no official religion. While the <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of worship</a> is granted in the same article, religious organizations deemed harmful to the government or social order can be prohibited.

The Belarusian government sponsors annual cultural festivals such as the Bazaar in Vitebsk, which showcases Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Several state holidays, such as <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20Independence%20Day">Independence Day</a> and <a href="Victory%20Day%20%289%20May%29">Victory Day</a>, draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk. The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country.
Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of <a href="Cyril%20of%20Turaw">Cyril of Turaw</a>.

By the 16th century, <a href="Polotsk">Polotsk</a> resident <a href="Francysk%20Skaryna">Francysk Skaryna</a> translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in <a href="Prague">Prague</a> and <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was <a href="Yanka%20Kupala">Yanka Kupala</a>. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as <a href="U%C5%82adzimir%20%C5%BDy%C5%82ka">Uładzimir Žyłka</a>, Kazimir Svayak, <a href="Yakub%20Kolas">Yakub Kolas</a>, <a href="%C5%B9mitrok%20Biadula">Źmitrok Biadula</a>, and <a href="Maksim%20Haretski">Maksim Haretski</a>, wrote for "<a href="Nasha%20Niva">Nasha Niva</a>", a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk.

After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of "Belarusianization" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges. The free development of literature occurred only in Polish-held territory until Soviet occupation in 1939. Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus and would not return until the 1960s.

The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by <a href="Vasil%20Byka%C5%AD">Vasil Bykaŭ</a> and <a href="Uladzimir%20Karatkievich">Uladzimir Karatkievich</a>. An influential author who devoted his work to awakening the awareness of the catastrophes the country has suffered, was <a href="Ales%20Adamovich">Ales Adamovich</a>. He was named by <a href="Svetlana%20Alexievich">Svetlana Alexievich</a>, the Belarusian winner of the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> 2015, as "her main teacher, who helped her to find a path of her own".
<a href="Music%20of%20Belarus">Music in Belarus</a> largely comprises a rich tradition of folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>. In the 19th century, Polish composer <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Moniuszko">Stanisław Moniuszko</a> composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet <a href="Vintsent%20Dunin-Martsinkyevich">Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich</a> and created the opera "Sialanka" ("Peasant Woman"). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet "<a href="Nightingale%20%28ballet%29">Nightingale</a>" by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk.

After the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland. During this period, <a href="Anatoly%20Bogatyrev">Anatoly Bogatyrev</a>, creator of the opera "In Polesye Virgin Forest", served as the "tutor" of Belarusian composers. The National Academic Theatre of Ballet in Minsk was awarded the <a href="Prix%20Benois%20de%20la%20Danse">Benois de la Dance Prize</a> in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world. Rock music has become increasingly popular in recent years, though the Belarusian government has attempted to limit the amount of foreign music aired on the radio in favor of traditional Belarusian music. Since 2004, Belarus has been sending artists to the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>.

<a href="Marc%20Chagall">Marc Chagall</a> was born in Liozna (near <a href="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a>) in 1887. He spent the <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> years in Soviet Belarus, becoming one of the country's most distinguished artists and a member of the modernist <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> and was a founder of the Vitebsk Arts College.

The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a> period. Due to the cool climate, clothes were designed to preserve body heat and were usually made from <a href="flax">flax</a> or <a href="wool">wool</a>. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns. One ornamental pattern common in early dresses currently decorates the hoist of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Belarus">Belarusian national flag</a>, adopted in a <a href="Belarusian%20referendum%2C%201995">disputed referendum</a> in 1995.

<a href="Belarusian%20cuisine">Belarusian cuisine</a> consists mainly of vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or <a href="stewed">stewed</a>. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. <a href="Wheat">Wheat</a> and <a href="rye">rye</a> breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of <a href="bread%20and%20salt">bread and salt</a> when greeting a guest or visitor.

Belarus has competed in the Olympic Games since the <a href="1994%20Winter%20Olympics">1994 Winter Olympics</a>. Its <a href="National%20Olympic%20Committee">National Olympic Committee</a> has been headed by President Lukashenko since 1997.

Belarusian literature was formed on the basis of <a href="Old%20Russian%20literature">Old Russian literature</a>, and the process of its separation took place in the 14th–15th centuries. The heyday came in the 16th–17th centuries (the so-called "Golden Age"). <a href="Old%20Belarusian%20language">Old Belarusian language</a> was the official language of the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> (ON Statutes 1529, 1566 and 1588, <a href="polemical%20literature">polemical religious literature</a>).

The first printed book in the Old Belarusian language – "Psalms" – was published in Prague in 1517 by <a href="Francysk%20Skaryna">Francysk Skaryna</a>. It was the first book printed in the language of the East Slavic group. In the 16th and 17th centuries there was a Baroque syllabic poetry and drama school under the influence of Polish culture (<a href="Symeon%20of%20Polotsk">Symeon of Polotsk</a>). In the 18th century numerous wars caused the decay of scholars. The literature gradually fell into disrepair; its revival began in the last quarter of the 17th century, when a professor of Dominican college Kajetan Marashovski wrote the first untitled comedy that featured Belarusian language. Revitalization process of creativity in the Belarusian language continued at the beginning of the 19th century.

Belize

Belize (), formerly <a href="British%20Honduras">British Honduras</a>, is an independent country on the eastern coast of <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. Belize is bordered on the north by <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, on the south and west by <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, and on the east by the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>. Its mainland is about long and wide.

Belize has an area of and a population of 387,879 (2017). It has the lowest <a href="population%20density">population density</a> in Central America. The country's population growth rate of 1.87% per year (2015) is the second highest in the region and one of the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20population%20growth">highest in the Western Hemisphere</a>.

Belize's abundance of terrestrial and marine species and its diversity of ecosystems gives it a key place in the globally significant <a href="Mesoamerican%20Biological%20Corridor">Mesoamerican Biological Corridor</a>.

Belize has a diverse society, composed of many cultures and languages that reflect its rich history. <a href="English%20language">English</a> is the official language of Belize, while <a href="Belizean%20Creole">Belizean Creole</a> is an unofficial native language. Over half the population is <a href="multilingual">multilingual</a>, with Spanish being the second most common spoken language.

Belize is considered a Central American and <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> nation with strong ties to both the Latin American and Caribbean regions. It is a member of the <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean Community</a> (CARICOM), the <a href="Community%20of%20Latin%20American%20and%20Caribbean%20States">Community of Latin American and Caribbean States</a> (CELAC), and the <a href="Central%20American%20Integration%20System">Central American Integration System</a> (SICA), the only country to hold full membership in all three regional organisations. Belize is a <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>, with <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> as <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Belize">its monarch</a> and <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>.

Belize is known for its <a href="September%20Celebrations%20of%20Belize">September Celebrations</a>, its extensive barrier reef <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s, and <a href="Punta">punta music</a>.

Its original name was British Honduras.
The earliest known record of the name appears in the journal of the <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> priest Fray José Delgado, dating to 1677. Delgado recorded the names of three major rivers that he crossed while travelling north along the Caribbean coast: Rio Soyte, Rio Xibum, and Rio Balis. The names of these waterways, which correspond to the <a href="Sittee%20River">Sittee River</a>, <a href="Sibun%20River">Sibun River</a> and <a href="Belize%20River">Belize River</a>, were provided to Delgado by his translator. It is likely that Delgado's "Balis" was actually the Mayan word "belix" (or "beliz"), meaning "muddy-watered".

Others have suggested that the name derives from a Spanish pronunciation of the name of the Scottish buccaneer <a href="Peter%20Wallace%20%28buccaneer%29">Peter Wallace</a>, who established a settlement at the mouth of the Belize River in 1638. There is no proof that Wallace settled in this area and some scholars have characterized this claim as a myth. Writers and historians have suggested several other possible etymologies, including postulated French and African origins.

The <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya civilization</a> emerged at least three millennia ago in the lowland area of the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> and the highlands to the south, in what is now southeastern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, Belize, <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, and western <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>. Many aspects of this culture persist in the area despite nearly 500 years of European domination. Prior to about 2500 BC, some <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunting and foraging</a> bands settled in small farming villages; they later domesticated crops such as corn, beans, <a href="Squash%20%28plant%29">squash</a>, and chili peppers. 
A profusion of languages and subcultures developed within the Maya core culture. Between about 2500 BC and 250 AD, the basic institutions of Maya civilisation emerged. The peak of this civilization occurred during the classic period, which began about 250 AD.

The <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya civilization</a> spread across what is now Belize around 1500 BC, and flourished there until about 900 AD. The recorded history of the middle and southern regions is dominated by <a href="Caracol">Caracol</a>, an urban political centre that may have supported over 140,000 people. North of the <a href="Maya%20Mountains">Maya Mountains</a>, the most important political centre was <a href="Lamanai">Lamanai</a>. In the late <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology">Classic Era</a> of Maya civilisation (600–1000 AD), as many as 1 million people may have lived in the area that is now Belize.

When Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, the area that is now Belize included three distinct Maya territories: <a href="Chetumal%20province">Chetumal province</a>, which encompassed the area around <a href="Corozal%20Bay">Corozal Bay</a>; <a href="Dzuluinicob%20province">Dzuluinicob province</a>, which encompassed the area between the <a href="New%20River%20%28Belize%29">New River</a> and the <a href="Sibun%20River">Sibun River</a>, west to <a href="Tipu%2C%20Belize">Tipu</a>; and a southern territory controlled by the <a href="Manche%20Ch%27ol">Manche Ch'ol</a> Maya, encompassing the area between the <a href="Monkey%20River">Monkey River</a> and the <a href="Sarstoon%20River">Sarstoon River</a>.

Spanish <a href="conquistador">conquistador</a>s explored the land and declared it a <a href="Spanish%20colony">Spanish colony</a> but chose not to settle and develop because of its lack of resources and the hostile Indian tribes of the Yucatán.

English and Scottish settlers and pirates known as the <a href="Baymen">Baymen</a> entered the area from the 17th century, with Baymen first settling on the coast of what is now Belize in 1638, seeking a sheltered region from which they could attack Spanish ships "(see <a href="English%20settlement%20in%20Belize">English settlement in Belize</a>)". The settlers established a trade colony and <a href="port">port</a> in what became the <a href="Belize%20District">Belize District</a>. and during the 18th century, established a system using <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">black slaves</a> to cut the <a href="logwood">logwood</a> (Haematoxylum campechianum) tree. This yielded a valuable fixing agent for clothing dyes, and was one of the first ways to achieve a <a href="Natural%20dye%23The%20rise%20of%20formal%20black">fast black</a> before the advent of artificial dyes. The Spanish granted the British settlers the right to occupy the area and cut logwood in exchange for helping to suppress piracy.

The British first appointed a superintendent over the Belize area in 1786. Before then the British government had not recognized the settlement as a colony for fear of provoking a <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a> attack. The delay in government oversight allowed the settlers to establish their own laws and forms of government. During this period, a few successful settlers gained control of the local legislature, known as the Public Meeting, as well as of most of the settlement's land and timber.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20St.%20George%27s%20Caye">Battle of St. George's Caye</a> was a 1798 military engagement off the coast of Belize between an invading Spanish fleet and a small force of <a href="Baymen">Baymen</a> and their slaves. From 3 to 5 September, the Spaniards tried to force their way through Montego Caye shoal, but were blocked by defenders. Spain's last attempt occurred on 10 September, when the Baymen repelled the Spanish fleet in a short engagement with no known casualties on either side. The anniversary of the battle is a national holiday in Belize and is celebrated to commemorate the "first Belizeans" and the defence of their territory.

In the early 19th century, the British sought to reform the settlers, threatening to suspend the Public Meeting unless it observed the government's instructions to eliminate slavery outright. After a generation of wrangling, slavery was <a href="Slavery%20Abolition%20Act%201833">abolished</a> in the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> in 1833, As a result of their slaves' abilities in the work of <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> extraction, owners in <a href="British%20Honduras">British Honduras</a> were compensated at £53.69 per slave on average, the highest amount paid in any British territory.

However, the end of slavery did little to change the former slaves' working conditions if they stayed at their trade. A series of institutions were put in place to restrict the ability of individuals to obtain land, in a debt-peonage system to organize the newly freed. The position of being "extra special" mahogany and logwood cutters undergirded the early ascriptions of the capacities (and consequently the limitations) of people of African descent in the colony. Because a small elite controlled the settlement's land and commerce, former slaves had little choice but to continue to work in timber cutting.

In 1836, after the <a href="Spanish%20American%20wars%20of%20independence">emancipation of Central America from Spanish rule</a>, the British claimed the right to administer the region. In 1862, Great Britain formally declared it a <a href="British%20Crown%20Colony">British Crown Colony</a>, subordinate to Jamaica, and named it British Honduras.

As a colony, Belize began to attract British investors. Among the British firms that dominated the colony in the late 19th century was the Belize Estate and Produce Company, which eventually acquired half of all the privately held land in the colony, and eventually eliminated the peonage system. Belize Estate's influence accounts in part for the colony's reliance on the mahogany trade throughout the rest of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.
The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s caused a near-collapse of the colony's economy as British demand for timber plummeted. The effects of widespread unemployment were worsened by a <a href="1931%20Belize%20hurricane">devastating hurricane</a> that struck the colony in 1931. Perceptions of the government's relief effort as inadequate were aggravated by its refusal to legalize labour unions or introduce a minimum wage. Economic conditions improved during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> as many Belizean men entered the armed forces or otherwise contributed to the war effort.

Following the war, the colony's economy stagnated because of the pressures caused by the war's spending. Britain's decision to <a href="devalue">devalue</a> the British Honduras dollar in 1949 worsened economic conditions and led to the creation of the People's Committee, which demanded independence. The People's Committee's successor, the <a href="People%27s%20United%20Party">People's United Party</a> (PUP), sought constitutional reforms that expanded voting rights to all adults. The first election under <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a> was held <a href="British%20Honduras%20general%20election%2C%201954">in 1954</a> and was decisively won by the PUP, beginning a three-decade period in which the PUP dominated the country's politics. Pro-independence activist <a href="George%20Cadle%20Price">George Cadle Price</a> became PUP leader in 1956 and the effective head of government in 1961, a post he would hold under various titles until 1984.

Under a new constitution Britain granted British Honduras self-government in 1964. On 1 June 1973, British Honduras was officially renamed Belize. Progress toward independence, however, was hampered by a <a href="Belizean%E2%80%93Guatemalan%20territorial%20dispute">Guatemalan claim to sovereignty over Belizean territory</a>.

Belize was granted independence on 21 September 1981. <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> refused to recognize the new nation because of its longstanding territorial dispute with the British colony, claiming that Belize belonged to Guatemala. About 1,500 British troops remained in Belize to deter any possible incursions.

With Price at the helm, the PUP won all national elections <a href="Belizean%20general%20election%2C%201984">until 1984</a>. In that election, the first national election after independence, the PUP was defeated by the <a href="United%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Belize%29">United Democratic Party</a> (UDP). UDP leader <a href="Manuel%20Esquivel">Manuel Esquivel</a> replaced Price as prime minister, with Price himself unexpectedly losing his own <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Belize%29">House</a> seat to a UDP challenger. The PUP under Price returned to power after elections <a href="Belizean%20general%20election%2C%201989">in 1989</a>. The following year the United Kingdom announced that it would end its military involvement in Belize, and the RAF Harrier detachment was withdrawn the same year, having remained stationed in the country continuously since its deployment had become permanent there in 1980. British soldiers were withdrawn in 1994, but the United Kingdom left behind a military training unit to assist with the newly created <a href="Belize%20Defence%20Force">Belize Defence Force</a>.

The UDP regained power in the <a href="Belizean%20general%20election%2C%201993">1993 national election</a>, and Esquivel became prime minister for a second time. Soon afterwards Esquivel announced the suspension of a pact reached with Guatemala during Price's tenure, claiming Price had made too many concessions to gain Guatemalan recognition. The pact may have curtailed the 130-year-old border dispute between the two countries. Border tensions continued into the early 2000s, although the two countries cooperated in other areas.

The PUP won a landslide victory in the 1998 national elections, and PUP leader <a href="Said%20Musa">Said Musa</a> was sworn in as prime minister. In the 2003 elections the PUP maintained its majority, and Musa continued as prime minister. He pledged to improve conditions in the underdeveloped and largely inaccessible southern part of Belize.

In 2005, Belize was the site of <a href="2005%20Belize%20unrest">unrest</a> caused by discontent with the PUP government, including tax increases in the national budget. On 8 February 2008, <a href="Dean%20Barrow">Dean Barrow</a> was sworn in as prime minister after his <a href="United%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Belize%29">UDP</a> won <a href="Belizean%20general%20election%2C%202008">a landslide victory</a> in general elections. Barrow and the UDP were re-elected <a href="Belizean%20general%20and%20local%20elections%2C%202012">in 2012</a> with a considerably smaller majority.

Throughout Belize's history, Guatemala has <a href="Belizean%E2%80%93Guatemalan%20territorial%20dispute">claimed ownership</a> of all or part of Belizean territory. This claim is occasionally reflected in maps drawn by Guatemala's government, showing Belize as Guatemala's twenty-third <a href="Departments%20of%20Guatemala">department</a>. , the border dispute with Guatemala remains unresolved and quite contentious. Guatemala's claim to Belizean territory rests, in part, on Clause VII of the <a href="Anglo-Guatemalan%20Treaty%20of%201859">Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty of 1859</a>, which obligated the British to build a road between Belize City and Guatemala. At various times the issue has required mediation by the United Kingdom, <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean Community</a> heads of government, the <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a> (OAS), Mexico, and the United States. Notably, both Guatemala and Belize participate in <a href="confidence-building">confidence-building</a> measures approved by the OAS such as the Guatemala-Belize Language Exchange Project.

Belize is a <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary</a> <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>. The structure of government is based on the British parliamentary system, and the legal system is modelled on the <a href="English%20law%23Common%20law">common law of England</a>. The symbolic head of state is <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, who holds the title <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Belize">Queen of Belize</a>. The Queen resides in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and is represented in Belize by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Belize">Governor-General</a>. Executive authority is exercised by the cabinet, which advises the Governor-General and is led by the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Belize">Prime Minister of Belize</a>, who is head of government. Cabinet ministers are members of the majority political party in parliament and usually hold elected seats within it concurrent with their cabinet positions.

The bicameral <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Belize">National Assembly of Belize</a> is composed of a <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Belize">House of Representatives</a> and a <a href="Senate%20of%20Belize">Senate</a>. The 31 members of the House are popularly elected to a maximum five-year term and introduce legislation affecting the development of Belize. The Governor-General appoints the 12 members of the Senate, with a Senate president selected by the members. The Senate is responsible for debating and approving bills passed by the House.

<a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested in both the government and the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Belize">Parliament of Belize</a>. Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

Members of the independent judiciary are appointed. The judicial system includes local magistrates grouped under the Magistrates' Court, which hears less serious cases. The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Belize">Supreme Court</a> (Chief Justice) hears murder and similarly serious cases, and the Court of Appeal, hears appeals from convicted individuals seeking to have their sentences overturned. Defendants may, under certain circumstances, appeal their cases to the <a href="Caribbean%20Court%20of%20Justice">Caribbean Court of Justice</a>.

Since 1974, the party system in Belize has been dominated by the centre-left <a href="People%27s%20United%20Party">People's United Party</a> and the centre-right <a href="United%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Belize%29">United Democratic Party</a>, although there have been other small parties that have participated at all levels of elections in the past. Though none of these small political parties have ever won any significant number of seats and/or offices, their challenge has been growing over the years.

Belize is a full participating member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a> (OAS), <a href="Central%20American%20Integration%20System">Central American Integration System</a> (SICA), <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean Community</a> (CARICOM), <a href="CARICOM%20Single%20Market%20and%20Economy">CARICOM Single Market and Economy</a> (CSME), <a href="Association%20of%20Caribbean%20States">Association of Caribbean States</a> (ACS), and the <a href="Caribbean%20Court%20of%20Justice">Caribbean Court of Justice</a> (CCJ), which currently serves as a final court of appeal for only <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, Belize and <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>. In 2001 the Caribbean Community heads of government voted on a measure declaring that the region should work towards replacing the UK's <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a> with the Caribbean Court of Justice. It is still in the process of acceding to CARICOM and SICA treaties, including trade and single market treaties.

Belize is an original member (1995) of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO), and participates actively in its work. The pact involves the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) subgroup of the <a href="African%2C%20Caribbean%20and%20Pacific%20Group%20of%20States">Group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific states</a> (ACP). CARIFORUM presently the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>.

The <a href="Belize%20Defence%20Force">Belize Defence Force</a> (BDF) serves as the country's military and is responsible for protecting the sovereignty of Belize. The BDF, with the Belize National Coast Guard and the Immigration Department, is a department of the Ministry of Defence and Immigration. In 1997 the regular army numbered over 900, the reserve army 381, the air wing 45 and the maritime wing 36, amounting to an overall strength of approximately 1400. In 2005, the maritime wing became part of the Belizean Coast Guard. In 2012, the Belizean government spent about $17 million on the military, constituting 1.08% of the country's <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP).

After Belize achieved independence in 1981 the United Kingdom maintained a deterrent force (British Forces Belize) in the country to protect it from invasion by <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> (see <a href="Guatemalan%20claim%20to%20Belizean%20territory">Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory</a>). During the 1980s this included a battalion and <a href="No.%201417%20Flight%20RAF">No. 1417 Flight RAF</a> of Harriers. The main British force left in 1994, three years after Guatemala recognized Belizean independence, but the United Kingdom maintained a training presence via the British Army Training and Support Unit Belize (BATSUB) and <a href="25%20Flight%20AAC">25 Flight AAC</a> until 2011 when the last British Forces left Ladyville Barracks, with the exception of seconded advisers.

Belize is divided into <a href="Districts%20of%20Belize">six districts</a>.
These districts are further divided into <a href="Constituencies%20of%20Belize">31 constituencies</a>. <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Belize">Local government in Belize</a> comprises four types of local authorities: <a href="city%20council">city council</a>s, <a href="town%20council">town council</a>s, <a href="Town%20council">village council</a>s and <a href="community%20council">community council</a>s. The two city councils (<a href="Belize%20City">Belize City</a> and <a href="Belmopan">Belmopan</a>) and seven town councils cover the urban population of the country, while village and community councils cover the rural population.

Belize is on the Caribbean coast of northern Central America. It shares a border on the north with the Mexican state of <a href="Quintana%20Roo">Quintana Roo</a>, on the west with the Guatemalan department of <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20%28department%29">Petén</a>, and on the south with the Guatemalan department of <a href="Izabal%20Department">Izabal</a>. To the east in the Caribbean Sea, <a href="Belize%20Barrier%20Reef">the second-longest barrier reef</a> in the world flanks much of the of predominantly <a href="marsh">marsh</a>y coastline. The area of the country totals , an area slightly larger than El Salvador, Israel, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> or Wales. The many <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s along the coasts and in the northern interior reduces the actual land area to .

Belize is shaped like a rectangle that extends about north-south and about east-west, with a total land boundary length of . The undulating courses of two rivers, the <a href="Rio%20Hondo%20%28Belize%29">Hondo</a> and the <a href="Sarstoon%20River">Sarstoon River</a>, define much of the course of the country's northern and southern boundaries. The western border follows no natural features and runs north-south through lowland forest and highland plateau.

The north of Belize consists mostly of flat, swampy coastal plains, in places heavily forested. The <a href="Flora%20and%20vegetation%20of%20Belize">flora</a> is highly diverse considering the small geographical area. The south contains the low <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a> of the <a href="Maya%20Mountains">Maya Mountains</a>. The highest point in Belize is <a href="Doyle%27s%20Delight">Doyle's Delight</a> at .

Belize's rugged geography has also made the country's coastline and jungle attractive to drug smugglers, who use the country as a gateway into Mexico. In 2011, the United States added Belize to the list of nations considered major drug producers or transit countries for narcotics.

Belize is a country with a rich variety of wildlife, because of its unique position between both <a href="North%20America">North</a> and South America, and a wide range of climates and habitats for plant and animal life. Belize's low human population and approximately of undistributed land makes for an ideal home for the more than 5,000 species of plants, and hundreds of species of animals, including <a href="armadillo">armadillo</a>s, snakes, and <a href="monkey">monkey</a>s.

The <a href="Cockscomb%20Basin%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary</a> is a nature reserve in south-central Belize established to protect the forests, fauna and <a href="Drainage%20basin">watershed</a>s of an approximately area of the eastern slopes of the Maya Mountains. The reserve was founded in 1990 as the first wilderness sanctuary for the <a href="jaguar">jaguar</a> and is regarded by one author as the premier site for jaguar preservation in the world.

While over 60% of Belize's land surface is covered by forest, some 20% of the country's land is covered by cultivated land (agriculture) and human settlements. <a href="Savanna">Savanna</a>, scrubland and <a href="wetland">wetland</a> constitute the remainder of Belize's land cover. Important <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> ecosystems are also represented across Belize's landscape. As a part of the globally significant Mesoamerican Biological Corridor that stretches from southern Mexico to Panama, Belize's biodiversity – both <a href="marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> and <a href="Terrestrial%20ecoregion">terrestrial</a> – is rich, with abundant <a href="flora">flora</a> and <a href="fauna">fauna</a>.

Belize is also a leader in protecting biodiversity and natural resources. According to the <a href="World%20Database%20on%20Protected%20Areas">World Database on Protected Areas</a>, 37% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protection, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. By contrast, Costa Rica only has 27% of its land territory protected.

Around 13.6% of Belize's <a href="territorial%20waters">territorial waters</a>, which contain the <a href="Belize%20Barrier%20Reef">Belize Barrier Reef</a>, are also protected. The Belize Barrier Reef is a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>-recognized <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> and is the second-largest barrier reef in the world, behind <a href="Australia">Australia</a>'s <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>.

A <a href="remote%20sensing">remote sensing</a> study conducted by the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC) and <a href="NASA">NASA</a>, in collaboration with the Forest Department and the Land Information Centre (LIC) of the government of Belize's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment (MNRE), and published in August 2010 revealed that Belize's forest cover in early 2010 was approximately 62.7%, down from 75.9% in late 1980. A similar study by Belize Tropical Forest Studies and Conservation International revealed similar trends in terms of Belize's forest cover. Both studies indicate that each year, 0.6% of Belize's forest cover is lost, translating to the clearing of an average of each year. The <a href="USAID">USAID</a>-supported ERVIR study by CATHALAC, NASA, and the MNRE also showed that Belize's protected areas have been extremely effective in protecting the country's forests. While only some 6.4% of forests inside of legally declared protected areas were cleared between 1980 and 2010, over a quarter of forests outside of protected areas were lost between 1980 and 2010.

As a country with a relatively high forest cover and a low <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> rate, Belize has significant potential for participation in initiatives such as <a href="REDD">REDD</a>. Significantly, the SERVIR study on Belize's deforestation was also recognized by the <a href="Group%20on%20Earth%20Observations">Group on Earth Observations</a> (GEO), of which Belize is a member nation.

Belize is known to have a number of economically important minerals, but none in quantities large enough to warrant mining. These minerals include <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a>, <a href="barite">barite</a> (source of <a href="barium">barium</a>), <a href="bauxite">bauxite</a> (source of aluminium), <a href="cassiterite">cassiterite</a> (source of tin), and gold. In 1990 <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, used in road-building, was the only mineral resource being exploited for either domestic or export use.

In 2006, the cultivation of newly discovered <a href="crude%20oil">crude oil</a> in the town of <a href="Spanish%20Lookout">Spanish Lookout</a> has presented new prospects and problems for this developing nation.

The Belize Barrier Reef is a series of <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s straddling the coast of Belize, roughly offshore in the north and in the south within the country limits. The Belize Barrier Reef is a long section of the long <a href="Mesoamerican%20Barrier%20Reef%20System">Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System</a>, which is continuous from <a href="Canc%C3%BAn">Cancún</a> on the northeast tip of the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> through the <a href="Riviera%20Maya">Riviera Maya</a> up to <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> making it one of the largest coral reef systems in the world.

It is Belize's top tourist destination, popular for <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> and <a href="snorkelling">snorkelling</a>, and attracting almost half of its 260,000 visitors. It is also vital to its fishing industry. In 1842 <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> described it as "the most remarkable reef in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>".

The Belize Barrier Reef was declared a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> by <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> in 1996 due to its vulnerability and the fact that it contains important natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biodiversity.

The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s of the world:
With 90% of the reef still to be researched, some estimate that only 10% of all species have been discovered.

Belize became the first country in the world to completely ban <a href="bottom%20trawling">bottom trawling</a> in December 2010. In December 2015, Belize banned offshore oil drilling within of the Barrier Reef and all of its 7 World Heritage Sites.

Despite these protective measures, the reef remains under threat from <a href="Marine%20pollution">oceanic pollution</a> as well as uncontrolled tourism, shipping, and fishing. Other threats include hurricanes, along with <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a> and the resulting increase in ocean temperatures, which causes <a href="coral%20bleaching">coral bleaching</a>. It is claimed by scientists that over 40% of Belize's coral reef has been damaged since 1998.

Belize has a <a href="tropical%20climate">tropical climate</a> with pronounced <a href="wet%20season">wet</a> and <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>s, although there are significant variations in weather patterns by region. Temperatures vary according to elevation, proximity to the coast, and the moderating effects of the northeast trade winds off the Caribbean. Average temperatures in the coastal regions range from in January to in July. Temperatures are slightly higher inland, except for the southern highland plateaus, such as the <a href="Mountain%20Pine%20Ridge">Mountain Pine Ridge</a>, where it is noticeably cooler year round. Overall, the seasons are marked more by differences in humidity and rainfall than in temperature.

Average rainfall varies considerably, from in the north and west to over in the extreme south. Seasonal differences in rainfall are greatest in the northern and central regions of the country where, between January and April or May, less than of rainfall per month. The dry season is shorter in the south, normally only lasting from February to April. A shorter, less rainy period, known locally as the "little dry", usually occurs in late July or August, after the initial onset of the rainy season.

<a href="Hurricane">Hurricane</a>s have played key—and devastating—roles in <a href="History%20of%20Belize">Belizean history</a>. In 1931, an unnamed hurricane destroyed over two-thirds of the buildings in Belize City and killed more than 1,000 people. In 1955, <a href="Hurricane%20Janet">Hurricane Janet</a> levelled the northern town of <a href="Corozal%20Town">Corozal</a>. Only six years later, <a href="Hurricane%20Hattie">Hurricane Hattie</a> struck the central coastal area of the country, with winds in excess of and <a href="storm%20tide">storm tide</a>s. The devastation of Belize City for the second time in thirty years prompted the relocation of the capital some inland to the <a href="planned%20city">planned city</a> of <a href="Belmopan">Belmopan</a>.

In 1978, <a href="Hurricane%20Greta-Olivia">Hurricane Greta</a> caused more than US$25 million in damages along the southern coast. On 9 October 2001, <a href="Hurricane%20Iris">Hurricane Iris</a> made landfall at <a href="Monkey%20River%20Town">Monkey River Town</a> as a Category Four storm. The storm demolished most of the homes in the village, and destroyed the banana crop. In 2007, <a href="Hurricane%20Dean">Hurricane Dean</a> made landfall as a Category 5 storm only north of the Belize–Mexico border. Dean caused extensive damage in northern Belize.

In 2010, Belize was directly affected by the Category 2 <a href="Hurricane%20Richard">Hurricane Richard</a>, which made landfall approximately south-southeast of Belize City at around 00:45 UTC on 25 October 2010. The storm moved inland towards <a href="Belmopan">Belmopan</a>, causing estimated damage of <a href="Belize%20dollar">BZ$</a>33.8 million ($17.4 million 2010 USD), primarily from damage to crops and housing.

The most recent hurricane to affect the nation was <a href="Hurricane%20Earl%20%282016%29">Hurricane Earl of 2016</a>.

Belize has a small, mostly private enterprise economy that is based primarily on export of <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> and <a href="crude%20oil">crude oil</a>, agriculture, agro-based industry, and merchandising, with tourism and construction recently assuming greater importance. , oil production was and oil exports were . The country is also a producer of <a href="industrial%20mineral">industrial mineral</a>s. In agriculture, <a href="sugar">sugar</a>, like in colonial times, remains the chief crop, accounting for nearly half of exports, while the <a href="banana">banana</a> industry is the largest employer.

The new <a href="government%20of%20Belize">government of Belize</a> faces important challenges to economic stability. Rapid action to improve <a href="tax%20collection">tax collection</a> has been promised, but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the <a href="exchange%20rate">exchange rate</a> under pressure. The tourist and construction sectors strengthened in early 1999, leading to a preliminary estimate of revived growth at 4%. Infrastructure remains a major economic development challenge; Belize has the region's most expensive electricity. Trade is important and the major trading partners are the United States, Mexico, the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, and Central America.

Belize has five commercial banks, of which the largest and oldest is <a href="Belize%20Bank">Belize Bank</a>. The other four banks are Heritage Bank, Atlantic Bank, <a href="FirstCaribbean%20International%20Bank">FirstCaribbean International Bank</a>, and <a href="Scotiabank">Scotiabank</a> (Belize). A robust complex of <a href="credit%20union">credit union</a>s began in the 1940s under the leadership of <a href="Marion%20M.%20Ganey">Marion M.

Belize is located on the coast of Central America. Based on its location, it is seen as a beautiful destinations for vacations. However, also due to its location, it is currently becoming known in the global arena for attracting many drug trafficking entities in North America. The Belize currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. This entices drug traffickers and money launderers who want to utilize their current economic system. In addition, Belize also offers nonresidents the ability to establish offshore accounts. Because of this loophole, it is desirable for many drug traffickers and money launderers to utilize Belize as a money laundering banking entity. As a result, the United States Department of State has recently named Belize one of the world’s "major money laundering countries." 2016 World Fact pageRank.Book of the United States Central Intelligence Agency

The largest integrated electric utility and the principal distributor in Belize is <a href="Belize%20Electricity%20Limited">Belize Electricity Limited</a>. BEL was approximately 70% owned by <a href="Fortis%20Inc.">Fortis Inc.</a>, a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> investor-owned distribution utility, which represented less than 2% of Fortis assets. Fortis took over the management of BEL in 1999, at the invitation of the government of Belize in an attempt to mitigate prior financial problems within the locally managed utility. In addition to its regulated investment in BEL, Fortis owns Belize Electric Company Limited (BECOL), a non-regulated <a href="hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> generation business that operates three hydroelectric generating facilities on the <a href="Macal%20River">Macal River</a>.

On 14 June 2011, the government of Belize nationalized the majority ownership interest of Fortis Inc. in Belize Electricity Ltd. The Belize utility encountered serious financial problems after the country's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in 2008 disallowed "the recovery of previously incurred fuel and purchased power costs in customer rates and set customer rates at a level that does not allow BEL to earn a fair and reasonable return", Fortis said in a June 2011 statement. BEL appealed this judgment to the Court of Appeal; however, a hearing is not expected until 2012. In May 2011, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Belize">Supreme Court of Belize</a> granted BEL's application to prevent the PUC from taking any enforcement actions pending the appeal. The Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry issued a statement saying the government had acted in haste and expressed concern over the message it sent to investors.

In August 2009, the government of Belize nationalized <a href="Belize%20Telemedia%20Limited">Belize Telemedia Limited</a> (BTL), which now competes directly with <a href="Speednet">Speednet</a>. As a result of the nationalisation process, the <a href="interconnection">interconnection</a> agreements are again subject to negotiations. Both BTL and Speednet boast a full range of products and services including basic telephone services, national and international calls, prepaid services, cellular services via GSM 1900 megahertz (MHz) and 3G <a href="CDMA">CDMA</a> 2000 respectively, international cellular roaming, fixed wireless, dial-up and internet, high-speed <a href="Digital%20subscriber%20line">DSL</a>, internet service, and national and international data networks.

Development costs are high, but the government of Belize has made tourism its second development priority after agriculture. In 2012, tourist arrivals totalled 917,869 (with about 584,683 from the United States) and tourist receipts amounted to over $1.3 billion.

Belize's population was 324,528 in 2010. Belize's <a href="total%20fertility%20rate">total fertility rate</a> in 2009 was 3.6 children per woman. Its birth rate was 27.33 births/1,000 population, and the death rate was 5.8 deaths/1,000 population.

The Maya are thought to have been in Belize and the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20region">Yucatán region</a> since the second millennium BC; however, much of Belize's original Maya population was wiped out by conflicts between constantly warring tribes. There were some who died of disease after discovery by Europeans. Three Maya groups now inhabit the country: The <a href="Yucatec">Yucatec</a> (who came from Yucatán, Mexico, to escape the savage <a href="Caste%20War%20of%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Caste War</a> of the 1840s), the <a href="Mopan%20people">Mopan</a> (indigenous to Belize but were forced out to Guatemala by the British for raiding settlements; they returned to Belize to evade enslavement by the Guatemalans in the 19th century), and <a href="Q%27eqchi%27%20people">Q'eqchi'</a> (also fled from slavery in Guatemala in the 19th century). The latter groups are chiefly found in the <a href="Toledo%20District">Toledo District</a>.

Creoles, also known as "Kriols", make up roughly 21% of the Belizean population and about 75% of the <a href="Belizean%20American">diaspora</a>. They are descendants of the Baymen slave owners, and <a href="slavery">slaves</a> brought to Belize for the purpose of the logging industry. These slaves were ultimately of <a href="West%20Africa">West</a> and <a href="Central%20Africa">Central Africa</a>n descent (many also of <a href="Miskito%20people">Miskito</a> ancestry from <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>) and born Africans who had spent very brief periods in Jamaica and <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. <a href="Caracoles">Bay Island</a>ers and ethnic Jamaicans came in the late 19th century, further adding to these already varied peoples, creating this ethnic group.

For all intents and purposes, Creole is an ethnic and linguistic denomination. Some natives, even with blonde hair and blue eyes, may call themselves Creoles. The designation is more racial than cultural, and is evident to physical appearance.

<a href="Belize%20Creole%20English">Belize Creole English</a> or "Kriol" developed during the time of slavery, and historically was only spoken by former slaves. However, this ethnicity has become an integral part of the Belizean identity, and as a result it is now spoken by about 45% of Belizeans. Belizean Creole is derived mainly from English. Its <a href="substratum">substrate languages</a> are the Native American language <a href="Miskito%20language">Miskito</a>, and the various <a href="West%20African">West African</a> and <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu languages</a> brought into the country by slaves. Creoles are found all over Belize, but predominantly in urban areas such as Belize City, coastal towns and villages, and in the Belize River Valley.

The <a href="Garinagu">Garinagu</a> (singular "Garifuna"), at around 4.5% of the population, are a mix of West/Central African, <a href="Arawaks">Arawak</a>, and <a href="Island%20Carib">Island Carib</a> ancestry. Though they were captives removed from their homelands, these people were never documented as slaves. The two prevailing theories are that, in 1635, they were either the survivors of two recorded shipwrecks or somehow took over the ship they came on.

Throughout history they have been incorrectly labelled as <a href="Black%20Caribs">Black Caribs</a>. When the British took over <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a> after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in 1763, they were opposed by French settlers and their Garinagu allies. The Garinagu eventually surrendered to the British in 1796. The British separated the more African-looking Garifunas from the more indigenous-looking ones. 5,000 Garinagu were exiled from the Grenadine island of <a href="Baliceaux">Baliceaux</a>. However, only about 2,500 of them survived the voyage to <a href="Roat%C3%A1n">Roatán</a>, an island off the coast of Honduras. The <a href="Garifuna%20language">Garifuna language</a> belongs to the <a href="Arawakan%20languages">Arawakan language family</a>, but has a large number of loanwords from Carib languages and from English.

Because <a href="Roat%C3%A1n">Roatán</a> was too small and infertile to support their population, the Garinagu petitioned the Spanish authorities of Honduras to be allowed to settle on the mainland coast. The Spanish employed them as soldiers, and they spread along the Caribbean coast of Central America. The Garinagu settled in Seine Bight, <a href="Punta%20Gorda%2C%20Belize">Punta Gorda</a> and Punta Negra, Belize, by way of Honduras as early as 1802. However, in Belize, 19 November 1832 is the date officially recognized as "<a href="Garifuna%20Settlement%20Day">Garifuna Settlement Day</a>" in Dangriga.

According to one genetic study, their ancestry is on average 76% <a href="Sub%20Saharan%20Africa">Sub Saharan Africa</a>n, 20% <a href="Arawak">Arawak</a>/<a href="Island%20Carib">Island Carib</a> and 4% <a href="European%20ethnic%20groups">European</a>.

The Mestizo culture are people of mixed Spanish and Maya descent. They originally came to Belize in 1847, to escape the <a href="Caste%20War%20of%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Caste War</a>, which occurred when thousands of Mayas rose against the state in Yucatán and massacred over one-third of the population. The surviving others fled across the borders into British territory. The Mestizos are found everywhere in Belize but most make their homes in the northern districts of Corozal and Orange Walk. The Mestizos are the largest ethnic group in Belize and make up approximately half of the population. The Mestizo towns centre on a main square, and social life focuses on the Catholic Church built on one side of it. Spanish is the main language of most Mestizos and Spanish descendants, but many speak English and Belize Kriol fluently. Due to the influences of Kriol and English, many Mestizos speak what is known as <a href="Spanglish">"Kitchen Spanish"</a>. The mixture of Latin and Maya foods like tamales, escabeche, chirmole, relleno, and empanadas came from their Mexican side and corn tortillas were handed down by their Mayan side. Music comes mainly from the <a href="marimba">marimba</a>, but they also play and sing with the guitar. Dances performed at village fiestas include the Hog-Head, Zapateados, the Mestizada, Paso Doble and many more.

Some 4% of the population are German-speaking <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a> farmers and craftsmen. The vast majority are so-called <a href="Russian%20Mennonites">Russian Mennonites</a> of German descent who settled in the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> during the 18th and 19th centuries. Most Russian Mennonites live in Mennonite settlements like <a href="Spanish%20Lookout">Spanish Lookout</a>, <a href="Shipyard%2C%20Belize">Shipyard</a>, <a href="Little%20Belize">Little Belize</a>, and Blue Creek. These Mennonites speak <a href="Plautdietsch">Plautdietsch</a> (a <a href="German%20dialects">German dialect</a>) in everyday life, but use mostly <a href="Standard%20German">Standard German</a> for reading (the Bible) and writing. The Plautdietsch-speaking <a href="Mennonites%20in%20Mexico">Mennonites came mostly from Mexico</a> in the years after 1958. There are also some mainly <a href="Pennsylvania%20German">Pennsylvania German</a>-speaking <a href="Old%20Order%20Mennonites">Old Order Mennonites</a> who came from the United States and Canada in the late 1960s. They live primarily in <a href="Upper%20Barton%20Creek">Upper Barton Creek</a> and associated settlements. These Mennonites attracted people from different <a href="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> backgrounds who formed a new community. They look quite similar to <a href="Amish">Old Order Amish</a>, but are different from them.

The remaining 5% or so of the population consist of a mix of <a href="Indians%20in%20Belize">Indians</a>, <a href="Ethnic%20Chinese%20in%20Belize">Chinese</a>, <a href="White%20people">Whites</a> from the United States and Canada, and many other foreign groups brought to assist the country's development. During the 1860s, a large influx of East Indians who spent brief periods in Jamaica and <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> veterans from <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> and other Southern states established <a href="Confederate%20settlements%20in%20British%20Honduras">Confederate settlements in British Honduras</a> and introduced commercial sugar cane production to the colony, establishing 11 settlements in the interior. The 20th century saw the arrival of more Asian settlers from mainland China, South Korea, India, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, and <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. <a href="Said%20Musa">Said Musa</a>, the son of an immigrant from <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, was the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Belize">Prime Minister of Belize</a> from 1998 to 2008. <a href="Central%20American">Central American</a> immigrants and expatriate Americans and Africans also began to settle in the country.

Creoles and other ethnic groups are emigrating mostly to the United States, but also to the United Kingdom and other developed nations for better opportunities. Based on the latest <a href="US%20Census">US Census</a>, the number of Belizeans in the United States is approximately 160,000 (including 70,000 legal residents and naturalized citizens), consisting mainly of Creoles and Garinagu.

Because of conflicts in neighbouring Central American nations, Mestizo <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have fled to Belize in significant numbers during the 1980s, and have been significantly adding to this group. These two events have been changing the demographics of the nation for the last 30 years.

English is the official language of Belize, a former British colony. English is the primary language of public education, government and most media outlets. About half of Belizeans regardless of ethnicity speak an <a href="English-based%20creole">English-based creole</a> called <a href="Belizean%20Creole">Belizean Creole</a> (also referred to as "Kriol") for most informal, social and interethnic dialogue.

When a Creole language exists alongside its <a href="lexifier">lexifier</a> language, as is the case in Belize, a continuum forms between the Creole and the lexifier language. It is therefore difficult to substantiate or differentiate the number of Creole speakers compared to English speakers. Belizean Creole might best be described as the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of the nation.

Approximately 50% of Belizeans self-identify as "Mestizo", "Latino", or "Hispanic" and 30% speak <a href="Belizean%20Spanish">Spanish</a> as a native language. When Belize was a British colony, Spanish was banned in schools but today it is widely taught as a <a href="second%20language">second language</a>. <a href="Spanglish">"Kitchen Spanish"</a> is an intermediate form of Spanish mixed with Belizean Creole, spoken in the northern towns such as Corozal and San Pedro.

Over half the population is <a href="multilingual">multilingual</a>. Being a small, multiethnic state, surrounded by Spanish-speaking nations, multilingualism is strongly encouraged.

Belize is also home to three <a href="Mayan%20languages">Mayan languages</a>: <a href="Q%E2%80%99eqchi%E2%80%99%20language">Q’eqchi’</a>, <a href="Mopan%20language">Mopan</a> (an <a href="endangered%20language">endangered language</a>), and <a href="Yucatec%20Maya%20language">Yucatec Maya</a>.
Approximately 16,100 people speak the <a href="Ta-Arawakan%20languages">Arawakan-based</a> <a href="Garifuna%20language">Garifuna language</a>, and 6,900 Mennonites in Belize speak mainly <a href="Plautdietsch%20language">Plautdietsch</a> while a minority of Mennonites speak <a href="Pennsylvania%20German%20language">Pennsylvania German</a>.

According to the 2010 census, 40.1% of Belizeans are <a href="Roman%20Catholics">Roman Catholics</a>, 31.8% are <a href="Protestants">Protestants</a> (8.4% <a href="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a>; 5.4% <a href="Adventist">Adventist</a>; 4.7% <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>; 3.7% <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a>; 3.6% <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a>; 2.9% <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>; 2.8% <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Nazarene">Nazarene</a>), 1.7% are <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, 10.3% adhere to other religions (<a href="Maya%20religion">Maya religion</a>, <a href="Garifuna%20religion">Garifuna religion</a>, <a href="Obeah">Obeah</a> and <a href="Myalism">Myalism</a>, and minorities of <a href="Mormonism">Mormons</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hindus</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhists</a>, <a href="Islam">Muslims</a>, <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'ís</a>, <a href="Rastafarians">Rastafarians</a> and other) and 15.5% profess to be irreligious.

According to PROLADES, Belize was 64.6% Roman Catholic, 27.8% Protestant, 7.6% Other in 1971. Until the late 1990s, Belize was <a href="History%20of%20Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Belize">a Roman Catholic majority country</a>. Catholics formed 57% of the population in 1991, and dropped to 49% in 2000. The percentage of Roman Catholics in the population has been decreasing in the past few decades due to the growth of Protestant churches, other religions and non-religious people.

In addition to Catholics, there has always been <a href="Protestantism%20in%20Belize">a large accompanying Protestant minority</a>. It was brought by <a href="British%20people">British</a>, <a href="German%20people">German</a>, and other settlers to the British colony of <a href="British%20Honduras">British Honduras</a>. From the beginning, it was largely <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> and <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a> in nature. The Protestant community in Belize experienced a large <a href="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> and <a href="Seventh-Day%20Adventist">Seventh-Day Adventist</a> influx tied to the recent spread of various <a href="Evangelical%20Protestant">Evangelical Protestant</a> denominations throughout <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. Geographically speaking, <a href="Mennonites%20in%20Belize">German Mennonites</a> live mostly in the rural districts of Cayo and Orange Walk.

The <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox Church</a> has a presence in <a href="Santa%20Elena%2C%20Belize">Santa Elena</a>.

The <a href="Association%20of%20Religion%20Data%20Archives">Association of Religion Data Archives</a> estimates there were 7,776 Bahá'ís in Belize in 2005, or 2.5% of the national population. Their estimates suggest this is the highest proportion of Bahá'ís in any country. Their data also states that the Bahá'í Faith is the second most common religion in Belize, followed by Hinduism (2.0%) and Judaism (1.1%). Hinduism is followed by most Indian immigrants. Muslims claim that there have been Muslims in Belize since the 16th century having been brought over from <a href="Africa">Africa</a> as slaves, but there are no sources for that claim. The Muslim population of today started the 1980s. Muslims numbered 243 in 2000 and 577 in 2010 according to the official statistics. and comprise 0.16 percent of the population. A mosque is at the Islamic Mission of Belize (IMB), also known as the Muslim Community of Belize. Another mosque, Masjid Al-Falah, officially opened in 2008 in Belize City.

Belize has a high prevalence of communicable diseases such as <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, respiratory diseases and intestinal illnesses.

A number of kindergartens, secondary, and tertiary schools in Belize provide quality education for students—mostly funded by the government. Belize has about a dozen <a href="List%20of%20universities%20in%20Belize">tertiary level institutions</a>, the most prominent of which is the <a href="University%20of%20Belize">University of Belize</a>, which evolved out of the University College of Belize founded in 1986. Before that <a href="St.%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Belize">St. John's College</a>, founded in 1877, dominated the tertiary education field.

Education in Belize is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years. , the literacy rate in Belize was estimated at 79.7%, one of the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20literacy%20rate">lowest in the Western Hemisphere</a>.

The educational policy is currently following the "Education Sector Strategy 2011–2016", which sets 3 objectives for the years to come: Improving access, quality, and governance of the education system by providing technical and <a href="vocational%20education">vocational education</a> and training.

Belize has relatively high rates of violent crime. The majority of violence in Belize stems from gang activity, which includes trafficking of drugs and persons, protecting drug smuggling routes, and securing territory for drug dealing.

In 2015, 119 murders were recorded in Belize, giving the country a homicide rate of 34 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest in the world, but lower than the neighbouring countries of <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>, <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>, and <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. Compared to the other districts in Belize, <a href="Belize%20District">Belize District</a> (containing Belize City) had the most murders by far compared to all the other districts. In 2015, 55% of the murders occurred in the Belize District. The violence in Belize City (especially the southern part of the city) is largely due to gang warfare.

In 2015, there were 40 reported cases of rape, 214 robberies, 742 burglaries, and 1027 cases of theft.

The Belize Police Department has implemented many protective measures in hopes of decreasing the high number of crimes. These measures include adding more patrols to "hot spots" in the city, obtaining more resources to deal with the predicament, creating the "Do the Right Thing for Youths at Risk" program, creating the Crime Information Hotline, creating the Yabra Citizen Development Committee, an organisation that helps youth, and many other initiatives. The Belize Police Department began an Anti-Crime Christmas campaign targeting criminals; as a result, the crime rates dropped in that month. In 2011, the government established a truce among many major gangs, lowering the murder rate.

Belize's social structure is marked by enduring differences in the distribution of wealth, power, and prestige. Because of the small size of Belize's population and the intimate scale of social relations, the social distance between the rich and the poor, while significant, is nowhere as vast as in other <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>n societies, such as <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>. Belize lacks the violent class and racial conflict that has figured so prominently in the social life of its Central American neighbours.

Political and economic power remain vested in the hands of the local elite, most of whom are either white, light-skinned <a href="Creole%20peoples">Creole</a>, or <a href="Mestizo">Mestizo</a>. The sizable middle group is composed of peoples of different ethnic backgrounds. This middle group does not constitute a unified <a href="social%20class">social class</a>, but rather a number of middle-class and <a href="working-class">working-class</a> groups, loosely oriented around shared dispositions toward education, cultural respectability, and possibilities for upward social mobility. These beliefs and the social practices they engender, help distinguish the middle group from the grass roots majority of the <a href="Belizean%20people">Belizean people</a>.

In 2013, the <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a> ranked Belize 101st out of 135 countries in its <a href="Global%20Gender%20Gap%20Report">Global Gender Gap Report</a>. Of all the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Belize ranked 3rd from last and had the lowest female-to-male ratio for primary school enrollment. In 2013, the <a href="United%20Nations">UN</a> gave Belize a <a href="Gender%20Inequality%20Index">Gender Inequality Index</a> score of 0.435, ranking it 79th out of 148 countries.

, 48.3% of women in Belize participate in the workforce, compared to 81.8% of men. 13.3% of the seats in Belize's <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Belize%29">National Assembly</a> are filled by women.

In Belizean folklore, there are the legends of <a href="Lang%20Bobi%20Suzi">Lang Bobi Suzi</a>, <a href="La%20Llorona">La Llorona</a>, <a href="La%20Sucia">La Sucia</a>, <a href="Tata%20Duende">Tata Duende</a>, <a href="X%27tabai">X'tabai</a>, <a href="Anansi">Anansi</a>, <a href="Xtabay">Xtabay</a>, Sisimite and the <a href="cadejo">cadejo</a>.

Most of the <a href="public%20holidays%20in%20Belize">public holidays in Belize</a> are traditional Commonwealth and <a href="liturgical%20year">Christian holidays</a>, although some are specific to Belizean culture such as <a href="Garifuna%20Settlement%20Day">Garifuna Settlement Day</a> and <a href="Baron%20Bliss%20Day">Baron Bliss Day</a>. In addition, the month of September is considered a <a href="September%20Celebrations%20of%20Belize">special time of national celebration</a>. Besides <a href="Independence%20Day">Independence Day</a> and St. George's Caye Day, Belizeans also celebrate <a href="Carnival">Carnival</a> during September, which typically includes several events spread across multiple days. In some areas of Belize, however, Carnival is celebrated at the traditional time before <a href="Lent">Lent</a> (in February).

Belizean cuisine is an amalgamation of all ethnicity in the nation, and their respectively wide variety of foods. It might best be described as both similar to Mexican/Central American cuisine and Jamaican/Anglo-Caribbean cuisine.

Breakfast typically consists of bread, flour <a href="tortilla">tortilla</a>s, or <a href="fry%20jack">fry jack</a>s that are often homemade. Fry jacks are eaten with various cheeses, <a href="refried%20beans">refried beans</a>, various forms of eggs or cereal, along with powdered milk, coffee, or tea. Midday meals vary, from foods such as rice and beans with or without coconut milk, <a href="tamale">tamale</a>s, <a href="empanadas">"panades"</a> (fried maize shells with beans or fish), and meat pies, <a href="escabeche">escabeche</a> (onion soup), <a href="chimole">chimole</a> (soup), <a href="caldo%20de%20pollo">caldo</a>, stewed chicken and garnaches (fried tortillas with beans, cheese, and sauce) to various constituted dinners featuring some type of rice and beans, meat and salad or coleslaw.

In rural areas, meals are typically more simple than in cities. The Maya use <a href="maize">maize</a>, <a href="bean">bean</a>s, or <a href="Cucurbita">squash</a> for most meals, and the Garifuna are fond of seafood, <a href="cassava">cassava</a> (particularly made into cassava bread or Ereba) and vegetables. The nation abounds with restaurants and fast food establishments selling fairly cheaply. Local fruits are quite common, but raw vegetables from the markets less so. Mealtime is a communion for families and schools and some businesses close at midday for lunch, reopening later in the afternoon. Steak is also common.

<a href="Punta">Punta</a> is a popular genre of <a href="Garifuna%20music">Garifuna music</a> and has become one of the most popular music in Belize. It is distinctly Afro-Caribbean, and is sometimes said to be ready for international popularization like similarly-descended styles (<a href="reggae">reggae</a>, <a href="calypso%20music">calypso</a>, <a href="merengue%20%28music%29">merengue</a>).

<a href="Brukdown">Brukdown</a> is a modern style of Belizean music related to <a href="Calypso%20music">calypso</a>. It evolved out of the music and dance of loggers, especially a form called <a href="buru">buru</a>. <a href="Reggae">Reggae</a>, <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a>, and <a href="Soca%20music">soca</a> imported from <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and the rest of the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, <a href="rapping">rap</a>, <a href="hip-hop">hip-hop</a>, heavy metal and <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> from the United States, are also popular among the youth of Belize.

The major sports in Belize are <a href="association%20football">football</a>, <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, <a href="volleyball">volleyball</a> and <a href="Cycle%20sport">cycling</a>, with smaller followings of <a href="boat%20racing">boat racing</a>, <a href="Sport%20of%20athletics">athletics</a>, <a href="softball">softball</a>, <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a> and <a href="netball">netball</a>. <a href="Fishing">Fishing</a> is also popular in coastal areas of Belize.

The <a href="Cross%20Country%20Cycling%20Classic">Cross Country Cycling Classic</a>, also known as the "cross country" race or the Holy Saturday Cross Country Cycling Classic, is considered one of the most important Belize sports events. This one-day sports event is meant for amateur cyclists but has also gained worldwide popularity. The history of Cross Country Cycling Classic in Belize dates back to the period when <a href="Monrad%20Metzgen">Monrad Metzgen</a> picked up the idea from a small village on the <a href="Northern%20Highway%20%28Belize%29">Northern Highway</a> (now Phillip Goldson Highway). The people from this village used to cover long distances on their bicycles to attend the weekly game of cricket. He improvised on this observation by creating a sporting event on the difficult terrain of the <a href="George%20Price%20Highway">Western Highway</a>, which was then poorly built.

Another major annual sporting event in Belize is the <a href="La%20Ruta%20Maya%20Belize%20River%20Challenge">La Ruta Maya Belize River Challenge</a>, a 4-day <a href="canoe%20marathon">canoe marathon</a> held each year in March. The race runs from <a href="San%20Ignacio%2C%20Belize">San Ignacio</a> to <a href="Belize%20City">Belize City</a>, a distance of .

On Easter day, citizens of Dangriga participate in a yearly fishing tournament. First, second, and third prize are awarded based on a scoring combination of size, species, and number. The tournament is broadcast over local radio stations, and prize money is awarded to the winners.

The <a href="Belize%20national%20basketball%20team">Belize national basketball team</a> is the only national team that has achieved major victories internationally. The team won the 1998 CARICOM Men's Basketball Championship, held at the Civic Center in Belize City, and subsequently participated in the 1999 Centrobasquet Tournament in Havana. The national team finished seventh of eight teams after winning only 1 game despite playing close all the way. In a return engagement at the 2000 CARICOM championship in Barbados, Belize placed fourth. Shortly thereafter, Belize moved to the Central American region and won the Central American Games championship in 2001.

The team has failed to duplicate this success, most recently finishing with a 2 and 4 record in the 2006 COCABA championship. The team finished second in the 2009 COCABA tournament in Cancun, Mexico where it went 3–0 in group play. Belize won its opening match in the Centrobasquet Tournament, 2010, defeating Trinidad and Tobago, but lost badly to Mexico in a rematch of the COCABA final. A tough win over Cuba set Belize in position to advance, but they fell to Puerto Rico in their final match and failed to qualify.

The national flower is the black orchid ("<a href="Prosthechea%20cochleata">Prosthechea cochleata</a>", also known as "Encyclia cochleata"). The national tree is the <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> tree ("<a href="Swietenia%20macrophylla">Swietenia macrophylla</a>"), which inspired the national motto "Sub Umbra Floreo", which means "Under the shade I flourish". The national animal is the <a href="Baird%27s%20tapir">Baird's tapir</a> and the national bird is the keel-billed toucan ("<a href="Ramphastos%20sulphuratus">Ramphastos sulphuratus</a>").

Benin

Benin ( or -; ; ), officially the Republic of Benin () and formerly <a href="Republic%20of%20Dahomey">Dahomey</a>, is a country in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. It is bordered by <a href="Togo">Togo</a> to the west, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> to the east, and <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> and <a href="Niger">Niger</a> to the north. The majority of its population lives on the small southern coastline of the <a href="Bight%20of%20Benin">Bight of Benin</a>, part of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Guinea">Gulf of Guinea</a> in the northernmost tropical portion of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The capital of Benin is <a href="Porto-Novo">Porto-Novo</a>, but the <a href="seat%20of%20government">seat of government</a> is in <a href="Cotonou">Cotonou</a>, the country's largest city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometers and its population in was estimated to be approximately /1e6 round 2 million. Benin is a <a href="tropical">tropical</a> nation, highly dependent on <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, with substantial employment and income arising from <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence farming</a>.

The <a href="official%20language">official language</a> of Benin is <a href="French%20language">French</a>. However, indigenous languages such as <a href="Fon%20language">Fon</a> and <a href="Yoruba%20language">Yoruba</a> are commonly spoken. The largest religious group in Benin is <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a>, followed closely by <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="Vodun">Vodun</a> and <a href="Protestants">Protestantism</a>. Benin is a member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a>, the <a href="Organisation%20of%20Islamic%20Cooperation">Organisation of Islamic Cooperation</a>, the <a href="South%20Atlantic%20Peace%20and%20Cooperation%20Zone">South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone</a>, <a href="Organisation%20internationale%20de%20la%20Francophonie">La Francophonie</a>, the <a href="Community%20of%20Sahel-Saharan%20States">Community of Sahel-Saharan States</a>, the <a href="African%20Petroleum%20Producers%20Association">African Petroleum Producers Association</a> and the <a href="Niger%20Basin%20Authority">Niger Basin Authority</a>.

From the 17th to the 19th century, the main political entities in the area were the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Dahomey">Kingdom of Dahomey</a> along with the city-state of <a href="Porto-Novo">Porto-Novo</a> and a large area with many different tribes to the north. This region was referred to as the <a href="Slave%20Coast">Slave Coast</a> from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of slaves shipped to the New World during the <a href="Trans-Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Trans-Atlantic slave trade</a>. After slavery was abolished, France took over the country and renamed it <a href="French%20Dahomey">French Dahomey</a>. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France, and had a tumultuous period with many different democratic governments, military coups and military governments.

A <a href="Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism">Marxist–Leninist</a> <a href="Sovereign%20state">state</a> called the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Benin">People's Republic of Benin</a> existed between 1975 and 1990. In 1991, it was replaced by the current <a href="Multi-party%20system">multi-party</a> Republic of Benin.

During the colonial period and at independence, the country was <a href="Geographical%20renaming">known as</a> Dahomey. On 30 November 1975 it was renamed to Benin, after the body of water on which the country lies—the <a href="Bight%20of%20Benin">Bight of Benin</a>—which, in turn, had been named after the <a href="Benin%20Empire">Benin Empire</a> (nowadays <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>). The country of Benin has no connection to <a href="Benin%20City">Benin City</a> in modern Nigeria, nor to the <a href="Benin%20bronzes">Benin bronzes</a>. The <a href="Benin%20Empire">form "Benin"</a> is the result of a Portuguese corruption of the city of Ubinu (now Benin City).

The new name, Benin, was chosen for its neutrality. Dahomey was the name of the former <a href="Dahomey">Kingdom of Dahomey</a>, which covered only most of the southern third of the present country and therefore did not represent <a href="Porto-Novo">Porto-Novo</a> (a rival state in the south), the northwestern sector <a href="Atakora%20Department">Atakora</a>, nor the kingdom of <a href="Borgu">Borgu</a>, which covered the northeastern third.

The current country of Benin combines three areas which had different political and ethnic systems prior to French colonial control. Before 1700, there were a few important city states along the coast (primarily of the Aja ethnic group, but also including Yoruba and Gbe peoples) and a mass of tribal regions inland (composed of Bariba, Mahi, Gedevi, and Kabye peoples). The <a href="Oyo%20Empire">Oyo Empire</a>, located primarily to the east of modern Benin, was the most significant large-scale military force in the region and it would regularly conduct raids and exact tribute from the coastal kingdoms and the tribal regions. The situation changed in the 1600s and early 1700s as the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Dahomey">Kingdom of Dahomey</a>, which was of Fon ethnicity, was founded on the <a href="Abomey">Abomey</a> plateau and began taking over areas along the coast. By 1727, king <a href="Agaja">Agaja</a> of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of <a href="Allada">Allada</a> and <a href="Ouidah">Whydah</a>, but it had become a tributary of the Oyo empire and did not directly attack the Oyo allied city-state of <a href="Porto-Novo">Porto-Novo</a>. The rise of the kingdom of Dahomey, the rivalry between the kingdom and the city of Porto-Novo, and the continued tribal politics of the northern region, persisted into the colonial and post-colonial periods.

The <a href="Dahomey">Dahomey Kingdom</a> was known for its culture and traditions. Young boys were often apprenticed to older soldiers, and taught the kingdom's military customs until they were old enough to join the army. Dahomey was also famous for instituting an elite female soldier corps, called <a href="Ahosi">Ahosi</a>, i.e. the king's wives, or Mino, "our mothers" in the Fon language <a href="Fongbe">Fongbe</a>, and known by many Europeans as the Dahomean <a href="Amazons">Amazons</a>. This emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned Dahomey the nickname of "black <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>" from European observers and 19th century explorers like <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Burton">Sir Richard Burton</a>.

The kings of Dahomey sold their war captives into <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">transatlantic slavery</a>; otherwise the captives would have been killed in a ceremony known as the <a href="Annual%20Customs%20of%20Dahomey">Annual Customs</a>. By about 1750, the King of Dahomey was earning an estimated £250,000 per year by selling Africans to the European slave-traders. Though the leaders of Dahomey appeared initially to resist the slave trade, it flourished in the region of Dahomey for almost three hundred years, beginning in 1472 with a trade agreement with <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese</a> merchants, leading to the area's being named "the Slave Coast". Court protocols, which demanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom's many battles be decapitated, decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area. The number went from 102,000 people per decade in the 1780s to 24,000 per decade by the 1860s. The decline was partly due to the <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">banning</a> of the <a href="trans-Atlantic%20slave%20trade">trans-Atlantic slave trade</a> by Britain and other countries. This decline continued until 1885, when the last slave ship departed from the coast of the present-day Benin Republic bound for Brazil, a former Portuguese colony, that had yet to abolish slavery.

The capital's name <a href="Porto-Novo">Porto-Novo</a> is of Portuguese origin, meaning "New Port". It was originally developed as a port for the slave trade.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, Dahomey had begun to lose its status as the regional power. This enabled the French to take over the area in 1892. In 1899, the French included the land called <a href="French%20Dahomey">French Dahomey</a> within the larger <a href="French%20West%20Africa">French West Africa</a> colonial region. In 1958, France granted autonomy to the <a href="Republic%20of%20Dahomey">Republic of Dahomey</a>, and full independence on 1 August 1960. The president who led them to independence was Hubert Maga.

For the next twelve years after 1960, ethnic strife contributed to a period of turbulence. There were several coups and regime changes, with the figures of <a href="Hubert%20Maga">Hubert Maga</a>, <a href="Sourou%20Migan%20Apithy">Sourou Apithy</a>, <a href="Justin%20Ahomadegb%C3%A9">Justin Ahomadegbé</a>, and <a href="Emile%20Derlin%20Zinsou">Emile Derlin Zinsou</a> dominating; the first three each represented a different area and ethnicity of the country. These three agreed to form a <a href="Presidential%20Council%20%28Benin%29">Presidential Council</a> after violence marred the 1970 elections.
On 7 May 1972, Maga ceded power to Ahomadegbe. On 26 October 1972, Lt. Col. <a href="Mathieu%20K%C3%A9r%C3%A9kou">Mathieu Kérékou</a> overthrew the ruling triumvirate, becoming president and stating that the country would not "burden itself by copying foreign <a href="ideology">ideology</a>, and wants neither Capitalism, Communism, nor Socialism". On 30 November 1974 however, he announced that the country was officially <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a>, under control of the Military Council of the Revolution (CNR), which nationalized the petroleum industry and banks. On 30 November 1975, he renamed the country to the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Benin">People's Republic of Benin</a>.

The CNR was dissolved in 1979, and Kérékou arranged <a href="show%20election">show election</a>s where he was the only allowed candidate. Establishing relations with <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>, and <a href="Great%20Socialist%20People%27s%20Libyan%20Arab%20Jamahiriya">Libya</a>, he put nearly all businesses and economic activities under state control, causing foreign investment in Benin to dry up. Kérékou attempted to reorganize education, pushing his own aphorisms such as "Poverty is not a fatality", resulting in a mass <a href="emigration">exodus</a> of teachers, along with a large number of other professionals. The regime financed itself by contracting to take nuclear waste first from the Soviet Union and later from France.

In 1980, Kérékou converted to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> and changed his first name to Ahmed, then changed his name back after claiming to be a <a href="born-again%20Christian">born-again Christian</a>.

In 1989, riots broke out after the regime did not have money to pay its army. The banking system collapsed. Eventually Kérékou renounced <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> and a convention forced Kérékou to release political prisoners and arrange elections. <a href="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a> was also abolished as the nation's form of government.

The country's name was officially changed to the " Republic of Benin" on 1 March 1990, after the newly formed government's <a href="constitution">constitution</a> was complete.
In a 1991 election, Kérékou lost to <a href="Nic%C3%A9phore%20Soglo">Nicéphore Soglo</a>. Kérékou returned to power after winning the 1996 vote. In 2001, a closely fought election resulted in Kérékou winning another term, after which his opponents claimed election irregularities.

In 1999, Kérékou issued a national apology for the substantial role Africans had played in the Atlantic slave trade.

Kérékou and former president Soglo did not run in the 2006 elections, as both were barred by the constitution's restrictions on age and total terms of candidates.

On 5 March 2006, <a href="Beninese%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">an election</a> was held that was considered free and fair. It resulted in a <a href="Two-round%20system">runoff</a> between <a href="Thomas%20Boni%20Yayi">Yayi Boni</a> and <a href="Adrien%20Houngb%C3%A9dji">Adrien Houngbédji</a>. The runoff election was held on 19 March and was won by Boni, who assumed office on 6 April. The success of the fair multi-party elections in Benin won praise internationally. Boni was <a href="Beninese%20presidential%20election%2C%202011">reelected in 2011</a>, taking 53.18% of the vote in the first round—enough to avoid a runoff election, becoming the first president to win an election without a runoff since the restoration of democracy in 1991.

In the <a href="Beninese%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">March 2016 presidential elections</a>, in which Boni Yayi was barred by the constitution from running for a third term, businessman <a href="Patrice%20Talon">Patrice Talon</a> won the second round with 65.37% of the vote, defeating investment banker and former Prime Minister <a href="Lionel%20Zinsou">Lionel Zinsou</a>. Talon was sworn in on 6 April 2016. Speaking on the same day that the Constitutional Court confirmed the results, Talon said that he would "first and foremost tackle constitutional reform", discussing his plan to limit presidents to a single term of five years in order to combat "complacency". He also said that he planned to slash the size of the government from 28 to 16 members.

Benin's politics take place in a framework of a <a href="presidential%20system">presidential</a> <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democratic</a> <a href="republic">republic</a>, where the <a href="President%20of%20Benin">President of Benin</a> is both <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>, within a <a href="multi-party%20system">multi-party system</a>. <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by the government. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested in both the government and the legislature. The <a href="judiciary">judiciary</a> is independent of the executive and the legislature. The political system is derived from the 1990 <a href="Constitution%20of%20Benin">Constitution of Benin</a> and the subsequent transition to <a href="democracy">democracy</a> in 1991.

Benin scored highly in the 2013 <a href="Ibrahim%20Index%20of%20African%20Governance">Ibrahim Index of African Governance</a>, which comprehensively measures the state of governance across the continent. Benin was ranked 18th out of 52 African countries, and scored best in the categories of Safety & Rule of Law and Participation & Human Rights.

In its 2007 Worldwide Press Freedom Index, <a href="Reporters%20Without%20Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a> ranked Benin 53rd out of 169 countries.

Benin has been rated equal-88th out of 159 countries in a 2005 analysis of police, business and political corruption.

Benin is divided into twelve <a href="Department%20%28subnational%20entity%29">department</a>s (French: "départements") which, in turn, are subdivided into 77 <a href="Commune%20%28subnational%20entity%29">communes</a>. In 1999, the previous six departments were each split into two halves, forming the current twelve. The six new departments were assigned official capitals in 2008.

The majority of Benin's population lives in the south. The population is young, with a <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> of 62 years. About 42 African ethnic groups live in this country; these various groups settled in Benin at different times and also migrated within the country. Ethnic groups include the <a href="Yoruba%20people">Yoruba</a> in the southeast (migrated from Nigeria in the 12th century); the <a href="Dendi%20people">Dendi</a> in the north-central area (who came from Mali in the 16th century); the <a href="Bariba%20people">Bariba</a> and the <a href="Fula%20people">Fula</a> (; ) in the northeast; the <a href="Betammaribe">Betammaribe</a> and the <a href="Somba%20people">Somba</a> in the <a href="Atacora%20Range">Atacora Range</a>; the <a href="Fon%20people">Fon</a> in the area around <a href="Abomey">Abomey</a> in the South Central and the <a href="Mina%20people">Mina</a>, <a href="Xueda%20people">Xueda</a>, and <a href="Aja%20people">Aja</a> (who came from Togo) on the coast.

Recent migrations have brought other African nationals to Benin that include Nigerians, Togolese, and Malians. The foreign community also includes many Lebanese and Indians involved in trade and commerce. The personnel of the many European embassies and foreign aid missions and of nongovernmental organizations and various missionary groups account for a large part of the European population. A small part of the European population consists of Beninese citizens of <a href="French%20people">French ancestry</a>, whose ancestors ruled Benin and left after independence.

Benin, a narrow, north–south strip of land in West Africa, lies between latitudes <a href="6th%20parallel%20north">6°</a> and <a href="13th%20parallel%20north">13°N</a>, and longitudes <a href="prime%20meridian">0°</a> and <a href="4th%20meridian%20east">4°E</a>. Benin is bounded by Togo to the west, <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> and <a href="Niger">Niger</a> to the north, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> to the east, and the <a href="Bight%20of%20Benin">Bight of Benin</a> to the south. The distance from the <a href="Niger%20River">Niger River</a> in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the south is about . Although the coastline measures the country measures about at its widest point.
Benin shows little variation in elevation and can be divided into four areas from the south to the north, starting with the low-lying, sandy, coastal plain (highest elevation ) which is, at most, wide. It is marshy and dotted with lakes and lagoons communicating with the ocean. Behind the coast lies the <a href="Guinean%20forest-savanna%20mosaic">Guinean forest-savanna mosaic</a>-covered plateaus of southern Benin (altitude between ), which are split by valleys running north to south along the <a href="Couffo%20River">Couffo</a>, <a href="Zou%20River">Zou</a>, and <a href="Oueme%20River">Oueme River</a>s.

An area of flat lands dotted with rocky hills whose altitude seldom reaches extends around Nikki and Save. A range of mountains extends along the northwest border and into Togo; this is the Atacora, with the highest point, <a href="Mont%20Sokbaro">Mont Sokbaro</a>, at .

Benin has fields of lying fallow, mangroves, and remnants of large sacred forests. In the rest of the country, the savanna is covered with thorny scrubs and dotted with huge <a href="Adansonia%20digitata">baobab</a> trees. Some forests line the banks of rivers. In the north and the northwest of Benin the <a href="W%20National%20Park">Reserve du W du Niger</a> and <a href="Pendjari%20National%20Park">Pendjari National Park</a> attract tourists eager to see elephants, lions, antelopes, hippos, and monkeys. Pendjari National Park together with the bordering Parks <a href="Arli%20National%20Park">Arli</a> and <a href="W%20National%20Park">W</a> in <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> and <a href="Niger">Niger</a> are among the most important strongholds for the endangered <a href="West%20African%20lion">West African lion</a>. With an estimated 356 (range: 246–466) lions, W-Arli-Pendjari harbours the largest remaining population of lions in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. Historically Benin has served as habitat for the endangered <a href="painted%20hunting%20dog">painted hunting dog</a>, "Lycaon pictus"; however, this canid is thought to have been locally <a href="extirpated">extirpated</a>.

Benin's climate is hot and humid. Annual rainfall in the coastal area averages 1300 mm or about 51 inches. Benin has two rainy and two dry seasons per year. The principal rainy season is from April to late July, with a shorter less intense rainy period from late September to November. The main dry season is from December to April, with a short cooler dry season from late July to early September. Temperatures and humidity are high along the tropical coast. In <a href="Cotonou">Cotonou</a>, the average maximum temperature is ; the minimum is .

Variations in temperature increase when moving north through a <a href="savanna">savanna</a> and plateau toward the Sahel. A dry wind from the Sahara called the <a href="Harmattan">Harmattan</a> blows from December to March, during which grass dries up, the vegetation turns reddish brown, and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country, causing the skies to be overcast. It is also the season when farmers burn brush in the fields.

The economy of Benin is dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. <a href="Cotton">Cotton</a> accounts for 40% of GDP and roughly 80% of official export receipts. Growth in real output has averaged around 5% in the past seven years, but rapid population growth has offset much of this increase. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Benin uses the <a href="CFA%20franc">CFA franc</a>, which is pegged to the euro.

Benin’s economy has continued to strengthen over the past years, with real GDP growth estimated at 5.1 and 5.7% in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The main driver of growth is the agricultural sector, with cotton being the country’s main export, while services continue to contribute the largest part of GDP largely because of Benin’s geographical location, enabling trade, transportation, transit and tourism activities with its neighbouring states.
In order to raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. Projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's US$307 million <a href="Millennium%20Challenge%20Account">Millennium Challenge Account</a> grant signed in February 2006.

The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation, with Benin benefiting from a G8 debt reduction announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to increase domestic power production.

Although <a href="trade%20unions%20in%20Benin">trade unions in Benin</a> represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the large informal economy has been noted by the <a href="International%20Trade%20Union%20Confederation">International Trade Union Confederation</a> (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of <a href="child%20labour">child labour</a>, and the continuing issue of <a href="unfree%20labour">forced labour</a>.

Benin is a member of the <a href="Organization%20for%20the%20Harmonization%20of%20Business%20Law%20in%20Africa">Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa</a> (<a href="OHADA">OHADA</a>).

Cotonou has the country's only seaport and <a href="Cadjehoun%20Airport">international airport</a>. A new port is currently under construction between Cotonou and Porto Novo. Benin is connected by two-lane asphalted roads to its neighboring countries (Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria). Mobile telephone service is available across the country through various <a href="Mobile%20Network%20Code">operators</a>. ADSL connections are available in some areas. Benin is connected to the Internet by way of satellite connections (since 1998) and a single submarine cable <a href="SAT-3/WASC%20%28cable%20system%29">SAT-3/WASC</a> (since 2001), keeping the price of data extremely high. Relief is expected with initiation of the <a href="ACE%20%28cable%20system%29">Africa Coast to Europe</a> cable in 2011.

In 2008, about a third of the population lived below the international poverty line of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1.25 per day.

The <a href="literacy">literacy</a> rate in Benin is among the lowest in the world: in 2015 it was estimated to be 38.4% (49.9% for males and 27.3% for females). Benin has achieved universal primary education and half of children (54%) were enrolled in secondary education in 2013, according to the <a href="UNESCO%20Institute%20for%20Statistics">UNESCO Institute for Statistics</a>.

Although at one time the education system was not free, Benin has abolished school fees and is carrying out the recommendations of its 2007 Educational Forum.

The government has devoted more than 4% of GDP to education since 2009. In 2015, public expenditure on education (all levels) amounted to 4.4% of GDP, according to the <a href="UNESCO%20Institute%20for%20Statistics">UNESCO Institute for Statistics</a>. Within this expenditure, Benin devoted quite a large share to tertiary education: 0.97% of GDP.

Between 2009 and 2011, the share of young people enrolled at university rose from 10% to 12% of the 18"–"25 year age cohort, one of the highest ratios in West Africa. Student enrollment in tertiary education more than doubled between 2006 and 2011 from 50,225 to 110,181. These statistics encompass not only bachelor's, master's and PhD programmes but also students enrolled in non-degree post-secondary diplomas.

In Benin, it is the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research which is responsible for implementing science policy. The National Directorate of Scientific and Technological Research handles planning and co-ordination, whereas the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research and National Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters each play an advisory role. Financial support comes from Benin’s National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation. The Benin Agency for the Promotion of Research Results and Technological Innovation carries out technology transfer through the development and dissemination of research results.

The regulatory framework has evolved since 2006 when the country’s first science policy was prepared. This has since been updated and complemented by new texts on science and innovation (the year of adoption is between brackets):
Equally important are Benin’s efforts to integrate science into existing policy documents:
In 2015, Benin's priority areas for scientific research were: health, education, construction and building materials, transportation and trade, culture, tourism and handicrafts, cotton/textiles, food, energy and climate change.

The main challenges facing research and development in Beniny are:

In 2007, Benin counted 1,000 researchers (in head counts). This corresponds to 115 researchers per million inhabitants. The main research structures in Benin are the Centre for Scientific and Technical Research, National Institute of Agricultural Research, National Institute for Training and Research in Education, Office of Geological and Mining Research and the Centre for Entomological Research.

The University of Abomey-Calavi was selected by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> in 2014 to participate in its Centres of Excellence project, owing to its expertise in applied mathematics. Within this project, the World Bank has loaned $8 million to Benin. The Association of African Universities has also received funds to enable it to co-ordinate knowledge-sharing among the 19 universities in West Africa involved in the project.

There are no available data on Benin's level of investment in research and development.

In 2013, the government devoted 2.5% of GDP to public health. In December 2014, 150 volunteer health professionals travelled to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, as part of a joint initiative by the <a href="Economic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) and its specialized agency, the West African Health Organisation, to help combat the epidemic. The Ebola epidemic has been a tragic reminder of the chronic underinvestment in West African health systems.

The Government of Benin devoted less than 5% of GDP to agricultural development in 2010, even though the members of the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a> had agreed to commit at least 10% of GDP to this area in the "Maputo Declaration" of 2003. They reiterated this goal in the "Malabo Declaration" adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'. However, African leaders meeting in Equatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common standard of measurement for the 10% target.

Benin has the third-highest publication intensity for scientific journals in West Africa, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded. There were 25.5 scientific articles per million inhabitants catalogued in this database in 2014. This compares with 65.0 for Gambia,49.6 for Cabo Verde, 23.2 for Senegal and 21.9 for Ghana. The volume of publications in this database tripled in Benin between 2005 and 2014 from 86 to 270. Between 2008 and 2014, Benin's main scientific collaborators were based in France (529 articles), United States (261), United Kingdom (254), Belgium (198) and Germany (156).

<a href="Transport%20in%20Benin">Transport in Benin</a> includes road, rail, water and air transportation. Benin possesses a total of 6,787 km of <a href="highway">highway</a>, of which 1,357 km are paved. Of the paved highways in the country, there are 10 <a href="Controlled-access%20highway">expressways</a>. This leaves 5,430 km of unpaved road. The <a href="Trans%E2%80%93West%20African%20Coastal%20Highway">Trans–West African Coastal Highway</a> crosses Benin, connecting it to <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> to the east, and <a href="Togo">Togo</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> and <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a> to the west. When construction in <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a> and <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> is finished, the highway will continue west to seven other <a href="Economic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) nations. A paved highway also connects Benin northwards to <a href="Niger">Niger</a>, and through that country to <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> and <a href="Mali">Mali</a> to the north-west. <a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20Benin">Rail transport in Benin</a> consists of of <a href="Single%20track%20%28rail%29">single track</a>, railway. Benin does not, at this time, share railway links with adjacent countries – <a href="Transport%20in%20Niger">Niger</a> possesses no railways to connect to, and while the other surrounding countries, <a href="Transport%20in%20Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href="Transport%20in%20Togo">Togo</a> and <a href="Transport%20in%20Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, do have railway networks, no connections have been built. In 2006, an Indian proposal appeared, which aims to link the railways of Benin with Niger and <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>. Benin will be a participant in the <a href="AfricaRail">AfricaRail</a> project.

<a href="Cadjehoun%20Airport">Cadjehoun Airport</a> located at Cotonou, has direct international jet service to <a href="Accra">Accra</a>, Niamey, <a href="Monrovia">Monrovia</a>, <a href="Lagos">Lagos</a>, <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a>, <a href="Lom%C3%A9">Lomé</a>, and <a href="Douala">Douala</a>, as well as other cities in Africa. Direct services also link Cotonou to Paris, Brussels and Istanbul.

The <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> rate in Benin was estimated in 2013 at 1.13% of adults aged 15–49 years. <a href="Malaria">Malaria</a> is a problem in Benin, being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children younger than five years.

During the 1980s, less than 30% of the country's population had access to primary health care services. Benin had one of the highest death rates for children under the age of five in the world. Its <a href="infant%20mortality%20rate">infant mortality rate</a> stood at 203 deaths for every live births. Only one in three mothers had access to child health care services. The <a href="Bamako%20Initiative">Bamako Initiative</a> changed that dramatically by introducing community-based health care reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. , Benin had the 34th highest rate of <a href="maternal%20mortality">maternal mortality</a> in the world. According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 13% of women had undergone <a href="female%20genital%20mutilation">female genital mutilation</a>. A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost. <a href="Demographic%20and%20Health%20Surveys">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> has completed three surveys in Benin since 1996.

Beninese literature had a strong oral tradition long before French became the dominant language. <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Couchoro">Félix Couchoro</a> wrote the first Beninese novel, "<a href="L%27Esclave%20%28Beninese%20novel%29">L'Esclave</a>", in 1929.

Post-independence, the country was home to a vibrant and innovative music scene, where native folk music combined with <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>ian <a href="highlife">highlife</a>, French <a href="cabaret">cabaret</a>, American <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock</a>, <a href="funk">funk</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>, and <a href="Music%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Congolese</a> <a href="African%20Rumba">rumba</a>.

Singer <a href="Ang%C3%A9lique%20Kidjo">Angélique Kidjo</a> and actor <a href="Djimon%20Hounsou">Djimon Hounsou</a> were born in Cotonou, Benin. Composer <a href="Wally%20Badarou">Wally Badarou</a> and singer <a href="Gnonnas%20Pedro">Gnonnas Pedro</a> are also of Beninese descent.

Biennale Benin, continuing the projects of several organizations and artists, started in the country in 2010 as a collaborative event called "Regard Benin". In 2012, the project become a Biennial coordinated by the Consortium, a federation of local associations. The international exhibition and artistic program of the 2012 Biennale Benin are curated by Abdellah Karroum and the Curatorial Delegation.

A number of Beninese artist have received major international recognition, such as <a href="Georges%20Ad%C3%A9agbo">Georges Adéagbo</a>, <a href="Meschac%20Gaba">Meschac Gaba</a>, <a href="Romuald%20Hazoum%C3%A8">Romuald Hazoumè</a>, <a href="Dominique%20Zinkp%C3%A8">Dominique Zinkpè</a> or <a href="Emo%20de%20Medeiros">Emo de Medeiros</a>.

Many Beninese in the south of the country have <a href="Akan%20name">Akan-based names</a> indicating the day of the week on which they were born. This is due to influence of the <a href="Akan%20people">Akan people</a> like the <a href="Akwamu">Akwamu</a> and others.

Local languages are used as the languages of instruction in elementary schools, with French only introduced after several years. In wealthier cities, however, French is usually taught at an earlier age. Beninese languages are generally transcribed with a separate letter for each speech sound (<a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>), rather than using <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>s as in French or <a href="digraph%20%28orthography%29">digraphs</a> as in English. This includes Beninese <a href="Yoruba%20language">Yoruba</a>, which in <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> is written with both diacritics and digraphs. For instance, the <a href="mid%20vowel">mid vowel</a>s written "é è, ô, o" in French are written "" in Beninese languages, whereas the <a href="consonant">consonant</a>s written "ng" and "sh" or "ch" in English are written "ŋ" and "c." However, digraphs are used for <a href="nasal%20vowel">nasal vowel</a>s and the <a href="labial-velar%20consonant">labial-velar consonant</a>s "kp" and "gb," as in the name of the <a href="Fon%20language">Fon language</a> "Fon gbe" , and diacritics are used as <a href="tone%20%28linguistics%29">tone marks</a>. In French-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen.

In the 2002 census, 42.8% of the population of Benin were <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> (27.1% <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, 5% <a href="Celestial%20Church%20of%20Christ">Celestial Church of Christ</a>, 3.2% <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>, 7.5% other Christian denominations), 24.4% were <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>, 17.3% practiced <a href="Vodun">Vodun</a>, 6% practiced other local traditional religions, 1.9% practiced other religions, and 6.5% claimed no religious affiliation.

Traditional religions include local <a href="animism">animistic</a> religions in the <a href="Atakora%20Department">Atakora</a> (Atakora and Donga provinces), and <a href="Vodun">Vodun</a> and <a href="Orisha">Orisha</a> veneration among the Yoruba and Tado peoples in the center and south of the nation. The town of <a href="Ouidah">Ouidah</a> on the central coast is the spiritual center of Beninese Vodun.

The major introduced religions are Christianity, followed throughout the south and center of Benin and in <a href="Otammari">Otammari</a> country in the <a href="Atakora%20Department">Atakora</a>, and Islam, introduced by the <a href="Songhai%20Empire">Songhai Empire</a> and Hausa merchants, and now followed throughout <a href="Alibori">Alibori</a>, <a href="Borgou">Borgou</a> and <a href="Donga%20Department">Donga</a> provinces, as well as among the Yoruba (who also follow Christianity). Many, however, continue to hold Vodun and Orisha beliefs and have incorporated the pantheon of Vodun and Orisha into Christianity. The <a href="Ahmadiyya%20Muslim%20Community">Ahmadiyya Muslim Community</a>, a sect originating in the 19th century, is also present in a significant minority.

Beninese cuisine is known in Africa for its exotic ingredients and flavorful dishes. Beninese cuisine involves fresh meals served with a variety of key sauces. In southern Benin cuisine, the most common ingredient is <a href="Maize">corn</a>, often used to prepare <a href="dough">dough</a> which is mainly served with <a href="peanut">peanut</a>- or <a href="tomato">tomato</a>-based <a href="sauce">sauce</a>s. <a href="Fish">Fish</a> and <a href="chicken">chicken</a> are the most common meats used in southern Beninese cuisine, but <a href="beef">beef</a>, <a href="goat">goat</a>, and <a href="Aethomys">bush rat</a> are also consumed. The main staple in northern Benin is <a href="Yam%20%28vegetable%29">yams</a>, often served with sauces mentioned above. The population in the northern provinces use beef and <a href="pork">pork</a> meat which is fried in palm or peanut oil or cooked in sauces. <a href="Cheese">Cheese</a> is used in some dishes. <a href="Couscous">Couscous</a>, rice, and <a href="bean">bean</a>s are commonly eaten, along with fruits such as <a href="mango">mango</a>es, oranges, avocados, bananas, kiwi fruit, and pineapples.

Meat is usually quite expensive, and meals are generally light on meat and generous on <a href="vegetable%20fat">vegetable fat</a>. Frying in palm or peanut oil is the most common meat preparation, and <a href="smoked%20fish">smoked fish</a> is commonly prepared in Benin. Grinders are used to prepare <a href="Cornmeal">corn flour</a>, which is made into a dough and served with sauces. "Chicken on the spit" is a traditional recipe in which chicken is roasted over fire on wooden sticks. <a href="Arecaceae">Palm</a> roots are sometimes soaked in a jar with saltwater and sliced garlic to tenderize them, then used in dishes. Many people have outdoor mud stoves for cooking.

<a href="Association%20football">Football</a> is generally considered the most popular sport in Benin. However, in the past 5 years, <a href="baseball">baseball</a> has been introduced to the country.

Bermuda

Bermuda () is a <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories">British Overseas Territory</a> in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is approximately east-southeast of <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>; south of <a href="Cape%20Sable%20Island">Cape Sable Island</a>, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>; and north of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. The <a href="capital%20city">capital city</a> is <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Bermuda">Hamilton</a>. Bermuda is an associate member of <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean Community</a> (CARICOM).

The first person known to have reached Bermuda was the <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> sea captain <a href="Juan%20de%20Berm%C3%BAdez">Juan de Bermúdez</a> in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed the islands for the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a>. Bermúdez never landed on the islands, but made two visits to the <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>, of which he created a recognisable map. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription on <a href="Spittal%20Pond%20Nature%20Reserve">Portuguese Rock</a> (previously called Spanish Rock). Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become <a href="feral">feral</a> and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, the English <a href="Virginia%20Company">Virginia Company</a>, which had established <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown</a> in <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Virginia</a> two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of the "<a href="Sea%20Venture">Sea Venture</a>" steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking, then landed ashore.

The island was administered as an extension of Virginia by the Company until 1614. Its <a href="Corporate%20spin-off">spin-off</a>, the <a href="Somers%20Isles%20Company">Somers Isles Company</a>, took over in 1615 and managed the colony until 1684. At that time, the company's charter was revoked, and the <a href="English%20Crown">English Crown</a> took over administration. The islands became a British colony following the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">1707 unification</a> of the parliaments of Scotland and England, which created the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. After 1949, when <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> became part of Canada, Bermuda became the oldest remaining British overseas territory. After the <a href="Transfer%20of%20sovereignty%20over%20Hong%20Kong">return</a> of <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> to China in 1997, Bermuda became the most populous remaining dependent territory (from 2002 overseas territory). Its first capital, <a href="St.%20George%27s%2C%20Bermuda">St. George's</a>, was established in 1612.

Bermuda's economy is based on offshore <a href="insurance">insurance</a> and <a href="reinsurance">reinsurance</a>, and <a href="tourism">tourism</a>, the two largest <a href="economic%20sector">economic sector</a>s. Bermuda had one of the world's highest <a href="GDP%20per%20capita">GDP per capita</a> for most of the 20th century and several years beyond. Recently, its economic status has been affected by the global recession. It has a <a href="Subtropics">subtropical</a> climate. Bermuda is the northernmost point of the <a href="Bermuda%20Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>, a region of sea in which, according to <a href="legend">legend</a>, a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances. The island is in the <a href="hurricane%20belt">hurricane belt</a> and prone to related severe weather; however, it is somewhat protected by a coral reef that surrounds the island and its position at the north of the belt, which limits the direction and severity of approaching storms.

Bermuda is a group of low-forming volcanoes in the Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the <a href="Sargasso%20Sea">Sargasso Sea</a>, roughly 578 <a href="nautical%20miles">nautical miles</a> () east-southeast of <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a> on the <a href="Outer%20Banks">Outer Banks</a> of <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> and about 594 nautical miles () southeast of <a href="Martha%27s%20Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a> of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. It is 898 nautical miles () northeast of <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, and 667 nautical miles () from <a href="Cape%20Sable%20Island">Cape Sable Island</a>, in <a href="Nova%20Scotia%2C%20Canada">Nova Scotia</a>, Canada. The islands lie due east of <a href="Fripp%20Island">Fripp Island</a>, <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, west-northwest of <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>, southeast of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, north-northwest of <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> and north of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>.

The archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the <a href="caldera">caldera</a> of a submarine volcano that forms a <a href="seamount">seamount</a>. The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic and the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>. The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and in the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles.

It has of coastline. The two <a href="Corporation">incorporated</a> <a href="Municipal%20government">municipalities</a> in Bermuda are the <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Bermuda">City of Hamilton</a> and the <a href="St.%20George%2C%20Bermuda">Town of St George</a>. Bermuda is divided into nine parishes, which have some localities called villages, such as <a href="Flatts%20Village%2C%20Bermuda">Flatts Village</a> and <a href="Somerset%20Village%2C%20Bermuda">Somerset Village</a>.

Although usually referred to in the singular, the territory consists of 181 islands, with a total area of . The largest island is Main Island, sometimes called Bermuda. Eight of the larger islands are connected by bridges, and are the populated islands. Compiling a list of the islands is often complicated, as many have more than one name (as does the entire archipelago, which has also been known historically as La Garza, Virgineola, and the Isle of Devils. Somers Isles is often rendered "Somers Islands", or mistaken for "Summer Isles").

Despite the small land mass, place names are repeated: two islands named Long Island, three bays named Long Bay (on Somerset, Main, and Cooper's islands), two Horseshoe Bays (one in Southampton, on the Main Island, the other at Morgan's Point, formerly Tucker's Island), two roads through cuttings called Khyber Pass, one in Warwick, the other in St. George's Parish, and two <a href="St.%20George%27s%2C%20Bermuda">St George's Town</a>s on <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Island%2C%20Bermuda">St George's Island</a> in <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Parish%2C%20Bermuda">St George's Parish</a>, each known as St George's. There is a <a href="Hamilton%20Parish%2C%20Bermuda">Hamilton Parish</a> in addition to the City of Hamilton in <a href="Pembroke%20Parish%2C%20Bermuda">Pembroke Parish</a>.

Bermuda is divided into nine <a href="Parish%20%28administrative%20division%29">parishes</a> and two incorporated <a href="municipalities">municipalities</a>.

Bermuda's nine parishes are:

Bermuda's two incorporated municipalities are:

Bermuda's two informal villages are:

Jones Village in Warwick, Cashew City (St. George's), Claytown (Hamilton), Middle Town (Pembroke), and <a href="Tucker%27s%20Town">Tucker's Town</a> (St. George's) are neighbourhoods; Dandy Town and North Village are sports clubs, and Harbour View Village is a small <a href="public%20housing">public housing</a> development.

Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, <a href="cerulean">cerulean</a> blue ocean waters are popular with tourists. Many of Bermuda's few hotels are located along the south shore of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a designated <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>. <a href="Scuba%20diving">Scuba</a> divers can explore numerous <a href="shipwreck">wrecks</a> and <a href="coral%20reefs">coral reefs</a> in relatively shallow water (typically in depth), with virtually unlimited visibility. Many nearby reefs are readily accessible from shore by <a href="snorkelling">snorkellers</a>, especially at <a href="Church%20Bay%2C%20Bermuda">Church Bay</a>.

Bermuda's most popular visitor attraction is the Royal Naval Dockyard, which includes the Bermuda Maritime Museum. Other attractions include the <a href="Bermuda%20Aquarium%2C%20Museum%20and%20Zoo">Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo</a>, Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute, the Botanical Gardens and <a href="Masterworks%20Museum%20of%20Bermuda%20Art">Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art</a>, lighthouses, and the Crystal Caves with <a href="stalactites">stalactites</a> and underground saltwater pools. Admiralty House is another nice attraction where locals and visitors enjoy cliff diving into the beautiful blue water and where you are able to see Dockyard in the distance.

It is not possible to rent a car on the island; public transport and taxis are available or visitors can hire <a href="Scooter%20%28motorcycle%29">scooters</a> for use as private transport.

Bermuda has a <a href="humid%20subtropical%20climate">humid subtropical climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a> "Cfa"). Bermuda is warmed by the nearby <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, and low latitude. The islands may experience modestly cooler temperatures in January, February, and March (average . There has never been snow, a frost or freeze on record in Bermuda.

Summertime <a href="heat%20index">heat index</a> in Bermuda can be high, although mid-August temperatures rarely exceed . The highest recorded temperature was in August 1989.

Bermuda is in the <a href="tropical%20cyclone">hurricane belt</a>. Along the Gulf Stream, it is often directly in the path of hurricanes recurving in the westerlies, although they usually begin to weaken as they approach Bermuda, whose small size means that direct <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfalls</a> of hurricanes are rare. The most recent hurricanes to cause significant damage to Bermuda were <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">category 2</a> <a href="Hurricane%20Gonzalo">Hurricane Gonzalo</a> on 18 October 2014 and <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">category 3</a> <a href="Hurricane%20Nicole">Hurricane Nicole</a> on 14 October 2016, both of which struck the island directly. Before that, <a href="Hurricane%20Fabian">Hurricane Fabian</a> on 5 September 2003 was the last major hurricane to hit Bermuda directly.

The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall, which is collected on roofs and catchments (or drawn from underground lenses) and stored in tanks. Each dwelling usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation. The law requires that each household collect rainwater that is piped down from the roof of each house. Average monthly rainfall is highest in October, at over 6 inches, and lowest in April and May.

The average annual temperature of the Atlantic Ocean around Bermuda is , from in February to in August.

Bermuda is on the same parallel as the <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> archipelago <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> a few time zones farther east in the Atlantic. The two archipelagos are the only land in the Atlantic on the <a href="32nd%20parallel%20north">32nd parallel north</a>.

When discovered, Bermuda was uninhabited and mostly dominated by forests of <a href="Juniperus%20bermudiana">Bermuda cedar</a>, with <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es along its shores. Only 165 of the island's current 1,000 <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a> species are considered <a href="indigenous%20%28ecology%29">native</a>. Of those, 15, including the eponymous cedar, are <a href="endemism">endemic</a>.

Settlers have introduced many species of palm trees to Bermuda. <a href="Coconut">Coconut palms</a> are found on Bermuda, making it the northernmost location for the natural growth of this species. However, the climate is usually too cool to allow the palms to properly set fruit.

The only <a href="Indigenous%20%28ecology%29">indigenous</a> <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s of Bermuda are five species of bats, all of which are also found in the eastern United States: "<a href="Lasionycteris%20noctivagans">Lasionycteris noctivagans</a>", "<a href="Lasiurus%20borealis">Lasiurus borealis</a>", "<a href="Lasiurus%20cinereus">Lasiurus cinereus</a>", "<a href="Lasiurus%20seminolus">Lasiurus seminolus</a>" and "<a href="Perimyotis%20subflavus">Perimyotis subflavus</a>". Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda include its national bird, the <a href="Bermuda%20petrel">Bermuda petrel</a> or cahow. It was rediscovered in 1951 after having been thought extinct since the 1620s. It is important as an example of a <a href="Lazarus%20taxon">Lazarus</a> species. The government has a programme to protect it, including restoration of a habitat area. The <a href="Bermuda%20rock%20skink">Bermuda rock skink</a> was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda, discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches. Recently through genetic DNA studies, scientists have discovered that a species of <a href="turtle">turtle</a>, the <a href="diamondback%20terrapin">diamondback terrapin</a>, previously thought to have been introduced, pre-dated the arrival of humans in the archipelago. As this species spends most of its time in brackish ponds, some question whether it should be classified as a land vertebrate to compete with the skink's unique status.

Bermuda's 2010 Census put Bermuda's population at 64,237 and, with an area of , it has a calculated population density of 1207/km².

The racial makeup of Bermuda as recorded by the 2010 census, was 54% black, 31% white, 8% multiracial, 4% Asian, and 4% other races, although these numbers are based on self-identification, and the majority of those who answered "black" have any mixture of black, white and indigenous American ancestry. Native-born Bermudians made up 67% of the population, compared to 29% non-natives.
The island experienced large-scale immigration over the 20th century, especially after the Second World War. Bermuda has a diverse population including both those with relatively deep roots in Bermuda extending back for centuries, and newer communities whose ancestry results from recent immigration, especially from Britain, North America, the West Indies, and the <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20Portugal">Portuguese Atlantic islands</a> (especially the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>), although these groups are steadily merging. About 46% of the population identified themselves with Bermudian ancestry in 2010, which was a decrease from the 51% who did so in the 2000 census. Those identifying with British ancestry dropped by 1% to 11% (although those born in Britain remain the largest non-native group at 3,942 persons). The number of people born in Canada declined by 13%. Those who reported West Indian ancestry were 13%. The number of people born in the West Indies actually increased by 538. A significant segment of the population is of <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> ancestry (10%), the result of immigration over the past 160 years, of whom 79% have residency status.

The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by <a href="Privateer%23Bermudian%20privateers">Bermudian privateers</a>, and Native Americans, primarily from the <a href="Algonquian%20peoples">Algonquian</a> and other tribes of the <a href="Atlantic%20seaboard">Atlantic seaboard</a>, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, "coloured" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as "coloured" are today described as "black", or "of African heritage", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as "coloured" who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies.

Bermuda's modern black population contains more than one demographic group. Although the number of residents born in Africa is very small, it has tripled between 2000 and 2010 (this group also includes non-blacks). The majority of blacks in Bermuda can be termed "Bermudian blacks", whose ancestry dates back centuries between the 17th century and the end of slavery in 1834, Bermuda's black population was self-sustaining, with its growth resulting largely from natural expansion. This contrasts to the enslaved blacks of the plantation colonies, who were subjected to conditions so harsh as to drop their birth rate below the death rate, and slaveholders in the West Indies found it necessary to continue importing more enslaved blacks from Africa until the end of slavery (the same had been true for the Native Americans that the Africans had replaced on the New World plantations). The indigenous populations of many West Indian islands, and much of the South-East of what is now the United States that had survived the 16th- and 17th-century epidemics of European-introduced diseases then became the victims of large-scale slave raiding, with much of the region completely depopulated. When the supply of indigenous slaves ran out, the slaveholders looked to Africa. The ancestry of Bermuda's black population is distinguished from that of the British West Indian black population in two ways: firstly, the higher degree of European and Native American admixture; secondly, the source of the African ancestry.

In the British West Indian islands (and also in the United States), the majority of enslaved blacks brought across the Atlantic came from West Africa (roughly between modern Senegal and Ghana). Very little of Bermuda's original black emigration came from this area. The first blacks to arrive in Bermuda in any numbers were free blacks from Spanish-speaking areas of the West Indies, and most of the remainder were recently enslaved Africans captured from the Spanish and Portuguese. As Spain and Portugal sourced most of their slaves from South-West Africa (the Portuguese through ports in modern-day Angola; the Spanish purchased most of their African slaves from Portuguese traders, and from Arabs whose slave trading was centred in Zanzibar). Genetic studies have consequently shown that the African ancestry of black Bermudians (other than those resulting from recent immigration from the British West Indian islands) is largely from a band across southern Africa, from Angola to Mozambique, which is similar to what is revealed in Latin America, but distinctly different from the blacks of the West Indies and the United States.

Most of Bermuda's black population trace some of their ancestry to Native Americans, although awareness of this is largely limited to <a href="St.%20David%27s%20Island%2C%20Bermuda">St David's Islanders</a> and most who have such ancestry are unaware of it. During the colonial period, hundreds of Native Americans were shipped to Bermuda. The best-known examples were the <a href="Algonquian%20peoples">Algonquian peoples</a> who were exiled from the southern <a href="New%20England">New England</a> colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th century, notably in the aftermaths of the <a href="Pequot%20War">Pequot</a> and <a href="King%20Philip%27s%20War">King Philip's</a> wars.

Today several thousand <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a> workers, principally from Britain, Canada, the West Indies, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and the US, reside in Bermuda. They are primarily engaged in specialised professions such as accounting, finance, and insurance. Others are employed in various trades, such as hotels, restaurants, construction, and landscaping services. Of the total workforce of 38,947 persons in 2005, government employment figures stated that 11,223 (29%) were non-Bermudians.

The predominant language on Bermuda is <a href="Bermudian%20English">Bermudian English</a>. It exhibits characteristics of British, West Indian, and American English. Perhaps most interesting is its closeness to <a href="acrolect">acrolect</a>al English compared to other varieties in the West Indies.

<a href="British%20English">British English</a> spellings and conventions are used in print media and formal written communications.

<a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> is also spoken in Bermuda; this is owing to immigration from <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, particularly from the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>.

Protestant 46.2% (includes Anglican 15.8%, African Methodist Episcopal 8.6%, Seventh Day Adventist 6.7, Pentecostal 3.5%, Methodist 2.7%, Presbyterian 2.0%, Church of God 1.6%, Baptist 1.2%, Salvation Army 1.1%, Brethren 1.0%, other Protestant 2.0%), Roman Catholic 14.5%, Jehovah's Witness 1.3%, other Christian 9.1%, Muslim 1%, other 3.9%, none 17.8%, unspecified 6.2% (2010 est.).

Bermuda's culture is a mixture of the various sources of its population: Native American, Spanish-Caribbean, English, Irish, and Scots cultures were evident in the 17th century, and became part of the dominant British culture. English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>, though also from <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> and the <a href="Cape%20Verde%20Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a>), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with <a href="African%20diaspora">Afro-Caribbean</a> ones.

A second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.

The first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was "<a href="Mary%20Prince%23Publication%20of%20The%20History%20of%20Mary%20Prince">The History of Mary Prince</a>", a <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a> by <a href="Mary%20Prince">Mary Prince</a>. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. <a href="Graham%20Ingham">Ernest Graham Ingham</a>, an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist <a href="Brian%20Burland">Brian Burland</a> (1931– 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, <a href="Angela%20Barry">Angela Barry</a> has won critical recognition for her published fiction.

Bermuda's proximity to the United States, as well as its origin as part of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, means that many aspects of US culture are reflected in, or incorporated into, Bermudian culture. Many non-Bermudian writers have also made Bermuda their home, or have had homes here, including <a href="A.%20J.%20Cronin">A. J. Cronin</a> and <a href="F.%20Van%20Wyck%20Mason">F. Van Wyck Mason</a>, who wrote on Bermudian subjects.

Actors such as <a href="Ernest%20Trimingham">Ernest Trimingham</a>, <a href="Oona%20O%27Neill">Oona O'Neill</a>, <a href="Earl%20Cameron%20%28actor%29">Earl Cameron</a>, <a href="Diana%20Dill">Diana Dill</a>, <a href="Lena%20Headey">Lena Headey</a>, <a href="Will%20Kempe%20%28actor%29">Will Kempe</a>, and most famously, <a href="Michael%20Douglas">Michael Douglas</a> and <a href="Catherine%20Zeta-Jones">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, grew up here or have lived here as adults. Other native or resident film and television figures in Bermuda include producer <a href="Arthur%20Rankin%2C%20Jr.">Arthur Rankin, Jr.</a>, and <a href="Michael%20Frith">Michael Frith</a>; an author and puppeteer most well known for his work on the <a href="The%20Muppets%20%28franchise%29">Muppets franchise</a>.

West Indian musicians introduced <a href="calypso%20music">calypso music</a> when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. While calypso appealed more to the visitors than to the locals, <a href="reggae">reggae</a> has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of <a href="Jamaicans">Jamaican</a> immigrants.

Bermuda's early literature consisted of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the island. These included <a href="John%20Smith%20%28explorer%29">John Smith's</a> "<a href="The%20Generall%20Historie%20of%20Virginia%2C%20New-England%2C%20and%20the%20Summer%20Isles">The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles</a>" (1624), and <a href="Edmund%20Waller">Edmund Waller</a>'s poem, "Battle of the Summer Islands" (1645).

<a href="Music%20of%20Bermuda">Music</a> and dance are important in Bermuda. Noted musicians have included local icons <a href="The%20Talbot%20Brothers%20of%20Bermuda">The Talbot Brothers</a>, who performed for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the "<a href="Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">Ed Sullivan Show</a>"; jazz pianist <a href="Lance%20Hayward">Lance Hayward</a>, singer-songwriter <a href="Heather%20Nova">Heather Nova</a> and her brother <a href="Mishka%20%28musician%29">Mishka</a>; <a href="tenor">tenor</a> <a href="Gary%20Burgess">Gary Burgess</a>, classical musician and conductor <a href="Kenneth%20Amis">Kenneth Amis</a> and, more recently, dancehall artist <a href="Collie%20Buddz">Collie Buddz</a>.

Bermuda is the only placename in the New World specifically mentioned in the works of <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, in "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>" in Act 1, Scene 2, line 230: "the still-vexed Bermoothes".

The dances of the colourful <a href="Gombey">Gombey</a> dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001 they performed in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Folklife%20Festival">Smithsonian Folklife Festival</a> on the Mall (see photo).

Bermudian <a href="Gina%20Swainson">Gina Swainson</a> was crowned "<a href="Miss%20World">Miss World</a>" in 1979.

Bermuda hosts an annual international film festival, which shows many independent films. One of the founders is film producer and director <a href="Arthur%20Rankin%2C%20Jr.">Arthur Rankin, Jr.</a>, co-founder of the <a href="Rankin/Bass">Rankin/Bass</a> production company.

Bermuda watercolours painted by local artists are sold at various galleries. Hand-carved cedar sculptures are another speciality. One such sculpture, created by Bermudian sculptor Chesley Trott, is installed at the airport's baggage claim area. In 2010, his sculpture "The Arrival" was unveiled near the bay to commemorate the freeing of slaves from the American brig "<a href="Enterprise%20%28slave%20ship%29">Enterprise</a>" in 1835. Local artwork may also be viewed at several galleries around the island. <a href="Alfred%20Birdsey">Alfred Birdsey</a> was one of the more famous and talented watercolourists; his impressionistic landscapes of <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Bermuda">Hamilton</a>, <a href="St.%20George%27s%2C%20Bermuda">St George's</a> and the surrounding sailboats, homes, and bays of Bermuda are world-renowned.

Local resident Tom Butterfield founded the <a href="Masterworks%20Museum%20of%20Bermuda%20Art">Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art</a> in 1986, initially featuring works about Bermuda by artists from other countries. He began with pieces by American artists, such as <a href="Winslow%20Homer">Winslow Homer</a>, <a href="Charles%20Demuth">Charles Demuth</a>, and <a href="Georgia%20O%27Keeffe">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>, who had lived and worked here. He has increasingly supported the development of local artists, arts education, and the arts scene. In 2008, the museum opened its new building, constructed within the Botanic Gardens.

Bermuda was discovered in 1503 by Spanish explorer <a href="Juan%20de%20Berm%C3%BAdez">Juan de Bermúdez</a>. It is mentioned in "Legatio Babylonica", published in 1511 by historian <a href="Pedro%20M%C3%A1rtir">Pedro Mártir de Anglería</a>, and was also included on Spanish charts of that year. Both Spanish and Portuguese ships used the islands as a replenishment spot to take on fresh meat and water. Legends arose of <a href="spirit">spirit</a>s and devils, now thought to have stemmed from the calls of raucous birds (most likely the <a href="Bermuda%20petrel">Bermuda petrel</a>, or "cahow") and the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs. Combined with the frequent storm-wracked conditions and the dangerous reefs, the archipelago became known as the Isle of Devils. Neither Spain nor Portugal attempted to settle it.

For the next century, the island is believed to have been visited frequently, but not settled. After the failure of the first two English colonies in Virginia, a more determined effort was initiated by King <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I of England</a>, who granted a Royal Charter to the <a href="Virginia%20Company">Virginia Company</a>.

It established a colony at <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown, Virginia</a>, in 1607. Two years later, a <a href="flotilla">flotilla</a> of seven ships left England under the Company's Admiral, Sir <a href="George%20Somers">George Somers</a>, and the new Governor of Jamestown, Sir <a href="Thomas%20Gates%20%28governor%29">Thomas Gates</a>, with several hundred settlers, food and supplies to relieve the colony of Jamestown. Somers had previous experience sailing with both Sir <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a> and Sir <a href="Walter%20Raleigh">Walter Raleigh</a>. The flotilla was broken up by a storm. As the flagship, the "<a href="Sea%20Venture">Sea Venture</a>", was taking on water, Somers drove it onto Bermuda's reef and gained the shores safely with smaller boats – all 150 passengers and a dog survived. (<a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play "<a href="The%20Tempest%20%28play%29">The Tempest</a>", in which the character <a href="Ariel%20%28The%20Tempest%29">Ariel</a> refers to the "still-vex'd Bermoothes" (I.ii.229), is thought to have been inspired by <a href="William%20Strachey">William Strachey</a>'s account of this shipwreck.) They stayed 10 months, starting a new settlement and building two small ships to sail to Jamestown. The group of islands were claimed for the English Crown, and the charter of the Virginia Company was later extended to include them.

In 1610, all but three of the survivors of the "Sea Venture" sailed on to Jamestown. Among them was <a href="John%20Rolfe">John Rolfe</a>, whose wife and child died and were buried in Bermuda. Later in Jamestown he married <a href="Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a>, a daughter of the powerful <a href="Chief%20Powhatan">Powhatan</a>, leader of a large confederation of about 30 <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian</a>-speaking tribes in coastal Virginia. In 1612, the English began intentional settlement of Bermuda with the arrival of the ship "Plough." St. George's was settled that year and designated as Bermuda's first capital. It is the oldest continually inhabited English town in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>.

In 1615, the colony was passed to a new company, the <a href="Somers%20Isles%20Company">Somers Isles Company</a>, named after the admiral who saved his passengers from the "Sea Venture". Many Virginian place names refer to the archipelago, such as Bermuda City, and <a href="Bermuda%20Hundred%2C%20Virginia">Bermuda Hundred</a>. The first English coins to circulate in North America were struck in Bermuda.

Because of its limited land area, Bermuda has had difficulty with over-population. In the first two centuries of settlement, it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population manageable. Before the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American Revolution</a> more than ten thousand Bermudians (over half of the total population through the years) gradually emigrated, primarily to the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern United States</a>. As Great Britain displaced Spain as the dominant European imperial power, it opened up more land for colonial development. A steady trickle of outward migration continued. With seafaring the only real industry in the early decades, by the end of the 18th century, at least a third of the island's manpower was at sea at any one time.

The archipelago's limited land area and resources led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>. In 1616 and 1620 acts were passed banning the hunting of certain birds and young tortoises.

In 1649, the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> was in its seventh year and King <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> was beheaded in Whitehall, London. In Bermuda, related tensions resulted in civil war on the island; it was ended by militias. The majority of colonists developed a strong sense of devotion to the Crown. Dissenters, such as <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>s and <a href="Independent%20%28religion%29">Independents</a>, were pushed to settle <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a> under <a href="William%20Sayle">William Sayle</a>. Bermuda and Virginia, as well as Antigua and Barbados were, however, the subjects of an Act of the <a href="Rump%20Parliament">Rump Parliament</a> which was essentially a declaration of war. An Act prohibiting Trade with Barbados, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego, specified that:
"due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.
All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprised. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath."
The Royalist colonies were also threatened with invasion. The Government of Bermuda eventually reached an agreement with the Parliamentarians in England which left the status quo in Bermuda.

In the 17th century, the Somers Isles Company suppressed shipbuilding, as it needed Bermudians to farm in order for it to generate income from the land. Agricultural production met with limited success, however, due to limited areas available for cultivation, high alkilinity of the soil, and the depletion of the soil quality that resulted from excessive farming. The Bermuda cedar boxes used to ship tobacco to England were reportedly worth more than their contents. The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the Company's charter in 1684, and the Company was dissolved.

Bermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper ("<a href="Juniperus%20bermudiana">Juniperus bermudiana</a>", called "Bermuda cedar") trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the <a href="Turks%20Islands">Turks Islands</a>, Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century.

Bermudian sailors and merchants relied on more than the export of salt, however. They vigorously pursued whaling, <a href="privateering">privateering</a>, and the merchant trade. Vessels sailed the normal shipping routes, but were required to engage an enemy vessel no matter the size or strength. As a result, many ships were destroyed.

The <a href="Bermuda%20sloop">Bermuda sloop</a> became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. The Bermuda sloop carried despatches of the victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Trafalgar</a>, and news of the death of <a href="Admiral%20Lord%20Nelson">Admiral Nelson</a>, to England.

<a href="American%20Revolution">American independence</a> led to great changes for Bermuda. Prior to the war, with no useful landmass or natural resources, Bermuda was largely ignored and left to its own devices by the London government. By being so deeply involved in trade, Bermuda merchants and financiers had played roles out of proportion to the colony's size in relation to the development of the Triangle Trade, and the trans-Atlantic English and British empires.

Its people were settlers and founders of new colonies, especially in the American South. Its merchant fleet and a web of expatriate Bermudian merchants dominated trade through a number of American <a href="Atlantic%20Seaboard">Atlantic Seaboard</a> ports and the West Indies. Bermudians fished for cod on the <a href="Grand%20Banks">Grand Banks</a> off <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, and were involved in the lumber industry in <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. Most importantly, they dominated the North American salt trade with "de facto" control of the <a href="Turks%20Islands">Turks Islands</a>.

The close economic, family, and historical ties ensured Bermudians were strongly sympathetic with the rebels at the start of the War. They supplied the rebels illegally with ships, salt and gunpowder. As the war progressed, economic realities caused Bermudians to seize opportunities; they turned to privateering against the Americans.

The end of the war, however, was to cause profound change in Bermuda, though some of those changes would take decades to crystallise. Following the war, with the buildup of Naval and military forces in Bermuda, the primary leg of the Bermudian economy became defence infrastructure. Even after tourism began later in the 19th century, Bermuda remained, in the eyes of London, a base more than a colony. The Crown strengthened its political and economic ties to Bermuda, and the colony's independence on the world stage was diminished.

The war had removed Bermuda's primary trading partners, the American colonies, from the empire, and dealt a harsh blow to Bermuda's merchant shipping trade. This also suffered due to the deforestation of Bermuda, as well as the advent of metal ships and steam propulsion, for which it did not have raw materials. During the course of the following <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, the primary market for Bermuda's salt disappeared as the Americans developed their own sources. Control of the Turks had passed to the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> in 1819.

By the end of the 19th century, except for naval and military facilities, Bermuda was considered a quiet, rustic backwater. It had been superseded in the development of the English-speaking Atlantic world.

After the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> began improving the harbours. In 1811, it started building the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Dockyard%2C%20Bermuda">large dockyard</a> on <a href="Ireland%20Island%2C%20Bermuda">Ireland Island</a>, in the west of the chain, to serve as its principal naval base guarding the western Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. To guard it, the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> built up a large <a href="Bermuda%20Garrison">Bermuda Garrison</a>, and heavily fortified the archipelago.

During the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> between Britain and the United States, the British attacks on <a href="Burning%20of%20Washington">Washington, D.C. and the Chesapeake</a> were planned and launched from Bermuda, where the headquarters of the Royal Navy's North American Station had recently been moved from <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>.
In 1816, James Arnold, the son of <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>, fortified Bermuda's Royal Naval Dockyard against possible US attacks. Today, the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Bermuda">National Museum of Bermuda</a>, which incorporates Bermuda's Maritime Museum, occupies the <a href="Keep">Keep</a> of the Royal Naval Dockyard, including the Commissioner's House, and exhibits artifacts of the base's military history.

As a result of Bermuda's proximity to the southeastern US coast, during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> <a href="Confederate%20States">Confederate States</a> <a href="Blockade%20runners%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">blockade runners</a> frequently used it as a stopping point base for runs to and from the Southern states or England to evade Union naval vessels on blockade patrol, delivering much needed war goods from England and for transporting much needed cotton back to England. The old Globe Hotel in St George's, which was a centre of intrigue for Confederate agents, is preserved as a public museum.

During the <a href="Anglo-Boer%20War">Anglo-Boer War</a> (1899–1902), 5,000 <a href="Boer">Boer</a> <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> were housed on five islands of Bermuda. They were located according to their views of the war. "Bitterenders" (Afrikaans: <a href="Bittereinder">Bittereinder</a>s), who refused to pledge allegiance to the British Crown, were interned on Darrell's Island and closely guarded. Other islands such as Morgan's Island held 884 men, including 27 officers; Tucker's Island held 809 Boer prisoners, Burt's Island 607, and Port's Island held 35.

"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported an attempted mutiny by Boer prisoners of war en route to Bermuda and that martial law was enacted on Darrell's Island, in addition to the escape of three Boer prisoners to mainland Bermuda, a young Boer soldier stowed away and sailed from Bermuda to New York on the steamship "Trinidad."

The most famous escapee was the Boer prisoner of war Captain <a href="Fritz%20Joubert%20Duquesne">Fritz Joubert Duquesne</a> who was serving a life sentence for "conspiracy against the British government and on (the charge of) espionage.". On the night of 25 June 1902, Duquesne slipped out of his tent, worked his way over a barbed-wire fence, swam 1.5 miles (2.4 km) past patrol boats and bright spot lights, through storm-wracked, using the distant <a href="Gibbs%20Hill%20Lighthouse">Gibbs Hill Lighthouse</a> for navigation until he arrived ashore on the main island. From there he escaped to the port of <a href="St.%20George%27s%2C%20Bermuda">St. George's</a> and a week later, he stowed away on a boat heading to Baltimore, Maryland. He settled in the US and later became a spy for Germany in both World Wars. He claimed to be responsible for the 1916 death of Lord <a href="Horatio%20Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Herbert Kitchener</a> in the sinking of <a href="HMS%20Hampshire%20%281903%29">HMS Hampshire</a>, the head of the British Army who had also commanded British forces in South Africa during the second Boer War, but this had resulted from a mine. In 1942, Col. Duquesne was arrested by the <a href="FBI">FBI</a> for leading the <a href="Duquesne%20Spy%20Ring">Duquesne Spy Ring</a>, which still to this day the largest espionage case in the history of the United States.

Lord Kitchener's brother, Lt. Gen. Sir <a href="Frederick%20Walter%20Kitchener">Walter Kitchener</a>, had been the <a href="Governor%20of%20Bermuda">Governor of Bermuda</a> from 1908 until his death in 1912. His son, Major Hal Kitchener, bought <a href="Hinson%27s%20Island%2C%20Bermuda">Hinson's Island</a> (with his partner, Major Hemming, another First World War aviator). The island had formerly been part of the Boer POW camp, housing teenaged prisoners from 1901 to 1902.

In the early 20th century, as modern transport and communication systems developed, Bermuda became a popular destination for American, Canadian and British tourists arriving by sea. The United States 1930 <a href="Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley%20Tariff%20Act">Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act</a> enacted protective tariffs. It cut off Bermuda's once-thriving agricultural export trade to the US and encouraged its development of tourism as an alternative.

After several failed attempts, in 1930 the first aeroplane reached Bermuda. A <a href="Stinson%20Detroiter">Stinson Detroiter</a> seaplane flying from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, it had to land twice in the ocean: once because of darkness and again to refuel. Navigation and weather forecasting improved in 1933 when the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (then responsible for providing equipment and personnel for the Royal Navy's <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a>) established a station at the Royal Naval Dockyard to repair (and supply replacement) float planes for the fleet. In 1936 <a href="Deutsche%20Luft%20Hansa">Luft Hansa</a> began to experiment with seaplane flights from <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> via the Azores with continuation to New York City.

In 1937, <a href="Imperial%20Airways">Imperial Airways</a> and <a href="Pan%20American%20World%20Airways">Pan American World Airways</a> began operating scheduled flying-boat airline services from New York and <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> to <a href="Darrell%27s%20Island%2C%20Bermuda">Darrell's Island, Bermuda</a>. In 1948, regularly scheduled commercial airline service by land-based aeroplanes began to <a href="Kindley%20Air%20Force%20Base">Kindley Field</a> (now <a href="L.F.%20Wade%20International%20Airport">L.F. Wade International Airport</a>), helping tourism to reach its peak in the 1960s–1970s. By the end of the 1970s, international business had supplanted tourism as the dominant sector of Bermuda's economy (see <a href="%23Economy">Economy of Bermuda</a>).

The Royal Naval Dockyard, and the attendant military garrison, continued to be important to Bermuda's economy until the mid-20th century. In addition to considerable building work, the armed forces needed to source food and other materials from local vendors. Beginning in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, US military installations also were located in Bermuda (see "Military" section below and <a href="Military%20of%20Bermuda">Military of Bermuda</a>).

Universal adult suffrage and the development of a two-party political system occurred in the 1960s. Before universal suffrage, adopted as part of Bermuda's Constitution in 1967, voting was dependent on a certain level of property ownership. (see "Politics" section, below, and <a href="Politics%20of%20Bermuda">Politics of Bermuda</a>). On 10 March 1973, the Governor of Bermuda <a href="Richard%20Sharples">Richard Sharples</a> was assassinated by local <a href="Black%20Power">Black Power</a> militants during a period of civil unrest.

The current ruling party in Bermuda is the <a href="Progressive%20Labour%20Party%20%28Bermuda%29">Progressive Labour party</a>, commonly referred to as the PLP. They were voted into power in July 2017 after Bermuda was ruled by the <a href="One%20Bermuda%20Alliance">One Bermuda Alliance</a> (OBA) for 5 years, from 2012 to 2017. David Burt is currently (2017) the Premier of Bermuda replacing Michael Dunkley who led the OBA.

Executive authority in Bermuda is vested in <a href="Elizabeth%20II">the monarch</a> and is exercised on her behalf by the <a href="Governor%20of%20Bermuda">Governor</a>. The governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the <a href="British%20Government">British Government</a>. The current governor is <a href="John%20Rankin%20%28diplomat%29">John Rankin</a>; he was sworn in on 5 December 2016. There is also a Deputy Governor (currently David Arkley <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">JP</a>). Defence and foreign affairs are carried out by the United Kingdom, which also retains responsibility to ensure good government. It must approve any changes to the Constitution of Bermuda. Bermuda is classified as a British Overseas Territory, but it is the oldest British colony. In 1620, a Royal Assent granted Bermuda limited self-governance; its <a href="Parliament%20of%20Bermuda">Parliament</a> is the fifth oldest in the world, behind the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="Tynwald">Tynwald</a> of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, the <a href="Althing">Althing</a> of <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, and <a href="Sejm%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland">Sejm</a> of Poland.

The Constitution of Bermuda came into force on 1 June 1967; it was amended in 1989 and 2003. The head of government is the <a href="Premier%20of%20Bermuda">premier</a>. A cabinet is nominated by the premier and appointed officially by the governor. The legislative branch consists of a <a href="bicameral%20parliament">bicameral parliament</a> modelled on the <a href="Westminster%20system">Westminster system</a>. The <a href="Senate%20of%20Bermuda">Senate</a> is the upper house, consisting of 11 members appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier and the leader of the opposition. The <a href="House%20of%20Assembly%20of%20Bermuda">House of Assembly</a>, or lower house, has 36 members, elected by the eligible voting populace in secret ballot to represent geographically defined constituencies.

<a href="Elections%20in%20Bermuda">Elections</a> must be called at no more than five-year intervals. The <a href="Bermudian%20general%20election%2C%202012">most recent</a> took place on 17 December 2012. Following this election, the <a href="One%20Bermuda%20Alliance">One Bermuda Alliance</a> took power, with <a href="Craig%20Cannonier">Craig Cannonier</a> succeeding <a href="Paula%20Cox">Paula Cox</a>, of the <a href="Progressive%20Labour%20Party%20%28Bermuda%29">Progressive Labour Party</a>, as <a href="List%20of%20Premiers%20of%20Bermuda">Premier</a>.

There are few accredited diplomats in Bermuda. The United States maintains the largest diplomatic mission in Bermuda, comprising both the United States Consulate and the <a href="US%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection">US Customs and Border Protection</a> Services at the <a href="L.F.%20Wade%20International%20Airport">L.F. Wade International Airport</a>. The current US Consul General is Robert Settje, who took office in August 2012. The United States is Bermuda's largest trading partner (providing over 71% of total imports, 85% of tourist visitors, and an estimated $163 billion of US capital in the Bermuda insurance/re-insurance industry), and an estimated 5% of Bermuda residents are US citizens, representing 14% of all foreign-born persons. The American diplomatic presence is an important element in the Bermuda political landscape.

As a British Overseas Territory, Bermuda does not have a seat in the <a href="General%20Assembly%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">United Nations</a>; it is represented by Britain in matters of <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">foreign affairs</a>. To promote its economic interests abroad, Bermuda maintains representative offices in cities such as London and <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>

Bermuda's proximity to the US had made it attractive as the site for summit conferences between British Prime Ministers and US Presidents. The first summit was held in December 1953, at the insistence of Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, to discuss relations with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. Participants included Churchill, US President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and French Premier <a href="Joseph%20Laniel">Joseph Laniel</a>.

In 1957, a second summit conference was held. The British Prime Minister, <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>, arrived earlier than President Eisenhower, to demonstrate they were meeting on British territory, as tensions were still high regarding the previous year's conflict over the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. Macmillan returned in 1961 for the third summit with President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. The meeting was called to discuss Cold War tensions arising from construction of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>.

The most recent summit conference in Bermuda between the two powers occurred in 1990, when British Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> met US President <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a>.

Direct meetings between the President of the United States and the <a href="Premier%20of%20Bermuda">Premier of Bermuda</a> have been rare. The most recent meeting was on 23 June 2008, between Premier <a href="Ewart%20Brown">Ewart Brown</a> and President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>. Prior to this, the leaders of Bermuda and the United States had not met at the White House since a 1996 meeting between Premier David Saul and President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>.

Bermuda has also joined several other nations in efforts to protect the <a href="Sargasso%20Sea">Sargasso Sea</a>.

On 11 June 2009, four <a href="Uyghur%20people">Uyghurs</a> who had been held in the United States <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay%20detention%20camp">Guantánamo Bay detention camp</a>, in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, were transferred to Bermuda. The four men were among 22 Uyghurs who claimed to be refugees, who were captured in 2001 in Pakistan after fleeing the <a href="American%20aerial%20bombardment%20of%20Afghanistan">American aerial bombardment of Afghanistan</a>. They were accused of training to assist the <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a>'s military. They were cleared as safe for release from Guantánamo in 2005 or 2006, but US domestic law prohibited deporting them back to China, their country of citizenship, because the US government determined that China was <a href="human%20rights%20in%20China">likely to violate</a> their human rights.

In September 2008, the men were cleared of all suspicion and Judge Ricardo Urbina in Washington ordered their release. Congressional opposition to their admittance to the United States was very strong and the US failed to find a home for them until Bermuda and <a href="Palau">Palau</a> agreed to accept the 22 men in June 2009.

The secret bilateral discussions that led to prisoner transfers between the US and the devolved Bermuda government sparked diplomatic ire from the United Kingdom, which was not consulted on the move despite Bermuda being a British territory. The British Foreign Office issued the following statement:
We've underlined to the Bermuda Government that they should have consulted with the United Kingdom as to whether this falls within their competence or is a security issue, for which the Bermuda Government do not have delegated responsibility. We have made clear to the Bermuda Government the need for a security assessment, which we are now helping them to carry out, and we will decide on further steps as appropriate.

As of May 2013, the four Uyghurs still lived in Bermuda; but they have not been given Bermudian status and remain stateless, posing problems for emergency medical situations and finding certain jobs. However, granting them Bermudian status would require a change in Bermudian laws, and the issue has prompted a major debate within Bermuda's parliament on what steps should be taken.

Bermuda became an associate member of the <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean Community</a> (CARICOM) in 2003 despite not being in the Caribbean region.

This is a <a href="socio-economic">socio-economic</a> bloc of nations in or near the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>. Other outlying member states include the Co-operative Republic of <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a> and the Republic of <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a> in South America, along with <a href="Belize">Belize</a> in Central America. The <a href="Turks%20and%20Caicos%20Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>, an associate member of CARICOM, and the Commonwealth of <a href="The%20Bahamas">The Bahamas</a>, a full member of CARICOM, are in the Atlantic, but near to the Caribbean. Other nearby nations or territories, such as the United States, are not members (although the US Commonwealth of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> has <a href="observer%20status">observer status</a>, and the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a> announced in 2007 they would seek ties with CARICOM). Bermuda, at roughly a thousand miles from the Caribbean Sea, has little trade with, and little economically in common with, the region, and joined primarily to strengthen cultural links.

Among some scholars, "the Caribbean" can be a socio-historical category, commonly referring to a cultural zone characterised by the legacy of slavery (a characteristic Bermuda shared with the Caribbean and the US) and the plantation system (which did not exist in Bermuda). It embraces the islands and parts of the neighbouring continent, and may be extended to include the Caribbean Diaspora overseas.

Bermuda was colonised by the English as an extension of Virginia and has long had close ties with the US Atlantic Seaboard and Canadian Maritimes as well as the UK. It had a history of African slavery, although Britain abolished it decades before the US. Since the 20th century, there has been considerable immigration to Bermuda from the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, as well as continued immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands. Unlike immigrants from British colonies in the West Indies, the latter immigrants have had greater difficulty in becoming permanent residents as they lacked British citizenship, mostly spoke no English, and required renewal of work permits to remain beyond an initial period. From the 1950s onwards, Bermuda relaxed its immigration laws, allowing increased immigration from Britain and Canada. Some Black politicians accused the government of using this device to counter the West Indian immigration of previous decades.

The PLP, the party in government when the decision to join CARICOM was made, has been dominated for decades by West Indians and their descendants. (The prominent roles of West Indians among Bermuda's black politicians and labour activists predated party politics in Bermuda, as exemplified by Dr. <a href="E.%20F.%20Gordon">E. F. Gordon</a>). The late PLP leader, Dame <a href="Lois%20Browne-Evans">Lois Browne-Evans</a>, and her <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidadian</a>-born husband, John Evans (who co-founded the "West Indian Association of Bermuda" in 1976), were prominent members of this group. They have emphasised Bermuda's cultural connections with the West Indies. Many Bermudians, both black and white, who lack family connections to the West Indies have objected to this emphasis.

Opinion polls conducted by Bermudian newspapers, "The Royal Gazette" and "The Bermuda Sun", showed clear majorities of Bermudians to be opposed to joining CARICOM. The UBP, which had been in Government from 1968 to 1998, objected that joining CARICOM was detrimental to Bermuda's interests:

Once known as "the Gibraltar of the West" and "Fortress Bermuda", Bermuda today is defended by forces of the British government. For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to <a href="privateering">privateering</a> at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local militia. After the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised <a href="Bermuda%20Volunteer/Territorial%20Army%20Units%201895-1965">volunteer units</a> to form a reserve for the <a href="Bermuda%20Garrison">military garrison</a>.
Due to its isolated location in the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic Ocean</a>, Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both <a href="world%20war">world war</a>s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> were operating <a href="Seaplane">Seaplane</a> bases on Bermuda.

In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return. In September 1940, as part of the <a href="Destroyers%20for%20Bases%20Agreement">Destroyers for Bases Agreement</a>, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and <a href="Dominion%20of%20Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%2C%20Bermuda%2C%201939-1945">Darrell's Island</a> in 1943).

Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> transport and refuelling aircraft and by <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first <a href="Kriegsmarine">German</a> and, later, <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet</a>. The principal installation, <a href="Kindley%20Air%20Force%20Base">Kindley Air Force Base</a> on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Bermuda">Naval Air Station Bermuda</a>. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and <a href="Canadian%20Forces">Canadian Forces</a> aircraft.

The original <a href="NAS%20Bermuda">NAS Bermuda</a> on the west side of the island, a <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, <a href="US%20Coast%20Guard">US Coast Guard</a> and <a href="NATO">NATO</a> vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as Naval Facility Bermuda (NAVFAC Bermuda), a <a href="SOSUS">SOSUS</a> station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

Canada, which had operated a war-time naval base, <a href="HMCS%20Somers%20Isles">HMCS "Somers Isles"</a>, on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.

In the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, <a href="HMS%20Malabar%20%28shore%20establishment%29">HMS Malabar</a>, continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.
Bermudians served in the British armed forces during both <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and World War II. After the latter, Major-General <a href="Glyn%20Gilbert">Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert</a>, Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral <a href="James%20Gambier%2C%201st%20Baron%20Gambier">Lord Gambier</a>, and Bermudian-born <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to Brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Anzio">Anzio landings</a>, Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The <a href="Cenotaph">Cenotaph</a> in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual <a href="Remembrance%20Day">Remembrance Day</a> commemoration.

Today, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than <a href="Bermuda%20Sea%20Cadet%20Corps">naval</a> and army cadet corps, is the <a href="Bermuda%20Regiment">Bermuda Regiment</a>, an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.

In 1970 the country switched its currency from the <a href="Bermudian%20pound">Bermudian pound</a> to the <a href="Bermudian%20dollar">Bermudian dollar</a>, which is <a href="Fixed%20exchange%20rate">pegged</a> at par with the US dollar. US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes; however, banks levy an exchange rate fee for the purchase of US dollars with Bermudian dollars. Bermudian notes carry the image of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the issuing authority for all banknotes and coins, and regulates financial institutions. The Royal Naval Dockyard Museum holds a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes and coins.

According to the Bermuda Government's Economic Statistics Division, Bermuda's <a href="Gross%20Domestic%20Product">GDP</a> was $5.85 billion in 2007, or $91,477 per capita, giving Bermuda the highest GDP per capita in the world.

The affordability of housing became a prominent issue during Bermuda's business peak in 2005 but has softened with the decline of Bermuda's real estate prices. The <a href="CIA">CIA</a> <a href="World%20Factbook">World Factbook</a> lists the average cost of a house in June 2003 as $976,000, while real estate agencies have claimed that this figure had risen to between $1.6 million and $1.845 million by 2007, though such high figures have been disputed.

Bermuda is an <a href="offshore%20financial%20centre">offshore financial centre</a>, which results from its minimal standards of business regulation/laws and direct <a href="taxation">taxation</a> on personal or corporate income. It has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system. Bermuda's consumption tax is equivalent to local income tax to local residents and funds government and infrastructure expenditures. The local tax system depends upon import duties, payroll taxes and <a href="consumption%20tax">consumption tax</a>es. The legal system is derived from that of the United Kingdom, with recourse to English courts of final appeal. Foreign private individuals cannot easily open bank accounts or subscribe to mobile phone or internet services.

Having no corporate income tax, Bermuda is a popular <a href="Tax%20haven">tax avoidance location</a>. Google, for example, is known to have shifted over $10 billion in revenue to its Bermuda subsidiary utilising the "<a href="Double%20Irish%20arrangement">Double Irish</a>" and "Dutch Sandwich" tax avoidance strategies, reducing its 2011 tax liability by $2 billion.

Government employment, off-shore business, and tourism are the largest sectors of Bermuda's economy. However, in September 2009, the Irish press reported that a growing number of companies were moving from Bermuda to Ireland as part of a search for "a more stable environment".
Large numbers of leading international insurance companies operate in Bermuda. Those internationally owned and operated businesses that are physically based in Bermuda (around four hundred) are represented by the Association of Bermuda International Companies (ABIC). In total, over 15,000 exempted or international companies are currently registered with the <a href="Registrar%20of%20Companies">Registrar of Companies</a> in Bermuda, most of which hold no office space or employees.

There are four hundred securities listed on the stock exchange, of which almost three hundred are offshore funds and alternative investment structures attracted by Bermuda's regulatory environment. The Exchange specialises in listing and trading of capital market instruments such as equities, debt issues, funds (including hedge fund structures) and depository receipt programmes. The BSX is a full member of the <a href="World%20Federation%20of%20Exchanges">World Federation of Exchanges</a> and is located in an <a href="OECD">OECD</a> member nation. It also has Approved Stock Exchange status under Australia's Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) taxation rules and Designated Investment Exchange status by the UK's Financial Services Authority.

Four banks operate in Bermuda, having consolidated total assets of $24.3 billion (March 2014).

Tourism is Bermuda's second-largest industry, with the island attracting over half a million visitors annually, of whom more than 80% are from the United States. Other significant sources of visitors are from Canada and the United Kingdom. Tourists arrive either by cruise ship or by air at <a href="L.F.%20Wade%20International%20Airport">L.F. Wade International Airport</a>, the only airport on the island.

Healthcare is another industry where expats are able to find employment relatively easily. Physicians, registered nurses, imaging technologists and healthcare managers and coders are in high demand for a small country and all pay decent salaries in excess of $100k US/year.

The Bermuda Education Act 1996 requires that only three categories of schools can operate in the Bermuda Education system:

<a href="Warwick%20Academy">Warwick Academy</a> was established in 1662 and is in the parish of Warwick.

Prior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated. When the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formerly maintained "white" schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools. The rest became part of the public school system and were either aided or maintained.

At present there are 26 schools in the Bermuda Public School System, 18 of which are primary schools, five are middle schools, two senior schools (<a href="The%20Berkeley%20Institute">The Berkeley Institute</a> and <a href="Cedarbridge%20Academy">Cedarbridge Academy</a>) and one special school. An Alternative Programme is provided for students with behavioural challenges who cannot function in the public mainstream. There is one aided primary school, two aided middle schools, and one aided senior school.

For higher education, the <a href="Bermuda%20College">Bermuda College</a> offers various <a href="associate%20degrees">associate degrees</a> and other certificate programmes. Bermuda does not have any four-year colleges or universities. Bermuda's graduates attend four year Universities in the United States, Canada, or England.

In May 2009, Bermudian Government's application was approved to become a contributory member of the <a href="University%20of%20the%20West%20Indies">University of the West Indies</a> (UWI). Bermuda's membership enabled Bermudian students to enter the University at an agreed upon subsidised rate by 2010. UWI also agreed that their Open Campus (online degree courses) would become open to Bermudian students in the future, with Bermuda becoming the 13th country to have access to the Open Campus.

The <a href="Bermuda%20Hospitals%20Board">Bermuda Hospitals Board</a> operates the <a href="King%20Edward%20VII%20Memorial%20Hospital">King Edward VII Memorial Hospital</a>, located in <a href="Paget%20Parish">Paget Parish</a>, and the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Wellness%20Institute">Mid-Atlantic Wellness Institute</a>, located in <a href="Devonshire%20Parish">Devonshire Parish</a>. Boston's Lahey Medical Center has an established visiting specialists program on the island which provides Bermudians and expats with access to specialists regularly on the island.

Unlike other countries that are a part of the British Colonies, Bermuda does not have <a href="National%20health%20insurance">national healthcare</a>. Employees must provide a healthcare plan and pay 50% of the cost.
Having healthcare is mandatory and even with help from employers is expensive, though no more expensive than that which an employee in the US would typically pay for healthcare when obtained through their employer and the coverage typically far exceeds that which one may have through their employer in the US. There are only a few approved health care providers that offer insurance to Bermudians. In 2016 these were the Bermudan government's Health Insurance Department, three other approved licensed health insurance companies, and three approved health insurance schemes (provided by the Bermudan government for its employees and by two banks).:

Bermuda uses the <a href="ICD-9">ICD-9</a> diagnostic coding system. It plans, however, to switch to the more comprehensive <a href="ICD-10">ICD-10</a> system to align with the US (which switched in 2015), since Bermudan residents most commonly obtain overseas healthcare there. Bermuda does not have <a href="Stark%20Law">Stark</a> laws nor do they have self-referral guidelines or anti-kickback laws. The lack of regulation in healthcare, specifically with billing and reimbursement, makes healthcare in Bermuda quite lucrative for physicians and owners of medical/healthcare practices.

Many sports popular today were formalised by British <a href="Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Public schools</a> and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the <a href="British%20empire">British empire</a>, and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players.

The professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including cricket, <a href="Association%20football">football</a>, <a href="rugby%20football">rugby football</a>, and even <a href="Lawn%20tennis">tennis</a> and <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29">rowing</a> (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to <a href="Yacht%20racing">sail racing</a>, founding the <a href="Royal%20Bermuda%20Yacht%20Club">Royal Bermuda Yacht Club</a>). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.

<a href="Bermuda%20national%20cricket%20team">Bermuda's national cricket team</a> participated in the <a href="Cricket%20World%20Cup%202007">Cricket World Cup 2007</a> in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a police officer named <a href="Dwayne%20Leverock">Dwayne Leverock</a>. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a <a href="One-Day%20International">One-Day International</a> (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well-known is <a href="David%20Hemp">David Hemp</a>, a former captain of <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a> in <a href="List%20of%20current%20first-class%20cricket%20teams%23England%20and%20Wales">English first class cricket</a>. The annual "Cup Match" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark "forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery". The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the "St. George's Garrison" (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Dockyard%2C%20Bermuda">Royal Naval Dockyard</a> at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).

In 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th <a href="PGA%20Grand%20Slam%20of%20Golf">PGA Grand Slam of Golf</a>. This 36-hole event was held on 16–17 October 2007, at the <a href="Mid%20Ocean%20Club">Mid Ocean Club</a> in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the <a href="Masters%20Tournament">Masters</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29">U.S. Open</a>, <a href="The%20Open%20Championship">British Open</a> and <a href="PGA%20Championship">PGA Championship</a>. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009. Bermudian Quinn Talbot was once the World one-armed golf champion.
The Government announced in 2006 that it would provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and <a href="Bermuda%20national%20football%20team">football</a> teams. Among Bermuda's most prominent footballers are <a href="Clyde%20Best">Clyde Best</a>, <a href="Shaun%20Goater">Shaun Goater</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Lightbourne">Kyle Lightbourne</a>, <a href="Reggie%20Lambe">Reggie Lambe</a>, <a href="Sam%20Nusum">Sam Nusum</a> and <a href="Nahki%20Wells">Nahki Wells</a>. In 2006, the <a href="Bermuda%20Hogges">Bermuda Hogges</a> were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the <a href="United%20Soccer%20Leagues%20Second%20Division">United Soccer Leagues Second Division</a> but folded in 2013.

<a href="Sailing">Sailing</a>, <a href="fishing">fishing</a> and <a href="Equestrianism">equestrian</a> sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious <a href="Bermuda%20Race">Newport–Bermuda Yacht Race</a> is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a> and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial <a href="Marion%2C%20Massachusetts">Marion</a>-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the <a href="Bermuda%20Fitted%20Dinghy">Bermuda Fitted Dinghy</a>. <a href="International%20One%20Design">International One Design</a> racing also originated in Bermuda. In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the <a href="2017%20America%27s%20Cup">2017 America's Cup</a> was announced.

At the <a href="Bermuda%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a>, Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events. In those Olympics, Bermuda's Katura Horton-Perinchief made history by becoming the first black female diver to compete in the Olympic Games. Bermuda has had one Olympic medallist, <a href="Clarence%20Hill%20%28boxer%29">Clarence Hill</a>, who won a bronze medal in boxing. Bermuda also competed in Men's <a href="Skeleton%20%28sport%29">Skeleton</a> at the <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy. Patrick Singleton placed 19th, with a final time of 1:59.81. <a href="Jillian%20Teceira">Jillian Teceira</a> competed in the Beijing Olympics in 2008. It is tradition for Bermuda to march in the Opening Ceremony in <a href="Bermuda%20shorts">Bermuda shorts</a>, regardless of the summer or winter Olympic celebration. Bermuda also competes in the biennial <a href="Island%20Games">Island Games</a>, which it hosted in 2013.

Bermuda has developed a proud <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> community. The Bermuda Rugby Union team won the 2011 Caribbean championships, defeating Guyana in the final. They previously beat The Bahamas and <a href="Mexico%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Mexico</a> to take the crown. Rugby 7's is also played, with four rounds scheduled to take place in the 2011–2012 season. The Bermuda 7's team competed in the 2011 Las Vegas 7's, defeating the <a href="Mexico%20national%20rugby%20sevens%20team">Mexican</a> team. There are four clubs on the island: (1) Police (2) Mariners (3) Teachers (4) Renegades. There is a men's and women's competition–current league champions are Police (Men) (winning the title for the first time since the 1990s) and Renegades (women's). Games are currently played at Warwick Academy. Bermuda u/19 team won the 2010 Caribbean Championships.

The <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> held <a href="Spring%20Training">Spring Training</a> in Bermuda in 1913. Yankee owner <a href="Frank%20J.%20Farrell">Frank J. Farrell</a> was said to be so pleased with the experience that he considered moving the Yankee training camp to Bermuda permanently.

In 1998, Bermuda established its own Basketball Association. Since then, its <a href="Bermuda%20national%20basketball%20team">national team</a> has taken advantage of Bermuda's advanced basketball facilities and competed at the <a href="Caribbean%20Basketball%20Championship">Caribbean Basketball Championship</a> where it beat competitors with multiple times its population.

Bolivia

Bolivia (; ; ; ; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia (), is a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a> located in western-central <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. It is bordered to the north and east by <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, to the southeast by <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, to the south by <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, to the southwest by <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, and to the northwest by <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. One-third of the country is the <a href="Andes">Andean</a> mountain range.

The largest city and principal economic and financial center is <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20la%20Sierra">Santa Cruz de la Sierra</a>, located on the <a href="Llanos%20Orientales">Llanos Orientales</a> (Tropical lowlands) mostly flat region in the East of Bolivia. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>) that lie outside <a href="Afro-Eurasia">Afro-Eurasia</a>. Bolivia is geographically the largest <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a> in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, but remains a relatively small country in economic and military terms.

Before Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the <a href="Inca%20Empire">Inca Empire</a>, while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish "<a href="conquistadors">conquistadors</a>" arriving from <a href="Cuzco">Cuzco</a> and <a href="Asunci%C3%B3n">Asunción</a> took control of the region in the 16th century. During the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish colonial period</a> Bolivia was administered by the <a href="Royal%20Audiencia%20of%20Charcas">Royal Audiencia of Charcas</a>. Spain built its empire in great part upon the silver that was extracted from <a href="Mining%20in%20Bolivia">Bolivia's mines</a>.

After the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Simón Bolívar</a>, on 6 August 1825. Since independence, Bolivia has endured periods of political and economic instability, including the loss of various peripheral territories to its neighbors, such as <a href="Acre%20%28state%29">Acre</a> and parts of the <a href="Gran%20Chaco">Gran Chaco</a>. It has been landlocked since the annexation of its <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a> coast territory by Chile following the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> (1879–84), but agreements with neighboring countries have granted it indirect access to the Pacific and <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> oceans.

The country's population, estimated at 11 million, is <a href="multiethnic">multiethnic</a>, including <a href="Amerindians">Amerindians</a>, <a href="Mestizo">Mestizo</a>s, <a href="Europeans">Europeans</a>, <a href="Asian%20people">Asian</a>s and <a href="Africans">Africans</a>. The <a href="Racial%20segregation">racial</a> and <a href="social%20segregation">social segregation</a> that arose from Spanish colonialism has continued to the modern era. <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> is the official and predominant language, although 36 <a href="Languages%20of%20Bolivia">indigenous language</a>s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are <a href="Guarani%20dialects">Guarani</a>, <a href="Aymara%20language">Aymara</a> and <a href="Quechuan%20languages">Quechua languages</a>.

Modern Bolivia is <a href="constitution%20of%20Bolivia">constitutionally</a> a <a href="unitary%20state">unitary state</a>, divided into <a href="Departments%20of%20Bolivia">nine departments</a>. Its geography varies from the peaks of the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the <a href="Amazon%20Basin">Amazon Basin</a>. It is the poorest country in South America, a <a href="developing%20country">developing country</a>, with a medium ranking in the <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">Human Development Index</a> and a poverty level of 53 percent. Its main economic activities include <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="forestry">forestry</a>, <a href="fishing">fishing</a>, <a href="mining">mining</a>, and <a href="manufacturing">manufacturing</a> goods such as textiles, clothing, refined metals, and <a href="refinery">refined petroleum</a>. Bolivia is very <a href="Geology%20of%20Bolivia">wealthy in minerals</a>, especially <a href="tin">tin</a>.

Bolivia is named after Simón Bolívar, a leader in the <a href="Spanish%20American%20wars%20of%20independence">Spanish American wars of independence</a>. The leader of <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Sucre">Antonio José de Sucre</a>, had been given the option by Bolívar to either unite <a href="Sucre">Charcas</a> (present-day Bolivia) with the newly formed <a href="Republic%20of%20Peru">Republic of Peru</a>, to unite with the <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20Rio%20de%20la%20Plata">United Provinces of Rio de la Plata</a>, or to formally declare its independence from Spain as a wholly independent nation. Sucre opted to create a brand new nation and, with local support, named it in honor of Simón Bolívar.

The original name was Republic of Bolívar. Some days later, congressman Manuel Martín Cruz proposed: "If from <a href="Romulus">Romulus</a> comes Rome, then from <a href="Bol%C3%ADvar">Bolívar</a> comes Bolivia" (). The name was approved by the Republic on 3 October 1825. In 2009, a <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bolivia">new constitution</a> changed the country's official name to "Plurinational State of Bolivia" in recognition of the multi-ethnic nature of the country and the enhanced position of Bolivia's indigenous peoples under the new constitution.

The region now known as Bolivia had been occupied for over 2,500 years when the <a href="Aymara%20people">Aymara</a> arrived. However, present-day Aymara associate themselves with the ancient civilization of the <a href="Tiwanaku%20culture">Tiwanaku culture</a> which had its capital at <a href="Tiwanaku">Tiwanaku</a>, in Western Bolivia. The capital city of Tiwanaku dates from as early as 1500 BC when it was a small, agriculturally based village.

The community grew to urban proportions between AD 600 and AD 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern <a href="Andes">Andes</a>. According to early estimates, the city covered approximately at its maximum extent and had between 15,000 and 30,000 inhabitants. In 1996 <a href="satellite%20imaging">satellite imaging</a> was used to map the extent of fossilized suka kollus (flooded raised fields) across the three primary valleys of Tiwanaku, arriving at population-carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285,000 and 1,482,000 people.

Around AD 400, Tiwanaku went from being a locally dominant force to a predatory state. Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects. In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.

The empire continued to grow with no end in sight. William H. Isbell states "Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between AD 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population." Tiwanaku continued to absorb cultures rather than eradicate them. Archaeologists note a dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics into the cultures which became part of the Tiwanaku empire. Tiwanaku's power was further solidified through the trade it implemented among the cities within its empire.

Tiwanaku's elites gained their status through the surplus food they controlled, collected from outlying regions and then redistributed to the general populace. Further, this elite's control of <a href="llama">llama</a> herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites. Through this control and manipulation of surplus resources, the elite's power continued to grow until about AD 950. At this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred, causing a significant drop in precipitation in the Titicaca Basin, believed by archaeologists to have been on the scale of a major drought.

As the rainfall decreased, many of the cities farther away from Lake Titicaca began to tender fewer foodstuffs to the elites. As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up. The area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter.

Between 1438 and 1527, the Inca empire, during its expansion from its capital at <a href="Cuzco">Cuzco</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. gained control over much of what is now Andean Bolivia and extended its control into the fringes of the Amazon basin.

The Spanish conquest of the <a href="Inca%20empire">Inca empire</a> began in 1524, and was mostly completed by 1533. The territory now called Bolivia was known as Charcas, and was under the authority of the Viceroy of <a href="Lima">Lima</a>. Local government came from the <a href="Real%20Audiencia%20of%20Charcas">Audiencia de Charcas</a> located in Chuquisaca (La Plata—modern <a href="Sucre">Sucre</a>). Founded in 1545 as a mining town, <a href="Potos%C3%AD">Potosí</a> soon produced fabulous wealth, becoming the largest city in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> with a population exceeding 150,000 people.

By the late 16th century, Bolivian <a href="silver">silver</a> was an important source of revenue for the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a>. A steady stream of natives served as labor force under the brutal, slave conditions of the Spanish version of the pre-Columbian draft system called the <a href="Mita%20%28Inca%29">mita</a>. Charcas was transferred to the <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata</a> in 1776 and the people from Buenos Aires, the capital of the Viceroyalty, coined the term "<a href="Upper%20Peru">Upper Peru</a>" () as a popular reference to the Royal Audiencia of Charcas. <a href="T%C3%BApac%20Katari">Túpac Katari</a> led the indigenous rebellion that laid siege to <a href="La%20Paz">La Paz</a> in March 1781, during which 20,000 people died. As Spanish royal authority weakened during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic wars</a>, sentiment against colonial rule grew.

The <a href="Bolivian%20War%20of%20Independence">struggle for independence</a> started in the city of <a href="Sucre">Sucre</a> on 25 May 1809 and the <a href="Chuquisaca%20Revolution">Chuquisaca Revolution</a> (Chuquisaca was then the name of the city) is known as the first cry of Freedom in Latin America. That revolution was followed by the <a href="La%20Paz%20revolution">La Paz revolution</a> on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the <a href="Spanish%20American%20wars%20of%20independence">Spanish American wars of independence</a> raged across the continent.

Bolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the <a href="Royalist%20%28Spanish%20American%20Revolution%29">royalists</a> and <a href="Patriot%20%28Spanish%20American%20Revolution%29">patriots</a>. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Sucre">Antonio José de Sucre</a>, with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Simón Bolívar</a>. After 16 years of war the Republic was <a href="Bolivian%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">proclaimed</a> on 6 August 1825.

In 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of <a href="Marshal">Marshal</a> <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20de%20Santa%20Cruz">Andrés de Santa Cruz</a>, invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, <a href="General">General</a> <a href="Luis%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Orbegoso">Luis José de Orbegoso</a>. Peru and Bolivia formed the <a href="Peru-Bolivian%20Confederation">Peru-Bolivian Confederation</a>, with de Santa Cruz as the "Supreme Protector". Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Confederation">War of the Confederation</a>: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of <a href="Paucarpata%20District">Paucarpata</a> near the city of <a href="Arequipa">Arequipa</a>.

At the outset of the war, the Chilean and Peruvian rebel army surrendered unconditionally and signed the <a href="Paucarpata%20Treaty">Paucarpata Treaty</a>. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. In Chile, the government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Yungay">Battle of Yungay</a>. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.

Following the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Gamarra">Agustín Gamarra</a> invaded Bolivia. The Peruvian army was decisively defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ingavi">Battle of Ingavi</a> on 20 November 1841 where Gamarra was killed. The Bolivian army under General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ballivi%C3%A1n">José Ballivián</a> then mounted a counter-offensive, capturing the Peruvian port of <a href="Arica%20Province%20%28Peru%29">Arica</a>. Later, both sides signed a <a href="peace%20treaty">peace treaty</a> in 1842, putting a final end to the war.

A period of political and economic instability in the early-to-mid-19th century weakened Bolivia. In addition, during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> (1879–83), <a href="Chile">Chile</a> occupied vast territories rich in <a href="natural%20resources">natural resources</a> south west of Bolivia, including the Bolivian <a href="coast">coast</a>. Chile took control of today's <a href="Chuquicamata">Chuquicamata</a> area, the adjoining rich "salitre" (<a href="Sodium%20nitrate">saltpeter</a>) fields, and the port of <a href="Antofagasta">Antofagasta</a> among other Bolivian territories.

Thus, since independence, Bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries. It also lost the <a href="Acre%20%28state%29">state of Acre</a>, in the Acre War, important because this region was known for its production of rubber. Peasants and the Bolivian army fought briefly but after a few victories, and facing the prospect of a total war against Brazil, it was forced to sign the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Petr%C3%B3polis">Treaty of Petrópolis</a> in 1903, in which Bolivia lost this rich territory. Popular myth has it that Bolivian president Mariano Melgarejo (1864–71) traded the land for what he called "a magnificent white horse" and Acre was subsequently flooded by Brazilians, which ultimately led to confrontation and fear of war with Brazil. In the late 19th century, an increase in the world price of silver brought Bolivia relative prosperity and political stability.

During the early 20th century, <a href="tin">tin</a> replaced silver as the country's most important source of wealth. A succession of governments controlled by the economic and social elite followed <a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> capitalist policies through the first thirty years of the 20th century.

Living conditions of the native people, who constitute most of the population, remained deplorable. With work opportunities limited to primitive conditions in the mines and in large estates having nearly feudal status, they had no access to education, economic opportunity, and <a href="Participation%20%28decision%20making%29">political participation</a>. Bolivia's defeat by Paraguay in the <a href="Chaco%20War">Chaco War</a> (1932–35), where Bolivia lost a great part of the <a href="Gran%20Chaco">Gran Chaco</a> region in dispute, marked a turning-point.

The <a href="Revolutionary%20Nationalist%20Movement">Revolutionary Nationalist Movement</a> (MNR), the most historic political party, emerged as a broad-based party. Denied its victory in the 1951 presidential elections, the MNR led a successful revolution in 1952. Under President <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Paz%20Estenssoro">Víctor Paz Estenssoro</a>, the MNR, having strong popular pressure, introduced <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a> into his political platform and carried out a sweeping land-reform promoting rural education and nationalization of the country's largest tin mines.

12 years of tumultuous rule left the MNR divided. In 1964, a military <a href="military%20dictatorship">junta</a> overthrew President Estenssoro at the outset of his third term. The 1969 death of President <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Barrientos%20Ortu%C3%B1o">René Barrientos Ortuño</a>, a former member of the junta who was elected president in 1966, led to a succession of weak governments. Alarmed by the rising Popular Assembly and the increase in the popularity of President Juan José Torres, the military, the MNR, and others installed Colonel (later General) <a href="Hugo%20Banzer%20Su%C3%A1rez">Hugo Banzer Suárez</a> as president in 1971. He returned to the presidency in 1997 through 2001.

The United States' <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) had been active in providing finances and training to the Bolivian military dictatorship in the 1960s. The revolutionary leader <a href="Che%20Guevara">Che Guevara</a> was killed by a team of CIA officers and members of the Bolivian Army on 9 October 1967, in Bolivia. <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20%28Central%20Intelligence%20Agency%29">Félix Rodríguez</a> was a CIA officer on the team with the Bolivian Army that captured and shot Guevara. Rodriguez said that after he received a Bolivian presidential execution order, he told "the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully, to remain consistent with the Bolivian government's story that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army." Rodriguez said the US government had wanted Che in Panama, and "I could have tried to falsify the command to the troops, and got Che to Panama as the US government said they had wanted", but that he had chosen to "let history run its course" as desired by Bolivia.

Elections in 1979 and 1981 were inconclusive and marked by fraud. There were coups d'état, counter-coups, and caretaker governments. In 1980, General <a href="Luis%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Meza%20Tejada">Luis García Meza Tejada</a> carried out a ruthless and violent <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> that did not have popular support. He pacified the people by promising to remain in power only for one year. At the end of the year, he staged a televised rally to claim popular support and announced, ""Bueno, me quedo"", or, "All right; I'll stay [in office]." After a military rebellion forced out Meza in 1981, three other military governments in 14 months struggled with Bolivia's growing problems. Unrest forced the military to convoke the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Bolivia">Congress</a>, elected in 1980, and allow it to choose a new chief executive. In October 1982, <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Siles%20Zuazo">Hernán Siles Zuazo</a> again became president, 22 years after the end of his first term of office (1956–60).

<a href="Gonzalo%20S%C3%A1nchez%20de%20Lozada">Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada</a> pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda. The most dramatic reform was the "capitalization" program, under which investors, typically foreign, acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises in return for agreed upon capital investments.

In 1993, <a href="Gonzalo%20S%C3%A1nchez%20de%20Lozada">Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada</a> ran for <a href="President%20of%20Bolivia">president</a> in alliance with the <a href="Revolutionary%20Liberation%20Movement%20Tupaq%20Katari">Tupac Katari Revolutionary Liberation Movement</a>, which inspired indigenous-sensitive and multicultural-aware policies. In 1993, Sanchez de Lozada introduced the "Plan de Todos", which led to the decentralization of government, introduction of <a href="intercultural%20bilingual%20education">intercultural bilingual education</a>, implementation of <a href="Agriculture">agrarian</a> <a href="legislation">legislation</a>, and <a href="privatization">privatization</a> of state owned businesses. The plan explicitly stated that Bolivian citizens would own a minimum of 51% of enterprises; under the plan, most <a href="Government-owned%20corporation">state-owned enterprises</a> (SOEs), though not mines, were sold. This privatization of SOEs led to a <a href="neoliberal">neoliberal</a> structuring.

The Law of Popular Participation gave municipalities the responsibility of maintaining various infrastructures (and offering services): health, education, systems of irrigation, which stripped the responsibility away from the state.

The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society, which instigated frequent and sometimes violent protests, particularly in La Paz and the Chapare <a href="coca">coca</a>-growing region, from 1994 through 1996. During this time, the umbrella labor-organization of Bolivia, the <a href="Central%20Obrera%20Boliviana">Central Obrera Boliviana</a> (COB), became increasingly unable to effectively challenge government policy. A teachers' strike in 1995 was defeated because the COB could not marshal the support of many of its members, including construction and factory workers.

In the 1997 elections, General <a href="Hugo%20Banzer">Hugo Banzer</a>, leader of the <a href="Nationalist%20Democratic%20Action">Nationalist Democratic Action</a> party (ADN) and former dictator (1971–78), won 22% of the vote, while the MNR candidate won 18%. At the outset of his government, President Banzer launched a policy of using special police-units to eradicate physically the illegal coca of the Chapare region. The MIR of Jaime Paz Zamora remained a coalition-partner throughout the Banzer government, supporting this policy (called the Dignity Plan). The Banzer government basically continued the free-market and privatization-policies of its predecessor. The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.

Between January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale <a href="2000%20Cochabamba%20protests">protests</a> erupted in <a href="Cochabamba">Cochabamba</a>, Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the <a href="Water%20privatization">privatisation of water</a> resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices. On 6 August 2001, Banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer. He died less than a year later. Vice President <a href="Jorge%20Quiroga">Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ramírez</a> completed the final year of his term.
In the June 2002 national elections, former President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (MNR) placed first with 22.5% of the vote, followed by coca-advocate and native peasant-leader <a href="Evo%20Morales">Evo Morales</a> (<a href="Movement%20for%20Socialism%20%28Bolivia%29">Movement Toward Socialism</a>, MAS) with 20.9%. A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of Sánchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time. The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives: economic reactivation (and job creation), anti-<a href="political%20corruption">corruption</a>, and social inclusion.

In 2003 the <a href="Bolivian%20gas%20conflict">Bolivian gas conflict</a> broke out. On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, Sanchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, <a href="Carlos%20Mesa">Carlos Mesa</a>, invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.

The country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, <a href="Eduardo%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Eduardo Rodríguez</a>, was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing Carlos Mesa.

The indigenous population of the <a href="Andes">Andean</a> region was not able to benefit from government reforms.

<a href="Evo%20Morales">Evo Morales</a> won the <a href="Bolivian%20presidential%20election%2C%202005">2005 presidential election</a> with 53.7% of the votes, an <a href="absolute%20majority">absolute majority</a>, unusual in Bolivian elections. On 1 May 2006, Morales caused controversy when he announced his intent to <a href="Bolivian%20gas%20conflict">re-nationalize Bolivian hydrocarbon assets</a>. Fulfilling a campaign promise, on 6 August 2006, Morales opened the <a href="Bolivian%20Constituent%20Assembly">Bolivian Constituent Assembly</a> to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority.

In August 2007, more conflicts arose in Sucre, as the city demanded the discussion of the seat of government inside the assembly, hoping the executive and legislative branches could return to the city, but the assembly and the government said this demand was overwhelmingly impractical and politically undesirable. In May 2008, Evo Morales was a signatory to the <a href="UNASUR%20Constitutive%20Treaty">UNASUR Constitutive Treaty</a> of the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20American%20Nations">Union of South American Nations</a>. In the 2009 national general elections, Evo Morales was re-elected with 64.22% of the vote. His party, <a href="Movement%20for%20Socialism%20%28Bolivia%29">Movement for Socialism</a>, also won a two-thirds majority in both houses of the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Bolivia">National Congress</a>.

Bolivia is located in the central zone of <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, between 57°26'–69°38'W and 9°38'–22°53'S. With an area of , Bolivia is the world's 28th-largest country, and the fifth largest country in South America, extending from the <a href="Andes">Central Andes</a> through part of the "<a href="Gran%20Chaco">Gran Chaco</a>" as far as the <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon</a>. The geographic center of the country is the so-called "Puerto Estrella" ("Star Port") on the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Grande%20%28Bolivia%29">Río Grande</a>, in <a href="%C3%91uflo%20de%20Ch%C3%A1vez%20Province">Ñuflo de Chávez Province</a>, <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Department%2C%20Bolivia">Santa Cruz Department</a>.

The geography of the country exhibits a great variety of terrain and climates. Bolivia has a high level of <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, considered one of the greatest in the world, as well as several <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a>s with ecological sub-units such as the "<a href="Altiplano">Altiplano</a>", <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>s (including <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a>), dry <a href="valley">valley</a>s, and the "<a href="Chiquitania">Chiquitania</a>", which is a <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20grasslands%2C%20savannas%2C%20and%20shrublands">tropical savanna</a>. These areas feature enormous variations in altitude, from an elevation of above sea level in <a href="Nevado%20Sajama">Nevado Sajama</a> to nearly along the <a href="Paraguay%20River">Paraguay River</a>. Although a country of great geographic diversity, Bolivia has remained a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a> since the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a>.

Bolivia can be divided into three <a href="Physical%20geography">physiographic</a> regions:


Bolivia has three <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a>s:


Deforestation in upper river basins has caused environmental problems, including soil erosion and declining water quality. An innovative project to try and remedy this situation involves landholders in upstream areas being paid by downstream water users to conserve forests. The landholders receive $20 to conserve the trees, avoid polluting livestock practices, and enhance the biodiversity and forest carbon on their land. They receive $30, which purchases a beehive, to compensate for conservation for two hectares of water-sustaining forest for five years. Honey revenue per hectare of forest is $5 per year, so within five years, the landholder has sold $50 of honey. The project is being conducted by <a href="Fundaci%C3%B3n%20Natura%20Bolivia">Fundación Natura Bolivia</a> and Rare Conservation, with support from the <a href="Climate%20%26amp%3B%20Development%20Knowledge%20Network">Climate & Development Knowledge Network</a>.

The <a href="geology%20of%20Bolivia">geology of Bolivia</a> comprises a variety of different <a href="lithology">lithologies</a> as well as <a href="plate%20tectonics">tectonic</a> and sedimentary environments. On a synoptic scale, geological units coincide with topographical units. Most elementally, the country is divided into a mountainous western area affected by the <a href="subduction">subduction</a> processes in the Pacific and an eastern lowlands of stable <a href="platform%20%28geology%29">platforms</a> and <a href="shield%20%28geology%29">shields</a>.

The climate of Bolivia varies drastically from one eco-region to the other, from the tropics in the eastern "<a href="Plain">llanos</a>" to a <a href="polar%20climate">polar climate</a> in the western Andes. The summers are warm, humid in the east and dry in the west, with rains that often modify temperatures, humidity, winds, <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">atmospheric pressure</a> and evaporation, yielding very different climates in different areas. When the climatological phenomenon known as "<a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o-Southern%20Oscillation">El Niño</a>" takes place, it causes great alterations in the weather. Winters are very cold in the west, and it snows in the mountain ranges, while in the western regions, windy days are more common. The autumn is dry in the non-tropical regions.

Bolivia, with an enormous variety of <a href="organism">organism</a>s and <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s, is part of the "<a href="Megadiverse%20countries%23Canc%C3%BAn%20initiative%20and%20declaration%20of%20like-minded%20megadiverse%20countries">Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries</a>".

Bolivia's variable altitudes, ranging from above sea level, allow for a vast biologic diversity. The territory of Bolivia comprises four types of <a href="biome">biome</a>s, 32 ecological regions, and 199 ecosystems. Within this geographic area there are several natural parks and reserves such as the <a href="Noel%20Kempff%20Mercado%20National%20Park">Noel Kempff Mercado National Park</a>, the <a href="Madidi%20National%20Park">Madidi National Park</a>, the <a href="Tunari%20National%20Park">Tunari National Park</a>, the <a href="Eduardo%20Avaroa%20Andean%20Fauna%20National%20Reserve">Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve</a>, and the <a href="Kaa-Iya%20del%20Gran%20Chaco%20National%20Park%20and%20Integrated%20Management%20Natural%20Area">Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area</a>, among others.

Bolivia boasts over 17,000 species of seed plants, including over 1,200 species of <a href="fern">fern</a>, 1,500 species of "<a href="marchantiophyta">marchantiophyta</a>" and <a href="moss">moss</a>, and at least 800 species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a>. In addition, there are more than 3,000 species of <a href="medicinal%20plant">medicinal plant</a>s. Bolivia is considered the place of origin for such species as <a href="Capsicum%20pubescens">peppers</a> and <a href="Capsicum">chili peppers</a>, <a href="peanut">peanut</a>s, the <a href="Phaseolus%20vulgaris">common bean</a>s, <a href="Cassava">yucca</a>, and several species of palm. Bolivia also naturally produces over 4,000 kinds of <a href="potato">potato</a>es.

Bolivia has more than 2,900 animal species, including 398 mammals, over 1,400 birds (about 14% of birds known in the world, being the sixth most diverse country in terms of bird species), 204 <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s, 277 <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s, and 635 fish, all <a href="fresh%20water">fresh water</a> fish as Bolivia is a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a>. In addition, there are more than 3,000 types of <a href="Lepidoptera">butterfly</a>, and more than 60 <a href="Domestication">domestic animals</a>.

Bolivia has gained global attention for its '<a href="Law%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Mother%20Earth">Law of the Rights of Mother Earth</a>', which accords nature the same rights as humans.

Bolivia has been governed by democratically elected governments since 1982, prior to that it was governed by various dictatorships. Presidents <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Siles%20Zuazo">Hernán Siles Zuazo</a> (1982–85) and <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Paz%20Estenssoro">Víctor Paz Estenssoro</a> (1985–89) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: <a href="Gonzalo%20S%C3%A1nchez%20de%20Lozada">Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada</a> in 2003 and <a href="Carlos%20Mesa">Carlos Mesa</a> in 2005.

Bolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the <a href="Revolutionary%20Nationalist%20Movement">Revolutionary Nationalist Movement</a>, <a href="Nationalist%20Democratic%20Action">Nationalist Democratic Action</a>, and the <a href="Revolutionary%20Left%20Movement%20%28Bolivia%29">Revolutionary Left Movement</a> predominated from 1985 to 2005. The current president is <a href="Evo%20Morales">Evo Morales</a>, the first indigenous Bolivian to serve as head of state. Morales' <a href="Movement%20for%20Socialism%20%E2%80%93%20Political%20Instrument%20for%20the%20Sovereignty%20of%20the%20Peoples">Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples</a> party was the first to win an outright presidential majority in four decades, doing so both in 2005 and 2009.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bolivia">constitution</a>, drafted in 2006–07 and approved in 2009, provides for balanced executive, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers, as well as several levels of autonomy. The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Bolivia">Congress</a>, whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Bolivia">Supreme Court</a> and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.

The executive branch is headed by a President and Vice President, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government <a href="Ministry%20%28government%20department%29">ministries</a>. The president is elected to a five-year term by <a href="Direct%20election">popular vote</a>, and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, "Palacio Quemado") in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an <a href="absolute%20majority">absolute majority</a> of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.

The "Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional" (<a href="Plurinational%20Legislative%20Assembly">Plurinational Legislative Assembly</a> or National Congress) has <a href="Bicameralism">two chambers</a>. The "Cámara de Diputados" (Chamber of Deputies) has 130 members elected to five-year terms, seventy from single-member districts ("circunscripciones"), sixty by proportional representation, and seven by the minority indigenous peoples of seven departments. The "Cámara de Senadores" (Chamber of Senators) has 36 members (four per department). Members of the Assembly are elected to five-year terms. The body has its headquarters on the Plaza Murillo in La Paz, but also holds honorary sessions elsewhere in Bolivia. The Vice President serves as titular head of the combined Assembly.

The judiciary consists of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Bolivia">Supreme Court</a>, the Constitutional Tribunal, the Judiciary Council, Agrarian and Environmental Tribunal, and District (departmental) and lower courts. In October 2011, Bolivia held its first judicial elections to choose members of the national courts by popular vote, a reform brought about by Evo Morales.

The <a href="Plurinational%20Electoral%20Organ">Plurinational Electoral Organ</a> is an independent branch of government which replaced the <a href="National%20Electoral%20Court%20of%20Bolivia">National Electoral Court</a> in 2010. The branch consists of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the nine Departmental Electoral Tribunals, Electoral Judges, the anonymously selected Juries at Election Tables, and Electoral Notaries. Wilfredo Ovando presides over the seven-member Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Its operations are mandated by the Constitution and regulated by the Electoral Regime Law (Law 026, passed 2010). The Organ's first elections were the country's first <a href="Bolivian%20judicial%20election%2C%202011">judicial election</a> in October 2011, and five municipal special elections held in 2011.

Bolivia has its constitutionally recognized capital in Sucre, while La Paz is the seat of government. La Plata (now Sucre) was proclaimed provisional capital of the newly independent Alto Perú (later, Bolivia) on 1 July 1826. On 12 July 1839, President <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Miguel%20de%20Velasco">José Miguel de Velasco</a> proclaimed a law naming the city as the capital of Bolivia, and renaming it in honor of the revolutionary leader <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Sucre">Antonio José de Sucre</a>. The Bolivian seat of government moved to <a href="La%20Paz">La Paz</a> at the start of the twentieth century, as a consequence of Sucre's relative remoteness from economic activity after the decline of <a href="Potos%C3%AD">Potosí</a> and its silver industry and of the Liberal Party in the War of 1899.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bolivia">2009 Constitution</a> assigns the role of national capital to Sucre, not referring to La Paz in the text. In addition to being the constitutional capital, the Supreme Court of Bolivia is located in Sucre, making it the judicial capital. Nonetheless, the <a href="Palacio%20Quemado">Palacio Quemado</a> (the Presidential Palace and seat of Bolivian <a href="Executive%20%28government%29">executive power</a>) is located in La Paz, as are the National Congress and Plurinational Electoral Organ. La Paz thus continues to be the seat of government.

There are 53 <a href="prisons%20in%20Bolivia">prisons in Bolivia</a>, which incarcerate around 8,700 people . The prisons are managed by the Penitentiary Regime Directorate (). There are 17 prisons in <a href="Departments%20of%20Bolivia">departmental</a> capital cities and 36 provincial prisons.

Despite losing its maritime coast, the so-called <a href="Litoral%20Department">Litoral Department</a>, after the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a>, Bolivia has historically maintained, as a state policy, a maritime claim to that part of <a href="Chile">Chile</a>; the claim asks for sovereign access to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and its maritime space. The issue has also been presented before the <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a>; in 1979, the OAS passed the "426 Resolution", which declared that the Bolivian problem is a hemispheric problem. On 4 April 1884, a truce was signed with Chile, whereby Chile gave facilities of access to Bolivian products through <a href="Antofagasta">Antofagasta</a>, and freed the payment of export rights in the port of <a href="Arica">Arica</a>. In October 1904, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Peace%20and%20Friendship%20%281904%29">Treaty of Peace and Friendship</a> was signed, and Chile agreed to build a <a href="Arica%E2%80%93La%20Paz%20railway">railway between Arica and La Paz</a>, to improve access of Bolivian products to the ports.

The "Special Economical Zone for Bolivia in Ilo" (ZEEBI) is a special economic area of of maritime coast, and a total extension of , called Mar Bolivia ("Sea Bolivia"), where Bolivia may maintain a free port near <a href="Ilo">Ilo</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a> under its administration and operation for a period of 99 years starting in 1992; once that time has passed, all the construction and territory revert to the Peruvian government. Since 1964, Bolivia has had its own port facilities in the "Bolivian Free Port" in <a href="Rosario%2C%20Santa%20Fe">Rosario, Argentina</a>. This port is located on the <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20River">Paraná River</a>, which is directly connected to the Atlantic Ocean.

The <a href="Military%20of%20Bolivia">Bolivian military</a> comprises three branches: <a href="Bolivian%20Army">Ejército (Army)</a>, <a href="Bolivian%20Naval%20Force">Naval (Navy)</a> and <a href="Bolivian%20Air%20Force">Fuerza Aérea (Air Force)</a>. The legal age for voluntary admissions is 18; however, when the numbers are small the government recruits anyone as young as 14. The <a href="tour%20of%20duty">tour of duty</a> is generally 12 months. The Bolivian government annually spends $130 million on defense.

The Bolivian army has around 31,500 men. There are six military regions ("regiones militares"—RMs) in the army. The army is organized into ten divisions.

Though it is landlocked Bolivia keeps a navy. The <a href="Bolivian%20Naval%20Force">Bolivian Naval Force</a> ("Fuerza Naval Boliviana" in Spanish) is a naval force about 5,000 strong in 2008.

The <a href="Bolivian%20Air%20Force">Bolivian Air Force</a> ('Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' or 'FAB') has nine air bases, located at La Paz, Cochabamba, <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20la%20Sierra">Santa Cruz</a>, <a href="Puerto%20Su%C3%A1rez">Puerto Suárez</a>, <a href="Tarija%2C%20Bolivia">Tarija</a>, <a href="Villamontes">Villamontes</a>, <a href="Cobija">Cobija</a>, <a href="Riberalta">Riberalta</a>, and <a href="Robor%C3%A9">Roboré</a>.

Bolivia has nine departments—<a href="Pando%20Department">Pando</a>, <a href="La%20Paz%20Department%20%28Bolivia%29">La Paz</a>, <a href="Beni%20Department">Beni</a>, <a href="Oruro%20Department">Oruro</a>, <a href="Cochabamba%20Department">Cochabamba</a>, <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Department%20%28Bolivia%29">Santa Cruz</a>, <a href="Potos%C3%AD%20Department">Potosí</a>, <a href="Chuquisaca%20Department">Chuquisaca</a>, <a href="Tarija%20Department">Tarija</a>.

According to what is established by the Bolivian Political Constitution, the Law of Autonomies and Decentralization regulates de procedure for the elaboration of Statutes of Autonomy, the transfer and distribution of direct competences between the central government and the autonomous entities.

There are four levels of decentralization: Departmental government, constituted by the "Departmental Assembly", with rights over the legislation of the department. The <a href="governor">governor</a> is chosen by <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>. Municipal government, constituted by a "Municipal Council", with rights over the legislation of the municipality. The <a href="mayor">mayor</a> is chosen by universal suffrage. Regional government, formed by several provinces or municipalities of geographical continuity within a department. It is constituted by a "Regional Assembly". Original indigenous government, <a href="self-governance">self-governance</a> of original indigenous people on the ancient territories where they live.

Bolivia's estimated 2012 gross domestic product (GDP) totaled $27.43 billion at official exchange rate and $56.14 billion at purchasing power parity. Economic growth was estimated to be at about 5.2%, and inflation was estimated at about 6.9%. Bolivia was rated "Repressed" by <a href="The%20Heritage%20Foundation">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s 2010 "<a href="Index%20of%20Economic%20Freedom">Index of Economic Freedom</a>". Despite a series of mostly political setbacks, between 2006 and 2009 the Morales administration has spurred growth higher than at any point in the preceding 30 years. The growth was accompanied by a moderate decrease in inequality. A surplus budget of 1.7% (GDP) was obtained by 2012, the government runs surpluses since Morales administration reflecting a prudent economic management.

A major blow to the Bolivian economy came with a drastic fall in the price of tin during the early 1980s, which impacted one of Bolivia's main sources of income and one of its major mining industries. Since 1985, the government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating scarcity. A major reform of the customs service has significantly improved transparency in this area. Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-liberal policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded national treatment.

In April 2000, Hugo Banzer, the former President of Bolivia, signed a contract with Aguas del Tunari, a private consortium, to operate and improve the water supply in Bolivia's third-largest city, <a href="Cochabamba">Cochabamba</a>. Shortly thereafter, the company tripled the water rates in that city, an action which resulted in <a href="2000%20Cochabamba%20protests">protests and rioting</a> among those who could no longer afford clean water. Amidst Bolivia's nationwide economic collapse and growing national unrest over the state of the economy, the Bolivian government was forced to withdraw the water contract.

Bolivia has the second largest <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> reserves in South America. The government has a long-term sales agreement to sell natural gas to Brazil through 2019. The government held a binding referendum in 2005 on the Hydrocarbon Law.

The US Geological Service estimates that Bolivia has 5.4 million <a href="cubic%20ton">cubic ton</a>nes of <a href="lithium">lithium</a>, which represent 50%–70% of world reserves. However, to mine for it would involve disturbing the country's salt flats (called <a href="Salar%20de%20Uyuni">Salar de Uyuni</a>), an important natural feature which boosts tourism in the region. The government does not want to destroy this unique natural landscape to meet the rising world demand for lithium. On the other hand, sustainable extraction of lithium is attempted by the government. This project is carried out by the public company "Recursos Evaporíticos" subsidiary of COMIBOL.

Once Bolivia's government depended heavily on foreign assistance to finance development projects and to pay the public staff. At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5 billion to its foreign <a href="creditor">creditor</a>s, with $1.6 billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the <a href="Paris%20Club">Paris Club</a> mechanism. External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian government has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by IMF programs since 1987, though economic crises have undercut Bolivia's normally good record. However, by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to Brazil and Argentina of natural gas.

The income from tourism has become increasingly important. <a href="Tourism%20in%20Bolivia">Bolivia's tourist industry</a> has grown gradually since about 1990.

The amount in reserve currencies and <a href="gold">gold</a> held by Bolivia's Central Bank advanced from 1.085 billion US dollars in 2000, under <a href="Hugo%20Banzer%20Suarez">Hugo Banzer Suarez</a>'s government, to 15.282 billion US dollars in 2014 under <a href="Evo%20Morales">Evo Morales</a>' government.

The General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics (Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil—DGAC) formerly part of the FAB, administers a civil aeronautics school called the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (Instituto Nacional de Aeronáutica Civil—INAC), and two commercial air transport services TAM and TAB.

<a href="TAM%20%E2%80%93%20Transporte%20A%C3%A9reo%20Militar">TAM – Transporte Aéreo Militar</a> (the Bolivian Military Airline) is an airline based in La Paz, Bolivia. It is the civilian wing of the 'Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' (the Bolivian Air Force), operating passenger services to remote towns and communities in the North and Northeast of Bolivia. TAM (a.k.a. TAM Group 71) has been a part of the FAB since 1945.

A similar airline serving the <a href="Beni%20Department">Beni Department</a> with small planes is <a href="L%C3%ADnea%20A%C3%A9rea%20Amaszonas">Línea Aérea Amaszonas</a>, using smaller planes than TAM.

Although a civil transport airline, <a href="TAB%20%E2%80%93%20Transportes%20A%C3%A9reos%20Bolivianos">TAB – Transportes Aéreos Bolivianos</a>, was created as a subsidiary company of the FAB in 1977. It is subordinate to the Air Transport Management (Gerencia de Transportes Aéreos) and is headed by an FAB general. TAB, a charter heavy cargo airline, links Bolivia with most countries of the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>; its inventory includes a fleet of Hercules C130 aircraft. TAB is headquartered adjacent to <a href="El%20Alto%20International%20Airport">El Alto International Airport</a>. TAB flies to Miami and <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, with a stop in <a href="Panama">Panama</a>.

The three largest, and main international airports in Bolivia are <a href="El%20Alto%20International%20Airport">El Alto International Airport</a> in La Paz, <a href="Viru%20Viru%20International%20Airport">Viru Viru International Airport</a> in Santa Cruz, and <a href="Jorge%20Wilstermann%20International%20Airport">Jorge Wilstermann International Airport</a> in Cochabamba.

Bolivia possesses an extensive but aged rail system, all in 1000 mm gauge, consisting of two disconnected networks.

Bolivia owns a communications satellite which was <a href="Offshore%20company">offshored/outsourced</a> and launched by <a href="China">China</a> named <a href="T%C3%BApac%20Katari%201">Túpac Katari 1</a>. In 2015, it was announced that electrical power advancements include a planned $300 million nuclear reactor developed by the <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n nuclear company <a href="Rosatom">Rosatom</a>.

Bolivias's drinking water and <a href="Sanitation">Sanitation</a> coverage has greatly improved since 1990 due to a considerable increase
in sectoral investment. However, the country has the continent's lowest coverage levels and services are of low 
quality. Political and institutional instability have 
contributed to the weakening of the sector's institutions at the 
national and local levels.

Two concessions to foreign private companies in two of the three largest cities – <a href="Cochabamba">Cochabamba</a> and <a href="La%20Paz">La Paz</a>/<a href="El%20Alto">El Alto</a> — were prematurely ended in 2000 and 2006 respectively. The country's second largest city, <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20la%20Sierra">Santa Cruz de la Sierra</a>, relatively successfully manages its own water and sanitation system by way of cooperatives. The government of <a href="Evo%20Morales">Evo Morales</a> intends to strengthen citizen participation within the sector. Increasing coverage requires a substantial increase of investment financing.

According to the government the main problems in the sector are low access to sanitation throughout the country; low access to water in rural areas; insufficient and ineffective investments; a low visibility of community service providers; a lack of respect of indigenous customs; "technical and institutional difficulties in the design and implementation of projects"; a lack of capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure; an institutional framework that is "not consistent with the political change in the country"; "ambiguities in the social participation schemes"; a reduction in the quantity and 
quality of water due to climate change; pollution and a lack of integrated water resources management; and the lack of policies and programs for the reuse of wastewater.

Only 27% of the population has access to <a href="improved%20sanitation">improved sanitation</a>, 80 to 88% has access to <a href="improved%20water%20source">improved water source</a>s. Coverage in urban areas is bigger than in rural ones.

According to the last two censuses carried out by the Bolivian National Statistics Institute "(Instituto Nacional de Estadística", INE), the population increased from 8,274,325 (from which 4,123,850 were men and 4,150,475 were women) in 2001 to 10,027,254 in 2012.

In the last fifty years the Bolivian population has tripled, reaching a population growth rate of 2.25%. The growth of the population in the inter-census periods (1950–1976 and 1976–1992) was approximately 2.05%, while between the last period, 1992–2001, it reached 2.74% annually.

Some 62.43% of Bolivians live in urban areas, while the remaining 37.57% in rural areas. The most part of the population (70%) is concentrated in the departments of <a href="La%20Paz%20Department%20%28Bolivia%29">La Paz</a>, <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Department%20%28Bolivia%29">Santa Cruz</a> and <a href="Cochabamba%20Department">Cochabamba</a>. In the <a href="Andes">Andean</a> <a href="Altiplano">Altiplano</a> region the departments of La Paz and <a href="Oruro%20Department">Oruro</a> hold the largest percentage of population, in the valley region the largest percentage is held by the departments of Cochabamba and <a href="Chuquisaca%20Department">Chuquisaca</a>, while in the Llanos region by Santa Cruz and <a href="Beni%20Department">Beni</a>. At national level, the population density is 8.49, with variations marked between 0.8 (<a href="Pando%20Department">Pando Department</a>) and 26.2 (Cochabamba Department).

The largest population center is located in the so-called "central axis" and in the Llanos region. Bolivia has a young population. According to the 2011 census, 59% of the population is between 15 and 59 years old, 39% is less than 15 years old. Almost 60% of the population is younger than 25 years of age.

According to a genetic study done on Bolivians, average values of Native American, European and African ancestry are 86%, 12.5%, and 1.5%, in individuals from La Paz and 76.8%, 21.4%, and 1.8% in individuals from Chuquisaca; respectively.

The ethnic composition of Bolivia is diverse. There are approximately three dozen native groups totaling approximately half of the Bolivian population – the largest proportion of indigenous people in Latin America. Exact numbers vary based on the wording of the ethnicity question and the available response choices. For example, the 2001 census did not provide "mestizo" as a response choice, resulting in a much higher proportion of respondents identifying themselves as belonging to one of the available indigenous ethnicity choices. A 2009 estimate put mestizo (mixed white and Amerindian) at 68%, indigenous at 20%, white at 5%, <a href="cholo">cholo</a> at 2%, black at 1%, other at 1%, while 3% were unspecified; 44% attributed themselves to some indigenous group, predominantly <a href="Quechuas">Quechuas</a> or <a href="Aymara%20people">Aymaras</a>.

<a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indigenous peoples</a>, also called ""originarios"" ("native" or "original") and less frequently, "Amerindians", could be <a href="Andes">Andean</a>, like the <a href="Aymara%20people">Aymaras</a> and <a href="Quechua%20people">Quechuas</a> (who formed the ancient <a href="Inca%20Empire">Inca Empire</a>), who are concentrated in the western departments of <a href="La%20Paz%20Department%2C%20Bolivia">La Paz</a>, <a href="Potos%C3%AD%20Department">Potosí</a>, <a href="Oruro%20Department">Oruro</a>, <a href="Cochabamba%20Department">Cochabamba</a> and <a href="Chuquisaca%20Department">Chuquisaca</a>. There also is an important ethnic population in the east, composed of the <a href="Chiquitano%20people">Chiquitano</a>, <a href="Chane%20people">Chane</a>, <a href="Guaran%C3%AD%20people">Guaraní</a> and <a href="Moxo%20people">Moxos</a>, among others, who inhabit the departments of <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Department%2C%20Bolivia">Santa Cruz</a>, <a href="Beni%20Department">Beni</a>, <a href="Tarija%20Department">Tarija</a> and <a href="Pando%20Department">Pando</a>.

<a href="Mestizo">Mestizo</a>s are distributed throughout the entire country and make up 26% of the Bolivian population. Most people assume their "mestizo" identity while at the same time identifying themselves with one or more indigenous cultures.

<a href="White%20people">Whites</a> comprised about 14% of the population in 2006, and are usually concentrated in the largest cities: <a href="La%20Paz">La Paz</a>, <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20la%20Sierra">Santa Cruz de la Sierra</a> and <a href="Cochabamba">Cochabamba</a>, but as well in some minor cities like <a href="Tarija">Tarija</a>. In the <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Department%2C%20Bolivia">Santa Cruz Department</a>, there are several dozen colonies of German-speaking <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a>s totaling around 40,000 inhabitants ().

<a href="Afro-Bolivian">Afro-Bolivian</a>s, descendents of <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">African slaves</a> who arrived in the time of the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a>, inhabit the <a href="La%20Paz%20Department%2C%20Bolivia">department of La Paz</a>, and are located mainly in the provinces of <a href="Nor%20Yungas%20Province">Nor Yungas</a> and <a href="Sud%20Yungas%20Province">Sud Yungas</a>. Slavery was abolished in Bolivia in 1831.

There are also important communities of <a href="Japanese%20Bolivians">Japanese</a> (14.000) and <a href="Lebanon">Lebanese</a> (12.900).

There are small numbers of European citizens from <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, as well as from other American countries, as <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, among others. There are important <a href="Peru">Peru</a>vian colonies in <a href="La%20Paz">La Paz</a>, <a href="El%20Alto">El Alto</a> and <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20la%20Sierra">Santa Cruz de la Sierra</a>.

The <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indigenous</a> peoples of Bolivia can be divided into two categories of ethnic groups: the Andeans, who are located in the <a href="Andes">Andean</a> <a href="Altiplano">Altiplano</a> and the valley region; and the lowland groups, who inhabit the warm regions of central and eastern Bolivia, including the valleys of Cochabamba Department, the Amazon Basin areas of northern La Paz Department, and the lowland departments of Beni, Pando, Santa Cruz, and Tarija (including the <a href="Gran%20Chaco">Gran Chaco</a> region in the southeast of the country). Large numbers of Andean peoples have also migrated to form Quechua, Aymara, and intercultural communities in the lowlands.


Bolivia has great linguistic diversity as a result of its <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bolivia">Constitution of Bolivia</a> recognizes 36 official languages besides <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>: <a href="Aymara%20language">Aymara</a>, <a href="Araona%20language">Araona</a>, <a href="Baure%20language">Baure</a>, <a href="B%C3%A9siro%20language">Bésiro</a>, <a href="Canichana%20language">Canichana</a>, <a href="Cavine%C3%B1o%20language">Cavineño</a>, <a href="Cayubaba%20language">Cayubaba</a>, <a href="Ch%C3%A1cobo%20language">Chácobo</a>, <a href="Chim%C3%A1n%20language">Chimán</a>, <a href="Ese%20Ejja%20language">Ese Ejja</a>, <a href="Guaran%C3%AD%20language">Guaraní</a>, <a href="Guarasuawe%20language">Guarasu'we</a>, <a href="Guarayu%20language">Guarayu</a>, <a href="Itonama%20language">Itonama</a>, <a href="Leco%20language">Leco</a>, <a href="Machajuyai-Kallawaya">Machajuyai-Kallawaya</a>, <a href="Machineri%20language">Machineri</a>, <a href="Maropa%20language">Maropa</a>, <a href="Moje%C3%B1o-Ignaciano">Mojeño-Ignaciano</a>, <a href="Moje%C3%B1o-Trinitario">Mojeño-Trinitario</a>, <a href="Mor%C3%A9%20language%20%28Bolivia%29">Moré</a>, <a href="Moset%C3%A9n%20language">Mosetén</a>, <a href="Movima%20language">Movima</a>, <a href="Pacawara%20language">Pacawara</a>, <a href="Puquina%20language">Puquina</a>, <a href="Quechua%20language">Quechua</a>, <a href="Sirion%C3%B3%20language">Sirionó</a>, <a href="Tacana%20language">Tacana</a>, <a href="Tapiet%C3%A9%20language">Tapieté</a>, <a href="Toromona%20language">Toromona</a>, <a href="Uru-Chipaya">Uru-Chipaya</a>, <a href="Weenhayek%20language">Weenhayek</a>, <a href="Yaminawa%20language">Yaminawa</a>, <a href="Yuki%20language%20%28Bolivia%29">Yuki</a>, <a href="Yuracar%C3%A9%20language">Yuracaré</a>, and <a href="Zamuco%20language">Zamuco</a>.

<a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> is the most spoken official language in the country, according to the 2001 census; as it is spoken by more than 60% of the population. All legal and official documents issued by the State, including the Constitution, the main private and public institutions, the media, and commercial activities, are in Spanish.

The main indigenous languages are: <a href="Quechua%20language">Quechua</a> (21.2% of the population in the 2001 census), <a href="Aymara%20language">Aymara</a> (14.6%), <a href="Guarani%20language">Guarani</a> (0.6%) and others (0.4%) including the <a href="Moxos%20language">Moxos</a> in the department of Beni.

<a href="Plautdietsch">Plautdietsch</a>, a <a href="German%20dialects">German dialect</a>, is spoken by about 70,000 <a href="Mennonites%20in%20Bolivia">Mennonite</a>s in <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Department%20%28Bolivia%29">Santa Cruz</a>. <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> is spoken mainly in the areas close to <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>.

Bolivia is a constitutionally <a href="secular%20state">secular state</a> that guarantees the <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of religion</a> and the independence of government from religion."

According to the 2001 <a href="census">census</a> conducted by the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Statistics%20of%20Bolivia">National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia</a>, 78 percent of the population is <a href="Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a>, followed by 19 percent <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> and 3 percent non-religious.

The <a href="Association%20of%20Religion%20Data%20Archives">Association of Religion Data Archives</a> (relying on the World Christian Database) records that in 2010, 92.5 percent of Bolivians identified as <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> (of any denomination), 3.1 percent identified with indigenous religion, 2.2 percent identified as <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í</a>, 1.9 percent identified as <a href="Agnosticism">agnostic</a>, and all other groups constituted 0.1 percent or less.

Much of the indigenous population adheres to different traditional beliefs marked by <a href="inculturation">inculturation</a> or <a href="Syncretic">syncretisim</a> with Christianity. The cult of <a href="Pachamama">Pachamama</a>, or "Mother Earth", is notable. The veneration of the <a href="Virgen%20de%20Copacabana">Virgin of Copacabana</a>, Virgin of Urkupiña and Virgin of Socavón, is also an important feature. There also are important <a href="Aymara%20people">Aymaran communities</a> near <a href="Lake%20Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a> that have a strong devotion to <a href="James%2C%20son%20of%20Zebedee">James the Apostle</a>. Deities worshiped in Bolivia include <a href="Ekeko">Ekeko</a>, the Aymaran god of abundance and prosperity, whose day is celebrated every 24 January, and <a href="Guarani%20mythology">Tupá</a>, a god of the <a href="Guaran%C3%AD%20people">Guaraní people</a>.

Approximately 67 percent of Bolivians live in urban areas, among the lowest proportion in South America. Nevertheless, the rate of urbanization is growing steadily, at around 2.5 percent annually. According to the 2012 census, there are total of 3,158,691 households in Bolivia – an increase of 887,960 from 2001. In 2009, 75.4 percent of homes were classified as a house, hut, or <a href="Pahuichi">Pahuichi</a>; 3.3 percent were apartments; 21.1 percent were rental residences; and 0.1 percent were <a href="mobile%20home">mobile home</a>s. Most of the country's largest cities are located in the highlands of the west and central regions.

Bolivian culture has been heavily influenced by the Quechua, the Aymara, as well as the popular cultures of Latin America as a whole.

The cultural development is divided into three distinct periods: precolumbian, colonial, and republican. Important <a href="archaeology">archaeological</a> ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a>s, and <a href="weaving">weaving</a>s remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include <a href="Tiwanaku">Tiwanaku</a>, <a href="El%20Fuerte%20de%20Samaipata">El Fuerte de Samaipata</a>, <a href="Inkallaqta">Inkallaqta</a> and <a href="Iskanawaya">Iskanawaya</a>. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and have seen little archaeological exploration.

The Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local native and mestizo builders and <a href="artisan">artisan</a>s, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, painting, and sculpture known as "Mestizo Baroque". The colonial period produced not only the paintings of Pérez de Holguín, Flores, Bitti, and others but also the works of skilled but unknown stonecutters, woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. An important body of Native Baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994.

Bolivian artists of stature in the 20th century include <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Luisa%20Pacheco">María Luisa Pacheco</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Mamani%20Mamani">Roberto Mamani Mamani</a>, <a href="Alejandro%20Mario%20Yllanes">Alejandro Mario Yllanes</a>, <a href="Alfredo%20Da%20Silva">Alfredo Da Silva</a>, and <a href="Marina%20N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez%20del%20Prado">Marina Núñez del Prado</a>.

Bolivia has a rich <a href="folklore">folklore</a>. Its regional <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a> is distinctive and varied. The "devil dances" at the annual carnival of Oruro are one of the great folkloric events of South America, as is the lesser known carnival at <a href="Tarabuco">Tarabuco</a>.
The best known of the various festivals found in the country is the "<a href="Carnaval%20de%20Oruro">Carnaval de Oruro</a>", which was among the first 19 "Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity", as proclaimed by UNESCO in May 2001.

Entertainment includes <a href="association%20football">football</a>.

Cuisine in Bolivia stems mainly from the combination of Spanish cuisine with traditional indigenous Aymara/Inca ingredients, with the addition of later influences from German, Italian, Basque, Russian, Polish, and Arab immigrants.

The 2011 Caroline Alethia novel "<a href="Plant%20Teacher">Plant Teacher</a>" takes place in Bolivia from 2007 to 2008. The novel explores such themes as politics, indigenous religions, and narcotourism.

The 2017 video game <a href="Ghost%20Recon%20Wildlands">Ghost Recon Wildlands</a> is set in a narco-state Bolivia.

In 2008, following <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> standards, Bolivia was declared free of illiteracy, making it the fourth country in South America to attain this status.

Bolivia has public and private universities. Among them: <a href="Universidad%20Mayor%2C%20Real%20y%20Pontificia%20de%20San%20Francisco%20Xavier%20de%20Chuquisaca">Universidad Mayor, Real y Pontificia de San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca</a> USFX – Sucre, founded in 1624; <a href="Universidad%20Mayor%20de%20San%20Andres">Universidad Mayor de San Andres</a> UMSA – La Paz, founded in 1830; <a href="Universidad%20Mayor%20de%20San%20Simon">Universidad Mayor de San Simon</a> UMSS – Cochabamba, founded in 1832; <a href="Universidad%20Aut%C3%B3noma%20Gabriel%20Ren%C3%A9%20Moreno">Universidad Autónoma Gabriel René Moreno</a> UAGRM – Santa Cruz de la Sierra, founded in 1880; <a href="Universidad%20Tecnica%20de%20Oruro">Universidad Tecnica de Oruro</a> UTO – Oruro, founded in 1892; and <a href="Universidad%20Aut%C3%B3noma%20Tom%C3%A1s%20Fr%C3%ADas">Universidad Autónoma Tomás Frías</a> UATF – Potosi, founded in 1892.

Based on 2013 "<a href="The%20World%20Factbook">The World Factbook</a>" estimates, Bolivia is ranked 161st in <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> with a number of 68.2 years. Life expectancy for men is 65.4 and for women is 71.1. A study by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> and <a href="UNICEF">United Nations International Emergency Children's Fund</a> reported over 230 babies died per day in Bolivia through lack of proper care. The majority of the population has no health insurance or access to healthcare. <a href="Demographic%20and%20Health%20Surveys">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> has completed five surveys in Bolivia since 1989 on a wide range of topics.
