Aalen

Aalen () is a former <a href="Free%20Imperial%20City">Free Imperial City</a> located in the eastern part of the German state of <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>, about east of <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> and north of <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a>. It is the seat of the <a href="Ostalbkreis">Ostalbkreis</a> district and is its largest town. It is also the largest town in the <a href="Ostw%C3%BCrttemberg">Ostwürttemberg</a> region. Since 1956, Aalen has had the status of <a href="Gro%C3%9Fe%20Kreisstadt">Große Kreisstadt</a> (major district town). It is noted for its many <a href="half-timbered">half-timbered</a> houses constructed from the 16th century through the 18th century.

With an area of 146.63 km, Aalen is ranked 7th in Baden-Württemberg and 2nd within the <a href="Stuttgart%20%28region%29">Government Region of Stuttgart</a>, after Stuttgart. With a population of about 66,000, Aalen is the 15th most-populated settlement in Baden-Württemberg.

Aalen is situated on the upper reaches of the river <a href="Kocher">Kocher</a>, at the foot of the <a href="Swabian%20Jura">Swabian Jura</a> which lies to the south and south-east, and close to the hilly landscapes of the <a href="Ellwangen%20Hills">Ellwangen Hills</a> to the north and the "Welland" to the north-west.

The west of Aalen's territory is on the foreland of the eastern Swabian Jura, and the north and north-west is on the <a href="Swabian-Franconian%20Forest">Swabian-Franconian Forest</a>, both being part of the <a href="Swabian%20Keuper-Lias%20Plains">Swabian Keuper-Lias Plains</a>. The south-west is part of the <a href="Albuch">Albuch</a>, the east is part of the <a href="H%C3%A4rtsfeld">Härtsfeld</a>, these two both being parts of the Swabian Jura.

The Kocher enters the town's territory from <a href="Oberkochen">Oberkochen</a> to the south, crosses the district of Unterkochen, then enters the town centre, where the "Aal" flows into it. The "Aal" is a small river located only within the town's territory. Next, the Kocher crosses the district of Wasseralfingen, then leaves the town for <a href="H%C3%BCttlingen%2C%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Hüttlingen</a>. Rivers originating near Aalen are the <a href="Rems">Rems</a> (near <a href="Essingen">Essingen</a>, west of Aalen) and the <a href="Jagst">Jagst</a> (near <a href="Unterschneidheim">Unterschneidheim</a>, east of Aalen), both being tributaries of the <a href="Neckar">Neckar</a>, just like the Kocher.

The elevation in the centre of the market square is relative to <a href="Normalh%C3%B6hennull">Normalhöhennull</a>. The territory's lowest point is at the <a href="Lein%20%28Kocher%29">Lein</a> river near Rodamsdörfle, the highest point is the Grünberg's peak near Unterkochen at .

Aalen's territory ranges over all <a href="Group%20%28stratigraphy%29">lithostratigraphic groups</a> of the <a href="South%20German%20Jurassic">South German Jurassic</a>: Aalen's south and the "Flexner" massif are on top of the <a href="White%20Jurassic">White Jurassic</a>, the town centre is on the <a href="Brown%20Jurassic">Brown Jurassic</a>, and a part of Wasseralfingen is on the <a href="Black%20Jurassic">Black Jurassic</a>. As a result, the town advertises itself as a "Geologist's Mecca".

Most parts of the territory are on the "Opalinuston-Formation" (Opalinum Clay <a href="Formation%20%28stratigraphy%29">Formation</a>) of the <a href="Aalenian">Aalenian</a> subdivision of the <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> Period, which is named after Aalen. On the "Sandberg", the "Schnaitberg" and the "Schradenberg" hills, all in the west of Aalen, the "Eisensandstein" (Iron Sandstone) formation emerges to the surface. On the other hills of the city, <a href="sand">sand</a>s "(Goldshöfer Sande)", <a href="gravel">gravel</a> and residual <a href="rubble">rubble</a> prevail.
The historic centre of Aalen and the other areas in the Kocher valley are founded completely on <a href="Holocene">holocenic</a> <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a> <a href="loam">loam</a> "(Auelehm)" and riverbed gravel that have filled in the valley.

Most parts of Dewangen and Fachsenfeld are founded on formations of "Jurensismergel" (Jurensis <a href="Marl">Marl</a>), "Posidonienschiefer" (cf. <a href="Posidonia%20Shale">Posidonia Shale</a>), "Amaltheenton" (Amalthean Clay), "Numismalismergel" (Numismalis Marl) and "Obtususton" (Obtusus Clay, named after <a href="Asteroceras%20obtusum">Asteroceras obtusum</a> ammonites) moving from south to north, all belonging to the Jurassic and being rich in fossils. They are at last followed by the "Trossingen Formation" already belonging to the <a href="Late%20Triassic">Late Triassic</a>.

Until 1939 iron ore was mined on the "Braunenberg" hill. (see <a href="%23Tiefer%20Stollen">Tiefer Stollen</a> section).

The maximum extent of the town's territory amounts to in a north-south dimension and in an east-west dimension. The area is , which includes 42.2% agriculturally used area and 37.7% of forest. 11.5% are built up or vacant, 6.4% is used by traffic infrastructure. Sporting and recreation grounds and parks comprise 1% , other areas 1.1% .

The following municipalities border on Aalen. They are listed clockwise, beginning south, with their respective linear distances to Aalen town centre given in brackets:

<a href="Oberkochen">Oberkochen</a> (), <a href="Essingen%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Essingen</a> (), <a href="Heuchlingen">Heuchlingen</a> (), <a href="Abtsgm%C3%BCnd">Abtsgmünd</a> (), <a href="Neuler">Neuler</a> (), <a href="H%C3%BCttlingen%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Hüttlingen</a> (), <a href="Rainau">Rainau</a> (), <a href="Westhausen%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Westhausen</a> (), <a href="Lauchheim">Lauchheim</a> (), <a href="Bopfingen">Bopfingen</a> () and <a href="Neresheim">Neresheim</a> (), all in the <a href="Ostalbkreis">Ostalbkreis</a> district, furthermore <a href="Heidenheim%20an%20der%20Brenz">Heidenheim an der Brenz</a> () and <a href="K%C3%B6nigsbronn">Königsbronn</a> (), both in <a href="Heidenheim%20%28district%29">Heidenheim district</a>.

Aalen's territory consists of the town centre "(Kernstadt)" and the municipalities
<a href="Merger%20%28politics%29">merged</a> from between 1938 (Unterrombach) and 1975 (Wasseralfingen, see <a href="%23Mergings">mergings</a> section).
The municipalities merged in the course of the latest municipal reform of the 1970s are also called "<a href="Stadtbezirk">Stadtbezirk</a>e" (quarters or districts), and are "Ortschaften" ("settlements") in terms of Baden-Württemberg's "<a href="Gemeindeordnung">Gemeindeordnung</a>" (municipal code), which means, each of them has its own council elected by its respective residents "(Ortschaftsrat)" and is presided by a spokesperson "(Ortsvorsteher)".

The town centre itself and the merged former municipalities consist of numerous villages "(Teilorte)", mostly separated by open ground from each other and having their own independent and long-standing history. Some however have been created as <a href="Planned%20community">planned communities</a>, which were given proper names, but no well-defined borders.

List of villages:

Aalen forms a "Mittelzentrum" ("medium-level centre") within the <a href="Ostw%C3%BCrttemberg">Ostwürttemberg</a> region. Its designated <a href="catchment%20area%20%28human%20geography%29">catchment area</a> includes the following municipalities of the central and eastern Ostalbkreis district: <a href="Abtsgm%C3%BCnd">Abtsgmünd</a>, <a href="Bopfingen">Bopfingen</a>, <a href="Essingen%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Essingen</a>, <a href="H%C3%BCttlingen%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Hüttlingen</a>, <a href="Kirchheim%20am%20Ries">Kirchheim am Ries</a>, <a href="Lauchheim">Lauchheim</a>, <a href="Neresheim">Neresheim</a>, <a href="Oberkochen">Oberkochen</a>, <a href="Riesb%C3%BCrg">Riesbürg</a> and <a href="Westhausen%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Westhausen</a>, and is interwoven with the catchment area of <a href="N%C3%B6rdlingen">Nördlingen</a>, situated in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, east of Aalen.

As Aalen's territory sprawls on escarpments of the Swabian Jura, on the Albuch and the Härtsfeld landscapes, and its elevation has a range of , the climate varies from district to district.

The <a href="weather%20station">weather station</a> the following data originate from is located between the town centre and Wasseralfingen at about and has been in operation since 1991.

The sunshine duration is about 1800 hours per year, which averages 4.93 hours per day. So Aalen is above the German average of 1550 hours per year. However, with 167 days of <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a>, Aalen's region also ranks above the German average of 138. The annual rainfall is , which places Aalen in the middle within Baden-Württemberg.
The annual mean temperature is . Here Aalen ranks above the German average of and the Baden-Württemberg average of .

Numerous remains of early civilization have been found in the area. Tools made of <a href="flint">flint</a> and traces of <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> human settlement dated between the 8th and 5th millennium BC were found on several sites on the margins of the Kocher and Jagst valleys. On the "Schloßbaufeld" plateau (appr. ), situated behind "Kocherburg" castle near Unterkochen, a hill-top settlement was found, with the core being dated to the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>. In the "Appenwang" forest near Wasseralfingen, in Goldshöfe, and in Ebnat, <a href="Tumulus">tumuli</a> of the <a href="Hallstatt%20culture">Hallstatt culture</a> were found. In Aalen and Wasseralfingen, gold and silver coins left by the <a href="Celts">Celts</a> were found. The Celts were responsible for the fortifications in the Schloßbaufeld settlement consisting of sectional embankments and a stone wall. Also, Near Heisenberg (Wasseralfingen), a Celtic <a href="nemeton">nemeton</a> has been identified; however it is no longer readily apparent.

After abandoning the <a href="Alb%20Limes">Alb Limes</a> (a "<a href="limes">limes</a>" generally following the ridgeline of the Swabian Jura) around 150 <a href="Anno%20Domini">AD</a>, Aalen's territory became part of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, in direct vicinity of the then newly erected <a href="Rhaetian%20Limes">Rhaetian Limes</a>. The Romans erected a <a href="castrum">castrum</a> to house the <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> unit "<a href="Ala%20%28Roman%20military%29">Ala</a> II Flavia milliaria"; its remains are known today as "Kastell Aalen" ("Aalen Roman fort"). The site is west of today's town centre at the bottom of the "Schillerhöhe" hill. With about 1,000 horsemen and nearly as many <a href="groom%20%28horse%29">groom</a>s, it was the greatest fort of <a href="auxiliaries%20%28Roman%20military%29">auxiliaries</a> along the Rhaetian Limes. There were Civilian settlements adjacent along the south and the east. Around 260 AD, the Romans gave up the fort as they withdrew their presence in unoccupied <a href="Germania">Germania</a> back to the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> and <a href="Danube">Danube</a> rivers, and the <a href="Alamanni">Alamanni</a> took over the region. Based on 3rd- and 4th-century coins found, the civilian settlement continued to exist for the time being. However, there is no evidence of continued civilization between the Roman era and the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>.

Based on discovery of alamannic graves, archaeologists have established the 7th century as the origination of Aalen. In the northern and western walls of St. John's church, which is located directly adjacent to the eastern gate of the Roman fort, Roman stones were incorporated. The building that exists today probably dates to the 9th century.

The first mention of Aalen was in 839, when emperor <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis the Pious</a> reportedly permitted the <a href="Fulda%20monastery">Fulda monastery</a> to exchange land with the Hammerstadt village, then known as "Hamarstat".
Aalen itself was first mentioned in an inventory list of <a href="Ellwangen%20Abbey">Ellwangen Abbey</a>, dated ca. 1136, as the village "Alon", along with a lower nobleman named Conrad of Aalen. This nobleman probably had his ancestral castle at a site south of today's town centre and was subject first to Ellwangen abbey, later to the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenstaufen">House of Hohenstaufen</a>, and eventually to the <a href="House%20of%20Oettingen">House of Oettingen</a>. 1426 was the last time a member of that house was mentioned in connection with Aalen.
Documents, from the Middle Ages, indicate that the town of Aalen was founded by the Hohenstaufen some time between 1241 and 1246, but at a different location than the earlier village, which was supposedly destroyed in 1388 during the war between the Alliance of Swabian Cities and the Dukes of Bavaria.
Later, it is documented that the counts of Oettingen ruled the town in 1340. They are reported to have pawned the town to Count <a href="Eberhard%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Eberhard II</a> and subsequently to the <a href="House%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">House of Württemberg</a> in 1358 or 1359 in exchange for an amount of money.

During the war against Württemberg, Emperor <a href="Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles IV</a> took the town without a fight after a siege. On 3 December 1360, he declared Aalen an <a href="Free%20imperial%20city">Imperial City</a>, that is, a city or town responsible only to the emperor, a status that made it a quasi-sovereign city-state and that it kept until 1803. In 1377, Aalen joined the Alliance of Swabian Cities, and in 1385, the term "civitas" appears in the town's seal for the first time. In 1398, Aalen was granted the right to hold markets, and in 1401 Aalen obtained proper jurisdiction.
The oldest artistic representation of Aalen was made in 1528. It was made as the basis of a lawsuit between the town and the Counts of Oettingen at the <a href="Reichskammergericht">Reichskammergericht</a> in Speyer. It shows Aalen surrounded by walls, towers, and double moats. The layout of the moats, which had an embankment built between them, is recognizable by the present streets named "Nördlicher, Östlicher, Südlicher" and "Westlicher Stadtgraben" (Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western Moat respectively). The wall was about tall, 1518 <a href="Pace%20%28unit%29">single paces</a> () long and enclosed an area of . During its early years, the town had two <a href="town%20gate">town gate</a>s: The "Upper" or "<a href="Ellwangen">Ellwangen</a> Gate" in the east, and St. Martin's gate in the south; however due to frequent floods, St. Martin's gate was bricked up in the 14th century and replaced by the "Lower" or "<a href="Schw%C3%A4bisch%20Gm%C3%BCnd">Gmünd</a> Gate" built in the west before 1400. Later, several minor side gates were added. The central street market took place on the "Wettegasse" (today called "Marktplatz", "market square") and the "Reichsstädter Straße". So the market district stretched from one gate to the other, however in Aalen it was not straight, but with a 90-degree curve between southern (St. Martin's) gate and eastern (Ellwangen) gate.

Around 1500, the civic graveyard was relocated from the town church to St. John's Church, and in 1514, the "Vierundzwanziger" ("Group of 24") was the first assembly constituted by the citizens.

Delegated by Württemberg's Duke <a href="Louis%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Louis III</a>, on 28 June 1575, nearly 30 years after <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s death, <a href="Jakob%20Andreae">Jakob Andreae</a>, professor and chancellor of the <a href="University%20of%20T%C3%BCbingen">University of Tübingen</a>, arrived in Aalen. The sermon he gave the following day convinced the mayor, the council, and the citizens to adopt the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a> in the town. Andreae stayed in Aalen for four weeks to help with the change. This brought along enormous changes, as the council forbade the Roman Catholic priests to celebrate masses and give sermons. However, after victories of the imperial armies at the beginning of the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>, the <a href="Prince-Provost">Prince-Provost</a>ry of Ellwangen, which still held the <a href="Jus%20patronatus">right of patronage</a> in Aalen, were able to temporarily bring Catholicism back to Aalen; however after the military successes of the <a href="Protestant%20Union">Protestant Union</a>, Protestant church practices were instituted again.

On the night of 5 September 1634, two ensigns of the army of <a href="Bernard%20of%20Saxe-Weimar">Bernard of Saxe-Weimar</a> who were fighting with the Swedes and retreating after the <a href="Battle%20of%20N%C3%B6rdlingen%20%281634%29">Battle of Nördlingen</a> set fire to two powder carriages, to prevent the war material to fall into Croatian hands and to prevent their advance. The result was a conflagration, that some say destroyed portions of the town. There are differing stories regarding this fire. According to 17th-century accounts, the church and all the buildings, except of the "Schwörturm" tower, were casualties of the fire, and only nine families survived. 19th century research by Hermann Bauer, Lutheran pastor and local historian, discovered that the 17th-century account is exaggerated, but he does agree that the town church and buildings in a "rather large" semicircle around it were destroyed. The fire also destroyed the town archive housed in an addition to the church, with all of its documents. After the fire, soldiers of both armies went through the town looting. It took nearly 100 years for the town to reach its population of 2,000.

French troops marched through Aalen in 1688 during the <a href="Nine%20Years%27%20War">Nine Years' War</a>; however, unlike other places, they left without leaving severe damages. The French came through again in 1702 during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> and in 1741 during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a>, the latter also caused imperial troops to move through in 1743.

The town church's tower collapsed in 1765, presumably because proper building techniques were not utilized during the reconstruction after the fire of 1634. The collapsing tower struck two children of the tower watchman who died of their injuries, and destroyed the nave, leaving only the altar cross intact. The remaining walls had to be knocked down due to the damage. Reconstruction began the same year, creating the building that exists today.

On 22 November 1749, the so-called "Aalen protocol" regulating the cohabitation of Lutherans and Roman Catholics in the jointly ruled territory of Oberkochen was signed in Aalen by the Duchy of Württemberg and the Prince-Provostry of Ellwangen. Aalen had been chosen because of its neutral status as a Free Imperial City.

During the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a> (1796), Aalen was looted. The War of the Second Coalition concluded in 1801 with the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lun%C3%A9ville">Treaty of Lunéville</a>, which led to the <a href="German%20Mediatisation">German Mediatisation</a> of 1803 that assigned most Imperial Cities to the neighbouring principalities. Aalen was assigned to the <a href="Prince-elector">electorate</a> of Württemberg, which later became the Kingdom of Württemberg, and became seat of the District ("Oberamt") of Aalen. During the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition">War of the Third Coalition</a>, on 6 October 1805, <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> arrived in Aalen, with an army of 40,000. This event, along with Bavarian and Austrian troops moving in some days later, caused miseries that according to the town clerk "no feather could describe".

In 1811, the municipality of Unterrombach was formed out of some villages previously belonging to Aalen, some to the Barons of Wöllwarth, and the eastern villages were assigned to the municipality of Unterkochen.

In the age of the Napoleonic wars, the <a href="town%20wall">town wall</a>s were no longer of use, and in the 18th century, with the maintenance of walls, gates and towers becoming more neglected Finally, due to the fact that the funds were lacking, starting in 1800, most towers were demolished, the other buildings followed soon.

Before the <a href="industrial%20revolution">industrial revolution</a>, Aalen's economy was shaped by its rural setting. Many citizens were pursuing farming besides their craft, such as <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tanning</a>. In the mid 19th century, there were twelve tanneries in Aalen, due to the proximity of <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a>, an important sales market. Other crafts that added to the economy were <a href="Weaving">weaving mills</a>, which produced linen and woolen goods, and baking of sweet pastry and gingerbread.

In Aalen, industrialisation was a slow process. The first major increase was in the 1840s, when three factories for <a href="Nail%20%28fastener%29">nails</a> and some other factories emerged. It was the link with the railway network, by the opening of the <a href="Rems%20Railway">Rems Railway</a> from <a href="Cannstatt">Cannstatt</a> to Wasseralfingen in 1861, that brought more industry to Aalen, along with the royal <a href="steel%20mill">steel mill</a> (later "Schwäbische Hüttenwerke") in Wasseralfingen. The Rems Railway's extension to Nördlingen in 1863, the opening of the <a href="Brenz%20Railway">Brenz Railway</a> in 1864 and of the <a href="Upper%20Jagst%20Railway">Upper Jagst Railway</a> in 1866 turned Aalen into a <a href="railway%20hub">railway hub</a>. Furthermore, between 1901 and its shutdown in 1972, the <a href="H%C3%A4rtsfeld%20Railway">Härtsfeld Railway</a> connected Aalen with <a href="Dillingen%20an%20der%20Donau">Dillingen an der Donau</a> via <a href="Neresheim">Neresheim</a>. Part of becoming a rail hub entailed more jobs based on the rail industry. These included, a maintenance facility, a <a href="roundhouse">roundhouse</a>, an administrative office, two track maintenance shops, and a freight station with an industrial <a href="branch%20line">branch line</a>. This helped shape Aalen into what today's historians call a "railwayman's town". Starting in 1866, the utilities in town all began to be upgraded. Starting with the Aalen <a href="gasworks">gasworks</a> which were opened and <a href="gas%20lighting">gas lighting</a> was introduced. Then in 1870, a modern <a href="water%20supply">water supply</a> system was started and in 1912 the <a href="mains%20electricity">mains electricity</a>. Finally, in 1935, the first electrically powered <a href="street%20light">street light</a>s were installed.
To fight housing shortage during and immediately after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the town set up barracks settlement areas at the "Schlauch" and "Alter Turnplatz" grounds. In spite of the industry being crippled by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of 1929, the public baths at the Hirschbach creek where modernized, extended and re-opened in 1931.

In the <a href="German%20federal%20election%2C%20November%201932">federal election of 1932</a>, the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> performed below average in Aalen with 25.8% of votes compared to 33.1% on the national level, thus finishing second to the <a href="Centre%20Party%20%28Germany%29">Centre Party</a> which had 26.6% (11.9% nationwide) of the votes, and ahead of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democratic Party of Germany</a> with 19.8% (20.4%). However, the <a href="German%20federal%20election%2C%20March%201933">March 1933 federal elections</a> showed that the sentiment had changed as the Nazi Party received 34.1% (still below German average 43.9% nationwide), but by far the leading vote-getter in Aalen, followed by the Centre party at 26.6% (11.3% nationwide) and the Social Democrats 18.6% (18.3% nationwide).

The democratically elected mayor Friedrich Schwarz remained in office until the Nazis removed him from office, in 1934, and replaced him by chairman of the Nazi Party town council head and brewery owner Karl Barth. Karl Barth was a provisional mayor until the more permanent solution of Karl Schübel. In August 1934, the Nazi consumer fair <a href="Braune%20Messe">Braune Messe</a> ("brown fair") was held in Aalen.

During <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi rule in Germany</a>, there were many military offices constructed in Aalen, starting with, in 1936, a <a href="military%20district%20%28Germany%29">military district</a> riding and driving school. The Nazis also built an army replenishment office "(Heeresverpflegungsamt)", a branch arsenal office "(Heeresnebenzeugamt)" and a branch army ammunitions institute "(Heeresnebenmunitionsanstalt)".

Starting in 1935, <a href="Merger%20%28politics%29">mergers</a> of neighbouring towns began. In 1938, the Oberamt was transformed into the <a href="Districts%20of%20Germany">Landkreis</a> of Aalen and the municipality of Unterrombach was disbanded. Its territory was mostly added to Aalen, with the exception of Hammerstadt, which was added to the municipality of Dewangen. Forst, Rauental and Vogelsang were added to Essingen (in 1952 the entire former municipality of Unterrombach was merged into Aalen, with the exception of Forst, which is part of Essingen until present).

In September 1944, the "Wiesendorf" <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">concentration camp</a>, a <a href="List%20of%20subcamps%20of%20Natzweiler-Struthof">subcamp</a> of <a href="Natzweiler-Struthof">Natzweiler-Struthof</a>, was constructed nearby. It was designated for between 200 and 300 prisoners who were utilized for <a href="Forced%20labour%20under%20German%20rule%20during%20World%20War%20II">forced labor in industrial businesses</a> nearby. Until the camp's dissolution in February 1945, 60 prisoners died. Between 1946 and 1957, the camp buildings were torn down; however, its foundations are still in place in house "Moltkestraße 44/46". Also, there were several other labour camps which existed where prisoners of war along with women and men from occupied countries occupied by Germany were pooled. The prisoners at these other camps had to work for the arms industry in major businesses like "Schwäbische Hüttenwerke" and the "Alfing Keßler" machine factory.

In the civic hospital, the <a href="deaconess">deaconess</a>es on duty were gradually replaced by <a href="National%20Socialist%20People%27s%20Welfare">National Socialist People's Welfare</a> nurses. <a href="Nazi%20eugenics">Nazi eugenics</a> led to <a href="compulsory%20sterilization">compulsory sterilization</a> of some 200 persons there.

Fortunately, Aalen avoided most of the combat activity during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It was only during the last weeks of the war that Aalen became a target of <a href="Air%20warfare%20of%20World%20War%20II">air warfare</a>, which led to the destruction and severe damage of parts of the town, the train station, and other railway installations. A series of air attacks lasting for more than three weeks reached its peak on 17 April 1945, when <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> planes bombed the branch arsenal office and the train station. During this raid, 59 people were killed, more than half of them buried by debris, and more than 500 lost their homes. Also, 33 residential buildings, 12 other buildings and 2 bridges were destroyed, and 163 buildings, including 2 churches, were damaged. Five days later, the Nazi rulers of Aalen were unseated by the US forces.

Aalen became part of the State of <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>, upon its creation in 1952. Then, with the Baden-Württemberg territorial reform of 1973, the District of Aalen was merged into the <a href="Ostalbkreis">Ostalbkreis</a> district. Subsequently, Aalen became seat of that district, and in 1975, the town's borough attained its present size (<a href="%23Mergings">see below</a>).

The population of Aalen exceeded the limit of 20,000, which was the requirement for to gain the status of <a href="Gro%C3%9Fe%20Kreisstadt">Große Kreisstadt</a> ("major district town") in 1946. On 1 August 1947, Aalen was declared "Unmittelbare Kreisstadt" ("immediate district town"), and with the creation of the <a href="Gemeindeordnung">Gemeindeordnung</a> (municipal code) of Baden-Württemberg on 1 April 1956, it was declared "Große Kreisstadt".

On 31 December 2008, 51.1 percent of Aalen were members of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>, 23.9 percent were members of the <a href="Evangelical-Lutheran%20Church%20in%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Evangelical-Lutheran Church</a>. About 25 percent belong to other or no religious community or gave no information. The district of Waldhausen was the district with the highest percentage of Roman Catholic inhabitants at 75.6 percent, and the central district was the one with the highest percentage of Evangelical-Lutheran inhabitants at 25.6 percent, as well as those claiming no religious preference at 32.5 percent.

Aalen's population originally was subject to the <a href="jus%20patronatus">jus patronatus</a> of Ellwangen Abbey, and thus subject to the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Augsburg">Roman Catholic Diocese of Augsburg</a>.

With the assistance of the Duke of Württemberg, in 1575, the <a href="reformation">reformation</a> was implemented in Aalen. Subsequently, Aalen has been a predominantly Protestant town for centuries, with the exception of the years from 1628 until 1632 (see <a href="%23Reformation">reformation</a> section). Being an Imperial City, Aalen could govern its clerical matters on its own, so Clerics, organists and choir masters were direct subjects to the council, which thus exerted bishop-like power. There was even a proper hymn book for Aalen. After the transition to Württemberg, in 1803, Aalen became seat of a <a href="deanery">deanery</a>, with the dean church being the Town Church (with the building constructed from 1765 to 1767 and existing until present). Another popular church is <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">St. John's</a> Church, located on the cemetery and refurbished in 1561.

As Aalen's population grew in the 20th century, more parishes were founded: <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">St. Mark's</a> parish with its church building of 1967 and <a href="Martin%20of%20Tours">St. Martin's</a> parish with its church of 1974. In the borough of Unterrombach, Aalen had implemented the <a href="reformation">reformation</a> as well, but the community remained a <a href="chapel%20of%20ease">chapel-of-ease</a> of Aalen. A proper church, the Christ Church, was erected in 1912 and a proper parish was established in 1947. In Fachsenfeld, the ruling family of Woellwarth resp. of Leinroden implemented the reformation. A parish church was built in 1591, however with an influx of Catholics in the 18th century, a Catholic majority was established. The other districts of present-day Aalen remained mostly catholic after the reformation, however Wasseralfingen established a Lutheran parish in 1891 and a church, St. Magdalene's Church, in 1893. In Unterkochen, after World War II, a parish was established and a church was built in 1960. All four parishes belong to the deanery of Aalen within the <a href="Evangelical-Lutheran%20Church%20in%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg</a>. Furthermore, in Aalen there are <a href="Pietism">Old Pietistic</a> communities.

The few Catholics of today's central district were covered by the parish of Unterkochen until the 19th century, a situation which continued for some years even after completion of <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">St. Mary's</a> Church in 1868, which was constructed by <a href="Georg%20Morlok">Georg Morlok</a>. However, in 1872 Aalen got its proper parish again, and in 1913, a second Catholic church, Salvator's Church, was completed, and in 1969 the Holy Cross Church was also finished. In 1963, a second parish was set up, and in 1972 it got a new Church, the new St. Mary's Church, which has been erected in place of the old St. Mary's church, which had been torn down in 1968. Another church of the second parish was St. Augustine's Church, which was completed in 1970. Finally, in 1976 and 1988, St. Elizabeth's Church and St. Thomas' Church were completed. Furthermore, in 1963, the St. Michael pastoral care office was built.

Hofherrnweiler has its own Catholic church, <a href="Saint%20Boniface">St. Boniface's</a>, since 1904. The villages of Dewangen, Ebnat, Hofen, Waldhausen and Wasseralfingen had remained Catholic after reformation, so old parishes and churches persist there. The "Assumption of Mary" Church in Dewangen has an <a href="Gothic%20art">early Gothic</a> tower and a newly built nave (1875). <a href="Immaculate%20Conception">Mary's Immaculate Conception</a> Church in Ebnat was constructed in 1723; however the church was first mentioned in 1298.
Hofen's <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a>'s Church is a <a href="fortified%20church">fortified church</a>, whose current nave was built between 1762 and 1775. Alongside the church, the Late Gothic <a href="Odile%20of%20Alsace">St. Odile's</a> Chapel is standing, whose entrance has the year 1462 engraved upon it. Foundations of prior buildings have been dated to the 11th and 13th century.

St. Mary's Church of Unterkochen was first mentioned in 1248, and has served the Catholics of Aalen for a long time. Waldhausen's parish church of <a href="Saint%20Nicholas">St. Nicholas</a> was built between 1699 and 1716. Wasseralfingen at first was a <a href="chapel%20of%20ease">chapel of ease</a> for Hofen, but has since had its own chapel, <a href="Saint%20Stephen">St. Stephen</a>, built. It was presumably built in 1353 and remodeled in 1832. In 1834, a proper parish was established, which built a new St. Stephen's Church. This new building utilized the <a href="Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture">Romanesque Revival architecture</a> style and was built between 1881 and 1883, and has since remained the parish's landmark. Also, Fachsenfeld received its own church, named <a href="Sacred%20Heart">Sacred Heart</a> in 1895. All Catholic parishes within Aalen are today incorporated into four pastoral care units within the "Ostalb" Deanery of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Rottenburg-Stuttgart">Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart</a>; however these units also comprise some parishes outside of Aalen. Pastoral Care Unit two comprises the parishes of Essingen, Dewangen and Fachsenfeld, unit four comprises Hofen and Wasseralfingen, unit five comprises both parishes of Aalen's centre and Hofherrnweiler, unit five comprises Waldhausen, Ebnat, Oberkochen and Unterkochen.

In addition to the two major religions within Aalen, there are also <a href="free%20church">free church</a>es and other communities, including the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a>, the <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a>, the <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> and the <a href="New%20Apostolic%20Church">New Apostolic Church</a>.

Until the late 19th century, no <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s were documented within Aalen. In 1886 there were four Jews were living in Aalen, a number that rose to ten in 1900, fell to seven in 1905, and remained so until 1925. Upon the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, seven Jews, including two children, lived in Aalen. During the <a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> in 1938, the vitrines of the three Jewish shops in the town were smashed and their proprietors imprisoned for several weeks. After their release, most Aalen Jews emigrated. The last Jews of Aalen, Fanny Kahn, was forcibly resettled to <a href="Oberdorf%20am%20Ipf">Oberdorf am Ipf</a>, which had a large Jewish community. Today, a street of Aalen is named after her. The Jew Max Pfeffer returned from Brussels to Aalen in 1948 to continue his shop, but emigrated to Italy in 1967.

In Aalen, there is an Islamic <a href="Turkish-Islamic%20Union%20for%20Religious%20Affairs">Ditib</a> community, which maintains the "D.I.T.I.B. Mosque of Aalen (Central Mosque)" located at Ulmer Straße. The mosque's construction started on 30 August 2008. The <a href="Mill%C3%AE%20G%C3%B6r%C3%BC%C5%9F">Millî Görüş</a> organisation maintains the <a href="Mehmed%20II">Fatih</a> Mosque, as well at Ulmer Straße.

The present-day make up of Aalen was created on 21 June 1975 by the unification of the cities of Aalen and Wasseralfingen, with the initial name of "Aalen-Wasseralfingen". This annexation made Aalen's territory one third larger than its prior size. On 1 July 1975, the name "Aalen" was revived. Prior to this merger, the town of Aalen had already annexed the following municipalities:

During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and the <a href="early%20modern%20period">early modern period</a>, Aalen was just a small town with a few hundred inhabitants. The population grew slowly due to numerous wars, famines and epidemics. It was the beginning of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in the 19th century where Aalen's growth accelerated. Whereas in 1803, only 1,932 people inhabited the town, in 1905 it had already increased to 10,442. The number continued to rise and reached 15,890 in 1939.

The influx of refugees and <a href="Heimatvertriebene">ethnic Germans</a> from Germany's former eastern territories after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> pushed the population to 31,814 in 1961. The merger with Wasseralfingen on 21 June 1975 added 14,597 persons and resulted in a total population of 65,165 people. On 30 June 2005, the population, which was officially determined by the <a href="List%20of%20statistical%20offices%20in%20Germany">Statistical Office of Baden-Württemberg</a>, was 67,125.

The following overview shows how the population figures of the borough were ascertained. Until 1823, the figures are mostly estimates, thereafter census results or official updates by the state statistical office. Starting in 1871, the figures were determined by non-uniform method of tabulation using extrapolation.

On 31 December 2008, Aalen had precisely 66,058 inhabitants, of which 33,579 were female and 32,479 were male. The average age of Aalen's inhabitants rose from 40.5 years in 2000 to 42.4 in 2008. Within the borough, 6,312 foreigners resided, which is 9.56 percent. Of them, the largest percentage are from <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> (38 percent of all foreigners), the second largest group are from Italy (13 percent), followed by <a href="Croats">Croatians</a> (6 percent) and <a href="Serb">Serb</a>s (5 percent).

The number of married residents fell from 32,948 in 1996 to 31,357 in 2007, while the number of divorced residents rose in the same period from 2,625 to 3,859. The number of single residents slightly increased between 1996 and 2004 from 25,902 to 26,268 and fell slightly until 2007 to 26,147. The number of widowed residents fell from 5,036 in 1996 to 4,783 in 2007.

Aalen has arranged a <a href="municipal%20association">municipal association</a> with <a href="Essingen">Essingen</a> and <a href="H%C3%BCttlingen%2C%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Hüttlingen</a>.

Since the <a href="local%20election">local election</a> of 25 May 2014, the <a href="municipal%20council">town council</a> consists of 51 representatives having a term of five years. The seats are distributed as follows on parties and groups (changes refer to the second last election of 2004):

Since 1374, the mayor and the council maintain the government of the town. In the 16th century, the town had two, sometimes three mayors, and in 1552, the council had 13 members. Later, the head of the administration was reorganized several times. In the Württemberg era, the mayor's title was initially called "Bürgermeister", then from 1819 it was <a href="Schulthei%C3%9F">Schultheiß</a>, and since 1947 it is "Oberbürgermeister". The mayor is elected for a term of eight years, and he is chairman and a voting member of the council. He has one deputy with the official title of "Erster Bürgermeister" ("first mayor") and one with the official title of "Bürgermeister" ("mayor").

Heads of town in Aalen since 1802

Aalen's <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> depicts a black eagle with a red tongue on golden background, having a red shield on its breast with a bent silver <a href="eel">eel</a> on it. Eagle and eel were first acknowledged as Aalen's heraldic animals in the seal of 1385, with the eagle representing the town's <a href="imperial%20immediacy">imperial immediacy</a>. After the territorial reform, it was bestowed again by the <a href="Stuttgart%20%28region%29">Administrative District of Stuttgart</a> on 16 November 1976.

The coat of arms' <a href="blazon">blazon</a> reads: “In gold, the black imperial eagle, with a red breast shield applied to it, therein a bent silver eel” "(In Gold der schwarze Reichsadler, belegt mit einem roten Brustschild, darin ein gekrümmter silberner Aal)".

Aalen’s flag is striped in red and white and contains the coat of arms.

The origin of the town’s name is uncertain. <a href="Matth%C3%A4us%20Merian">Matthäus Merian</a> (1593–1650) presumed the name to originate from its location at the Kocher river, where "frequently eels are caught", while "Aal" is German for "eel". Other explanations point to Aalen as the garrison of an <a href="Ala%20%28Roman%20allied%20military%20unit%29">ala</a> during the Roman empire, respectively to an abridgement of the Roman name "Aquileia" as a potential name of the Roman fort, a name that nearby <a href="Heidenheim%20an%20der%20Brenz">Heidenheim an der Brenz</a> bore as well. Another interpretation points to a Celtic word aa meaning "water".

The "Twin Cities Society of Aalen" "(Städtepartnerschaftsverein Aalen e. V.)" promotes "friendly relations" between Aalen and its <a href="Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities">twin cities</a>, which comprises mutual exchanges of sports and cultural clubs, schools and other civic institutions. On the occasion of the <a href="%23Reichsst%C3%A4dter%20Tage">Reichsstädter Tage</a>, from 11 until 13 September 2009 the first conference of twinned cities was held.

Aalen has five twin cities:

On the occasion of the 1980 "Reichsstädter Tage", Aalen took over godparenthood for the more than 3000 ethnic Germans displaced from the <a href="Vy%C5%A1kov">Wischau</a> linguistic enclave. 972 of them settled in Aalen in 1946. The "Wischau Linguistic Enclave Society" "(Gemeinschaft Wischauer Sprachinsel)" regularly organises commemorative meetings in Aalen. Their traditional costumes are stored in the <a href="%23Old%20Town%20Hall">Old Town Hall</a>.

According to the 2007 municipal poll by the Baden-Württemberg chapter of the <a href="German%20Taxpayers%20Federation">German Taxpayers Federation</a>, municipal tax revenues totalling to 54,755 million Euros (2006) resp. 62,148 million Euros (2007) face the following debts:

The town operates the “Theatre of the Town of Aalen” "(Theater der Stadt Aalen)". Having been founded in 1991 and featuring six salaried actors, it is the newest as well as the smallest civic theatre in Germany. In addition to regular plays, it also offers four theatre clubs for all age levels. During the 2008/2009 season, 400 performances of ten productions attracted more than 21,000 visitors.

The town endowed the "Schubart Literary Award" "(Schubart-Literaturpreis)" in 1955 in tribute to <a href="Christian%20Friedrich%20Daniel%20Schubart">Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart</a>, who spent his childhood and youth in Aalen.

In 1977, a <a href="symphony%20orchestra">symphony orchestra</a> was founde in Aalen, which today is called "Aalener Sinfonieorchester", and consists mostly of instructors and students of the music school. It performs three public concerts annually: The “New Year’s Concert” in January, the “Symphony Concert” in July and a “Christmas Concert” in December. Beyond that, music festivals regularly take place in Aalen, like the <a href="Aalen%20Jazzfest">Aalen Jazzfest</a>.

The Aalen volunteer fire department has had a <a href="marching%20band">marching band</a> since 1952, whose roots date back to 1883.

In the central district of Aalen, there are two museums: The “Aalen <a href="Limes%20Germanicus">Limes</a> Museum" "(Limesmuseum Aalen)" is located at the place of the largest <a href="castra">Roman cavalry fort</a> north of the Alps until about 200 AD. It opened in 1964. The museum exhibits numerous objects from the Roman era. The ruins of the cavalry fort located beside the museum is open to museum visitors. Every other year, a Roman festival is held in the area of the museum (<a href="%23Roman%20Festival">see below</a>).

Also in Wasseralfingen, in the cemetery a memorial with the Polish inscription "To the victims of Hitler" which commemorates the deceased forced labourers buried there.

In 1954, on the "Schillerhöhe" hill the town erected a bell tower as a memorial to Aalen's victims of both world wars and to the <a href="Heimatvertriebene">displacement of ethnic Germans</a>. The tower was planned by <a href="Emil%20Leo">Emil Leo</a>, the bell was endowed by Carl Schneider. The tower is open on request.

For other churches in Aalen, see the <a href="%23Religions">Religions</a> section.

The Historic Town Hall was originally built in the 14th century. After the fire of 1634, it was re-constructed in 1636. This building received a clock from Lauterburg, and the Imperial City of <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> donated a <a href="Carillon">Carillon</a>. It features a figurine of the "Spy of Aalen" and historically displayed other figurines, however the latter ones were lost by a fire in 1884. Since then, the Spy resides inside the reconstructed tower and has become a symbol of the town. The building was used as the town hall until 1907. Since 1977, the Geological-Paleontological Museum resides in the Historic Town Hall.

According to legend, the citizens of Aalen owe the "Spy of Aalen" "(Spion von Aalen)" their town having been spared from destruction by the emperor's army:

The Imperial City of Aalen once was were in quarrel with the emperor, and his army was shortly before the gates to take the town. The people of Aalen got scared and thus dispatched their “most cunning” one out into the enemy’s camp to spy out the strength of their troops. Without any digression, he went straight into the middle of the enemy camp, which inescapably led to him being seized and presented to the emperor. When the emperor asked him what he had lost here, he answered in <a href="Swabian%20German">Swabian German</a>: "Don't frighten, high lords, I just want to peek how many cannons and other war things you've got, since I am the spy of Aalen". The emperor laughed upon such a blatancy and "acted" naïvety, steered him all through the camp and then sent him back home. Soon the emperor withdrew with his army as he thought a town such "wise guys" reside in deserved being spared.

The earliest record of the Old Town Hall was in 1575. Its outside wall features the oldest known coat of arms, which is of 1664. Until 1851, the building also housed the "Krone-Post" hotel, which coincided with being a station of the <a href="Thurn-und-Taxis-Post">Thurn und Taxis postal company</a>. It has housed many notable persons. Thus the so-called "Napoleon Window" with its "N" painted on reminds of the stay of French emperor <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in 1805. According to legend, he rammed his head so hard it bled on this window, when he was startled by the noise of his soldiers ridiculing the "Spy of Aalen". The building was used as Aalen's town hall from 1907 until 1975. Today it houses a cabaret café and the stage of the Theatre of the Town of Aalen. The town has adopted the "Wischau Linguistic Enclave Society" due to their godparenthood and stores their traditional constumes in the building.

The "Bürgerspital" ("Civic Asylum") is a <a href="Timber%20framing">timber-frame</a> house erected on "Spritzenhausplatz" ("Fire Engine House Square") in 1702. Until 1873, it was used as civic hospital, then, later as a retirement home. After a comprehensive renovation in 1980 it was turned into a senior citizen's community centre.

On a slope of the "Langert" mountain, south of the town, the "Limes-Thermen" ("Limes <a href="Thermae">Thermae</a>") <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a>s are located. They were built in ancient Roman style and opened in 1985. The health spa is supplied with water about .

The market square is the historic hub of Aalen and runs along about from the town hall in the south to the Historic Town Hall and the Old Town Hall in the north, where it empties into "Radgasse" alley. Since 1809, it is site of the weekly market on Wednesday and Saturday. About in front of the "Reichsstädter Brunnen" fountain at the town hall, the coats of arms of Aalen, its twinned cities and of the Wischau linguistic enclave are paved into the street as mosaic.

In 1705, for the water supply of Aalen a well casing was erected at the northern point of the market square, in front of the Historic Town Hall. It was a present of duke <a href="Eberhard%20Louis%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Eberhard Louis</a>. The fountain bore a statue of emperor <a href="Joseph%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph I.</a>, who was enthroned in 1705 and in 1707 renewed Aalen's Imperial City privileges. The fountain was supplied via a wooden pipe. Excessive water was dissipated through ditches branched from Kocher river. When in the early 1870s Aalen's water network was constructed, the fountain was replaced by a smaller fountain about distant. In 1975, the old market fountain was re-erected in baroque style. It bears a replica of the emperor's statue, with the original statue exhibited in the new town hall's lobby. The <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> casing plates depict the 1718 coat of arms of the Duchy of Württemberg and the coats of arms of Aalen and of the merged municipalities.

The "Reichsstädter Brunnen" fountain ("Imperial Civic Fountain") is located in front of the town hall at the southern point of the market square. It was created by sculptor <a href="Fritz%20Nuss">Fritz Nuss</a> in 1977 to commemorate Aalen's time as an Imperial City (1360–1803). On its circumference is a <a href="frieze">frieze</a> showing bronze figurines illustrating the town's history.

The "Radgasse" ("Wheel Alley") features Aalen's oldest façade. Originally a small pond was on its side. The buildings were erected between 1659 and 1662 for peasants with citizenry privileges and renovated in the mid-1980s. The namesake for the alley was the "Wheel" tavern, which was to be found at the site of today's address "Radgasse 15".

The former iron ore pit "Wilhelm" at Braunenberg hill was converted into the "Tiefer Stollen" tourist mine in order to remind of the old-day miners' efforts and to maintain it as a memorial of early industrialisation in the Aalen area. It has a mining museum open for visitors, and a <a href="mine%20railway">mine railway</a> takes visitors deep into the mountain. The Town of Aalen, a sponsorship association, and many citizens volunteered several thousand hours of labour to put the mine into its current state. As far as possible, things were left in the original state. In 1989, a sanitary gallery was established where respiratory diseases are treated within rest cures. Thus the Aalen village of Röthard, where the gallery is located, was awarded the title of "Place with sanitary gallery service" in 2004.

The Aalen Observatory was built in 1969 as school observatory for the Schubart <a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">Gymnasium</a>. In 2001, it was converted to a public observatory.

Alois Alzheimer

Aloysius Alzheimer (; ; 14 June 1864 – 19 December 1915), known as Alois Alzheimer, was a German <a href="psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> and <a href="neuropathologist">neuropathologist</a> and a colleague of <a href="Emil%20Kraepelin">Emil Kraepelin</a>. Alzheimer is credited with identifying the first published case of "presenile dementia", which Kraepelin would later identify as <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

Aloysius Alzheimer was born in <a href="Marktbreit">Marktbreit</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a> on 14 June 1864. His father served in the office of <a href="notary%20public">notary public</a> in the family's hometown. 

The Alzheimers moved when Alois was still young in order to give their children an opportunity to attend the Royal Humanistic Gymnasium. Later, Alois studied medicine at <a href="Aschaffenburg">Aschaffenburg</a> and at the universities of <a href="University%20of%20T%C3%BCbingen">Tübingen</a>, <a href="Humboldt%20University%20Berlin">Berlin</a>, and <a href="University%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a>. In his final year of school he was on the fencing team and a member of a fraternity, and even received a fine for disturbing the peace while out with his team. 

In April 1884, he married Cecille Simonette Nathalie Geisenheimer, with whom he had three children. Cecille died in 1901. In 1887, Alois Alzheimer graduated from Würzburg with a degree in medicine.

The following year, he spent five months assisting mentally ill women before he took an office in the city mental asylum in <a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main">Frankfurt am Main</a>, the Städtische Anstalt für Irre und Epileptische (Asylum for Lunatics and Epileptics). , a noted psychiatrist, was the dean of the asylum. Another neurologist, <a href="Franz%20Nissl">Franz Nissl</a>, began to work in the same asylum with Alzheimer. Together, they conducted research on the pathology of the nervous system, specifically the normal and pathological anatomy of the cerebral cortex. Alzheimer was the co-founder and co-publisher of the journal "Zeitschrift für die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie", though he never wrote a book that he could call his own.

While at the Frankfurt asylum, Alzheimer also met <a href="Emil%20Kraepelin">Emil Kraepelin</a>, one of the best-known German psychiatrists of the time. Kraepelin became a mentor to Alzheimer, and the two worked very closely for the next several years. When Kraepelin moved to Munich to work at the Royal Psychiatric Hospital in 1903, he invited Alzheimer to join him. 

At the time, Kraepelin was doing clinical research on psychosis in senile patients; Alzheimer, on the other hand, was more interested in the lab work of senile illnesses. The two men would face many challenges involving the politics of the psychiatric community. For example, both formal and informal arrangements would be made among psychiatrists at asylums and universities to receive cadavers. In 1908 he was a professor at the <a href="Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University">Ludwig Maximilian University</a> and the Neurological and Psychiatric Clinic of the Friedrich-Wilhelm University from 1912 until he fell ill.

In 1901, Alzheimer observed a patient at the Frankfurt Asylum named <a href="Auguste%20Deter">Auguste Deter</a>. The 51-year-old patient had strange behavioral symptoms, including a loss of short-term memory; she became his obsession over the coming years. Auguste Deter was a victim of the politics of the time in the psychiatric community; the Frankfurt asylum was too expensive for her husband. Herr Deter made several requests to have his wife moved to a less expensive facility, but Alzheimer intervened in these requests. Ms. Deter remained at the Frankfurt asylum, where Alzheimer had made a deal to receive her records and brain upon her death. 

On 8 April 1906, Frau Deter died, and Alzheimer had her medical records and brain brought to Munich where he was working in Kraepelin's laboratory. With two Italian physicians, he used the staining techniques of Bielschowsky to identify <a href="amyloid">amyloid</a> plaques and <a href="neurofibrillary%20tangles">neurofibrillary tangles</a>. These brain anomalies would become identifiers of what later became known as <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

Alzheimer discussed his findings on the brain pathology and symptoms of presenile dementia publicly on 3November 1906, at the Tübingen meeting of the Southwest German Psychiatrists. The attendees at this lecture seemed uninterested in what he had to say. The lecturer that followed Alzheimer was to speak on the topic of "compulsive masturbation", which the audience was so eagerly awaiting that they sent Alzheimer away without any questions or comments on his discovery of the pathology of a type of senile dementia. 

Following the lecture, Alzheimer published a short paper summarizing his lecture; in 1907 he wrote a larger paper detailing the disease and his findings. The disease would not become known as Alzheimer's disease until 1910, when Kraepelin named it so in the chapter on "Presenile and Senile Dementia" in the 8th edition of his "Handbook of Psychiatry". By 1911, his description of the disease was being used by European physicians to diagnose patients in the US.

American <a href="Solomon%20Carter%20Fuller">Solomon Carter Fuller</a> gave a report similar to that of Alzheimer at a lecture five months before Alzheimer. <a href="Oskar%20Fischer">Oskar Fischer</a> was a fellow German psychiatrist, 12 years Alzheimer's junior, who reported 12 cases of senile dementia in 1907 around the time that Alzheimer published his short paper summarizing his lecture.

The two men had different interpretations of the disease, but due to Alzheimer's short life, they never had the opportunity to meet and discuss their ideas.

In August 1912, Alzheimer fell ill on the train on his way to the <a href="University%20of%20Breslau">University of Breslau</a>, where he had been appointed professor of psychiatry in July 1912. Most probably he had a <a href="streptococcal">streptococcal</a> infection and subsequent <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a> leading to valvular heart disease, <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a> and <a href="kidney%20failure">kidney failure</a>. He never recovered completely from this illness. 

He died of heart failure on 19December 1915, aged 51, in <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a>, <a href="Silesia%20Province">Silesia</a> (present-day <a href="Wroc%C5%82aw">Wrocław</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>). He was buried on 23 December 1915 next to his wife in the <a href="Frankfurt%20Main%20Cemetery">Hauptfriedhof in Frankfurt am Main</a>.

In the early 1990s, critics began to question Alzheimer's findings and form their own hypotheses based on Alzheimer's notes and papers. Amaducci and colleagues hypothesized that Auguste Deter had <a href="metachromatic%20leukodystrophy">metachromatic leukodystrophy</a>, a rare condition in which accumulations of fats affect the cells that produce myelin. 

Another hypothesis offered by Claire O'Brien was that Auguste Deter actually had a vascular dementing disease. Through extremely fortunate circumstances the original microscope preparations on which Alzheimer based his description of the disease were rediscovered in 1998 in Munich, and his findings could thus be reevaluated. The slides confirmed that Auguste Deter did in fact have what is now known as Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer was known for having a variety of medical interests including vascular diseases of the brain, early dementia, brain tumors, <a href="forensic%20psychiatry">forensic psychiatry</a> and <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>. Alzheimer was a leading specialist in histopathology in Europe. His colleagues knew him to be a dedicated professor and cigar smoker.

<doc id="2384" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2384" title="Aedile">
Aedile

Aedile ( , from "<a href="Glossary%20of%20ancient%20Roman%20religion%23aedes">aedes</a>," "temple edifice") was an office of the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>. Based in <a href="Rome%23Monarchy.2C%20republic.2C%20empire">Rome</a>, the aediles were responsible for maintenance of public buildings ("aedēs") and regulation of public <a href="festival">festival</a>s. They also had powers to enforce public order.

There were two pairs of aediles: the first were the "plebeian aediles" (Latin "aediles plebis") and possession of this office was limited to plebeians; the other two were "curule aediles" (Latin "aediles curules"), open to both plebeians and patricians, in alternating years. An "aedilis curulis" was classified as a "magister curulis".

The office of the aedilis was generally held by young men intending to follow the <a href="cursus%20honorum">cursus honorum</a> to high political office, traditionally after their <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a>ship but before their <a href="praetor">praetor</a>ship. It was not a compulsory part of the cursus, and hence a former quaestor could be elected to the praetorship without having held the position of aedile. However, it was an advantageous position to hold because it demonstrated the aspiring politician's commitment to public service, as well as giving him the opportunity to hold public festivals and games, an excellent way to increase his name recognition and popularity.

The plebeian aediles were created in the same year as the <a href="Tribune">Tribunes of the People</a> (494 BC). Originally intended as assistants to the tribunes, they guarded the rights of the plebs with respect to their headquarters, the Temple of Ceres. Subsequently, they assumed responsibility for maintenance of the city's buildings as a whole. Their duties at first were simply ministerial. They were the assistants to the tribunes in whatever matters that the tribunes might entrust to them, although most matters with which they were entrusted were of minimal importance. Around 446 BC, they were given the authority to care for the decrees of the senate ("senatus consulta"). When a "senatus consultum" was passed, it would be transcribed into a document, and deposited in the public treasury, the "<a href="Aerarium">Aerarium</a>". They were given this power because the <a href="Roman%20consul">Roman Consuls</a>, who had held this power before, arbitrarily suppressed and altered the documents. They also maintained the acts of the <a href="Plebeian%20Council">Plebeian Council</a> (popular assembly), the "plebiscites". Plebiscites, once passed, were also transcribed into a physical document for storage. While their powers grew over time, it is not always easy to distinguish the difference between their powers, and those of the <a href="Roman%20censor">Roman Censors</a>. Occasionally, if a Censor was unable to carry out one of his tasks, an Aedile would perform the task instead.

According to <a href="Livy">Livy</a> (vi. 42), after the passing of the <a href="Lex%20Licinia%20Sextia">Licinian rogations</a> in 367 BC, an extra day was added to the Roman games; the plebeian aediles refused to bear the additional expense, whereupon the patricians offered to undertake it, on condition that they were admitted to the aedileship. The plebeians accepted the offer, and accordingly two "curule" aediles were appointed—at first from the patricians alone, then from patricians and plebeians in turn, lastly, from either—at the <a href="Tribal%20Assembly">Tribal Assembly</a> under the presidency of the consul. Curule Aediles, as formal magistrates, held certain honors that Plebeian Aediles (who were not technically magistrates), did not hold. Besides having the right to sit on a <a href="Curule%20Chair">Curule Chair</a> ("sella curulis") and to wear a <a href="toga">toga praetexta</a>, the Curule Aediles also held the power to issue edicts ("jus edicendi"). These edicts often pertained to matters such as the regulation of the public markets, or what we might call "economic regulation". <a href="Livy">Livy</a> suggests, perhaps incorrectly, that both Curule as well as Plebeian Aediles were sacrosanct. Although the curule aediles always ranked higher than the plebeian, their functions gradually approximated and became practically identical. Within five days after the beginning of their terms, the four Aediles (two Plebeian, two Curule) were required to determine, by lot or by agreement among themselves, what parts of the city each should hold jurisdiction over.

There was a distinction between the two sets of Aediles when it came to public festivals. Some festivals were Plebeian in nature, and thus were under the superintendence of Plebeian Aediles. Other festivals were supervised exclusively by the Curule Aediles, and it was often with these festivals that the Aediles would spend lavishly. This was often done so as to secure the support of voters in future elections. Because Aediles were not reimbursed for any of their public expenditures, most individuals who sought the office were independently wealthy. Since this office was a stepping stone to higher office and the Senate, it helped to ensure that only wealthy individuals (mostly landowners) would win election to high office. These extravagant expenditures began shortly after the end of <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a>, and increased as the spoils returned from Rome's new eastern conquests. Even the decadence of the emperors rarely surpassed that of the Aediles under the Republic, as could have been seen during <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar's</a> Aedileship.

Plebeian Aediles were elected by the <a href="Plebeian%20Council">Plebeian Council</a> (popular assembly), usually while under the presidency of a <a href="Plebeian%20Tribune">Plebeian Tribune</a>. Curule Aediles were elected by the <a href="Tribal%20Assembly">Tribal Assembly</a>, usually while under the presidency of a <a href="Roman%20Consul">Roman Consul</a>. Since the Plebeian Aediles were elected by the <a href="Plebeians">Plebeians</a> (commoners), rather than by all of the <a href="SPQR">People of Rome</a> (Plebeians as well as members of the <a href="Patrician%20%28Ancient%20Rome%29">Patrician</a> aristocracy), they were not technically <a href="Roman%20magistrate">magistrates</a>. Before the passage of the "<a href="Lex%20Villia%20Annalis">lex annalis</a>", individuals could run for the Aedileship by the time they turned twenty-seven. After the passage of this law in 180 BC, a higher age was set, probably thirty-five. By the 1st century BC, Aediles were elected in July, and took office on the first day in January.

<a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> (<a href="de%20Legibus">Legg.</a> iii. 3, 7) divides these functions under three heads:

(1) Care of the city:
the repair and preservation of temples, sewers and aqueducts; street cleansing and paving; regulations regarding traffic, dangerous animals and dilapidated buildings; precautions against fire; superintendence of baths and taverns; enforcement of <a href="sumptuary">sumptuary</a> laws; punishment of gamblers and usurers; the care of public morals generally, including the prevention of foreign superstitions and the registration of <a href="meretrix">meretrices</a>. They also punished those who had too large a share of the <a href="ager%20publicus">ager publicus</a>, or kept too many cattle on the state pastures.

(2) Care of provisions:
investigation of the quality of the articles supplied and the correctness of weights and measures; the purchase of grain for disposal at a low price in case of necessity.

(3) Care of the games: 
superintendence and organization of the public games, as well as of those given by themselves and private individuals (e.g. at funerals) at their own expense. 
Ambitious persons often spent enormous sums in this manner to win the popular favor with a view to official advancement.

In 44 BC <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> added two plebeian aediles, called "Cereales", whose special duty was the care of the cereal (grain) supply. Under <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> the office lost much of its importance, its judicial functions and the care of the games being transferred to the praetor, while its city responsibilities were limited by the appointment of a <a href="praefectus%20urbi">praefectus urbi</a>. Augustus took for himself its powers over various religious duties. By stripping it of its powers over temples, Augustus effectively destroyed the office, by taking from it its original function. After this point, few people were willing to hold such a powerless office, and Augustus was even known to compel individuals into holding the office. Augustus accomplished this by randomly selecting former tribunes and quaestors for the office. Future emperors would continue to dilute the power of the office by transferring its powers to newly created offices. However, the office did retain some powers over licentiousness and disorder, in particular over the baths and brothels, as well as the registration of prostitutes. In the 3rd century, it disappeared altogether.

Under the Empire, Roman colonies and cities often had officials with powers similar to those of the republican aediles, although their powers widely varied. It seems as though they were usually chosen annually. Today in <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> the county mayor can still be referred to as 'edil' (e.g. 'O edil de Coimbra', meaning 'the mayor of <a href="Coimbra">Coimbra</a>'), a way of reference used also in Romania for any mayors (ex. 'Edil al Bucureștiului', meaning 'mayor of Bucharest'). In Spain (and Latin America) the members of municipal councils are called concejales or ediles.

In his play "<a href="Coriolanus">Coriolanus</a>", <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> references the aediles. However, they are minor characters, and their chief role is to serve as policemen.

American Airlines

American Airlines, Inc. (AA) is an American airline headquartered in <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a>, within the <a href="Dallas-Fort%20Worth%20metroplex">Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex</a>. It is the <a href="World%27s%20largest%20airlines">world's largest airline</a> when measured by fleet size, revenue, scheduled passenger-kilometers flown, and number of destinations served. American together with its regional partners operates an extensive international and domestic network with an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries.

American Airlines is a founding member of <a href="Oneworld">Oneworld</a> alliance, the third largest airline alliance in the world and coordinates fares, services, and scheduling with alliance partners <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a>, <a href="Iberia%20%28airline%29">Iberia</a>, and <a href="Finnair">Finnair</a> in the transatlantic market and with <a href="Cathay%20Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a> and <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a> in the transpacific market. Regional service is operated by independent and subsidiary carriers under the brand name of <a href="American%20Eagle%20%28airline%20brand%29">American Eagle</a>.

American operates out of ten hubs located in <a href="Dallas/Fort%20Worth%20International%20Airport">Dallas/Fort Worth</a>, <a href="Charlotte%20Douglas%20International%20Airport">Charlotte</a>, <a href="O%27Hare%20International%20Airport">Chicago-O'Hare</a>, <a href="Philadelphia%20International%20Airport">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Miami%20International%20Airport">Miami</a>, <a href="Phoenix%20Sky%20Harbor%20International%20Airport">Phoenix</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%20Washington%20National%20Airport">Washington, DC-National</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles%20International%20Airport">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">New York-JFK</a>, and <a href="LaGuardia%20Airport">New York-LaGuardia</a>. American operates its primary maintenance base at <a href="Tulsa%20International%20Airport">Tulsa International Airport</a> in addition to the maintenance locations located at its hubs. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is American's largest passenger carrying hub handling 51.1 million passengers annually with an average of 140,000 passengers daily. The company as of 2015 employs over 113,300 people. Through the airline's parent company, <a href="American%20Airlines%20Group">American Airlines Group</a>, it is publicly traded under NASDAQ: AAL with a market capitalization of about $25 billion as of 2017.

American Airlines was started in 1930 via a union of more than eighty small airlines.

The two organizations from which American Airlines was originated were <a href="Robertson%20Aircraft%20Corporation">Robertson Aircraft Corporation</a> and <a href="Colonial%20Air%20Transport">Colonial Air Transport</a>. The former was first formed in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company <a href="The%20Aviation%20Corporation">The Aviation Corporation</a>. This in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as <a href="American%20Airways">American Airways</a>. In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system, and was renamed American Airlines. Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing <a href="Trans%20World%20Airlines">Trans World Airlines</a> in 2001.

In 2011, due to a downturn in the airline industry, American Airlines' parent company <a href="AMR%20Corporation">AMR Corporation</a> filed for bankruptcy protection. In 2013, <a href="US%20Airways">US Airways</a> and American Airlines merged. Eventually operations were merged under one operating certificate to create the largest United States airline which kept the American Airlines brand name.

American Airlines is headquartered in <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a>, adjacent to the <a href="Dallas/Fort%20Worth%20International%20Airport">Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport</a>. The headquarters is located in two office buildings in the CentrePort office complex and these buildings together have about of space. over 4,300 employees work at this complex.

Before it was headquartered in Texas, American Airlines was headquartered at 633 Third Avenue in the <a href="Murray%20Hill%2C%20Manhattan">Murray Hill</a> area of <a href="Midtown%20Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>, New York City. In 1979 American moved its headquarters to a site at <a href="Dallas/Fort%20Worth%20International%20Airport">Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport</a>, which affected up to 1,300 jobs. <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor of New York City</a> <a href="Ed%20Koch">Ed Koch</a> described the move as a "betrayal" of New York City. American moved to two leased office buildings in <a href="Grand%20Prairie%2C%20Texas">Grand Prairie, Texas</a>. On January 17, 1983, the airline finished moving into a $150 million ($ when adjusted for inflation), facility in Fort Worth; $147 million (about $ when adjusted for inflation) in Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport bonds financed the headquarters. The airline began leasing the facility from the airport, which owns the facility.

As of 2015 American Airlines is the corporation with the largest presence in Fort Worth.

In 2015, the airline announced it will build a new headquarters in Fort Worth. Groundbreaking began in the spring of 2016 and occupancy is scheduled for summer 2019. The airline plans to house 5,000 new workers in the building.

It will be located on a property adjacent to the airline's flight academy and conference and training center, west of <a href="Texas%20State%20Highway%20360">Texas State Highway 360</a>, west from the current headquarters. The airline will lease a total of from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and this area will include the headquarters.Construction of the new headquarters is scheduled to occur after the demolition of the Sabre facility.

The airline considered developing a new headquarters in <a href="Irving%2C%20Texas">Irving</a>, on the <a href="Texas%20Stadium">Texas Stadium</a> site, before deciding to keep the headquarters in Fort Worth.

As of November 2013 American Airlines and American Eagle received $10,011,836 in annual federal subsidies for <a href="Essential%20Air%20Service">Essential Air Service</a>s. These subsidies are awarded by public tender and ensure that small, rural airports can be connected to the national air network.


Violations occurring over a 4½ year period—from October 1993 to July 1998—targeted American Airlines for using high-sulfur fuel in motor vehicles at 10 major airports around the country. Under the federal <a href="Clean%20Air%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Clean Air Act</a> high sulfur fuel cannot be used in motor vehicles. American Airlines promptly identified and corrected these violations of the Clean Air Act.

American Airlines' wastewater treatment plant <a href="recycle">recycle</a>s water used at the base to wash aircraft, process rinse water tanks, and irrigate landscape. That alone has saved almost $1 million since 2002. In addition to that, American Airlines has also won the award for the reduction of <a href="hazardous%20waste">hazardous waste</a> that saved them $229,000 after a $2,000 investment. A bar code system is used to track hazardous waste. It has led to reduction of waste by 50 percent since 2000.

American Airlines is title sponsor of two basketball venues: <a href="American%20Airlines%20Center">American Airlines Center</a> (<a href="Dallas%20Mavericks">Dallas Mavericks</a>), (<a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a>) and <a href="American%20Airlines%20Arena">American Airlines Arena</a> (<a href="Miami%20Heat">Miami Heat</a>).

The company sponsors several professional sports teams:

In 1931, Goodrich Murphy, an American employee, designed the AA logo. The logo was redesigned by <a href="Massimo%20Vignelli">Massimo Vignelli</a> in 1967. Thirty years later, in 1997, American Airlines was able to make its logo Internet-compatible by buying the domain AA.com. "AA" is also American's two-letter <a href="IATA">IATA</a> <a href="airline%20codes">airline designator</a>.

On January 16, 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign with FutureBrand dubbed, "A New American". This included a new logo replacing the logo used since 1967. American Airlines calls the new logo the "Flight Symbol, incorporating the eagle, star, and the letter “A” of the classic logo.

American's early <a href="aircraft%20livery">liveries</a> varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s, featuring an <a href="eagle">eagle</a> painted on the fuselage. The eagle became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of <a href="Envoy%20Air">American Eagle Airlines</a>. Propeller aircraft featured an <a href="international%20orange">international orange</a> lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.

In the late 1960s, American commissioned designer <a href="Massimo%20Vignelli">Massimo Vignelli</a> to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple "AA" logo, without an eagle, on the tail; instead, Vignelli created a highly stylized eagle, which remained the company's logo until 2013. In 1999, American painted a new <a href="Boeing%20757">Boeing 757</a> (N679AN) in its 1959 international orange livery. One <a href="Boeing%20777">Boeing 777</a> and one Boeing 757 were painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail, in support of <a href="Susan%20G.%20Komen%20for%20the%20Cure">Susan G. Komen for the Cure</a>. One Boeing 757 is painted with a yellow ribbon on the tailfin on the aircraft and on the side of the body says "Flagship Freedom". American Eagle, the airline's regional airline has the same special livery on ERJ-145 aircraft.
On January 17, 2013, American unveiled a new livery. Before then, American had been the only major U.S. airline to leave most of its aircraft surfaces unpainted. This was because C. R. Smith hated painted aircraft, and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Robert "Bob" Crandall later justified the distinctive natural metal finish by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs.

In January 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign dubbed, "The New American". In addition to a new logo, American Airlines introduced a new livery for its fleet. The airline calls the new livery and branding "a clean and modern update". The current design features an abstract American flag on the tail, along with a silver-painted fuselage, as a throw-back to the old livery. The new design was painted by <a href="Leading%20Edge%20Aviation%20Services">Leading Edge Aviation Services</a> in <a href="California">California</a>. Doug Parker, the incoming CEO indicated that the new livery could be short-lived, stating that "maybe we need to do something slightly different than that ... The only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle, which kind of makes it confusing, so that gives us an opportunity, actually, to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint".

In the end, American let its employees decide the new livery's fate. On an internal website for employees, American posted two options, one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery. All of the <a href="American%20Airlines%20Group">American Airlines Group</a> employees (including US Airways and other affiliates) were able to vote. American ultimately decided to keep the new look. Parker announced that American would keep a US Airways heritage aircraft in the fleet, with plans to add a heritage TWA aircraft and a heritage American plane with the old livery.


American currently operates ten hubs across the continental U.S.



American operated interchange flight services in conjunction with Alaska Airlines during the 1970s between Texas and Alaska during the construction of the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. This interchange agreement allowed for single, no change of aircraft service between Houston, Texas and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Anchorage, Alaska and Fairbanks, Alaska. The round trip routing of this interchange flight was Houston-Dallas/Fort Worth-Seattle-Anchorage-Fairbanks with Seattle, Washington serving as the interchange point where flight and cabin crews were changed from one airline to the other. Boeing 727-200 jetliners provided by both American and Alaska Airlines were utilized to provide this interchange service.

American Airlines is the only US carrier that flies to <a href="Ernesto%20Cortissoz%20International%20Airport">Barranquilla</a>, <a href="Tancredo%20Neves%20International%20Airport">Belo Horizonte</a>, <a href="Brasilia%20International%20Airport">Brasilia</a>, <a href="Alfonso%20Bonilla%20Aragon%20International%20Airport">Cali</a>, <a href="Hugo%20Chavez%20International%20Airport">Cap-Haitien</a>, <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar%20International%20Airport%20%28Venezuela%29">Caracas</a>, <a href="Jaime%20Gonzalez%20Airport">Cienfuegos</a>, <a href="Martinique%20Aime%20Cesaire%20International%20Airport">Fort-de-France</a>, <a href="Jose%20Joaquin%20de%20Olmedo%20International%20Airport">Guayaquil</a>, <a href="El%20Alto%20International%20Airport">La Paz</a>, <a href="Eduardo%20Gomes%20International%20Airport">Manaus</a>, <a href="La%20Chinita%20International%20Airport">Maracaibo</a>, <a href="Carrasco%20International%20Airport">Montevideo</a>, <a href="Pointe-a-Pitre%20International%20Airport">Pointe-a-Pitre</a>, <a href="San%20Salvador%20Airport">San Salvador (Bahamas)</a>, <a href="Viru%20Viru%20International%20Airport">Santa Cruz de la Sierra</a> and <a href="Juan%20Gualberto%20Gomez%20Airport">Varadero</a>.

Dining options include free snacks, beverages, and alcohol on all flights, with three-course meals offered on flights 900 miles (1,448 km) or longer (select routes under 900 miles offer meal service).

On December 9, 2015, American announced a new Premium Economy product for most long-haul widebody aircraft. This new product will debut on the new 787-9s in late 2016 and will be available on the new A350s in 2018. It will also be retrofitted to all other widebody aircraft within the next three years, excluding 767s due to their upcoming retirement. The seats will be wider than standard Main Cabin seats and will offer 38" of pitch, 2" more than Main Cabin Extra seats, as well as a footrest. Premium Economy customers will also get two free checked bags, priority boarding, and enhanced food and drink service including free alcohol. This product will make American Airlines the first U.S. carrier to offer a four-cabin aircraft.

American's economy plus product (not to be confused with premium economy), Main Cabin Extra, is available on most of the mainline fleet and <a href="American%20Eagle%20%28airline%20brand%29">American Eagle</a> regional aircraft with more than 50 seats. Exceptions include a majority of former <a href="US%20Airways">US Airways</a> aircraft (as of May 2015), <a href="US%20Airways%20Express">US Airways Express</a> regional aircraft, and a handful of 777-200ERs that have yet to be retrofitted. Seats range from 17.2–18.5 inches (44–47 cm) in width and have 34–38 inches (86–97 cm) of pitch, which is 4–6 more inches of pitch offered in regular economy seating. American will retain Main Cabin Extra when the new Premium Economy product enters service in late 2016.

Main Cabin is American's economy product, and is found on all mainline and regional aircraft in its fleet. Seats range from 17–18.5 inches (43–47 cm) in width and have 30–32 inches (76–81 cm) of pitch. Newer aircraft, including all Boeing 777-300ER, refurbished Boeing 777-200ER's, all Boeing 787 Dreamliners, all Airbus A330s, all newly delivered Airbus A319s and Boeing 737s, and most newly delivered Airbus A321s, include seatback TVs, featuring AVOD in each seat.

American's basic economy product, Basic Economy, is available on select routes. It is American's lowest main cabin fare. Basic economy is located in main cabin, but comes with restrictions. These restrictions include assigned seat at check in, no access to overhead bins, no upgrades or refunds, and boarding in the last group.

American Airlines marketed increased legroom in economy class as "More Room Throughout Coach", also referred to as "MRTC" starting in February 2000. Two rows of economy class seats were removed on Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft. Amid financial losses, this scheme was discontinued in 2004.

In May 2017, American announced they would be adding more seats to some of its Boeing 737 Max jetliners and reducing overall legroom in the basic economy class. The last three rows will lose two inches; going from the current 31 to 29 inches. The remainder of the economy cabin will have 30 inches of legroom. This compares to Jet Blue with 34 inches of legroom and Spirit with 28 inches.

AAdvantage is the <a href="frequent%20flyer%20program">frequent flyer program</a> for American Airlines. It was launched on May 1, 1981, and it remains the largest frequent flyer program with over 67 million members as of 2011.

The Admirals Club was conceived by AA president C.R. Smith as a marketing promotion shortly after he was made an honorary <a href="Texas%20Ranger%20Division">Texas Ranger</a>. Inspired by the <a href="Kentucky%20colonel">Kentucky colonel</a>s and other <a href="Title%20of%20honor">honorary</a> organizations, Smith decided to make particularly valued passengers "admirals" of the "Flagship fleet" (AA called its aircraft "Flagships" at the time). The list of Admirals included many celebrities, politicians, and other VIPs, as well as more "ordinary" customers who had been particularly loyal to the airline.

There was no physical Admirals Club until shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. During the airport's construction, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia had an upper-level lounge set aside for press conferences and business meetings. At one such press conference, he noted that the entire terminal was being offered for lease to airline tenants; after a reporter asked whether the lounge would be leased as well, LaGuardia replied that it would, and a vice president of AA immediately offered to lease the premises. The airline then procured a liquor license and began operating the lounge as the "Admirals Club" in 1939.

The second Admirals Club opened at Washington National Airport. Because it was illegal to sell alcohol in Virginia at the time, the club contained refrigerators for the use of its members, so they could store their own liquor at the airport. For many years, membership in the Admirals Club (and most other airline lounges) was by the airline's invitation. After a passenger sued for discrimination, the Club (and most other airline lounges) switched to a paid membership program.

Though affiliated with the Admirals Club and staffed by many of the same employees, the Flagship Lounge is a separate lounge specifically designed for customers flying in First Class on transcontinental domestic flights and international flights, as well as AAdvantage Executive Platinum and Oneworld Emerald frequent flyers. Flagship Lounges are now available at four airports: Chicago-O'Hare, London-Heathrow, Los Angeles, and New York-JFK. American also previously offered a Flagship Lounge in Miami from 2000 to 2002, and again from 2009. It plans to open again in 2017.

Antidepressant

Antidepressants are drugs used for the treatment of <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">major depressive disorder</a> and other conditions, including <a href="dysthymia">dysthymia</a>, <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety disorder</a>s, <a href="obsessive%20compulsive%20disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>, <a href="eating%20disorder">eating disorder</a>s, <a href="chronic%20pain">chronic pain</a>, <a href="neuropathic%20pain">neuropathic pain</a> and, in some cases, <a href="dysmenorrhoea">dysmenorrhoea</a>, snoring, <a href="migraine">migraine</a>, <a href="attention-deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder">attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD), <a href="addiction">addiction</a>, <a href="substance%20dependence">dependence</a>, and <a href="sleep%20disorder">sleep disorder</a>s. They may be prescribed alone or in combination with other medications.

The most important classes of antidepressants are the <a href="selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a>s (SSRIs), <a href="serotonin%E2%80%93norepinephrine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>s (SNRIs), <a href="tricyclic%20antidepressant">tricyclic antidepressant</a>s (TCAs), <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">monoamine oxidase inhibitor</a>s (MAOIs), <a href="reversible%20inhibitors%20of%20monoamine%20oxidase%20A">reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A</a> (RIMAs), <a href="tetracyclic%20antidepressant">tetracyclic antidepressant</a>s (TeCAs), and <a href="noradrenergic%20and%20specific%20serotonergic%20antidepressant">noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant</a> (NaSSAs). <a href="Hypericum%20perforatum%23Major%20depressive%20disorder">St John's wort</a> is also used in the treatment of depression.

One theory regarding the cause of depression is that it is characterized by an overactive <a href="Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal%20axis">hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis</a> (HPA axis) that resembles the neuro-endocrine response to stress. These HPA axis abnormalities participate in the development of depressive symptoms, and antidepressants may serve to regulate HPA axis function.

For depression, the <a href="Hamilton%20Depression%20Rating%20Scale">Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</a> (HAM-D) is often used to measure the severity of depression. The maximum score for the 17-item HAM-D questionnaire is 52; the higher the score, the more severe the depression.

The UK <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Health%20and%20Care%20Excellence">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressant treatment should be considered for:

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be used in combination with psychosocial interventions in most cases, should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are typically better tolerated than other antidepressants.

<a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors that include severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.

Conflicting results have arisen from studies analyzing the efficacy of antidepressants by comparisons to placebo in people with acute mild to moderate depression. Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic (<a href="dysthymia">dysthymia</a>) or severe.

Researchers <a href="Irving%20Kirsch">Irving Kirsch</a> and Thomas Moore have contested the pharmacological activity of antidepressants in the relief of depression, and state that the evidence is most consistent a role as active <a href="placebo">placebo</a>s. Their study consisted of a meta analysis incorporating data from both published studies and unpublished data obtained from the FDA via a <a href="Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Freedom of Information Act</a> request. Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, but not one that is clinically significant. In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.

A 2017 meta analysis comparing the efficacy of SSRIs against placebo found the mean reduction in <a href="Hamilton%20Rating%20Scale%20for%20Depression">Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression</a> to be -1.94 points over 49 studies. This was statistically significant, but failed to meet the clinical significance threshold, predefined according to the <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Health%20and%20Care%20Excellence">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> recommended standard mean difference of 0.5, equivalent to a 3 point reduction in HDRS. A high risk of bias was found, which could possibly explain the statistically significant effect of SSRI, and the authors concluded that the frequency of adverse events outweighed the small clinical improvements.
The efficacy of antidepressants was observed in one meta analysis to be dependent upon the baseline severity, as measured by the HDRS. Antidepressants in patients with a score less than 23(indicating mild to moderate depression) demonstrated a small benefit over placebo. However, antidepressants in those with a score >25 exhibited an advantage over placebo that cross the NICE threshold for clinical significance.

Another study focusing on paroxetine (Paxil) and imipramine found that antidepressant drugs were only slightly better than placebo in cases of mild or moderate depression they surveyed but offered "substantial" benefit in those with severe depression.

In 2014 the U.S. FDA published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012. The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.

A review commissioned by the <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Health%20and%20Care%20Excellence">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> concluded that there is strong evidence that SSRIs have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression. The treatment guidelines developed in conjunction with this review suggest that antidepressants should be considered in patients with moderate to severe depression and those with mild depression that is persistent or resistant to other treatment modalities.

The <a href="Cochrane%20Collaboration">Cochrane Collaboration</a> recently performed a systematic review of clinical trials of the <a href="tricyclic%20antidepressant">tricyclic antidepressant</a> <a href="amitriptyline">amitriptyline</a>. The study concluded that in spite of moderate evidence for publication bias, there is strong evidence that the efficacy of amitriptyline is superior to placebo.

A 2015 systematic review of add-on therapies for treatment-resistant depression concluded that <a href="quetiapine">quetiapine</a> and <a href="aripiprazole">aripiprazole</a> have the strongest evidence-base supporting their efficacy, but they are associated with additional treatment-related side effects when used as an add-on therapy.

A 2008 Cochrane Collaboration review on <a href="St%20John%27s%20wort">St John's wort</a> (specifically, any extracts which contain "<a href="Hypericum%20perforatum">Hypericum perforatum</a>"), and a 2015 meta-analytic systematic review by some of the same authors, both concluded that it: has superior efficacy to placebo in treating depression; is as effective as standard antidepressant pharmaceuticals for treating depression; and has fewer adverse effects than other antidepressants. The 2015 meta analysis concluded that it is difficult to assign a place for St. John's wort in the treatment of depression owing to limitations in the available evidence base, including large variations in efficacy seen in trials performed in German-speaking relative to other countries. <a href="Reversible%20inhibitors%20of%20monoamine%20oxidase%20A">Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A</a> (RIMAs) have also been shown to be an effective drug therapy with greater tolerability than other antidepressants; however, the efficacy of SSRIs, tricyclic, and tetracyclic antidepressants in treating depression is supported by a much larger evidence base compared to other antidepressant drug therapies (i.e., St John's wort, rMAO-A inhibitors, <a href="serotonin%E2%80%93norepinephrine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>, <a href="serotonin%20antagonist%20and%20reuptake%20inhibitor">serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor</a>s, <a href="noradrenaline%20reuptake%20inhibitor">noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor</a>s, and <a href="noradrenergic%20and%20specific%20serotonergic%20antidepressant">noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant</a>s).

A study published in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>" ("JAMA") demonstrated that the magnitude of the placebo effect in clinical trials of depression have been growing over time, while the effect size of tested drugs has remained relatively constant. The authors suggest that one possible explanation for the growing placebo effect in clinical trials is the inclusion of larger number of participants with shorter term, mild, or spontaneously remitting depression as a result of decreasing stigma associated with antidepressant use. Placebo response rates in clinical trials of complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies are significantly lower than those in clinical trials of traditional antidepressants.

A 2004 review concluded that antidepressant studies that failed to support efficacy claims were dramatically less likely to be published than those that did support favorable efficacy claims. Similar results were obtained for a study of publication of clinical trials of antidepressants in children. A 2015 investigation of meta-analyses of antidepressant studies found that 79% of them had "sponsorship or authors who were (pharmaceutical) industry employees and/or had conflicts of interest".

A 2012 meta-analysis found that fluoxetine and venlafaxine were effective for major depression in all age groups. The authors also found no evidence of a relationship between baseline severity of depression and degree of benefit of antidepressants over placebo.

A review published in 2012 found a negative correlation between study year and efficacy of antidepressants as measured by response rate. The change in response rate was largely driven by increase in placebo response. However the authors still concluded that antidepressants were effective in treating depression. The authors found that TCAs were the most effective drug, followed by <a href="SNRIs">SNRIs</a>, <a href="MAOIs">MAOIs</a>, <a href="SSRIs">SSRIs</a> and atypical antidepressants.

The largest and most expensive study conducted to date, on the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for depression, was commissioned by the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Mental%20Health">National Institute of Mental Health</a>. The study was dubbed "<a href="STAR%2AD">The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression</a>" (STAR*D) Study. The results are summarized here.
Participants in the trial were recruited when they sought medical care at general medical or psychiatric clinics. No advertising was used to recruit subjects in order to maximize the generalizability of the study results. Participants were required to have a minimum score of 14 point on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) in order to be enrolled in the trial. Generally accepted cutoffs are 7–17 points for mild depression, 18–24 points for moderate depression, and ≥ 24 for severe depression. The average participant baseline HAM-D17 score was 22. The pre-specified primary endpoint of this trial was remission as determined by the HAM-D score, with all patients with missing scores rated as non-responders. In the aftermath of the trial, the investigators have presented the results mainly using the secondary endpoint of remission according to the QIDS-SR16 Score, which tend to be somewhat higher.
There were no statistical or meaningful clinical differences in remission rates, response rates, or times to remission or response among any of the medications compared in this study. These included bupropion sustained release, bupropion, citalopram, lithium, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, sertraline, triiodothyronine, tranylcypromine, and venlafaxine extended release.

A 2008 review of <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized controlled trial</a>s concluded that symptomatic improvement with SSRIs was greatest by the end of the first week of use, but that some improvement continued for at least 6 weeks.

Between 30% and 50% of individuals treated with a given antidepressant do not show a response. In clinical studies, approximately one-third of patients achieve a full <a href="remission%20%28medicine%29">remission</a>, one-third experience a response and one-third are nonresponders. Partial remission is characterized by the presence of poorly defined residual symptoms. These symptoms typically include depressed mood, psychic anxiety, sleep disturbance, fatigue and diminished interest or pleasure. It is currently unclear which factors predict partial remission. However, it is clear that residual symptoms are powerful predictors of relapse, with relapse rates 3–6 times higher in patients with residual symptoms than in those who experience full remission. In addition, antidepressant drugs tend to lose efficacy over the course of treatment. According to data from the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, less than one-third of Americans taking one antidepressant medication have seen a mental health professional in the previous year. A number of strategies are used in clinical practice to try to overcome these limits and variations. They include switching medication, augmentation, and combination.

The <a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> 2000 Practice Guideline advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant.
A 2006 meta-analysis review found wide variation in the findings of prior studies; for patients who had failed to respond to an SSRI antidepressant, between 12% and 86% showed a response to a new drug. However, the more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial. However, a later meta-analysis found no difference between switching to a new drug and staying on the old medication; although 34% of treatment resistant patients responded when switched to the new drug, 40% responded without being switched.

For a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines suggest augmentation, or adding a drug from a different class. These include <a href="Lithium%20%28medication%29">lithium</a> and <a href="thyroid">thyroid</a> augmentation, <a href="dopamine%20agonist">dopamine agonist</a>s, <a href="sex%20steroid">sex steroid</a>s, <a href="Norepinephrine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">NRIs</a>, <a href="glucocorticoid">glucocorticoid</a>-specific agents, or the newer <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a>s.

A combination strategy involves adding another antidepressant, usually from a different class so as to have effect on other mechanisms. Although this may be used in clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy. Other tests recently conducted include the use of <a href="psychostimulant">psychostimulant</a>s as an augmentation therapy. Several studies have shown the efficacy of combining <a href="modafinil">modafinil</a> to treatment-resistant patients. It has been used to help combat SSRI-associated fatigue.

The therapeutic effects of antidepressants typically do not continue once the course of medication ends, resulting in a high rate of <a href="relapse">relapse</a>. A 2003 <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> of 31 placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, mostly limited to studies covering a period of one year, found that 18% of patients who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a <a href="placebo">placebo</a>.

A gradual loss of therapeutic benefit occurs in a minority of people during the course of treatment. A strategy involving the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of the acute episode, followed by psychotherapy in its residual phase, has been suggested by some studies.

Antidepressants are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the treatment of <a href="generalized%20anxiety%20disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</a> (GAD) that has failed to respond to conservative measures such as education and self-help activities. GAD is a common disorder of which the central feature is excessive worry about a number of different events. Key symptoms include excessive anxiety about multiple events and issues, and difficulty controlling worrisome thoughts that persists for at least 6 months.

Antidepressants provide a modest-to-moderate reduction in anxiety in GAD, and are superior to placebo in treating GAD. The efficacy of different antidepressants is similar.

SSRIs are a second-line treatment of adult <a href="obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive%20disorder">obsessive–compulsive disorder</a> (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first-line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second-line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects. SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; patients treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo. Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term treatment trials of 6 to 24 weeks and in discontinuation trials of 28 to 52 weeks duration.

Antidepressants are recommended as an alternative or additional first step to self-help programs in the treatment of <a href="bulimia%20nervosa">bulimia nervosa</a>. SSRIs (fluoxetine in particular) are preferred over other antidepressants due to their acceptability, tolerability, and superior reduction of symptoms in short-term trials. Long-term efficacy remains poorly characterized. <a href="Bupropion">Bupropion</a> is not recommended for the treatment of eating disorders due to an increased risk of seizure.

Similar recommendations apply to <a href="binge%20eating%20disorder">binge eating disorder</a>. SSRIs provide short-term reductions in binge eating behavior, but have not been associated with significant weight loss.

Clinical trials have generated mostly negative results for the use of SSRIs in the treatment of <a href="anorexia%20nervosa">anorexia nervosa</a>. Treatment guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recommend against the use of SSRIs in this disorder. Those from the American Psychiatric Association note that SSRIs confer no advantage regarding weight gain, but that they may be used for the treatment of co-existing depressive, anxiety, or obsessive–compulsive disorders.

A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that antidepressants treatment favorably affects pain, health-related quality of life, depression, and sleep in <a href="fibromyalgia">fibromyalgia</a> syndrome. Tricyclics appear to be the most effective class, with moderate effects on pain and sleep and small effects on fatigue and health-related quality of life. The fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction on tricyclics was 48% versus 28% for placebo. For SSRIs and SNRIs the fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction was 36% (20% in the placebo comparator arms) and 42% (32% in the corresponding placebo comparator arms). Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was common. Antidepressants including <a href="amitriptyline">amitriptyline</a>, <a href="fluoxetine">fluoxetine</a>, <a href="duloxetine">duloxetine</a>, <a href="milnacipran">milnacipran</a>, <a href="moclobemide">moclobemide</a>, and <a href="pirlindole">pirlindole</a> are recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the treatment of fibromyalgia based on "limited evidence".

A 2014 meta-analysis from the <a href="Cochrane%20Collaboration">Cochrane Collaboration</a> found the antidepressant duloxetine to be effective for the treatment of pain resulting from <a href="diabetic%20neuropathy">diabetic neuropathy</a>. The same group reviewed data for amitriptyline in the treatment of <a href="neuropathic%20pain">neuropathic pain</a> and found limited useful randomized clinical trial data. They concluded that the long history of successful use in the community for the treatment of fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain justified its continued use. The group was concerned about the potential for overestimating the amount of pain relief provided by amitriptyline, and highlighted that only a small number of people will experience significant pain relief by taking this medication.

Difficulty tolerating <a href="adverse%20effects">adverse effects</a> is the most common reason for antidepressant discontinuation.

Almost any medication involved with serotonin regulation has the potential to cause <a href="serotonin%20syndrome">serotonin toxicity</a> (also known as "serotonin syndrome") an excess of serotonin that can induce mania, restlessness, agitation, <a href="emotional%20lability">emotional lability</a>, insomnia and confusion as its primary symptoms. Although the condition is serious, it is not particularly common, generally only appearing at high doses or while on other medications. Assuming proper medical intervention has been taken (within about 24 hours) it is rarely fatal.

<a href="MAOIs">MAOIs</a> tend to have pronounced (sometimes fatal) interactions with a wide variety of medications and <a href="over-the-counter%20drug">over-the-counter drug</a>s. If taken with foods that contain very high levels of <a href="tyramine">tyramine</a> (e.g., mature cheese, cured meats, or yeast extracts), they may cause a potentially lethal <a href="hypertensive%20crisis">hypertensive crisis</a>. At lower doses the person may be bothered by only a headache due to an increase in blood pressure.

In response to these adverse effects, a different type of MAOI has been developed: the <a href="reversible%20inhibitor%20of%20monoamine%20oxidase%20A">reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A</a> (RIMA) class of drugs. Their primary advantage is that they do not require the person to follow a special diet, while being purportedly effective as SSRIs and tricyclics in treating depressive disorders.

SSRI use in pregnancy has been associated with a variety of risks with varying degrees of proof of causation. As depression is independently associated with negative pregnancy outcomes, determining the extent to which observed associations between antidepressant use and specific adverse outcomes reflects a causative relationship has been difficult in some cases. In other cases, the attribution of adverse outcomes to antidepressant exposure seems fairly clear.

SSRI use in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion of about 1.7-fold, and is associated with preterm birth and low birth weight.

A systematic review of the risk of major birth defects in antidepressant-exposed pregnancies found a small increase (3% to 24%) in the risk of major malformations and a risk of cardiovascular birth defects that did not differ from non-exposed pregnancies. A study of fluoxetine-exposed pregnancies found a 12% increase in the risk of major malformations that just missed statistical significance. Other studies have found an increased risk of cardiovascular birth defects among depressed mothers not undergoing SSRI treatment, suggesting the possibility of ascertainment bias, e.g. that worried mothers may pursue more aggressive testing of their infants. Another study found no increase in cardiovascular birth defects and a 27% increased risk of major malformations in SSRI exposed pregnancies. The FDA advises for the risk of birth defects with the use of paroxetine and the MAOI should be avoided.

A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis found that antidepressant use during pregnancy was statistically significantly associated with some pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational age and preterm birth, but not with other outcomes. The same review cautioned that because differences between the exposed and unexposed groups were small, it was doubtful whether they were clinically significant.

A <a href="neonate">neonate</a> (infant less than 28 days old) may experience a withdrawal syndrome from abrupt discontinuation of the antidepressant at birth. Antidepressants have been shown to be present in varying amounts in breast milk, but their effects on infants are currently unknown.

Moreover, SSRIs inhibit nitric oxide synthesis, which plays an important role in setting vascular tone. Several studies have pointed to an increased risk of prematurity associated with SSRI use, and this association may be due to an increase risk of <a href="pre-eclampsia">pre-eclampsia</a> of pregnancy.

Another possible problem with antidepressants is the chance of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>. Many cases of bipolar depression are very similar to those of unipolar depression. Therefore, the patient can be misdiagnosed with unipolar depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20–40% of bipolar patients. For bipolar depression, antidepressants (most frequently SSRIs) can exacerbate or trigger symptoms of <a href="hypomania">hypomania</a> and <a href="mania">mania</a>.

Studies have shown that the use of antidepressants is correlated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thinking (suicidality) in those aged under 25. This problem has been serious enough to warrant government intervention by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to warn of the increased risk of suicidality during antidepressant treatment. According to the FDA, the heightened risk of suicidality is within the first one to two months of treatment. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) places the excess risk in the "early stages of treatment". A <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> suggests that the relationship between antidepressant use and suicidal behavior or thoughts is age-dependent. Compared to placebo the use of antidepressants is associated with an increase in suicidal behavior or thoughts among those aged under 25 (<a href="odds%20ratio">OR</a>=1.62). This increase in suicidality approaches that observed in children and adolescents. There is no effect or possibly a mild protective effect among those aged 25 to 64 (OR=0.79). Antidepressant treatment has a protective effect against suicidality among those aged 65 and over (OR=0.37).

Sexual side-effects are also common with SSRIs, such as loss of <a href="sexual%20drive">sexual drive</a>, <a href="anorgasmia">failure to reach orgasm</a>, and <a href="erectile%20dysfunction">erectile dysfunction</a>. Although usually reversible, these sexual side-effects can, in rare cases, last for months or years after the drug has been completely withdrawn.

In a study of 1022 outpatients, overall sexual dysfunction with all antidepressants averaged 59.1% with SSRIs values between 57 and 73%, mirtazapine 24%, nefazodone 8%, amineptine 7% and moclobemide 4%. <a href="Moclobemide">Moclobemide</a>, a selective reversible MAO-A inhibitor, does not cause sexual dysfunction, and can actually lead to an improvement in all aspects of sexual function.

Biochemical mechanisms suggested as causative include increased serotonin, particularly affecting <a href="5-HT2%20receptor">5-HT</a> and <a href="5HT3%20receptor">5-HT receptors</a>; decreased <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a>; decreased <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a>; blockade of <a href="cholinergic%20receptor">cholinergic</a> and <a href="alpha-1%20adrenergic%20receptor">αadrenergic receptors</a>; inhibition of <a href="nitric%20oxide%20synthase">nitric oxide synthetase</a>; and elevation of <a href="prolactin">prolactin</a> levels. <a href="Mirtazapine">Mirtazapine</a> is reported to have fewer sexual side-effects, most likely because it antagonizes 5-HT and 5-HT receptors and may, in some cases, reverse sexual dysfunction induced by SSRIs by the same mechanism.

<a href="Bupropion">Bupropion</a>, a weak NDRI and nicotinic antagonist, may be useful in treating reduced libido as a result of <a href="SSRI">SSRI</a> treatment.

Changes in appetite or weight are common among antidepressants, but largely drug-dependent and are related to which neurotransmitters they affect. <a href="Mirtazapine">Mirtazapine</a> and <a href="paroxetine">paroxetine</a>, for example, have the effect of weight gain and/or increased appetite, while others (such as <a href="bupropion">bupropion</a> and <a href="venlafaxine">venlafaxine</a>) achieve the opposite effect.

The <a href="antihistamine">antihistaminic</a> properties of certain TCA- and TeCA-class antidepressants have been shown to contribute to the common side-effects of increased appetite and weight gain associated with these classes of medication.

Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms were first reported with <a href="imipramine">imipramine</a>, the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), in the late 1950s, and each new class of antidepressants has brought reports of similar conditions, including <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitors">monoamine oxidase inhibitors</a> (MAOIs), SSRIs, and SNRIs. As of 2001, at least 21 different antidepressants, covering all the major classes, were known to cause discontinuation syndromes. The problem has been poorly studied, and most of the literature has been case reports or small clinical studies; incidence is hard to determine and controversial.

People with discontinuation syndrome have been on an antidepressant for at least four weeks and have recently stopped taking the medication, either abruptly or after a fast taper. Common symptoms include flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sweating), sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares, constant sleepiness), sensory/movement disturbances (imbalance, tremors, <a href="Vertigo%20%28medical%29">vertigo</a>, dizziness, electric-shock-like experiences), mood disturbances (<a href="dysphoria">dysphoria</a>, anxiety, agitation) and cognitive disturbances (confusion and hyperarousal). Over fifty symptoms have been reported.

Most cases of discontinuation syndrome last between one and four weeks, are relatively mild, and resolve on their own; in rare cases symptoms can be severe or extended. Paroxetine and venlafaxine seem to be particularly difficult to discontinue and prolonged withdrawal syndrome lasting over 18 months have been reported with paroxetine.

With the explosion of use and interest in SSRIs in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focused especially on <a href="Prozac%23Popular%20culture">Prozac</a>, interest grew as well in discontinuation syndromes. In the late 1990s, some investigators thought that symptoms that emerged when antidepressants were discontinued, might mean that antidepressants were causing <a href="addiction">addiction</a>, and some used the term "withdrawal syndrome" to describe the symptoms. Addictive substances cause <a href="physiological%20dependence">physiological dependence</a>, so that <a href="drug%20withdrawal">drug withdrawal</a> causes suffering. These theories were abandoned, since addiction leads to <a href="drug-seeking%20behavior">drug-seeking behavior</a>, and people taking antidepressants do not exhibit drug-seeking behavior. The term "withdrawal syndrome" is no longer used with respect to antidepressants, to avoid confusion with problems that arise from addiction. There are case reports of antidepressants being abused, but these are rare and are mostly limited to antidepressants with stimulant effects and to people who already had a substance use disorder. A 2012 comparison of the effects of stopping therapy with <a href="benzodiazepine">benzodiazepine</a>s and <a href="SSRI">SSRI</a>s argued that because the symptoms are similar, it makes no sense to say that benzodiazepines are addictive while SSRIs are not. Responses to that review noted that there is no evidence that people who stop taking SSRIs exhibit drug-seeking behavior while people who stop taking benzodiazepines do, and that the drug classes should be considered differently.

Antidepressants can cause emotional blunting, or numbness. This is a reduction in extremes of emotion, both positive and negative. While the patient may feel less depressed, they may also feel less happiness or empathy in some situations. This may be cause for a dose reduction or medication change. The exact mechanism is unknown.

The earliest and probably most widely accepted scientific theory of antidepressant action is the <a href="monoamine%20hypothesis">monoamine hypothesis</a> (which can be traced back to the 1950s), which states that depression is due to an imbalance (most often a deficiency) of the <a href="monoamine%20neurotransmitter">monoamine neurotransmitter</a>s (namely <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>, <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a> and <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a>). It was originally proposed based on the observation that certain hydrazine anti-tuberculosis agents produce antidepressant effects, which was later linked to their inhibitory effects on <a href="monoamine%20oxidase">monoamine oxidase</a>, the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters. All currently marketed antidepressants have the monoamine hypothesis as their theoretical basis, with the possible exception of <a href="agomelatine">agomelatine</a> which acts on a dual <a href="Melatonin">melatonergic</a>-<a href="Serotonin">serotonergic</a> pathway. Despite the success of the monoamine hypothesis it has a number of limitations: for one, all monoaminergic antidepressants have a delayed onset of action of at least a week; and secondly, there are a sizeable portion (>40%) of depressed patients that do not adequately respond to monoaminergic antidepressants. A number of alternative hypotheses have been proposed, including the glutamate, neurogenic, <a href="Epigenetics">epigenetic</a>, cortisol hypersecretion and inflammatory hypotheses.

<a href="Selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a>s (SSRIs) are believed to increase the <a href="extracellular">extracellular</a> level of the <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> by <a href="Reuptake%20inhibitor">limiting</a> its <a href="reuptake">reabsorption</a> into the <a href="presynaptic%20cell">presynaptic cell</a>, increasing the level of <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> in the <a href="synaptic%20cleft">synaptic cleft</a> available to bind to the <a href="postsynaptic%20receptor">postsynaptic receptor</a>. They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other <a href="monoamine%20transporter">monoamine transporter</a>s, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the <a href="norepinephrine%20transporter">norepinephrine</a> and <a href="dopamine%20transporter">dopamine transporter</a>s.

SSRIs are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in many countries. The efficacy of SSRIs in mild or moderate cases of depression has been disputed.

<a href="Serotonin%E2%80%93norepinephrine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>s (SNRIs) are potent inhibitors of the <a href="reuptake">reuptake</a> of <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> and <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a>. These <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a>s are known to play an important role in mood. SNRIs can be contrasted with the more widely used <a href="selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a>s (SSRIs), which act mostly upon serotonin alone.

The human <a href="serotonin%20transporter">serotonin transporter</a> (SERT) and <a href="norepinephrine%20transporter">norepinephrine transporter</a> (NET) are <a href="membrane%20protein">membrane protein</a>s that are responsible for the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Balanced dual inhibition of <a href="monoamine">monoamine</a> reuptake can possibly offer advantages over other antidepressants drugs by treating a wider range of symptoms.

SNRIs are sometimes also used to treat <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety disorder</a>s, <a href="obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive%20disorder">obsessive–compulsive disorder</a> (OCD), <a href="attention%20deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD), chronic <a href="neuropathic%20pain">neuropathic pain</a>, and <a href="fibromyalgia%20syndrome">fibromyalgia syndrome</a> (FMS), and for the relief of <a href="menopause">menopausal</a> symptoms.

<a href="Serotonin%20modulator%20and%20stimulator">Serotonin modulator and stimulator</a>s (SMSs), sometimes referred to more simply as serotonin modulators, are a type of <a href="drug">drug</a> with a multimodal action specific to the <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> system. To be precise, SMSs simultaneously modulate one or more <a href="serotonin%20receptor">serotonin receptor</a>s and inhibit the <a href="reuptake">reuptake</a> of serotonin. The term was created to describe the <a href="mechanism%20of%20action">mechanism of action</a> of the serotonergic antidepressant <a href="vortioxetine">vortioxetine</a> (Brintellix/Trintellix), which acts as a <a href="serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a> (SRI), <a href="partial%20agonist">partial agonist</a> of the <a href="5-HT1A%20receptor">5-HT receptor</a>, and <a href="receptor%20antagonist">antagonist</a> of the <a href="5-HT3%20receptor">5-HT</a> and <a href="5-HT7%20receptor">5-HT receptor</a>s. However, it can also technically be applied to <a href="vilazodone">vilazodone</a> (Viibryd), which is an antidepressant as well and acts as an SRI and 5-HT receptor partial agonist.

An alternative term is serotonin partial agonist/reuptake inhibitor (SPARI), which can be applied only to vilazodone.

<a href="Serotonin%20antagonist%20and%20reuptake%20inhibitors">Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors</a> (SARIs) while mainly used as antidepressants, are also <a href="anxiolytic">anxiolytic</a>s and <a href="hypnotic">hypnotic</a>s. They act by <a href="receptor%20antagonist">antagonizing</a> <a href="serotonin%20receptor">serotonin receptor</a>s such as <a href="5-HT2A%20receptor">5-HT</a> and <a href="reuptake%20inhibitor">inhibiting</a> the <a href="reuptake">reuptake</a> of <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>, <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a>, and/or <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a>. Additionally, most also act as <a href="alpha-1%20adrenergic%20receptor">α-adrenergic receptor</a> <a href="receptor%20antagonist">antagonists</a>. The majority of the currently marketed SARIs belong to the <a href="phenylpiperazine">phenylpiperazine</a> class of compounds. They include <a href="trazodone">trazodone</a> and <a href="nefazodone">nefazodone</a>.

<a href="Norepinephrine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>s (NRIs or NERIs) are a type of <a href="drug">drug</a> that acts as a <a href="reuptake%20inhibitor">reuptake inhibitor</a> for the <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a> (noradrenaline) by blocking the <a href="drug%20action">action</a> of the <a href="norepinephrine%20transporter">norepinephrine transporter</a> (NET). This in turn leads to increased <a href="extracellular">extracellular</a> <a href="concentration">concentration</a>s of norepinephrine.

NRIs are commonly used in the treatment of conditions like <a href="attention-deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder">ADHD</a> and <a href="narcolepsy">narcolepsy</a> due to their <a href="psychostimulant">psychostimulant</a> effects and in <a href="obesity">obesity</a> due to their <a href="appetite%20suppressant">appetite suppressant</a> effects. They are also frequently used as antidepressants for the treatment of <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">major depressive disorder</a>, <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety</a> and <a href="panic%20disorder">panic disorder</a>. Additionally, many <a href="substance%20abuse">drugs of abuse</a> such as <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a href="methylphenidate">methylphenidate</a> possess NRI activity, though it is important to mention that NRIs without combined <a href="dopamine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">dopamine reuptake inhibitor</a> (DRI) properties are not significantly rewarding and hence are considered to have a negligible <a href="abuse%20potential">abuse potential</a>. However, norepinephrine has been implicated as acting synergistically with dopamine when actions on the two neurotransmitters are combined (e.g., in the case of <a href="norepinephrine%E2%80%93dopamine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">NDRI</a>s) to produce rewarding effects in psychostimulant drugs of abuse.

The majority of the <a href="tricyclic%20antidepressant">tricyclic antidepressant</a>s (TCAs) act primarily as <a href="serotonin%E2%80%93norepinephrine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>s (SNRIs) by blocking the <a href="serotonin%20transporter">serotonin transporter</a> (SERT) and the <a href="norepinephrine%20transporter">norepinephrine transporter</a> (NET), respectively, which results in an elevation of the <a href="Synapse">synaptic</a> concentrations of these <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a>s, and therefore an enhancement of <a href="neurotransmission">neurotransmission</a>. Notably, with the sole exception of <a href="amineptine">amineptine</a>, the TCAs have negligible <a href="affinity%20%28pharmacology%29">affinity</a> for the <a href="dopamine%20transporter">dopamine transporter</a> (DAT), and therefore have no efficacy as <a href="dopamine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">dopamine reuptake inhibitor</a>s (DRIs).

Although TCAs are sometimes <a href="medical%20prescription">prescribed</a> for depressive disorders, they have been largely replaced in clinical use in most parts of the world by newer antidepressants such as <a href="selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a>s (SSRIs), <a href="serotonin%E2%80%93norepinephrine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>s (SNRIs) and <a href="norepinephrine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>s (NRIs). Adverse effects have been found to be of a similar level between TCAs and SSRIs.

<a href="Tetracyclic%20antidepressants">Tetracyclic antidepressants</a> (TeCAs) are a class of antidepressants that were first introduced in the 1970s. They are named after their <a href="chemical%20structure">chemical structure</a>, which contains four <a href="cyclic%20compound">rings of atoms</a>, and are closely related to the <a href="tricyclic%20antidepressant">tricyclic antidepressant</a>s (TCAs), which contain three rings of atoms.

<a href="Monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">Monoamine oxidase inhibitor</a>s (MAOIs) are chemicals which inhibit the activity of the <a href="monoamine%20oxidase">monoamine oxidase enzyme family</a>. They have a long history of use as medications prescribed for the treatment of <a href="clinical%20depression">depression</a>. They are particularly effective in treating <a href="atypical%20depression">atypical depression</a>. They are also used in the treatment of <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a> and several other disorders.

Because of potentially lethal dietary and drug interactions, <a href="monoamine%20oxidase">monoamine oxidase</a> inhibitors have historically been reserved as a last line of treatment, used only when other classes of antidepressant drugs (for example <a href="selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a>s and <a href="tricyclic%20antidepressant">tricyclic antidepressant</a>s) have failed.

MAOIs have been found to be effective in the treatment of <a href="panic%20disorder">panic disorder</a> with <a href="agoraphobia">agoraphobia</a>, <a href="social%20phobia">social phobia</a>, atypical depression or mixed anxiety and depression, <a href="bulimia">bulimia</a>, and <a href="post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, as well as <a href="borderline%20personality%20disorder">borderline personality disorder</a>. MAOIs appear to be particularly effective in the management of <a href="Bipolar%20disorder">bipolar depression</a> according to a recent retrospective-analysis. There are reports of MAOI efficacy in <a href="obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive%20disorder">obsessive–compulsive disorder</a> (OCD), <a href="trichotillomania">trichotillomania</a>, <a href="dysmorphophobia">dysmorphophobia</a>, and <a href="avoidant%20personality%20disorder">avoidant personality disorder</a>, but these reports are from uncontrolled case reports.

MAOIs can also be used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease by targeting MAO-B in particular (therefore affecting <a href="dopaminergic%20neuron">dopaminergic neuron</a>s), as well as providing an alternative for <a href="migraine">migraine</a> <a href="prophylaxis">prophylaxis</a>. Inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B is used in the treatment of <a href="clinical%20depression">clinical depression</a> and <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety disorder</a>s.

See the <a href="list%20of%20antidepressants">list of antidepressants</a> for other drugs which are not specifically characterized.

Adjunct medications are an umbrella term used to describe substances that increase the potency or "enhance" antidepressants. They work by affecting variables very close to the antidepressant, sometimes affecting a completely different <a href="mechanism%20of%20action">mechanism of action</a>. This may be attempted when depression treatments have not been successful in the past.

Common types of adjunct medication techniques generally fall into the following categories:
It is unknown if undergoing <a href="psychological%20therapy">psychological therapy</a> at the same time as taking anti-depressants enhances the anti-depressive effect of the medication.

<a href="Lithium%20%28medication%29">Lithium</a> has been used to augment antidepressant therapy in those who have failed to respond to antidepressants alone. Furthermore, lithium dramatically decreases the suicide risk in recurrent depression. There is some evidence for the addition of a thyroid hormone, <a href="triiodothyronine">triiodothyronine</a>, in patients with normal thyroid function.

Psychopharmacologists have also tried adding a <a href="psychostimulant">stimulant</a>, in particular, <a href="d-amphetamine">d-amphetamine</a>. However, the use of stimulants in cases of treatment-resistant depression is relatively controversial. A review article published in 2007 found psychostimulants may be effective in treatment-resistant depression with concomitant antidepressant therapy, but a more certain conclusion could not be drawn due to substantial deficiencies in the studies available for consideration, and the somewhat contradictory nature of their results.

Before the 1950s, <a href="opioid">opioid</a>s and <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>s were commonly used as antidepressants. Their use was later restricted due to their addictive nature and side effects. Extracts from the herb <a href="Hypericum%20perforatum">St John's wort</a> have been used as a "nerve tonic" to alleviate depression.

In 1951, <a href="Irving%20Selikoff">Irving Selikoff</a> and Edward Robitzek, working out of <a href="Sea%20View%20Hospital">Sea View Hospital</a> on <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>, began clinical trials on two new <a href="tuberculosis">anti-tuberculosis</a> agents developed by Hoffman-LaRoche, <a href="isoniazid">isoniazid</a> and <a href="iproniazid">iproniazid</a>. Only patients with a poor <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a> were initially treated; nevertheless, their condition improved dramatically. Selikoff and Robitzek noted "a subtle general stimulation … the patients exhibited renewed vigor and indeed this occasionally served to introduce disciplinary problems." The promise of a cure for tuberculosis in the Sea View Hospital trials was excitedly discussed in the mainstream press.

In 1952, learning of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term "antidepressant" to describe its action. A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his <a href="pulmonology">pulmonology</a> colleagues at Cochin Hospital. In 1952 (before Lurie and Salzer), Delay, with the resident Jean-Francois Buisson, reported the positive effect of isoniazid on depressed patients. The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of <a href="diamine%20oxidase">diamine oxidase</a>, coupled with a weak inhibition of <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20A">monoamine oxidase A</a>.

Selikoff and Robitzek also experimented with another anti-tuberculosis drug, <a href="iproniazid">iproniazid</a>; it showed a greater psychostimulant effect, but more pronounced toxicity. Later, Jackson Smith, Gordon Kamman, George Crane, and <a href="Frank%20Ayd">Frank Ayd</a>, described the psychiatric applications of iproniazid. Ernst Zeller found iproniazid to be a potent <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">monoamine oxidase inhibitor</a>. Nevertheless, iproniazid remained relatively obscure until Nathan Kline, the influential head of research at <a href="Rockland%20State%20Hospital">Rockland State Hospital</a>, began to popularize it in the medical and popular press as a "psychic energizer". Roche put a significant marketing effort behind iproniazid. Its sales grew until it was recalled in 1961, due to reports of lethal <a href="hepatotoxicity">hepatotoxicity</a>.

The antidepressant effect of a <a href="tricyclic">tricyclic</a>, a three ringed compound, was first discovered in 1957 by <a href="Roland%20Kuhn">Roland Kuhn</a> in a Swiss <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">psychiatric hospital</a>. <a href="Antihistamine">Antihistamine</a> derivatives were used to treat surgical shock and later as <a href="neuroleptics">neuroleptics</a>. Although in 1955 <a href="reserpine">reserpine</a> was shown to be more effective than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics were being developed as <a href="sedatives">sedatives</a> and <a href="antipsychotics">antipsychotics</a>.

Attempting to improve the effectiveness of <a href="chlorpromazine">chlorpromazine</a>, Kuhn in conjunction with the <a href="Geigy">Geigy</a> <a href="Pharmaceutical%20Company">Pharmaceutical Company</a> discovered the compound "G 22355", later renamed <a href="imipramine">imipramine</a>. Imipramine had a beneficial effect in patients with depression who showed mental and <a href="motor%20retardation">motor retardation</a>. Kuhn described his new compound as a "thymoleptic" "taking hold of the emotions," in contrast with neuroleptics, "taking hold of the nerves" in 1955–56. These gradually became established, resulting in the patent and manufacture in the US in 1951 by Häfliger and SchinderA.

Antidepressants became <a href="prescription%20drug">prescription drug</a>s in the 1950s. It was estimated that no more than 50 to 100 individuals per million suffered from the kind of depression that these new drugs would treat, and pharmaceutical companies were not enthusiastic in marketing for this small market. Sales through the 1960s remained poor compared to the sales of tranquilizers, which were being marketed for different uses. Imipramine remained in common use and numerous successors were introduced. The use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) increased after the development and introduction of "reversible" forms affecting only the MAO-A subtype of inhibitors, making this drug safer to use.

By the 1960s, it was thought that the mode of action of tricyclics was to inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. However, norepinephrine reuptake became associated with stimulating effects. Later tricyclics were thought to affect <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> as proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug.

Researchers began a process of <a href="rational%20drug%20design">rational drug design</a> to isolate antihistamine-derived compounds that would selectively target these systems. The first such compound to be patented was <a href="zimelidine">zimelidine</a> in 1971, while the first released clinically was <a href="indalpine">indalpine</a>. <a href="Fluoxetine">Fluoxetine</a> was approved for commercial use by the US <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) in 1988, becoming the first <a href="Blockbuster%20drug">blockbuster</a> SSRI. Fluoxetine was developed at <a href="Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Company">Eli Lilly and Company</a> in the early 1970s by <a href="Bryan%20Molloy">Bryan Molloy</a>, <a href="Klaus%20Schmiegel">Klaus Schmiegel</a>, David Wong and others. SSRIs became known as "novel antidepressants" along with other newer drugs such as SNRIs and <a href="Norepinephrine%20Reuptake%20Inhibitor">NRIs</a> with various selective effects.

<a href="Hypericum%20perforatum">St John's wort</a> fell out of favor in most countries through the 19th and 20th centuries, except in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, where <a href="Hypericum">Hypericum</a> extracts were eventually licensed, packaged and prescribed. Small-scale efficacy trials were carried out in the 1970s and 1980s, and attention grew in the 1990s following a <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a>. It remains an <a href="over-the-counter%20drug">over-the-counter drug</a> (OTC) supplement in most countries. Research continues to investigate its active component <a href="hyperforin">hyperforin</a>, and to further understand its mode of action.

In the United States, antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed medication in 2013. Of the estimated 16 million "long term" (over 24 months) users, roughly 70 percent are female.

In the UK, figures reported in 2010 indicated that the number of antidepressant prescribed by the <a href="National%20Health%20Service">National Health Service</a> (NHS) almost doubled over a decade. Further analysis published in 2014 showed that number of antidepressants dispensed annually in the community went up by 25 million in the 14 years between 1998 and 2012, rising from 15 million to 40 million. Nearly 50% of this rise occurred in the four years after the <a href="Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%9308">2008 banking crash</a>, during which time the annual increase in prescriptions rose from 6.7% to 8.5%. These sources also suggest that aside from the recession, other factors that may influence changes in prescribing rates may include: improvements in diagnosis, a reduction of the <a href="Social%20stigma">stigma</a> surrounding mental health, broader prescribing trends, GP characteristics, geographical location and housing status. Another factor that may contribute to increasing consumption of antidepressants is the fact that these medications now are used for other conditions including <a href="social%20anxiety">social anxiety</a> and <a href="post%20traumatic%20stress">post traumatic stress</a>.

United States: The most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the US retail market in 2010 were:

Netherlands: In the Netherlands, <a href="paroxetine">paroxetine</a>, marketed as Seroxat among generic preparations, is the most prescribed antidepressant, followed by <a href="amitriptyline">amitriptyline</a>, <a href="citalopram">citalopram</a> and <a href="venlafaxine">venlafaxine</a>.

In looking at the issue of antidepressant use, some academics have highlighted the need to examine the use of antidepressants and other medical treatments in cross-cultural terms, due to the fact that various cultures prescribe and observe different manifestations, symptoms, meanings and associations of depression and other medical conditions within their populations. These cross-cultural discrepancies, it has been argued, then have implications on the perceived efficacy and use of antidepressants and other strategies in the treatment of depression in these different cultures. In India antidepressants are largely seen as tools to combat marginality, promising the individual the ability to re-integrate into society through their use—a view and association not observed in the West.

Somewhat less than 10% of orally administered fluoxetine is excreted from humans unchanged or as <a href="glucuronide">glucuronide</a>. Because most antidepressants function by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinepherine these drugs can interfere with natural neurotransmitter levels in other organisms impacted by indirect exposure. Antidepressants fluoxetine and sertraline have been detected in aquatic organisms residing in effluent dominated streams. The presence of antidepressants in surface waters and aquatic organisms has caused concern because ecotoxicological effects to aquatic organisms due to fluoxetine exposure have been demonstrated. Coral reef fish have been demonstrated to modulate aggressive behavior through serotonin.

Exposure to fluoxetine has been demonstrated to increase serotonergic activity in fish, subsequently reducing aggressive behavior. Artificially increasing serotonin levels in crustaceans can temporarily reverse social status and turn subordinates into aggressive and territorial dominant males. Perinatal exposure to fluoxetine at relevant environmental concentrations has been shown to lead to significant modifications of memory processing in 1-month-old cuttlefish. This impairment may disadvantage cuttlefish and decrease their survival.

Auger effect

The Auger effect is a physical phenomenon in which the filling of an <a href="Inner-shell%20electrons">inner-shell</a> vacancy of an <a href="atom">atom</a> is accompanied by the emission of an <a href="electron">electron</a> from the same atom. When a <a href="core%20electron">core electron</a> is removed, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of <a href="energy">energy</a>. Although most often this energy is released in the form of an emitted <a href="photon">photon</a>, the energy can also be transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom; this second ejected electron is called an Auger electron. The effect was first discovered by <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> in 1922; <a href="Pierre%20Victor%20Auger">Pierre Victor Auger</a> independently discovered the effect shortly after and is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community, in accordance with <a href="Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy">Stiegler's law of eponymy</a>.

Upon ejection, the <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> of the Auger electron corresponds to the difference between the energy of the initial <a href="electronic%20transition">electronic transition</a> into the vacancy and the <a href="ionization%20energy">ionization energy</a> for the <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a> from which the Auger electron was ejected. These energy levels depend on the type of atom and the chemical environment in which the atom was located. <a href="Auger%20electron%20spectroscopy">Auger electron spectroscopy</a> involves the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with either <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s or energetic electrons and measures the intensity of Auger electrons that result as a function of the Auger electron energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment. <a href="Carrier%20generation%20and%20recombination%23Auger%20recombination">Auger recombination</a> is a similar Auger effect which occurs in <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a>s. An electron and <a href="electron%20hole">electron hole</a> (electron-hole pair) can recombine giving up their energy to an electron in the conduction band, increasing its energy. The reverse effect is known as <a href="impact%20ionization">impact ionization</a>.

The Auger emission process was observed and published in 1922 by <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a>, an Austrian-Swedish physicist, as a side effect in her competitive search for the nuclear beta electrons with the British physicist <a href="Charles%20Drummond%20Ellis">Charles Drummond Ellis</a>.

The French physicist <a href="Pierre%20Victor%20Auger">Pierre Victor Auger</a> independently discovered it in 1923 upon analysis of a Wilson <a href="cloud%20chamber">cloud chamber</a> experiment and it became the central part of his PhD work. High-energy X-rays were applied to ionize gas particles and observe <a href="photoelectric">photoelectric</a> electrons. The observation of electron tracks that were independent of the frequency of the incident photon suggested a mechanism for electron ionization that was caused from an <a href="internal%20conversion">internal conversion</a> of energy from a radiationless transition. Further investigation, and theoretical work using elementary quantum mechanics and transition rate/transition probability calculations, showed that the effect was a radiationless effect more than an internal conversion effect.

Akio Morita

Akio Morita was born in <a href="Nagoya">Nagoya, Aichi</a>, Japan. Morita's family was involved in <a href="sake">sake</a>, <a href="miso">miso</a> and <a href="soy%20sauce">soy sauce</a> production in the village of Kosugaya (currently a part of <a href="Tokoname%2C%20Aichi">Tokoname City</a>) on the western coast of <a href="Chita%20Peninsula">Chita Peninsula</a> in <a href="Aichi%20Prefecture">Aichi Prefecture</a> since 1665. He was the oldest of four siblings and his father Kyuzaemon trained him as a child to take over the family business. Akio, however, found his true calling in mathematics and physics, and in 1944 he graduated from <a href="Osaka%20University">Osaka Imperial University</a> with a degree in physics. He was later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>, and served in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. During his service, Morita met his future business partner Masaru Ibuka in the Navy's Wartime Research Committee.

On May 7, 1946, Ibuka founded "Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha" (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, the forerunner of Sony Corporation) with about 20 employees and initial capital of ¥190,000. Ibuka was 38 years old. Morita, 25 years old joined "Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha" shortly after its inception, with Morita's family investing in Sony during the early period and being the largest shareholder.

In 1949, the company developed magnetic recording tape and in 1950, sold the first <a href="tape%20recorder">tape recorder</a> in Japan. In 1957, it produced a pocket-sized radio (the first to be fully <a href="transistor">transistor</a>ized), and in 1958, Morita and Ibuka decided to rename their company Sony (derived from "sonus"--<a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "sound"—and "Sonny-boys" the most common American expression). Morita was an advocate for all the products made by <a href="Sony">Sony</a>. However, since the radio was slightly too big to fit in a shirt pocket, Morita made his employees wear shirts with slightly larger pockets to give the radio a "pocket sized" appearance. In 1960, it produced the first <a href="transistor">transistor</a> television in the world. In 1973, Sony received an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> for its <a href="Trinitron">Trinitron</a> television-set technology. In 1975, it released the first <a href="Betamax">Betamax</a> home video recorder, a year before <a href="VHS">VHS</a> format came out. In 1979, the <a href="Walkman">Walkman</a> was introduced, making it one of the world's first portable music players. In 1984, Sony launched the <a href="Discman">Discman</a> series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products.

In 1960, the Sony Corporation of America (SONAM, currently abbreviated as SCA) was established in the United States. In 1961, Sony Corporation was the first Japanese company to be listed on the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>, in the form of <a href="American%20depositary%20receipt">American depositary receipt</a>s (ADRs), which are traded over-the-counter. Sony bought CBS Records Group which consisted of <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic Records</a> and other CBS labels in 1988 and Columbia Pictures Entertainment (<a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, <a href="TriStar%20Pictures">TriStar Pictures</a> and others) in 1989.

On November 25, 1994, Morita stepped down as Sony chairman after suffering a <a href="cerebral%20hemorrhage">cerebral hemorrhage</a> while playing tennis. He was succeeded by <a href="Norio%20Ohga">Norio Ohga</a>, who had joined the company in the 1950s after sending Morita a letter denouncing the poor quality of the company's tape recorders.

Morita was vice chairman of the <a href="Japan%20Business%20Federation">Japan Business Federation</a> (<a href="Japan%20Federation%20of%20Economic%20Organizations">Japan Federation of Economic Organizations</a>), and was a member of the Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group, also known as the "Wise Men's Group". He was also the third Japanese chairman of the <a href="Trilateral%20Commission">Trilateral Commission</a>. His amateur radio call sign is JP1DPJ.

In 1966, Morita wrote a book called "Gakureki Muyō Ron" (学歴無用論, Never Mind School Records), where he stresses that school records are not important to success or one's business skills. In 1986, Morita wrote an autobiography titled "<a href="Made%20in%20Japan%20%28biography%29">Made in Japan</a>". He co-authored the 1991 book "<a href="The%20Japan%20That%20Can%20Say%20No">The Japan That Can Say No</a>" with politician <a href="Shintaro%20Ishihara">Shintaro Ishihara</a>, where they criticized American business practices and encouraged Japanese to take a more independent role in business and foreign affairs. The book was translated into English and caused controversy in the United States, and Morita later had his chapters removed from the English version and distanced himself from the book.

Morita was awarded the <a href="Albert%20Medal%20%28Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts%29">Albert Medal</a> by the United Kingdom's <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> in 1982, the first Japanese to receive the honor. Two years later, he received the prestigious <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a>, and in 1991, was awarded the First Class <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Treasure">Order of the Sacred Treasure</a> from the <a href="Akihito">Emperor of Japan</a>. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">British knighthood (KBE)</a>. Morita received the International Distinguished Entrepreneur Award from the <a href="University%20of%20Manitoba">University of Manitoba</a> in 1987. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun">Order of the Rising Sun</a> in 1999.

Morita suffered a stroke in 1993, during a game of tennis. On November 25, 1994, he stepped down as Sony chairman. On October 3, 1999, Morita died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> at the age of 78.

<doc id="2392" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2392" title="Anode">
Anode

An anode is an <a href="electrode">electrode</a> through which <a href="conventional%20current">conventional current</a> flows into a polarized electrical device. A common <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a> is ACID for "anode current into device". The direction of (positive) electric current is opposite to the direction of electron flow: (negatively charged) electrons flow out the anode to the outside circuit.

The terms anode and <a href="cathode">cathode</a> do not relate to the voltage polarity of those electrodes but the direction of the current: whether positive charge is flowing into or out of the device. Conventional current quantifies the flow of positive charge. In most cases, positive charge flows into the device via the anode, and positive charge leaves the device via the cathode.

Conventional current depends not only on the direction the charge carriers move, but also the carriers' charge. The currents outside the device are usually carried by electrons in a metal conductor. The flow of electrons is opposite to conventional current because electrons have a negative charge. Consequently, electrons leave the device via the anode, and electrons enter the device through the cathode.

The anode and cathode have slightly different definitions for electrical devices such as diodes and vacuum tubes where the electrode naming is fixed and does not depend on the actual charge flow (current). These devices usually allow substantial current flow in one direction but negligible current in the other direction. Consequently, the electrode names use the terms that have substantial ordinary currents. An ideal diode allows current in one direction but not in the other. The electrode that allows positive charges to flow into it would be the anode, but that electrode would never allow positive charges to flow out, so that ideal diode terminal could never be the cathode. For the ideal diode, it makes sense to always call that terminal the anode. For non-ideal diodes, the electrodes are also given fixed names even though such a diode under reverse bias would have a positive charge flow out of the "anode". For some operating conditions and devices, such as diode breakdown, Zener diodes, or photodiodes, the positive charge flow out of the "anode" could be substantial.

The polarity of voltage on an anode with respect to an associated <a href="cathode">cathode</a> varies depending on the device type and on its operating mode. In the following examples, the anode is negative in a device that provides power, and positive in a device that consumes power:

In a discharging battery or <a href="galvanic%20cell">galvanic cell</a> (diagram at right), the anode is the negative terminal because it is where conventional current flows into "the device" (i.e. the battery cell). This inward current is carried externally by electrons moving outwards, negative charge flowing in one direction being electrically equivalent to positive charge flowing in the opposite direction.

In a recharging battery, or an <a href="electrolytic%20cell">electrolytic cell</a>, the anode is the positive terminal, which receives current from an external generator. The current through a recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge; in other words, the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging.

In a <a href="diode">diode</a>, the anode is the positive terminal at the tail of the arrow symbol (flat side of the triangle), where current flows into the device. Note electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current (that of the arrow, in which the current flows "most easily"), even for types such as <a href="Zener%20diode">Zener diode</a>s or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current.

In a <a href="cathode%20ray%20tube">cathode ray tube</a>, the anode is the positive terminal where electrons flow out of the device, i.e., where positive electric current flows in.

The word was coined in 1834 from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἄνοδος ("anodos"), 'ascent', by <a href="William%20Whewell">William Whewell</a>, who had been consulted by <a href="Michael%20Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a>. In that paper Faraday explained that when an electrolytic cell is oriented so that electric current traverses the "decomposing body" (electrolyte) in a direction "from East to West, or, which will strengthen this help to the memory, that in which the sun appears to move", the anode is where the current enters the electrolyte, on the East side: ""ano" upwards, "odos" a way; the way which the sun rises".

The use of 'East' to mean the 'in' direction (actually 'in' → 'East' → 'sunrise' → 'up') may appear contrived. Previously, as related in the first reference cited above, Faraday had used the more straightforward term "eisode" (the doorway where the current enters). His motivation for changing it to something meaning 'the East electrode' (other candidates had been "eastode", "oriode" and "anatolode") was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for <a href="electric%20current">current</a>, whose exact nature was not known at the time. The reference he used to this effect was the Earth's magnetic field direction, which at that time was believed to be invariant. He fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and in the same direction as a hypothetical <a href="solenoid">magnetizing current loop</a> around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic <a href="dipole">dipole</a> field oriented like the Earth's. This made the internal current East to West as previously mentioned, but in the event of a later convention change it would have become West to East, so that the East electrode would not have been the 'way in' any more. Therefore, "eisode" would have become inappropriate, whereas "anode" meaning 'East electrode' would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current, then unknown but, he thought, unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference. In retrospect the name change was unfortunate, not only because the Greek roots alone do not reveal the anode's function any more, but more importantly because as we now know, the Earth's magnetic field direction on which the "anode" term is based is subject to <a href="Geomagnetic%20reversal">reversals</a> whereas the <a href="electric%20current">current</a> direction convention on which the "eisode" term was based has no reason to change in the future.

Since the later discovery of the <a href="electron">electron</a>, an easier to remember and more durably correct technically although historically false, etymology has been suggested: anode, from the Greek "anodos", 'way up', 'the way (up) out of the cell (or other device) for electrons'.

In <a href="electrochemistry">electrochemistry</a>, the "anode" is where <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> occurs and is the positive polarity contact in an <a href="electrolytic%20cell">electrolytic cell</a>. At the anode, <a href="anion">anion</a>s (negative ions) are forced by the electrical potential to react chemically and give off electrons (oxidation) which then flow up and into the driving circuit. <a href="List%20of%20chemistry%20mnemonics%23Electrodes">Mnemonics</a>: LEO Red Cat (Loss of Electrons is Oxidation, Reduction occurs at the Cathode), or AnOx Red Cat (Anode Oxidation, Reduction Cathode), or OIL RIG (Oxidation is Loss, Reduction is Gain of electrons), or Roman Catholic and Orthodox (Reduction – Cathode, anode – Oxidation), or LEO the lion says GER (Losing electrons is Oxidation, Gaining electrons is Reduction).

This process is widely used in metals refining. For example, in copper refining, copper anodes, an intermediate product from the furnaces, are electrolysed in an appropriate solution (such as <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>) to yield high purity (99.99%) cathodes. Copper cathodes produced using this method are also described as <a href="electrolytic%20copper.">electrolytic copper.</a>

In a <a href="battery%20%28electricity%29">battery</a> or <a href="galvanic%20cell">galvanic cell</a>, the anode is the negative electrode from which electrons flow out towards the external part of the circuit. Internally the positively charged cations are flowing away from the anode (even though it is negative and therefore would be expected to attract them, this is due to <a href="electrode%20potential">electrode potential</a> relative to the electrolyte solution being different for the anode and cathode metal/electrolyte systems); but, external to the cell in the circuit, electrons are being pushed out through the negative contact and thus through the circuit by the voltage potential as would be expected. Note: in a galvanic cell, contrary to what occurs in an electrolytic cell, no anions flow to the anode, the internal current being entirely accounted for by the cations flowing away from it (cf drawing).

In the United States, many battery manufacturers regard the positive electrode as the anode, particularly in their technical literature. Though technically incorrect, it does resolve the problem of which electrode is the anode in a secondary (or rechargeable) cell. Using the traditional definition, the anode switches ends between charge and discharge cycles.

In electronic vacuum devices such as a <a href="cathode%20ray%20tube">cathode ray tube</a>, the <a href="Plate%20electrode">anode</a> is the positively charged electron collector. In a tube, the anode is a charged positive plate that collects the electrons emitted by the cathode through electric attraction. It also accelerates the flow of these electrons.

In a <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> <a href="diode">diode</a>, the anode is the P-doped layer which initially supplies "<a href="electron%20hole">holes</a>" to the junction. In the junction region, the holes supplied by the anode combine with electrons supplied from the N-doped region, creating a depleted zone. As the P-doped layer supplies holes to the depleted region, negative dopant ions are left behind in the P-doped layer ('P' for positive charge-carrier ions). This creates a base negative charge on the anode. When a positive voltage is applied to anode of the diode from the circuit, more "<a href="electron%20hole">holes</a>" are able to be transferred to the depleted region, and this causes the diode to become conductive, allowing current to flow through the circuit. The terms anode and cathode should not be applied to a Zener diode, since it allows flow in either direction, depending on the polarity of the applied potential (i.e. voltage).

In <a href="cathodic%20protection">cathodic protection</a>, a metal anode that is more reactive to the corrosive environment of the system to be protected is electrically linked to the protected system, and partially <a href="corrosion">corrodes</a> or dissolves, which protects the metal of the system it is connected to. As an example, an <a href="iron">iron</a> or <a href="steel">steel</a> <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">ship's hull</a> may be protected by a zinc <a href="sacrificial%20anode">sacrificial anode</a>, which will dissolve into the seawater and prevent the hull from being corroded. Sacrificial anodes are particularly needed for systems where a <a href="electrostatics">static charge</a> is generated by the action of flowing liquids, such as pipelines and watercraft. Sacrificial anodes are also generally used in tank-type water heaters.

In 1824 to reduce the impact of this destructive electrolytic action on ships hulls, their fastenings and underwater equipment, the scientist-engineer Sir <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a>, developed the first and still most widely used marine electrolysis protection system. Davy installed sacrificial anodes made from a more electrically reactive (less noble) metal attached to the vessel hull and electrically connected to form a cathodic protection circuit.

A less obvious example of this type of protection is the process of <a href="galvanise">galvanising</a> iron. This process coats iron structures (such as fencing) with a coating of <a href="zinc">zinc</a> metal. As long as the zinc remains intact, the iron is protected from the effects of corrosion. Inevitably, the zinc coating becomes breached, either by cracking or physical damage. Once this occurs, corrosive elements act as an electrolyte and the zinc/iron combination as electrodes. The resultant current ensures that the zinc coating is sacrificed but that the base iron does not corrode. Such a coating can protect an iron structure for a few decades, but once the protecting coating is consumed, the iron rapidly corrodes.

If, conversely, tin is used to coat steel, when a breach of the coating occurs it actually accelerates oxidation of the iron.

The opposite of an anode is a <a href="cathode">cathode</a>. When the current through the device is reversed, the <a href="electrode">electrode</a>s switch functions, so anode becomes cathode, while cathode becomes anode, as long as the reversed current is applied, with the exception of diodes where electrode naming is always based on the forward current direction.

Analog television

Analog television or analogue television is the original <a href="television">television</a> technology that uses <a href="analog%20signal">analog signal</a>s to transmit video and audio. In an analog television broadcast, the brightness, colors and sound are represented by rapid variations of either the <a href="amplitude">amplitude</a>, <a href="frequency">frequency</a> or phase of the signal.

Analog signals vary over a continuous range of possible values which means that electronic noise and interference becomes reproduced by the receiver. So with analog, a moderately weak signal becomes snowy and subject to interference. In contrast, a moderately weak digital signal and a very strong digital signal transmit equal picture quality. Analog television may be <a href="wireless">wireless</a> or can be distributed over a cable network using <a href="cable%20converter">cable converter</a>s.

All <a href="broadcast%20television%20system">broadcast television system</a>s preceding <a href="digital%20transmission">digital transmission</a> of <a href="digital%20television">digital television</a> (DTV) used analog signals.

Analog television around the world has been in the process of shutting down since the late 2000s.

The earliest systems were <a href="mechanical%20television">mechanical television</a> systems, which used spinning disks with patterns of holes punched into the disc to scan an image. A similar disk reconstructed the image at the receiver. Synchronization of the receiver disc rotation was handled through sync pulses broadcast with the image information. However these mechanical systems were slow, the images were dim and flickered severely, and the image resolution very low. Camera systems used similar spinning discs and required intensely bright illumination of the subject for the light detector to work.

Analog television did not really begin as an industry until the development of the <a href="cathode-ray%20tube">cathode-ray tube</a> (CRT), which uses a focused electron beam to trace lines across a <a href="phosphor">phosphor</a> coated surface. The electron beam could be swept across the screen much faster than any mechanical disc system, allowing for more closely spaced scan lines and much higher image resolution. Also far less maintenance was required of an all-electronic system compared to a spinning disc system. All-electronic systems became popular with households after the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>.

Broadcasters of analog television encode their signal using different systems. The official systems of transmission are named: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, K1, L, M and N. These systems determine the number of scan lines, frame rate, channel width, video bandwidth, video-audio separation, and so on.

The colors in those systems are encoded with one of three color coding schemes: <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a>, <a href="PAL">PAL</a>, or <a href="SECAM">SECAM</a>, and then use <a href="RF%20modulation">RF modulation</a> to modulate this signal onto a <a href="very%20high%20frequency">very high frequency</a> (VHF) or <a href="ultra%20high%20frequency">ultra high frequency</a> (UHF) carrier. Each frame of a television image is composed of lines drawn on the screen. The lines are of varying brightness; the whole set of lines is drawn quickly enough that the human eye perceives it as one image. The next sequential frame is displayed, allowing the depiction of motion. The analog television signal contains timing and synchronization information, so that the receiver can reconstruct a two-dimensional moving image from a one-dimensional time-varying signal.

The first <a href="commercial%20television">commercial television</a> systems were <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a>; the beginning of <a href="color%20television">color television</a> was in the 1950s.

A practical television system needs to take <a href="luma%20%28video%29">luminance</a>, <a href="chrominance">chrominance</a> (in a color system), synchronization (horizontal and vertical), and <a href="Sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction">audio</a> signals, and broadcast them over a radio transmission. The transmission system must include a means of <a href="television%20channel">television channel</a> selection.

Analog <a href="broadcast%20television%20systems">broadcast television systems</a> come in a variety of frame rates and resolutions. Further differences exist in the frequency and modulation of the audio carrier. The monochrome combinations still existing in the 1950s are standardized by the <a href="International%20Telecommunication%20Union">International Telecommunication Union</a> (ITU) as capital letters A through N. When color television was introduced, the hue and saturation information was added to the monochrome signals in a way that black and white televisions ignore. In this way backwards compatibility was achieved. That concept is true for all analog television standards.

There were three standards for the way the additional color information can be encoded and transmitted. The first was the American NTSC (National Television Systems Committee) color television system. The European/Australian PAL (Phase Alternation Line rate) and the French-former Soviet Union SECAM (Séquentiel Couleur Avec Mémoire) standard were developed later and attempt to cure certain defects of the NTSC system. PAL's color encoding is similar to the NTSC systems. SECAM, though, uses a different modulation approach than PAL or NTSC.

In principle, all three color encoding systems can be combined with any scan line/frame rate combination. Therefore, in order to describe a given signal completely, it's necessary to quote the color system and the broadcast standard as a capital letter. For example, the United States, Canada, Mexico and South Korea use NTSC-M (many of these transitioned or transitioning to digital), Japan uses NTSC-J (discontinued in 2012, when Japan transitioned to digital (ISDB)), the UK uses PAL-I (discontinued in 2012, when UK transitioned to digital (DVB-T)), France uses SECAM-L (discontinued in 2011, when France transitioned to digital (DVB-T)), much of Western Europe and Australia use PAL-B/G (Many of these transitioned or transitioning to DVB-T as digital television standards), most of Eastern Europe uses SECAM-D/K or PAL-D/K and so on.

However, not all of these possible combinations actually exist. NTSC is currently only used with system M, even though there were experiments with NTSC-A (405 line) in the UK and NTSC-N (625 line) in part of South America. PAL is used with a variety of 625-line standards (B,G,D,K,I,N) but also with the North American 525-line standard, accordingly named <a href="PAL-M">PAL-M</a>. Likewise, SECAM is used with a variety of 625-line standards.

For this reason many people refer to any 625/25 type signal as "PAL" and to any 525/30 signal as "NTSC", even when referring to digital signals; for example, on <a href="DVD-video">DVD-video</a>, which does not contain any analog color encoding, and thus no PAL or NTSC signals at all. Even though this usage is common, it is misleading, as that is not the original meaning of the terms PAL/SECAM/NTSC.

Although a number of different broadcast television systems were in use worldwide, the same principles of operation apply.

In many countries, over-the-air <a href="broadcast%20television">broadcast television</a> of <a href="analog%20audio">analog audio</a> and <a href="analog%20video">analog video</a> signals has been discontinued, to allow the re-use of the television broadcast <a href="radio%20spectrum">radio spectrum</a> for other services such as <a href="datacasting">datacasting</a> and <a href="subchannel">subchannel</a>s.

A <a href="cathode-ray%20tube">cathode-ray tube</a> (CRT) television displays an image by scanning a beam of <a href="electrons">electrons</a> across the screen in a pattern of horizontal lines known as a <a href="raster%20scan">raster</a>. At the end of each line the beam returns to the start of the next line; the end of the last line is a link that returns to the top of the screen. As it passes each point the intensity of the beam is varied, varying the <a href="luminance">luminance</a> of that point. A <a href="color%20television">color television</a> system is identical except that an additional signal known as <a href="chrominance">chrominance</a> controls the color of the spot.

Raster scanning is shown in a slightly simplified form below.

When analog television was developed, no affordable technology for storing any video signals existed; the luminance signal has to be generated and transmitted at the same time at which it is displayed on the CRT. It is therefore essential to keep the raster scanning in the camera (or other device for producing the signal) in exact <a href="synchronization">synchronization</a> with the scanning in the television.

The physics of the CRT require that a finite time interval be allowed for the spot to move back to the start of the next line ("horizontal retrace") or the start of the screen ("vertical retrace"). The timing of the luminance signal must allow for this.

The human eye has a characteristic called <a href="Phi%20phenomenon">Phi phenomenon</a>. Quickly displaying successive scan images will allow the apparent <a href="illusion">illusion</a> of smooth motion. Flickering of the image can be partially solved using a long persistence phosphor coating on the CRT, so that successive images fade slowly. However, slow phosphor has the negative side-effect of causing image smearing and blurring when there is a large amount of rapid on-screen motion occurring.

The maximum <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a> depends on the <a href="Bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidth</a> of the electronics and the transmission system, and the number of horizontal scan lines in the image. A frame rate of 25 or 30 <a href="hertz">hertz</a> is a satisfactory compromise, while the process of <a href="interlacing">interlacing</a> two <a href="video%20field">video field</a>s of the picture per <a href="film%20frame">frame</a> is used to build the image. This process doubles the apparent number of video frames per second and further reduces flicker and other defects in transmission.

<a href="Plasma%20screens">Plasma screens</a> and <a href="LCD">LCD</a> screens have been used in analog <a href="television%20set">television set</a>s. These types of display screens use lower voltages than older CRT displays. Many dual system <a href="television%20receiver">television receiver</a>s, equipped to receive both <a href="analog%20transmission">analog transmission</a>s and <a href="digital%20transmission">digital transmission</a>s have analog <a href="tuner%20%28television%29">tuner</a> receiving capability and must use a <a href="television%20antenna">television antenna</a>.

The television system for each country will specify a number of television channels within the UHF or VHF frequency ranges. A channel actually consists of two signals: the picture information is transmitted using <a href="amplitude%20modulation">amplitude modulation</a> on one frequency, and the sound is transmitted with <a href="frequency%20modulation">frequency modulation</a> at a frequency at a fixed offset (typically 4.5 to 6 MHz) from the picture signal.

The channel frequencies chosen represent a compromise between allowing enough <a href="Bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidth</a> for video (and hence satisfactory picture resolution), and allowing enough channels to be packed into the available frequency band. In practice a technique called <a href="vestigial%20sideband">vestigial sideband</a> is used to reduce the channel spacing, which would be nearly twice the video bandwidth if pure AM was used.

Signal reception is invariably done via a <a href="superheterodyne%20receiver">superheterodyne receiver</a>: the first stage is a "tuner" which selects a television channel and frequency-shifts it to a fixed <a href="intermediate%20frequency">intermediate frequency</a> (IF). The signal <a href="amplifier">amplifier</a> performs amplification to the IF stages from the microvolt range to fractions of a volt.

At this point the IF signal consists of a video <a href="carrier%20signal">carrier signal</a> at one frequency and the sound carrier at a fixed offset. A <a href="demodulator">demodulator</a> recovers the video signal. Also at the output of the same demodulator is a new frequency modulated sound carrier at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22 MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as "intercarrier sound", and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the sound <a href="carrier%20frequency">carrier frequency</a> does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.

So the FM sound carrier is then demodulated, amplified, and used to drive a loudspeaker. Until the advent of the <a href="NICAM">NICAM</a> and <a href="Multichannel%20television%20sound">MTS</a> systems, television sound transmissions were invariably monophonic.

The video carrier is demodulated to give a <a href="composite%20video">composite video</a> signal; this contains luminance, chrominance and synchronization signals; this is identical to the video signal format used by analog video devices such as <a href="VCRs">VCRs</a> or <a href="closed-circuit%20television">CCTV cameras</a>. Note that the RF signal modulation is inverted compared to the conventional AM: the minimum video signal level corresponds to maximum carrier amplitude, and vice versa. To ensure good linearity (fidelity), consistent with affordable manufacturing costs of transmitters and receivers, the video carrier is never shut off altogether. When intercarrier sound was invented later in 1948, not completely shutting off the carrier had the side effect of allowing intercarrier sound to be economically implemented.

Each line of the displayed image is transmitted using a signal as shown above. The same basic format (with minor differences mainly related to timing and the encoding of color) is used for PAL, <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> and SECAM television systems. A monochrome signal is identical to a color one, with the exception that the elements shown in color in the diagram (the color burst, and the chrominance signal) are not present.
The "front porch" is a brief (about 1.5 <a href="microsecond">microsecond</a>) period inserted between the end of each transmitted line of picture and the leading edge of the next line <a href="sync%20pulse">sync pulse</a>. Its purpose was to allow <a href="voltage">voltage</a> levels to stabilise in older televisions, preventing interference between picture lines. The "front porch" is the first component of the <a href="horizontal%20blanking%20interval">horizontal blanking interval</a> which also contains the horizontal sync pulse and the "back porch".

The "back porch" is the portion of each scan line between the end (rising edge) of the horizontal sync pulse and the start of active video. It is used to restore the black level (300 mV) reference in analog video. In signal processing terms, it compensates for the <a href="fall%20time">fall time</a> and <a href="settling%20time">settling time</a> following the sync pulse.

In color television systems such as PAL and NTSC, this period also includes the <a href="colorburst">colorburst</a> signal. In the SECAM system it contains the reference subcarrier for each consecutive color difference signal in order to set the zero-color reference.

In some professional systems, particularly <a href="satellite%20link">satellite link</a>s between locations, the audio is embedded within the back porch of the video signal, to save the cost of renting a second channel.

The luminance component of a composite video signal varies between 0 V and approximately 0.7 V above the "black" level. In the NTSC system, there is a "blanking" signal level used during the front porch and back porch, and a "black" signal level 75 mV above it; in PAL and SECAM these are identical.

In a monochrome receiver the luminance signal is amplified to drive the <a href="control%20grid">control grid</a> in the <a href="electron%20gun">electron gun</a> of the CRT. This changes the intensity of the electron beam and therefore the brightness of the spot being scanned. Brightness and contrast controls determine the DC shift and amplification, respectively.

A color signal conveys picture information for each of the red, green, and blue components of an image (see the article on <a href="color%20space">color space</a> for more information). However, these are not simply transmitted as three separate signals, because: such a signal would not be compatible with monochrome receivers (an important consideration when color broadcasting was first introduced). It would also occupy three times the bandwidth of existing television, requiring a decrease in the number of television channels available. Furthermore, typical problems with signal transmission (such as differing received signal levels between different colors) would produce unpleasant side effects.

Instead, the RGB signals are converted into <a href="YUV">YUV</a> form, where the Y signal represents the lightness and darkness (luminance) of the colors in the image. Because the rendering of colors in this way is the goal of both black and white (monochrome) film and black and white (monochrome) television systems, the Y signal is ideal for transmission as the luminance signal. This ensures a monochrome receiver will display a correct picture in black and white, where a given color is reproduced by a shade of gray that correctly reflects how light or dark the original color is.

The U and V signals are "color difference" signals. The U signal is the difference between the B signal and the Y signal, also known as B minus Y (B-Y), and the V signal is the difference between the R signal and the Y signal, also known as R minus Y (R-Y). The U signal then represents how "purplish-blue" or its complementary color "yellowish-green" the color is, and the V signal how "purplish-red" or its complementary "greenish-cyan" it is. The advantage of this scheme is that the U and V signals are zero when the picture has no color content. Since the human eye is more sensitive to errors in luminance than in color, the U and V signals can be transmitted in a relatively <a href="lossy%20compression">lossy</a> (specifically: bandwidth-limited) way with acceptable results.

In the receiver, a single demodulator can extract an additive combination of U plus V. An example is the X demodulator used in the X/Z demodulation system. In that same system, a second demodulator, the Z demodulator, also extracts an additive combination of U plus V, but in a different ratio. The X and Z color difference signals are further matrixed into three color difference signals, (R-Y), (B-Y), and (G-Y). The combinations of usually two, but sometimes three demodulators were:

a) (I) / (Q), (as used in the 1954 RCA CTC-2 and the 1985 RCA "Colortrak" series, and the 1954 Arvin, and some professional color monitors in the 1990s),

b) (R-Y) / (Q), as used in the 1955 RCA 21 inch color receiver,

c) (R-Y) / (B-Y), used in the first color receiver on the market (Westinghouse, not RCA),

d) (R-Y) / (G-Y), (as used in the RCA Victor CTC-4 chassis),

e) (R-Y) / (B-Y) / (G-Y),

f) (X) / (Z), as used in many receivers of the late 50's and throughout the 60's.

In the end, further matrixing of the above color-difference signals c through f yielded the three color-difference signals, (R-Y), (B-Y), and (G-Y).

The R,G,B signals in the receiver needed for the display device (CRT, Plasma display or LCD display) are electronically derived by matrixing as follows: R is the additive combination of (R-Y) with Y, G is the additive combination of (G-Y) with Y, and B is the additive combination of (B-Y) with Y. All of this is accomplished electronically. It can be seen that in the combining process, the low resolution portion of the Y signals cancel out, leaving R,G, and B signals able to render a low-resolution image in full color. However, the higher resolution portions of the Y signals do not cancel out, and so are equally present in R, G, and B, producing the higher definition (higher resolution) image detail in monochrome, although it appears to the human eye as a full-color and full resolution picture.

In the NTSC and PAL color systems, U and V are transmitted by using quadrature amplitude modulation of a subcarrier. This kind of modulation applies two independent signals to one subcarrier, with the idea that both signals will be recovered independently at the receive end. Before transmission, the subcarrier itself, is removed from the active (visible) portion of the video, and moved, in the form of a burst, to the horizontal blanking portion, which is not directly visible on screen. (More about the burst below.)

For NTSC, the subcarrier is a 3.58 MHz sine wave. For the PAL system it is a 4.43 MHz sine wave. After the above-mentioned quadrature amplitude modulation of the subcarrier, subcarrier sidebands are produced, and the subcarrier itself is filtered out of the visible portion of the video, since it is the subcarrier sidebands that carry all of the U and V information, and the subcarrier itself carries no information.

The resulting subcarrier sidebands is also known as "chroma" or "chrominance". Physically, this chrominance signal is a 3.58 MHz(NTSC) or 4.43 MHz(PAL) sine wave which, in response to changing U and V values, changes phase as compared to the subcarrier, and also changes amplitude.

As it turns out, the chroma amplitude (when considered together with the Y signal) represents the approximate saturation of a color, and the chroma phase against the subcarrier as reference, approximately represents the hue of the color. For particular test colors found in the test color bar pattern, exact amplitudes and phases are sometimes defined for test and trouble shooting purposes only.

Although, in response to changing U and V values, the chroma sinewave changes phase with respect to the subcarrier, it's not correct to say that the subcarrier is simply "phase modulated". That is because a single sine wave U test signal with QAM produces only one pair of sidebands, whereas real phase modulation under the same test conditions would produce multiple sets of sidebands occupying more frequency spectrum.

In NTSC, the chrominance sine wave has the same average frequency as the subcarrier frequency. But a spectrum analyzer instrument shows that, for transmitted chrominance, the frequency component at the subcarrier frequency is actually zero energy, verifying that the subcarrier was indeed removed before transmission.

These sideband frequencies are within the luminance signal band, which is why they are called "subcarrier" sidebands instead of simply "carrier" sidebands. Their exact frequencies were chosen such that (for NTSC), they are midway between two harmonics of the frame repetition rate, thus ensuring that the majority of the power of the luminance signal does not overlap with the power of the chrominance signal.

In the British PAL (D) system, the actual chrominance center frequency, with equal lower and upper sidebands, is 4.43361875 MHz, a direct multiple of the scan rate frequency. This frequency was chosen to minimize the chrominance beat interference pattern that would be visible in areas of high color saturation in the transmitted picture.

At certain times, the chrominance signal represents only the U signal, and 70 nanoseconds (NTSC) later, the chrominance signal represents only the V signal. (This is the nature of the quadrature amplitude modulation process that created the chrominance signal.) About 70 nanoseconds later still, -U, and another 70 nanoseconds, -V.

So to extract U, a synchronous demodulator is utilized, which uses the subcarrier to briefly gate (sample) the chroma every 280 nanoseconds, so that the output is only a train of discrete pulses, each having an amplitude that is the same as the original U signal at the corresponding time. In effect, these pulses are discrete-time analog samples of the U signal. The pulses are then low-pass filtered so that the original analog continuous-time U signal is recovered. For V, a 90 degree shifted subcarrier briefly gates the chroma signal every 280 nanoseconds, and the rest of the process is identical to that used for the U signal.

Gating at any other time than those times mentioned above will yield an additive mixture of any two of U, V, -U, or -V. One of these "off-axis" (that is, off the U and V axis) gating methods is called I/Q demodulation. Another much more popular "off-axis" scheme was the X/Z demodulation system. Further matrixing recovered the original U and V signals. This scheme was actually the most popular demodulator scheme throughout the 60's.

The above process uses the subcarrier. But as previously mentioned, it was deleted before transmission, and only the chroma is transmitted. Therefore, the receiver must reconstitute the subcarrier. For this purpose, a short burst of subcarrier, known as the color burst, is transmitted during the back porch (re-trace blanking period) of each scan line. A subcarrier oscillator in the receiver locks onto this signal (see phase-locked loop) to achieve a phase reference, resulting in the oscillator producing the reconstituted subcarrier.

NTSC uses this process unmodified. Unfortunately, this often results in poor color reproduction due to phase errors in the received signal, caused sometimes by multipath, but mostly by poor implementation at the studio end. With the advent of solid state receivers, cable TV, and digital studio equipment for conversion to an over-the-air analog signal, these NTSC problems have been largely fixed, leaving operator error at the studio end as the sole color rendition weakness of the NTSC system. In any case, the PAL D (delay) system mostly corrects these kind of errors by reversing the phase of the signal on each successive line, and the averaging the results over pairs of lines. This process is achieved by the use of a 1H (where H = horizontal scan frequency) duration delay line. (A typical circuit used with this device converts the low frequency color signal to <a href="ultrasound">ultrasound</a> and back again). Phase shift errors between successive lines are therefore cancelled out and the wanted signal amplitude is increased when the two in-phase (<a href="coincident">coincident</a>) signals are re-combined.

NTSC is more spectrum efficient than PAL, giving more picture detail for a given bandwidth. This is because sophisticated comb filters in receivers are more effective with NTSC's 4 field color phase cadence compared to PAL's 8 field cadence. However, in the end, the larger channel width of most PAL systems in Europe still give their PAL systems the edge in transmitting more picture detail.

In the <a href="SECAM">SECAM</a> television system, U and V are transmitted on "alternate" lines, using simple <a href="frequency%20modulation">frequency modulation</a> of two different color subcarriers.

In some analog color CRT displays, starting in 1956, the brightness control signal (<a href="luminance">luminance</a>) is fed to the <a href="cathode">cathode</a> connections of the electron guns, and the color difference signals (<a href="chrominance">chrominance</a> signals) are fed to the control grids connections. This simple CRT matrix mixing technique was replaced in later <a href="solid%20state%20%28electronics%29">solid state</a> designs of signal processing with the original matrixing method used in the 1954 and 1955 color TV receivers.

Synchronizing pulses added to the video signal at the end of every <a href="scan%20line">scan line</a> and video frame ensure that the sweep oscillators in the receiver remain locked in step with the transmitted signal, so that the image can be reconstructed on the receiver screen.

A "sync separator" circuit detects the sync voltage levels and sorts the pulses into horizontal and vertical sync. (see section below – Other technical information, for extra detail.)

The horizontal synchronization pulse ("horizontal sync" "HSYNC"), separates the <a href="scan%20line">scan line</a>s. The horizontal sync signal is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line. The rest of the scan line follows, with the signal ranging from 0.3 V (black) to 1 V (white), until the next horizontal or <a href="vertical%20synchronization%20pulse">vertical synchronization pulse</a>.

The format of the horizontal sync pulse varies. In the 525-line <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> system it is a 4.85 <a href="microsecond">µs</a>-long pulse at 0 <a href="volt">V</a>. In the 625-line <a href="PAL">PAL</a> system the pulse is 4.7 µs synchronization pulse at 0 <a href="volt">V</a> . This is lower than the amplitude of any video signal ("blacker than black") so it can be detected by the level-sensitive "sync stripper" circuit of the receiver.

Vertical synchronization (also called vertical sync or VSync) separates the video fields. In PAL and NTSC, the vertical sync pulse occurs within the <a href="vertical%20blanking%20interval">vertical blanking interval</a>. The vertical sync pulses are made by prolonging the length of HSYNC pulses through almost the entire length of the scan line.

The "vertical sync" signal is a series of much longer pulses, indicating the start of a new field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).

The format of such a signal in 525-line <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> is:

Each pre- or post- equalizing pulse consists in half a <a href="scan%20line">scan line</a> of black signal: 2 µs at 0 V, followed by 30 µs at 0.3 V.

Each long sync pulse consists in an equalizing pulse with timings inverted: 30 µs at 0 V, followed by 2 µs at 0.3 V.

In video production and computer graphics, changes to the image are often kept in step with the vertical synchronization pulse to avoid visible discontinuity of the image. Since the <a href="frame%20buffer">frame buffer</a> of a <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a> display imitates the dynamics of a cathode-ray display, if it is updated with a new image while the image is being transmitted to the display, the display shows a mishmash of both frames, producing a <a href="page%20tearing">page tearing</a> <a href="digital%20artifact">artifact</a> partway down the image.

Vertical synchronization eliminates this by timing frame buffer fills to coincide with the <a href="vertical%20blanking%20interval">vertical blanking interval</a>, thus ensuring that only whole frames are seen on-screen. Software such as video games and <a href="computer%20aided%20design">computer aided design</a> (CAD) packages often allow vertical synchronization as an option, because it delays the image update until the vertical blanking interval. This produces a small penalty in latency, because the program has to wait until the video controller has finished transmitting the image to the display before continuing. <a href="Triple%20buffering">Triple buffering</a> reduces this latency significantly.

Two timing intervals are defined – the "front porch" between the end of displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the "back porch" after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the "horizontal blanking" (or "retrace") "interval" and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning to the start of the next display line.

The lack of precision timing components in early television receivers meant that the timebase circuits occasionally needed manual adjustment.
If their free-run frequencies were too far from the actual line and field rates, the circuits would not be able to follow the incoming sync signals.
Loss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.

The adjustment took the form of "horizontal hold" and "vertical hold" controls, usually on the front panel along with other common controls. These adjusted the free-run frequencies of the corresponding timebase oscillators.

By the early 1980s the efficacy of the synchronization circuits, plus the inherent stability of the sets' oscillators, had been improved to the point where these controls were no longer necessary.

A typical analog monochrome <a href="television%20receiver">television receiver</a> is based around the block diagram shown below:

Image synchronization is achieved by transmitting negative-going pulses; in a composite video signal of 1 volt amplitude, these are approximately 0.3 V below the "<a href="black%20level">black level</a>". The "horizontal sync" signal is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line. Two timing intervals are defined – the "front porch" between the end of displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the "back porch" after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the "horizontal blanking" (or "retrace") "interval" and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning to the start of the next display line.

The "vertical sync" signal is a series of much longer pulses, indicating the start of a new field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).

In the television receiver, a "sync separator" circuit detects the sync voltage levels and sorts the pulses into horizontal and vertical sync.

Loss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.

Counting sync pulses, a <a href="video%20line%20selector">video line selector</a> picks a selected line from a TV signal, used for <a href="teletext">teletext</a>, <a href="on-screen%20display">on-screen display</a>s, <a href="station%20identification">station identification</a> logos as well as in the industry when cameras were used as a sensor.

In an analog receiver with a <a href="Cathode%20ray%20tube">CRT</a> display sync pulses are fed to horizontal and vertical "timebase" circuits (commonly called "sweep circuits" in the United States), each consisting of an oscillator and an amplifier. These generate modified <a href="sawtooth%20wave">sawtooth</a> and <a href="parabola">parabola</a> current waveforms to scan the electron beam in a <a href="linear">linear</a> way. The waveform shapes are necessary to make up for the distance variations from the electron beam source and the screen surface. The oscillators are designed to free-run at frequencies very close to the field and line rates, but the sync pulses cause them to reset at the beginning of each scan line or field, resulting in the necessary synchronization of the beam sweep with the originating signal. The output waveforms from the timebase amplifiers are fed to the horizontal and vertical "deflection coils" wrapped around the CRT tube. These coils produce <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s proportional to the changing current, and these deflect the electron beam across the screen.

In the 1950s, the power for these circuits was derived directly from the mains supply.
A simple circuit consisted of a <a href="Series%20and%20parallel%20circuits">series</a> voltage dropper <a href="Electrical%20resistance">resistance</a> and a <a href="rectifier">rectifier</a> <a href="valve">valve</a> (<a href="Vacuum%20tube">tube</a>) or <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> <a href="diode">diode</a>. This avoided the cost of a large high voltage mains supply (50 or 60 Hz) <a href="transformer">transformer</a>. This type of circuit was used for thermionic valve (<a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>) technology. It was inefficient and produced a lot of heat which led to premature failures in the circuitry.

In the 1960s, <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> technology was introduced into timebase circuits. During the late 1960s in the UK, <a href="Synchronization%20%28alternating%20current%29">synchronous</a> (with the scan line rate) power generation was introduced into <a href="Solid%20state%20%28electronics%29">solid state</a> receiver designs. These had very complex circuits in which faults were difficult to trace, but had very efficient use of power.

In the early 1970s <a href="Alternating%20current">AC</a> mains (50 or 60 Hz), and line timebase (15,625 Hz), <a href="thyristor">thyristor</a> based switching circuits were introduced. In the UK use of the simple (50 Hz) types of power circuits were discontinued. The reason for design changes arose from the electricity supply contamination problems arising from <a href="Electromagnetic%20interference">EMI</a>, and supply loading issues due to energy being taken from only the positive half cycle of the mains supply waveform.

Most of the receiver's circuitry (at least in <a href="transistor">transistor</a>- or <a href="integrated%20circuit">IC</a>-based designs) operates from a comparatively low-voltage <a href="direct-current">DC</a> power supply. However, the <a href="anode">anode</a> connection for a <a href="cathode-ray%20tube">cathode-ray tube</a> requires a very high voltage (typically 10–30 kV) for correct operation.

This voltage is not directly produced by the main <a href="power%20supply">power supply</a> circuitry; instead the receiver makes use of the circuitry used for horizontal scanning. <a href="Direct%20current">Direct current</a> (DC), is switched though the line output transformer, and <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a> (AC) is induced into the scan coils. At the end of each horizontal scan line the <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>, which has built up in both transformer and scan coils by the current, is a source of latent electromagnetic energy. This stored collapsing magnetic field energy can be captured. The reverse flow, short duration, (about 10% of the line scan time) current from both the line output transformer and the horizontal scan coil is discharged again into the <a href="transformer">primary winding</a> of the <a href="flyback%20transformer">flyback transformer</a> by the use of a rectifier which blocks this negative reverse <a href="electromotive%20force">emf</a>. A small value <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a> is connected across the scan switching device. This tunes the circuit <a href="inductance">inductance</a>s to <a href="resonate">resonate</a> at a much higher <a href="frequency">frequency</a>. This slows down (lengthens) the flyback time from the extremely rapid decay rate that would result if they were electrically isolated during this short period. One of the secondary windings on the flyback transformer then feeds this brief high voltage pulse to a <a href="Cockcroft%E2%80%93Walton%20generator">Cockcroft–Walton generator</a> design <a href="voltage%20multiplier">voltage multiplier</a>. This produces the required <a href="extra%20high%20tension">EHT</a> supply. A <a href="flyback%20converter">flyback converter</a> is a power supply circuit operating on similar principles.

A typical modern design incorporates the flyback transformer and rectifier circuitry into a single unit with a captive output lead, (known as a diode split line output transformer or an Integrated High Voltage Transformer (IHVT)), so that all high-voltage parts are enclosed. Earlier designs used a separate line output transformer and a well insulated high voltage multiplier unit. The high frequency (15 kHz or so) of the horizontal scanning allows reasonably small components to be used.

The first country to make a wholesale <a href="digital%20television%20transition">switch</a> to digital over-the-air (terrestrial television) broadcasting was Luxembourg in 2006, followed later in 2006 by the Netherlands; in 2007 by Finland, Andorra, Sweden and Switzerland; in 2008 by Belgium (Flanders) and Germany; in 2009 by the United States (high power stations), southern Canada, the Isle of Man, Norway, and Denmark. In 2010, Belgium (Wallonia), Spain, Wales, Latvia, Estonia, the Channel Islands, San Marino and Slovenia; in 2011 Israel, Austria, Monaco, Cyprus, Japan (excluding <a href="Miyagi%20Prefecture">Miyagi</a>, <a href="Iwate%20Prefecture">Iwate</a>, and <a href="Fukushima%20Prefecture">Fukushima</a> prefectures), Malta and France; in 2012 the Czech Republic, Arab World, Taiwan, Portugal, Japan (including Miyagi, Iwate, and Fukushima prefectures), Serbia, Italy, Canada, Mauritius, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Lithuania, Slovakia, Gibraltar, and South Korea; in 2013, the Republic of Macedonia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Australia, and New Zealand, completed the transition. The United Kingdom made the transition to digital television between 2008 and 2012, with the exception of <a href="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow-in-Furness</a>, which made the switch over in 2007. The first digital TV-only area in the United Kingdom was Ferryside in <a href="Carmarthenshire">Carmarthenshire</a>.

In the United States, high-power over-the-air broadcasts are solely in the <a href="ATSC">ATSC</a> digital format since 12 June 2009, the date that the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) set for the end of all high-power analog television transmissions. As a result, almost two million households could no longer watch television because they had not prepared for the transition. The switchover was originally scheduled for 17 February 2009, until the <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> passed the <a href="DTV%20Delay%20Act">DTV Delay Act</a>. By special dispensation, some analog television signals ceased on the original date. While the majority of the viewers of over-the-air broadcast television in the U.S. watch full-power stations (which number about 1800), there are three other categories of television stations in the U.S.: <a href="low-power%20broadcasting">low-power broadcasting</a> stations, <a href="Class%20A%20television%20service">class A stations</a>, and <a href="broadcast%20relay%20station">television translator stations</a>. There is presently no deadline for these stations, about 7100 in number, to convert to digital broadcasting. In broadcasting, whatever happens in the United States also influences southern Canada and northern Mexico because those areas are covered by television stations in the U.S.

In Japan, the switch to digital occurred on the 24 July 2011, but in Fukushima, Iwate, and Miyagi prefectures, the conversion was delayed to 31 March 2012, due to complications from the <a href="2011%20T%C5%8Dhoku%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami</a> and <a href="Fukushima%20Daiichi%20nuclear%20disaster">its related nuclear accidents</a>. In Canada, most of the larger cities turned off analog broadcasts on 31 August 2011. China is scheduled to end analog broadcasting between 2015 and 2018, due to the large size of the country.

Brazil switched to digital television on 2 December 2007 in its major cities. It is now estimated that Brazil will end analog broadcasting in 2023.

In Malaysia, the Malaysian Communications & Multimedia Commission (MCMC) advertised for tender bids to be submitted in the third quarter of 2009 for the 470 through 742 MHz <a href="UHF">UHF</a> allocation, to enable Malaysia's broadcast system to move into DTV. The new <a href="broadcast%20band">broadcast band</a> allocation would result in Malaysia's having to build an infrastructure for all broadcasters, using a single <a href="digital%20terrestrial%20transmission">digital terrestrial transmission</a>/television broadcast (DTTB) channel. Large portions of Malaysia are covered by television broadcasts from Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, and Indonesia (from Borneo and Batam)

In the Philippines, the <a href="National%20Telecommunications%20Commission">National Telecommunications Commission</a> required all broadcasting companies to end analog broadcasting on December 31, 2015 at 11:59 p.m. Due to delay of the release of the implementing rules and regulations for digital television broadcast, the target date was moved to 2020. Full digital broadcast is expected in 2021.

Adhesive

Adhesive may be used interchangeably with glue, cement, <a href="mucilage">mucilage</a>, or paste, and is any substance applied to one surface, or both surfaces, of two separate items that binds them together and resists their separation. Adjectives may be used in conjunction with the word "adhesive" to describe properties based on the substance's physical or chemical form, the type of materials joined, or conditions under which it is applied.

The use of adhesives offers many advantages over binding techniques such as <a href="sewing">sewing</a>, <a href="fastener">mechanical fastening</a>, <a href="welding">thermal bonding</a>, etc. These include the ability to bind different materials together, to distribute stress more efficiently across the joint, the cost effectiveness of an easily mechanized process, an improvement in aesthetic design, and increased design flexibility. Disadvantages of adhesive use include decreased stability at high temperatures, relative weakness in bonding large objects with a small bonding surface area, and greater difficulty in separating objects during testing. Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion. These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemically reacts</a> in order to harden. Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural or synthetic origin, or by their starting <a href="phase%20%28matter%29">physical phase</a>.

Adhesives may be found naturally or produced synthetically. The earliest human use of adhesive-like substances was approximately 200,000 years ago, when Neanderthals produced tar from the dry distillation of birch bark for use in binding stone tools to wooden handles.The first references to adhesives in literature first appeared in approximately 2000 BCE. The Greeks and Romans made great contributions to the development of adhesives. In Europe, glue was not widely used until the period 1500–1700 CE. From then until the 1900s increases in adhesive use and discovery were relatively gradual. Only since the last century has the development of synthetic adhesives accelerated rapidly, and innovation in the field continues to the present.

The earliest use of adhesives was discovered in central Italy when two stone flakes partially covered with birch-bark <a href="tar">tar</a> and a third uncovered stone from the Middle Pleistocene era (circa 200,000 years ago) were found. This is thought to be the oldest discovered human use of tar-<a href="axe">hafted</a> stones.

The birch-bark-tar adhesive is a simple, one-component adhesive. Although sticky enough, plant-based adhesives are brittle and vulnerable to environmental conditions. The first use of compound adhesives was discovered in Sibudu, South Africa. Here, 70,000-year-old stone segments that were once inserted in axe hafts were discovered covered with an adhesive composed of plant gum and red ochre (natural iron oxide) as adding ochre to plant gum produces a stronger product and protects the gum from disintegrating under wet conditions. The ability to produce stronger adhesives allowed middle stone age humans to attach stone segments to sticks in greater variations, which led to the development of new tools.

More recent examples of adhesive use by prehistoric humans have been found at the burial sites of ancient tribes. Archaeologists studying the sites found that approximately 6,000 years ago the tribesmen had buried their dead together with food found in broken clay pots repaired with tree resins. Another investigation by archaeologists uncovered the use of <a href="bitumen">bituminous</a> cements to fasten ivory eyeballs to statues in Babylonian temples dating to approximately 4000 BCE.

In 2000, a paper revealed the discovery of a 5,200-year-old man nicknamed the "<a href="%C3%96tzi">Tyrolean Iceman</a>" or "Ötzi", who was preserved in a glacier near the Austria-Italy border. Several of his belongings were found with him including two arrows with flint arrowheads and a copper hatchet, each with evidence of organic glue used to connect the stone or metal parts to the wooden shafts. The glue was analyzed as <a href="pitch%20%28resin%29">pitch</a>, which requires the heating of tar during its production. The retrieval of this tar requires a transformation of birch bark by means of heat, in a process known as pyrolysis.

The first references to adhesives in literature first appeared in approximately 2000 BCE. Further historical records of adhesive use are found from the period spanning 1500–1000 BCE. Artifacts from this period include paintings depicting wood gluing operations and a casket made of wood and glue in King <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun's</a> tomb. Other ancient Egyptian artifacts employ animal glue for bonding or lamination. Such lamination of wood for bows and furniture is thought to have extended their life and was accomplished using <a href="casein">casein</a> (milk protein)-based glues. The ancient Egyptians also developed starch-based pastes for the bonding of <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a> to clothing and a <a href="plaster%20of%20Paris">plaster of Paris</a>-like material made of calcined gypsum.

From 1 to 500 AD the Greeks and Romans made great contributions to the development of adhesives. <a href="Wood%20veneer">Wood veneer</a>ing and <a href="marquetry">marquetry</a> were developed, the production of animal and fish glues refined, and other materials utilized. Egg-based pastes were used to bond gold leaves incorporated various natural ingredients such as blood, bone, hide, milk, cheese, vegetables, and grains. The Greeks began the use of <a href="slaked%20lime">slaked lime</a> as mortar while the Romans furthered mortar development by mixing lime with volcanic ash and sand. This material, known as <a href="Pozzolana">pozzolanic cement</a>, was used in the construction of the Roman Colosseum and Pantheon. The Romans were also the first people known to have used tar and beeswax as caulk and sealant between the wooden planks of their boats and ships.

In Central Asia, the rise of the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a> in approximately 1000 AD can be partially attributed to the good range and power of the bows of Genghis Khan's hordes. These bows were constructed with laminated lemonwood and bullhorn bonded by an unknown adhesive.

In Europe, glue fell into disuse until the period 1500–1700 AD. At this time, world-renowned cabinet and furniture makers such as <a href="Thomas%20Chippendale">Thomas Chippendale</a> and <a href="Duncan%20Phyfe">Duncan Phyfe</a> began to use adhesives to hold their products together.

The development of modern adhesives began in 1690 with the founding of the first commercial glue plant in Holland. This plant produced glues from animal hides.

In 1750, the first British glue patent was issued for fish glue. The following decades of the next century witnessed the manufacture of casein glues in German and Swiss factories. In 1876, the first US patent (number 183,024) was issued to the Ross brothers for the production of casein glue.

The first US postage stamps used starch-based adhesives when issued in 1840. The first US patent (number 61,991) on dextrin (a starch derivative) adhesive was issued in 1867.

Natural rubber was first used as material for adhesives starting in 1830. In 1839, <a href="Charles%20Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a> discovered that a rubber and sulfur mixture, when heated, becomes elastic. In 1843, Thomas Hancock named this process <a href="vulcanization">vulcanization</a>. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by <a href="Electroplating">electrodeposition</a> to obtain a stronger bond to rubber. The development of the automobile and the need for rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable bonds of rubber and metal. This spurred the development of cyclized rubber treated in strong acids. By 1927, this process was used to produce solvent-based thermoplastic <a href="rubber%20cement">rubber cement</a>s for metal to rubber bonding.

Natural rubber-based sticky adhesives were first used on a backing by Henry Day (US Patent 3,965) in 1845. Later these kinds of adhesives were used in cloth backed surgical and electric tapes. By 1925, the pressure-sensitive tape industry was born.
Today, sticky notes, <a href="Scotch%20tape">Scotch tape</a>, and other tapes are examples of PSA (pressure-sensitive adhesives).

A key step in the development of synthetic plastics was the introduction of a <a href="thermoset%20plastic">thermoset plastic</a> known as <a href="Bakelite">Bakelite</a> phenolic in 1910. Within two years, phenolic resin was applied to plywood as a coating varnish. In the early 1930s, phenolics gained importance as adhesive resins.

The 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s witnessed great advances in the development and production of new plastics and resins due to the First and Second World Wars. These advances greatly improved the development of adhesives by allowing the use of newly developed materials that exhibited a variety of properties. With changing needs and ever evolving technology, the development of new synthetic adhesives continues to the present. However, due to their low cost, natural adhesives are still more commonly used.

In the course of time and during their development, adhesives have gained a stable position in an increasing number of production processes. There is hardly any product in our surroundings that does not contain at least one adhesive—be it the label on a beverage bottle, protective coatings on automobiles, or profiles on window frames. Market researchers forecast a <a href="Inventory%20turnover">turnover</a> of almost US$50 billion for the global adhesives market in 2019. In particular, the economic development of <a href="emerging%20country">emerging countries</a> such as China, India, Russia, and Brazil will cause a rising demand for adhesives in the future.

Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion. These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemically reacts</a> in order to harden. Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural, or synthetic origin, or by their starting <a href="phase%20%28matter%29">physical phase</a>.

There are two types of adhesives that harden by drying: "solvent-based adhesives" and "polymer dispersion adhesives", also known as "emulsion adhesives". 
Solvent-based adhesives are a mixture of ingredients (typically <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s) dissolved in a <a href="solvent">solvent</a>. White glue, contact adhesives and <a href="rubber%20cement">rubber cement</a>s are members of the "drying adhesive" family. As the solvent evaporates, the adhesive hardens. Depending on the chemical composition of the adhesive, they will adhere to different materials to greater or lesser degrees.

Polymer dispersion adhesives are milky-white dispersions often based on <a href="polyvinyl%20acetate">polyvinyl acetate</a> (PVAc). They are used extensively in the woodworking and packaging industries. They are also used with fabrics and fabric-based components, and in engineered products such as loudspeaker cones.

"Pressure-sensitive adhesives" (PSA) form a bond by the application of light pressure to marry the adhesive with the adherend. They are designed to have a balance between flow and resistance to flow. The bond forms because the adhesive is soft enough to flow (i.e., "wet") to the adherend. The bond has strength because the adhesive is hard enough to resist flow when stress is applied to the bond. Once the adhesive and the adherend are in close proximity, molecular interactions, such as <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20force">van der Waals force</a>s, become involved in the bond, contributing significantly to its ultimate strength.

PSAs are designed for either permanent or removable applications. Examples of permanent applications include safety labels for power equipment, foil tape for <a href="HVAC">HVAC</a> duct work, automotive interior trim assembly, and sound/vibration damping films. Some high performance permanent PSAs exhibit high adhesion values and can support kilograms of weight per square centimeter of contact area, even at elevated temperatures. Permanent PSAs may initially be removable (for example to recover mislabeled goods) and build adhesion to a permanent bond after several hours or days.

Removable adhesives are designed to form a temporary bond, and ideally can be removed after months or years without leaving residue on the adherend. Removable adhesives are used in applications such as surface protection films, masking tapes, bookmark and note papers, barcodes labels, price marking labels, promotional graphics materials, and for skin contact (wound care dressings, EKG electrodes, athletic tape, analgesic and transdermal drug patches, etc.). Some removable adhesives are designed to repeatedly stick and unstick. They have low adhesion, and generally cannot support much weight. <a href="Pressure-sensitive%20adhesive">Pressure-sensitive adhesive</a> is used in <a href="Post-it%20note">Post-it note</a>s.

Pressure-sensitive adhesives are manufactured with either a liquid carrier or in 100% solid form. Articles are made from liquid PSAs by coating the adhesive and drying off the solvent or water carrier. They may be further heated to initiate a <a href="cross-link">cross-link</a>ing reaction and increase <a href="molecular%20mass">molecular weight</a>. 100% solid PSAs may be low viscosity polymers that are coated and then reacted with radiation to increase molecular weight and form the adhesive, or they may be high viscosity materials that are heated to reduce viscosity enough to allow coating, and then cooled to their final form. Major raw material for PSA's are <a href="acrylate">acrylate</a>-based polymers.

"Contact adhesives" are used in strong bonds with high shear-resistance like <a href="laminate">laminate</a>s, such as bonding <a href="Formica%20%28plastic%29">Formica</a> to a wooden counter, and in <a href="footwear">footwear</a>, as in attaching outsoles to uppers.

<a href="Natural%20rubber">Natural rubber</a> and <a href="polychloroprene">polychloroprene</a> (Neoprene) are commonly used contact adhesives. Both of these elastomers undergo <a href="strain%20crystallization">strain crystallization</a>. In the construction industry a specialised proprietary adhesive known as "liquid nails" is used. This also copes with tasks such as sealing <a href="artificial%20turf">artificial turf</a>.

Contact adhesives must be applied to both surfaces and allowed some time to dry before the two surfaces are pushed together. Some contact adhesives require as long as 24 hours to dry before the surfaces are to be held together. Once the surfaces are pushed together, the bond forms very quickly. It is usually not necessary to apply pressure for a long time, so there is less need for <a href="Clamp%20%28tool%29">clamps</a>.

"Hot adhesives", also known as "hot melt adhesives", are <a href="thermoplastic">thermoplastic</a>s applied in molten form (in the 65–180 °C range) which solidify on cooling to form strong bonds between a wide range of materials. <a href="Ethylene-vinyl%20acetate">Ethylene-vinyl acetate</a>-based hot-melts are particularly popular for crafts because of their ease of use and the wide range of common materials they can join. A glue gun (shown at right) is one method of applying hot adhesives. The glue gun melts the solid adhesive, then allows the liquid to pass through its barrel onto the material, where it solidifies.

Thermoplastic glue may have been invented around 1940 by <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a> as a solution to the problem that water-based adhesives, commonly used in packaging at that time, failed in humid climates, causing packages to open.

"Multi-component adhesives" harden by mixing two or more components which chemically react. This reaction causes polymers to cross-link into acrylics, urethanes, and epoxies - See <a href="thermosetting%20polymers">thermosetting polymers</a>.

There are several commercial combinations of multi-component adhesives in use in industry. Some of these combinations are:

The individual components of a multi-component adhesive are not adhesive by nature. The individual components react with each other after being mixed and show full adhesion only on curing. The multi-component resins can be either solvent-based or solvent-less. The solvents present in the adhesives are a medium for the polyester or the polyurethane resin. The solvent is dried during the curing process.

"One-part adhesives" harden via a chemical reaction with an external energy source, such as <a href="radiation">radiation</a>, <a href="heat">heat</a>, and <a href="moisture">moisture</a>.

"Ultraviolet" (UV) "light curing adhesives", also known as "light curing materials" (LCM), have become popular within the manufacturing sector due to their rapid curing time and strong bond strength. Light curing adhesives can cure in as little as a second and many formulations can bond dissimilar substrates (materials) and withstand harsh temperatures. These qualities make <a href="UV%20curing">UV curing</a> adhesives essential to the manufacturing of items in many industrial markets such as electronics, telecommunications, medical, aerospace, glass, and optical. Unlike traditional adhesives, UV light curing adhesives not only bond materials together but they can also be used to seal and coat products. They are generally acrylic-based.

"Heat curing adhesives" consist of a pre-made mixture of two or more components. When heat is applied the components react and cross-link. This type of adhesive includes <a href="thermosetting%20polymer">thermoset</a> <a href="epoxy">epoxies</a>, <a href="polyurethane">urethanes</a>, and <a href="polyimide">polyimide</a>s.

"Moisture curing adhesives" cure when they react with moisture present on the substrate surface or in the air. This type of adhesive includes <a href="cyanoacrylates">cyanoacrylates</a> and <a href="polyurethane">urethanes</a>.

Natural adhesives are made from organic sources such as vegetable <a href="starch">starch</a> (<a href="dextrin">dextrin</a>), natural resins, or animals (e.g. the milk protein <a href="casein">casein</a> and hide-based <a href="animal%20glue">animal glue</a>s). These are often referred to as <a href="bioadhesives">bioadhesives</a>.

One example is a simple paste made by cooking flour in water. Starch-based adhesives are used in <a href="corrugated%20board">corrugated board</a> and <a href="paper%20bag">paper sack</a> production, paper tube winding, and <a href="wallpaper%20adhesive">wallpaper adhesive</a>s. Casein glue is mainly used to adhere glass bottle labels. Animal glues have traditionally been used in bookbinding, wood joining, and many other areas but now are largely replaced by synthetic glues except in specialist applications like the production and repair of stringed instruments. <a href="Albumen">Albumen</a> made from the protein component of blood has been used in the <a href="plywood">plywood</a> industry. <a href="Masonite">Masonite</a>, a wood hardboard, was originally bonded using natural wood <a href="lignin">lignin</a>, an <a href="organic%20polymer">organic polymer</a>, though most modern particle boards such as <a href="Medium-density%20fiberboard">MDF</a> use synthetic thermosetting resins.

Synthetic adhesives are based on <a href="elastomer">elastomer</a>s, <a href="thermoplastics">thermoplastics</a>, <a href="emulsion">emulsion</a>s, and <a href="Thermosetting%20plastic">thermosets</a>. Examples of thermosetting adhesives are: <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a>, <a href="polyurethane">polyurethane</a>, <a href="cyanoacrylate">cyanoacrylate</a> and <a href="Acrylic%20resin">acrylic</a> polymers. The first commercially produced synthetic adhesive was <a href="Karlsons%20Klister">Karlsons Klister</a> in the 1920s.

Applicators of different adhesives are designed according to the adhesive being used and the size of the area to which the adhesive will be applied. The adhesive is applied to either one or both of the materials being bonded. The pieces are aligned and pressure is added to aid in adhesion and rid the bond of air bubbles.

Common ways of applying an adhesive include brushes, rollers, using films or pellets, spray guns and applicator guns ("e.g.", <a href="caulk%20gun">caulk gun</a>). All of these can be used manually or automated as part of a machine.

For an adhesive to be effective it must have three main properties. It must be able to wet the substrate. It must harden and finally it must be able to transmit load between the two surfaces/substrates being adhered.

Adhesion, the attachment between adhesive and substrate may occur either by mechanical means, in which the adhesive works its way into small pores of the substrate, or by one of several chemical mechanisms. The strength of adhesion depends on many factors, including the means by which it occurs.

In some cases, an actual <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a> occurs between adhesive and substrate. In others, electrostatic forces, as in static electricity, hold the substances together. A third mechanism involves the <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20forces">van der Waals forces</a> that develop between molecules. A fourth means involves the moisture-aided diffusion of the glue into the substrate, followed by hardening.

The quality of adhesive bonding depends strongly on the ability of the adhesive to efficiency cover (wet) the substrate area. This happens when the <a href="surface%20energy">surface energy</a> of the substrate is greater than the surface energy of the adhesive. However, high strength adhesives have high surface energy. Thus, their application is problematic for low energy materials such as <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s. To solve this problem, surface treatment can be used to increase the surface energy as a preparation step before adhesive bonding. Importantly, surface preparation provides a reproducible surface allowing consistent bonding results. The commonly used surface activation techniques include <a href="plasma%20activation">plasma activation</a>, <a href="flame%20treatment">flame treatment</a> and wet chemistry priming.

There are several factors that could contribute to the failure of two adhered surfaces. Sunlight and heat may weaken the adhesive. Solvents can deteriorate or dissolve adhesive. Physical stresses may also cause the separation of surfaces. When subjected to loading, debonding may occur at different locations in the adhesive joint. The major fracture types are the following:

"Cohesive fracture" is obtained if a crack propagates in the bulk polymer which constitutes the adhesive. In this case the surfaces of both adherends after debonding will be covered by fractured adhesive. The crack may propagate in the center of the layer or near an interface. For this last case, the cohesive fracture can be said to be "cohesive near the interface".

"Adhesive fracture" (sometimes referred to as "interfacial fracture") is when debonding occurs between the adhesive and the adherend. In most cases, the occurrence of adhesive fracture for a given adhesive goes along with smaller fracture toughness.

Other types of fracture include:


As a general design rule, the material properties of the object need to be greater than the forces anticipated during its use. (i.e. geometry, loads, etc.). The engineering work will consist of having a good model to evaluate the function. For most adhesive joints, this can be achieved using <a href="fracture%20mechanics">fracture mechanics</a>. Concepts such as the <a href="stress%20concentration">stress concentration</a> factor and the <a href="strain%20energy%20release%20rate">strain energy release rate</a> can be used to predict failure. In such models, the behavior of the adhesive layer itself is neglected and only the adherents are considered.

Failure will also very much depend on the opening "mode" of the joint.

As the loads are usually fixed, an acceptable design will result from combination of a material selection procedure and geometry modifications, if possible. In adhesively bonded structures, the global geometry and loads are fixed by structural considerations and the design procedure focuses on the material properties of the adhesive and on local changes on the geometry.

Increasing the joint resistance is usually obtained by designing its geometry so that:

Some glues and adhesives have a limited <a href="shelf%20life">shelf life</a>. Exposure to heat, oxygen, water vapor, etc. can degrade the adhesive over time, preventing it from functioning properly.

Anthony Hopkins

Sir Philip Anthony Hopkins (born 31 December 1937) is a Welsh film, stage, and television actor. After graduating from the <a href="Royal%20Welsh%20College%20of%20Music%20%26amp%3B%20Drama">Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama</a> in 1957, he trained at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> in London, and was then spotted by <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> who invited him to join the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a>.

Hopkins was born on New Year's Eve 1937, in <a href="Margam">Margam</a>, a suburb of <a href="Port%20Talbot">Port Talbot</a>, <a href="Glamorgan">Glamorgan</a>. His parents were Annie Muriel ("<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a>" Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker. His school days were unproductive; he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend <a href="West%20Monmouth%20School">Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School</a> in <a href="Pontypool">Pontypool</a>. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at <a href="Cowbridge%20Grammar%20School">Cowbridge Grammar School</a> in the <a href="Vale%20of%20Glamorgan">Vale of Glamorgan</a>. In a 2002 profile in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Hopkins told journalist <a href="Franz%20Lidz">Franz Lidz</a>: "I was a poor learner, which left me open to ridicule and gave me an inferiority complex. I grew up absolutely convinced I was stupid." His only real talent was for drinking India ink, which impressed his school chums but not his teachers. In desperation, his parents sent him off to boarding school, where the headmaster told him he was "hopeless" and he developed a "sheer contempt for authority." He stumbled into acting at 17 with a <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> group (his one line: "").

Hopkins was influenced and encouraged by Welsh compatriot <a href="Richard%20Burton">Richard Burton</a>, whom he met at the age of 15. Hopkins promptly enrolled at the <a href="Royal%20Welsh%20College%20of%20Music%20%26amp%3B%20Drama">Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, from which he graduated in 1957. After two years in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> doing his <a href="national%20service">national service</a>, he moved to London, where he studied in London at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> and, in 1965, joined <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>'s <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a>.

Hopkins made his first professional stage appearance in the <a href="Palace%20Theatre%2C%20Swansea">Palace Theatre, Swansea</a>, in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of "Have a Cigarette". In 1965, after several years in repertory, he was spotted by <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, who invited him to join the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a> in London. Hopkins became Olivier's <a href="understudy">understudy</a>, and filled in when Olivier was struck with <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a> during a production of <a href="August%20Strindberg">August Strindberg</a>'s "The Dance of Death". Olivier later noted in his memoir, "Confessions of an Actor", that "A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth."

Despite his success at the National, Hopkins tired of repeating the same roles nightly and yearned to be in films. He made his small-screen debut in a 1967 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> broadcast of "<a href="A%20Flea%20in%20Her%20Ear">A Flea in Her Ear</a>". His first starring role in a film came in 1964 in "Changes", a short directed by <a href="Drewe%20Henley">Drewe Henley</a>, written and produced by <a href="James%20Scott%20%28artist%29">James Scott</a> and co-starring <a href="Jacqueline%20Pearce">Jacqueline Pearce</a>. In 1968, he got his break in "<a href="The%20Lion%20in%20Winter%20%281968%20film%29">The Lion in Winter</a>" playing <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a>. Although Hopkins continued in theatre (most notably at the National Theatre as Lambert Le Roux in "<a href="Pravda%20%28play%29">Pravda</a>" by <a href="David%20Hare%20%28playwright%29">David Hare</a> and <a href="Howard%20Brenton">Howard Brenton</a> and as Antony in "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>" opposite <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a> as well as in the Broadway production of <a href="Peter%20Shaffer">Peter Shaffer</a>'s "<a href="Equus%20%28play%29">Equus</a>") he gradually moved away from it to become more established as a television and film actor. He portrayed <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> in the BBC television film "<a href="The%20Great%20Inimitable%20Mr.%20Dickens">The Great Inimitable Mr. Dickens</a>" in 1970, and <a href="Pierre%20Bezukhov">Pierre Bezukhov</a> in the BBC's mini series "<a href="War%20and%20Peace%20%281972%20TV%20series%29">War and Peace</a>" (1972). In 1972 he starred as British politician <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> in "<a href="Young%20Winston">Young Winston</a>", and in 1977 he played British Army officer <a href="John%20Frost%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Frost</a> in <a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>'s World War II-set film "<a href="A%20Bridge%20Too%20Far%20%28film%29">A Bridge Too Far</a>".

In 1980, he starred in "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28film%29">The Elephant Man</a>" as the English doctor <a href="Sir%20Frederick%20Treves%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Frederick Treves</a>, who attends to <a href="Joseph%20Merrick">Joseph Merrick</a> (portrayed by <a href="John%20Hurt">John Hurt</a>), a severely deformed man in 19th century London. That year he also starred opposite <a href="Shirley%20MacLaine">Shirley MacLaine</a> in "<a href="A%20Change%20of%20Seasons%20%28film%29">A Change of Seasons</a>" and famously said "she was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with."

In 1983, Hopkins also became a company member of <a href="The%20Mirror%20Theater%20Ltd">The Mirror Theater Ltd</a>'s Repertory Company.
He remained an enthusiastic member of the company and the Mirror’s Producing Artistic Director Sabra Jones visited him in London in 1986 to discuss moving "Pravda" to New York from the National Theater. In 1984, he starred opposite <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> in "<a href="The%20Bounty%20%281984%20film%29">The Bounty</a>" as <a href="William%20Bligh">William Bligh</a>, captain of the Royal Navy ship the <a href="HMS%20Bounty">HMS "Bounty"</a>, in a retelling of the <a href="Mutiny%20on%20the%20Bounty">mutiny on the "Bounty"</a>.

Hopkins was nominated for an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for his performance, and the film frequently ranks among the best British films of all time. Hopkins portrayed Oxford academic <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> in the 1993 British biographical film "<a href="Shadowlands%20%281993%20film%29">Shadowlands</a>", and received the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA Award for Best Actor</a>. During the 1990s, Hopkins had the chance to work with <a href="Bart%20the%20Bear">Bart the Bear</a> in two films: "<a href="Legends%20of%20the%20Fall">Legends of the Fall</a>" (1994) and "<a href="The%20Edge%20%281997%20film%29">The Edge</a>" (1997). According to trainer, Lynn Seus, "Tony Hopkins was absolutely brilliant with Bart...He acknowledged and respected him like a fellow actor. He would spend hours just looking at Bart and admiring him. He did so many of his own scenes with Bart."

Hopkins was Britain's highest paid performer in 1998, starring in "<a href="The%20Mask%20of%20Zorro">The Mask of Zorro</a>" and "<a href="Meet%20Joe%20Black">Meet Joe Black</a>", and also agreed to reprise his role as Dr Hannibal Lecter for a fee of <a href="%C2%A3">£</a>15 million. In 2000, Hopkins narrated "<a href="Dr.%20Seuss%27%20How%20the%20Grinch%20Stole%20Christmas%20%282000%20film%29">Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas</a>". Hopkins received a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 2003.

Hopkins stated that his role as <a href="Burt%20Munro">Burt Munro</a>, whom he portrayed in his 2005 film "<a href="The%20World%27s%20Fastest%20Indian">The World's Fastest Indian</a>", was his favourite. He also asserted that Munro was the easiest role that he had played because both men have a similar outlook on life. In 2006, Hopkins was the recipient of the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Cecil%20B.%20DeMille%20Award">Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award</a> for lifetime achievement. In 2008, he received the <a href="BAFTA%20Fellowship">BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award</a>, the highest award the <a href="British%20Film%20Academy">British Film Academy</a> can bestow.

He played a priest who is "an expert in exorcisms and whose methods are not necessarily traditional". Hopkins, who is quoted as saying "I don't know what I believe, myself personally", reportedly wrote a line--"Some days I don't know if I believe in God or Santa Claus or Tinkerbell"—into his character in order to identify with it. On the other hand, in other sources from the same time, he is quoted as saying that he did believe in God and had done so for decades. On 21 September 2011, <a href="Peter%20R.%20de%20Vries">Peter R. de Vries</a> named Hopkins in the role of the <a href="Heineken">Heineken</a> owner <a href="Freddy%20Heineken">Freddy Heineken</a> in a future film about his kidnapping.

Hopkins portrayed <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> in <a href="Sacha%20Gervasi">Sacha Gervasi</a>'s biopic "<a href="Hitchcock%20%28film%29">Hitchcock</a>", following his career while making "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>". The film was released on 23 November 2012. In 2013, he reprised his role as Odin in "". In 2014, he portrayed <a href="Methuselah">Methuselah</a> in <a href="Darren%20Aronofsky">Darren Aronofsky</a>'s "<a href="Noah%20%282014%20film%29">Noah</a>". Since October 2016, Hopkins has been starring as Robert Ford in the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> sci-fi series "<a href="Westworld%20%28TV%20series%29">Westworld</a>". Hopkins played Autobot ally Sir Edmund Burton in "", which was released in June 2017.

Hopkins' most famous role is as the <a href="cannibalistic">cannibalistic</a> <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> <a href="Hannibal%20Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a> in "<a href="The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Lambs%20%28film%29">The Silence of the Lambs</a>", for which he won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> in 1991, with <a href="Jodie%20Foster">Jodie Foster</a> as <a href="Clarice%20Starling">Clarice Starling</a>, who also won for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a>. The film won <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a> and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay</a>. Hopkins reprised his role as Lecter twice; in <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s "<a href="Hannibal%20%28film%29">Hannibal</a>" (2001), and "<a href="Red%20Dragon%20%282002%20film%29">Red Dragon</a>" (2002). His original portrayal of the character in "The Silence of the Lambs" has been labelled by the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">AFI</a> as the <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Villains">number-one film villain</a>. At the time he was offered the role, Hopkins was making a return to the London stage, performing in "<a href="M.%20Butterfly">M. Butterfly</a>". He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, "Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life."

Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by <a href="Thomas%20Harris">Thomas Harris</a>. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that "<a href="Red%20Dragon%20%282002%20film%29">Red Dragon</a>" would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, "<a href="Hannibal%20Rising%20%28film%29">Hannibal Rising</a>".

Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles. He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can "do it without thinking". This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later.

<a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>, who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of "<a href="Shadowlands%20%281993%20film%29">Shadowlands</a>" (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and <a href="Debra%20Winger">Debra Winger</a>), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for "this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift."

Renowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry, and Shakespeare. In Steven Spielberg's "<a href="Amistad%20%28film%29">Amistad</a>", Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.

Hopkins is a gifted <a href="Impressionist%20%28entertainment%29">mimic</a>, adept at turning his native Welsh accent into whatever is required by a character. He duplicated the voice of his late mentor, Laurence Olivier, for additional scenes in "<a href="Spartacus%20%28film%29">Spartacus</a>" in its 1991 restoration. His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show "<a href="Parkinson%20%28TV%20series%29">Parkinson</a>" featured an impersonation of comedian <a href="Tommy%20Cooper">Tommy Cooper</a>. Hopkins has said acting "like a submarine" has helped him to deliver credible performances in his thrillers. He said, "It's very difficult for an actor to avoid, you want to show a bit. But I think the less one shows the better."

Anthony Hopkins was made a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in 1987, and was knighted as a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> at Buckingham Palace in 1993 for services to the arts. In 1988, Hopkins was made an Honorary D.Litt and in 1992 was awarded Honorary fellowship from the <a href="University%20of%20Wales%2C%20Lampeter">University of Wales, Lampeter</a>. He was made a freeman of his hometown <a href="Port%20Talbot">Port Talbot</a> in 1996.

Hopkins resides in <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu, California</a>. He had moved to the US once before during the late 1970s to pursue his film career, but returned to <a href="London">London</a> in the late 1980s. However, he decided to return to the US following his 1990s success. Retaining his British citizenship, he became a naturalised US citizen on 12 April 2000, with Hopkins stating: "I have dual citizenship; it just so happens I live in America".

Hopkins has been married three times: to <a href="Petronella%20Barker%20%28actress%20born%201942%29">Petronella Barker</a> from 1966 to 1972; to Jennifer Lynton from 1973 to 2002; and, since 2003, to Stella Arroyave. On Christmas Eve 2012, he celebrated his 10th wedding anniversary by having a blessing at a private service at <a href="St%20David%27s%20Cathedral">St David's Cathedral</a>, <a href="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a> in the most westerly point of Wales. He has a daughter, actress and singer <a href="Abigail%20Hopkins">Abigail Hopkins</a> (born 20 August 1968), from his first marriage.

Hopkins is a recovering <a href="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a>; he has stayed sober since he stopped drinking just after Christmas 1975. In 2002, he told the New York Times that he woke up in a Phoenix hotel room with no memory of having driven from Los Angeles. "It was two days before his 38th birthday. Still, he continued to spiral downward, at times sitting at home for hours without saying a word. He'd climb in his car and cruise aimlessly for days: once he went on a drive and didn't return for two months. "If there is someone fighting within you, it makes your life unbearable," he said. "Anger has to be converted into something else or it destroys you." He said that a major help in his recovery was his belief in God. He has criticised <a href="atheism">atheism</a>, saying in 2011 that "being an atheist must be like living in a closed cell with no windows". In an interview with <a href="Larry%20King">Larry King</a> in 2016, Hopkins described himself as an <a href="agnostic">agnostic</a> and said he believed in a "superior consciousness in all of us". He <a href="Smoking%20cessation">gave up smoking</a> using the <a href="Allen%20Carr">Allen Carr</a> method. In 2008, he embarked on a weight loss program, and by 2010, he had lost 80 pounds.

In January 2017, in an interview with "<a href="The%20Desert%20Sun">The Desert Sun</a>", Hopkins reported that he had been diagnosed with <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, but that he was "high end".

Hopkins has offered his support to various charities and appeals, notably becoming President of the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>'s <a href="Snowdonia">Snowdonia</a> Appeal, raising funds for the preservation of <a href="Snowdonia%20National%20Park">Snowdonia National Park</a> in north Wales. In 1998 he donated <a href="%C2%A3">£</a>1 million towards the £3 million needed to aid the Trust's efforts in purchasing parts of <a href="Snowdon">Snowdon</a>. Prior to the campaign, Hopkins authored "Anthony Hopkins' Snowdonia", which was published in 1995. Due to his contributions to Snowdonia, in addition to his film career, in 2004 Hopkins was named among the <a href="100%20Welsh%20Heroes">100 Welsh Heroes</a> in a Welsh poll.

Hopkins has been a patron of the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> centre in his hometown of <a href="Port%20Talbot">Port Talbot</a>, South Wales for more than 20 years, having first joined the YMCA in the 1950s. He supports other various philanthropic groups. He was a Guest of Honour at a Gala Fundraiser for Women in Recovery, Inc., a <a href="Venice%2C%20California">Venice, California</a>-based non-profit organisation offering rehabilitation assistance to women in recovery from substance abuse. He is also a volunteer teacher at the Ruskin School of Acting in <a href="Santa%20Monica%2C%20California">Santa Monica, California</a>. Hopkins served as the Honorary Patron of The New Heritage Theatre Company in <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise, Idaho</a> from 1997-2007, participating in fundraising and marketing efforts for the repertory theatre.

Hopkins contributed toward the refurbishment of a £2.3 million wing at his <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Welsh%20College%20of%20Music%20%26amp%3B%20Drama">Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama</a> in Cardiff, named the Anthony Hopkins Centre. It opened in 1999.

Hopkins is a prominent member of environmental protection group <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> and as of early 2008 featured in a television advertisement campaign, voicing concerns about <a href="Whaling%20in%20Japan">Japan's continuing annual whale hunt</a>. He has also been a patron of <a href="RAPt">RAPt</a> (Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust) since its early days and helped open their first intensive drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit at <a href="Downview%20%28HM%20Prison%29">Downview (HM Prison)</a> in 1992.

Hopkins is an admirer of the Welsh comedian <a href="Tommy%20Cooper">Tommy Cooper</a>. On 23 February 2008, as patron of the Tommy Cooper Society, he unveiled a commemorative statue in the entertainer's home town of <a href="Caerphilly">Caerphilly</a>. For the ceremony, he donned Cooper's trademark <a href="fez%20%28clothing%29">fez</a> and performed a comic routine.

In a 2012 interview, Hopkins stated, "I've been composing music all my life and if I'd been clever enough at school I would like to have gone to music college. As it was I had to settle for being an actor." In 1986, he released a single called "Distant Star", which peaked at No. 75 in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>.

In the same year, as part of the restoration process for the <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> film "<a href="Spartacus%20%28film%29">Spartacus</a>", Hopkins was approached to re-record lines from a scene that was being added back to the film; this scene featured <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> and <a href="Tony%20Curtis">Tony Curtis</a>, with Hopkins recommended by Olivier's widow, <a href="Joan%20Plowright">Joan Plowright</a> to perform her late husband's part thanks to his talent for mimicry.

In 1996, he directed "<a href="August%20%281996%20film%29">August</a>", an adaptation of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a>'s "<a href="Uncle%20Vanya">Uncle Vanya</a>" set in Wales. His first screenplay, an experimental drama called "<a href="Slipstream%20%282007%20film%29">Slipstream</a>", which he also directed and scored, premiered at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a> in 2007. In 1997, Hopkins narrated the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> natural documentary series, "<a href="Killing%20for%20a%20Living">Killing for a Living</a>", which showed predatory behaviour in nature. He narrated episode 1 through 3 before being replaced by <a href="John%20Shrapnel">John Shrapnel</a>.

Hopkins is a fan of the BBC sitcom "<a href="Only%20Fools%20and%20Horses">Only Fools and Horses</a>", and once remarked in an interview how he would love to appear in the series. Writer <a href="John%20Sullivan%20%28writer%29">John Sullivan</a> saw the interview, and with Hopkins in mind created the character <a href="The%20Driscoll%20Brothers">Danny Driscoll</a>, a local villain. However, filming of the new series coincided with the filming of "The Silence of the Lambs", making Hopkins unavailable. The role instead went to <a href="Roy%20Marsden">Roy Marsden</a>.

On 31 October 2011, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Rieu">André Rieu</a> released an album including a waltz which Hopkins had composed in 1964, at the age of 27. Hopkins had never heard his composition, "<a href="And%20the%20Waltz%20Goes%20On">And the Waltz Goes On</a>", before it was premiered by Rieu's orchestra in Vienna; Rieu's album was given the same name as Hopkins' piece.

In January 2012, Hopkins released an album of classical music, entitled "Composer", performed by the <a href="City%20of%20Birmingham%20Symphony%20Orchestra">City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra</a>, and released on CD via the UK radio station <a href="Classic%20FM%20%28UK%29">Classic FM</a>. The album consists of nine of his original works and film scores, with one of the pieces titled "Margam" in tribute to his home town near <a href="Port%20Talbot">Port Talbot</a> in Wales.

In October 2015, Hopkins appeared as Sir in a <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> production of <a href="Ronald%20Harwood">Ronald Harwood</a>'s "<a href="The%20Dresser%20%282015%20film%29">The Dresser</a>", alongside <a href="Ian%20McKellen">Ian McKellen</a>, <a href="Edward%20Fox%20%28actor%29">Edward Fox</a> and <a href="Emily%20Watson">Emily Watson</a>. "The Dresser" is set in a London theatre during <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>, where an aging actor-manager, Sir, prepares for his starring role in "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>" with the help of his devoted dresser, Norman.

Ardal O'Hanlon

Ardal O'Hanlon (; born 8 October 1965) is an Irish comedian and actor. He played <a href="Father%20Dougal%20McGuire">Father Dougal McGuire</a> in "<a href="Father%20Ted">Father Ted</a>", George Sunday/Thermoman in "<a href="My%20Hero%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">My Hero</a>", and DI Jack Mooney in "<a href="Death%20in%20Paradise%20%28TV%20series%29">Death in Paradise</a>".

Ardal O'Hanlon was born on 8 October 1965 in <a href="Carrickmacross">Carrickmacross</a>, the son of politician and doctor <a href="Rory%20O%27Hanlon">Rory O'Hanlon</a> and Teresa Ward. He has five siblings. The episode of "<a href="Who%20Do%20You%20Think%20You%20Are%3F%20%28Irish%20TV%20series%29">Who Do You Think You Are?</a>" which aired on 6 October 2008 revealed that O'Hanlon's paternal grandfather, Michael O'Hanlon, was a <a href="University%20College%20Dublin">UCD</a> medicine student who had joined the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281917%E2%80%9322%29">IRA</a> during the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a> and was a member of <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28Irish%20leader%29">Michael Collins</a>' squad which assassinated British secret service agents on the morning of <a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%281920%29">Bloody Sunday</a>. Details of his grandfather's activities survive in UCD Archives, as well as <a href="Blackrock%20College">Blackrock College</a>. It also transpired that, on his mother's side, he is a close relative of <a href="Peter%20Fenelon%20Collier">Peter Fenelon Collier</a>.

O'Hanlon was schooled in <a href="Blackrock%20College">Blackrock College</a> in Dublin and graduated, in 1987, from the <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Higher%20Education">National Institute for Higher Education</a>, <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> (now <a href="Dublin%20City%20University">Dublin City University</a>) with a degree in Communications Studies.

Together with Kevin Gildea and Barry Murphy, O'Hanlon founded the International Comedy Cellar, upstairs in the International Bar on Dublin's South Wicklow Street. Dublin had no comedy scene at the time. As a stand up, O'Hanlon won the <a href="Hackney%20Empire%20New%20Act%20of%20the%20Year">Hackney Empire New Act of the Year</a> competition in 1994. For a time he was the presenter of "The Stand Up Show".

He was spotted by <a href="Graham%20Linehan">Graham Linehan</a>, who was to cast him as Father Dougal McGuire in "<a href="Father%20Ted">Father Ted</a>" (1995–98). In 1995 he received the Top TV Comedy Newcomer at the British Comedy Awards for this role. In 1995, he appeared (as Father Dougal) in a <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> <a href="Television%20ident">ident</a> ("Hello, you're watching... television"), and during <a href="Comic%20Relief%20%28charity%29">Comic Relief</a> on BBC1. This was followed by the award-winning short comedy film "<a href="Flying%20Saucer%20Rock%27n%27Roll">Flying Saucer Rock'n'Roll</a>".

O'Hanlon moved into straight acting alongside <a href="Emma%20Fielding">Emma Fielding</a> and <a href="Beth%20Goddard">Beth Goddard</a> in the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> comedy-drama "Big Bad World", which aired for two series in summer 1999 and winter 2001. He also played a minor role in "<a href="The%20Butcher%20Boy%20%281997%20film%29">The Butcher Boy</a>" as Joe's (Francie's best friend) father, and appeared in an episode of the original "<a href="Whose%20Line%20Is%20It%20Anyway%3F%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Whose Line is it Anyway?</a>".

In 2000, O'Hanlon starred in the comedy series "<a href="My%20Hero%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">My Hero</a>", in which he played a very naive superhero from the planet Ultron. His character juggled world-saving heroics with life in suburbia. He stayed in the role until the first episode of series 6 in July 2006 where he was replaced by <a href="James%20Dreyfus">James Dreyfus</a> during the same episode.

He also provided the voice of the lead character in the three Christmas television cartoon specials of "<a href="Robbie%20the%20Reindeer">Robbie the Reindeer</a>". He appeared in the 2005 <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> sitcom "<a href="Blessed%20%28television%29">Blessed</a>", written by <a href="Ben%20Elton">Ben Elton</a>; at the 2005 British Comedy Awards, it was publicly slated by <a href="Jonathan%20Ross%20%28television%20presenter%29">Jonathan Ross</a>, albeit in jest. Towards the end of 2005, he played an eccentric Scottish character, Coconut Tam, in the family-based film, "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Greyfriars%20Bobby">The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby</a>". Although more commonly on television, he has appeared on radio – on 18 July 2011, he appeared on "<a href="Quote...%20Unquote">Quote... Unquote</a>". Appropriately, one of his questions concerned a quotation from "Father Ted".

In 2006, O'Hanlon wrote and presented an <a href="Raidi%C3%B3%20Teilif%C3%ADs%20%C3%89ireann">RTÉ</a> television series called "Leagues Apart", which saw him investigate the biggest and most passionate football rivalries in a number of European countries. Included were Roma vs Lazio in Italy, Barcelona vs Real Madrid in Spain, and Galatasaray vs Fenerbahce in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. He followed this with another RTÉ show, "So You Want To Be Taoiseach?" in 2007. It was a political series where O'Hanlon gave tongue-in-cheek advice on how to go about becoming <a href="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> of Ireland. Both programmes went some way towards freeing O'Hanlon from his association with the character of Dougal in the minds of Irish audiences.

He appeared in the "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" episode "<a href="Gridlock%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Gridlock</a>", broadcast on 14 April 2007, in which he played a cat-like creature named Thomas Kincade Brannigan. O'Hanlon appears in Series 3 of the TV show "<a href="Skins%20%28TV%20series%29">Skins</a>", playing Naomi Campbell (<a href="Lily%20Loveless">Lily Loveless</a>)'s Politics teacher named Kieran, who attempted to kiss her. He then went on to form a relationship with Naomi's mother (<a href="Olivia%20Colman">Olivia Colman</a>). O'Hanlon plays the lead role in Irish comedy television programme "Val Falvey, TD" on <a href="RT%C3%89%20One">RTÉ One</a>. He has recently performed in the <a href="Edinburgh%20Fringe">Edinburgh Fringe</a>.

In February 2011, O'Hanlon returned to the <a href="Gate%20Theatre">Gate Theatre</a>, Dublin starring in the Irish premiere of Christopher Hampton's translation of Yasmina Reza's "<a href="God%20of%20Carnage">God of Carnage</a>", alongside <a href="Maura%20Tierney">Maura Tierney</a>.

In 2011, he appeared in the comedy panel show "<a href="Argumental">Argumental</a>".

O'Hanlon has written a novel, "<a href="The%20Talk%20of%20the%20Town%20%28novel%29">The Talk of the Town</a>" (known in the United States as "Knick Knack Paddy Whack"), which was published in 1998. The novel is about a teenage boy, Patrick Scully, and his friends.

In February 2015 he officially launched the 2015 Sky <a href="Cat%20Laughs">Cat Laughs</a> Comedy Festival which takes place in Kilkenny from 28 May–1 June. In 2015 he played the role of Peter the Milkman in the <a href="Sky%201">Sky 1</a> sitcom "<a href="After%20Hours%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">After Hours</a>".

Advanced Micro Devices

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American <a href="multinational%20company">multinational</a> <a href="semiconductor%20industry">semiconductor company</a> based in <a href="Sunnyvale%2C%20California">Sunnyvale</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, United States, that develops <a href="computer%20processor">computer processor</a>s and related technologies for business and <a href="consumer%20markets">consumer markets</a>. While initially it manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a practice known as <a href="Fabless%20manufacturing">fabless</a>, after <a href="GlobalFoundries">GlobalFoundries</a> was spun off in 2009. AMD's main products include <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>s, <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a> <a href="chipset">chipset</a>s, <a href="embedded%20processor">embedded processor</a>s and <a href="Graphics%20processing%20unit">graphics processors</a> for <a href="server%20%28computing%29">server</a>s, <a href="workstation">workstation</a>s and personal computers, and <a href="embedded%20system">embedded system</a>s applications.

AMD is the second-largest supplier and only significant rival to <a href="Intel">Intel</a> in the market for <a href="x86">x86</a>-based microprocessors. Since acquiring <a href="ATI%20Technologies">ATI</a> in 2006, AMD and its competitor <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> have dominated the discrete Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) market.

Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated on May 1, 1969, by <a href="Jerry%20Sanders%20%28businessman%29">Jerry Sanders</a>, along with seven of his colleagues from <a href="Fairchild%20Semiconductor">Fairchild Semiconductor</a>. Sanders, an <a href="electrical%20engineer">electrical engineer</a> who was the director of marketing at Fairchild, had like many Fairchild executives, grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support, opportunity, and flexibility within that company, and decided to leave to start his own <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> company. The previous year <a href="Robert%20Noyce">Robert Noyce</a>, who had invented the first practical <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a> or the microchip in 1959 at Fairchild, had left Fairchild together with <a href="Gordon%20Moore">Gordon Moore</a> and founded the semiconductor company <a href="Intel">Intel</a> in July 1968.

In September 1969, AMD moved from its temporary location in <a href="Santa%20Clara%2C%20California">Santa Clara</a> to <a href="Sunnyvale%2C%20California">Sunnyvale</a>, California. To immediately secure a customer base, AMD initially became a <a href="second%20source">second source</a> supplier of microchips designed by Fairchild and <a href="National%20Semiconductor">National Semiconductor</a>. AMD first focused on producing logic chips. The company guaranteed quality control to <a href="MIL-STD-883">United States Military Standard</a>, an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including <a href="computer%20manufacturer">computer manufacturer</a>s, the <a href="telecommunications%20industry">telecommunications industry</a>, and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid.

In November 1969, the company manufactured its first product, the Am9300, a <a href="4-bit">4-bit</a> <a href="Integrated%20circuit%23SSI.2C%20MSI%20and%20LSI">MSI</a> <a href="shift%20register">shift register</a>, which began selling in 1970. Also in 1970, AMD produced its first proprietary product, the Am2501 logic counter, which was highly successful. Its best-selling product in 1971 was the Am2505, the fastest <a href="Binary%20multiplier">multiplier</a> available.

In 1971, AMD entered the <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a> chip market, beginning with the Am3101, a <a href="64-bit%20computing">64-bit</a> bipolar RAM. That year AMD also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits, and by year end the company's total annual sales reached $4.6 million.

AMD went public in September 1972. The company was a second source for Intel <a href="MOSFET">MOS</a>/<a href="Integrated%20circuit%23LSI">LSI</a> circuits by 1973, with products such as Am14/1506 and Am14/1507, dual 100-bit dynamic shift registers. By 1975, AMD was producing 212 products – of which 49 were proprietary, including the Am9102 (a <a href="Static%20random-access%20memory">static</a> <a href="Extrinsic%20semiconductor%23N-type%20semiconductors">N-channel</a> 1024-bit RAM) and three low-power <a href="Schottky%20barrier">Schottky</a> <a href="Integrated%20circuit%23Generations">MSI</a> circuits: Am25LS07, Am25LS08, and Am25LS09.

Intel had created the first <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>, its 4-bit <a href="Intel%204004">4004</a>, in 1971. By 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market with the <a href="AMD%20Am9080">Am9080</a>, a <a href="reverse%20engineering">reverse-engineered</a> clone of the <a href="Intel%208080">Intel 8080</a>, and the <a href="AMD%20Am2900">Am2900</a> <a href="bit-slice">bit-slice</a> microprocessor family. When Intel began installing <a href="microcode">microcode</a> in its microprocessors in 1976, it entered into a <a href="cross-licensing">cross-licensing</a> agreement with AMD, granting AMD a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals, effective October 1976.

In 1977, AMD entered into a joint venture with <a href="Siemens">Siemens</a>, a German engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the U.S. market. Siemens purchased 20% of AMD's stock, giving AMD an infusion of cash to increase its product lines. That year the two companies also jointly established Advanced Micro Computers, located in Silicon Valley and in Germany, giving AMD an opportunity to enter the <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a> development and manufacturing field, in particular based on AMD's second-source <a href="Zilog">Zilog</a> <a href="Z8000">Z8000</a> microprocessors. When the two companies' vision for Advanced Micro Computers diverged, AMD bought out Siemens' stake in the U.S. division in 1979. AMD closed its Advanced Micro Computers subsidiary in late 1981, after switching focus to manufacturing second-source Intel x86 microprocessors.

Total sales in <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> 1978 topped $100 million, and in 1979, AMD debuted on the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>. In 1979, production also began in AMD's new semiconductor <a href="Semiconductor%20fabrication%20plant">fab</a> in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>; the company already had overseas assembly facilities in <a href="Penang">Penang</a> and <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, and it began construction on a semiconductor fab in <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a> in 1981. In 1980, AMD began supplying semiconductor products for <a href="telecommunications">telecommunications</a>, an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation.

Intel had introduced the first <a href="x86">x86</a> microprocessors in 1978. In 1981, <a href="IBM">IBM</a> created its <a href="IBM%20Personal%20Computer">PC</a>, and wanted Intel's x86 processors, but only under the condition that Intel also provide a second-source manufacturer for its patented x86 microprocessors. Intel and AMD entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement, first signed in October 1981 and formally executed in February 1982. The terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a second-source manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other; that is, each party could "earn" the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other, if agreed to, by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity. The technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company. The 1982 agreement also extended the 1976 AMD–Intel cross-licensing agreement through 1995. The agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements, and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one year's notice. The main result of the 1982 agreement was that AMD became a second-source manufacturer of Intel's x86 microprocessors and related chips, and Intel provided AMD with database tapes for its <a href="8086">8086</a>, <a href="80186">80186</a>, and <a href="80286">80286</a> chips.

Beginning in 1982, AMD began volume-producing second-source Intel-licensed 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 processors, and by 1984 its own <a href="Am286">Am286</a> clone of Intel's 80286 processor, for the rapidly growing market of IBM PCs and <a href="IBM%20clone">IBM clone</a>s. It also continued its successful concentration on proprietary <a href="bipolar%20junction%20transistor">bipolar</a> chips. In 1983, it introduced INT.STD.1000, the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry.

The company continued to spend greatly on research and development, and in addition to other breakthrough products, created the world's first 512K <a href="EPROM">EPROM</a> in 1984. That year AMD was listed in the book "The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America", and based on 1984 income it made the <a href="Fortune%20500">"Fortune" 500</a> list for the first time in 1985.

By mid-1985, however, the microchip market experienced a severe downturn, mainly due to long-term aggressive trade practices (<a href="dumping%20%28pricing%20policy%29">dumping</a>) from Japan, but also due to a crowded and non-innovative chip market in the U.S. AMD rode out the mid-1980s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing, devising the Liberty Chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for 52 weeks in <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> 1986, and by heavily lobbying the U.S. government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory Japanese pricing. During this time period, AMD withdrew from the <a href="DRAM">DRAM</a> market, and at the same time made some headway into the <a href="CMOS">CMOS</a> market, which it had lagged in entering, having focused instead on bipolar chips.

AMD had some success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 "World Chip" <a href="frequency-shift%20keying">FSK</a> modem, one of the first multi-standard devices that covered both Bell and <a href="ITU-T">CCITT</a> tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex. Beginning in 1986, AMD embraced the perceived shift toward <a href="RISC">RISC</a> with their own <a href="AMD%20Am29000">AMD Am29000</a> (29k) processor; the 29k survived as an <a href="embedded%20processor">embedded processor</a>. The company also increased its <a href="EPROM">EPROM</a> memory market share in the late 1980s. Throughout the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier of Intel x86 processors. In 1991, it introduced its own 386-compatible <a href="Am386">Am386</a>, an AMD-designed chip. Creating its own chips, AMD began to compete directly with Intel.

AMD had a large and successful <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a> business, even during the <a href="dotcom%20bust">dotcom bust</a>. In 2003, to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow, which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from Intel, AMD spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into <a href="Spansion">Spansion</a>, a joint venture with <a href="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a>, which had been co-manufacturing flash memory with AMD since 1993. AMD divested itself of Spansion in December 2005, in order to focus on the microprocessor market, and Spansion went public in an IPO.

AMD announced the acquisition of the graphics processor company <a href="ATI%20Technologies">ATI Technologies</a> on July 24, 2006. AMD paid $4.3 billion in cash and 58 million shares of its <a href="stock">stock</a>, for a total of approximately $5.4 billion. The transaction completed on October 25, 2006. On August 30, 2010, AMD announced that it would retire the ATI brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the AMD brand name.

In October 2008, AMD announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibillion-dollar joint venture with <a href="Advanced%20Technology%20Investment%20Company">Advanced Technology Investment Co.</a>, an investment company formed by the government of <a href="Abu%20Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>. The new venture is called <a href="GlobalFoundries">GlobalFoundries Inc.</a> The partnership and spin-off gave AMD an infusion of cash and allowed AMD to focus solely on chip design. To assure the Abu Dhabi investors of the new venture's success, CEO <a href="Hector%20Ruiz">Hector Ruiz</a> stepped down as CEO of AMD in July 2008, while remaining Executive Chairman, in preparation for becoming Chairman of Global Foundries in March 2009. President and COO <a href="Dirk%20Meyer">Dirk Meyer</a> became AMD's CEO. Recessionary losses necessitated AMD cutting 1,100 jobs in 2009.

In August 2011, AMD announced that former <a href="Lenovo">Lenovo</a> executive <a href="Rory%20Read">Rory Read</a> would be joining the company as CEO, replacing Meyer. AMD announced in November 2011 plans to lay off more than 10% (1,400) of its employees from across all divisions worldwide. In October 2012, it announced plans to lay off an additional 15% of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue.

AMD acquired the low-power server manufacturer <a href="SeaMicro">SeaMicro</a> in early 2012, with an eye to bringing out an <a href="ARM%20architecture">ARM architecture</a> server chip.

On October 8, 2014, AMD announced that Rory Read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer. He was succeeded by <a href="Lisa%20Su">Lisa Su</a>, a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since June.

On October 16, 2014, AMD announced a new restructuring plan along with its Q3 results. Effective July 1, 2014, AMD reorganized into two business groups: Computing and Graphics, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including <a href="Advanced%20Micro%20Devices%23Partnerships">solutions for gaming consoles</a>), engineering services, and royalties. As part of this restructuring, AMD announced that 7% of its global workforce would be laid off by the end of 2014.

In February 1982, AMD signed a contract with <a href="Intel%20Corporation">Intel</a>, becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of <a href="Intel%208086">8086</a> and <a href="Intel%208088">8088</a> processors. <a href="IBM">IBM</a> wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its <a href="IBM%20Personal%20Computer">IBM PC</a>, but IBM's policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the <a href="Am286">Am286</a> under the same arrangement. In 1984 Intel, in order to shore up its advantage in the marketplace, internally decided to no longer cooperate with AMD in supplying product information, and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the <a href="Intel%2080386">Intel 80386</a> to AMD. In 1987, AMD invoked arbitration over the issue, and Intel reacted by cancelling the 1982 technological-exchange agreement altogether. After three years of testimony, AMD eventually won in arbitration in 1992, but Intel disputed this decision. Another long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20California">Supreme Court of California</a> sided with the arbitrator and AMD.

In 1990, Intel also countersued AMD, renegotiating AMD's right to use derivatives of Intel's <a href="microcode">microcode</a> for its cloned processors. In the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute, AMD was forced to develop <a href="clean%20room%20design">clean-room design</a>ed versions of Intel code for its x386 and x486 processors, the former long after Intel had released its own x386 in 1985. In March 1991, AMD released the <a href="Am386">Am386</a>, its clone of the Intel 386 processor. By October of the same year it had sold one million units.

In 1993, AMD introduced the first of the <a href="Am486">Am486</a> family of processors, which proved popular with a large number of <a href="original%20equipment%20manufacturer">original equipment manufacturer</a>s, including <a href="Compaq">Compaq</a>, which signed an exclusive agreement using the Am486. Another Am486-based processor, the <a href="Am5x86">Am5x86</a>, was released in November 1995 and continued AMD's success as a fast, cost-effective processor.

Finally, in an agreement effective 1996, AMD received the rights to the microcode in Intel's x386 and x486 processor families, but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors.

AMD's first in-house x86 processor was the <a href="AMD%20K5">K5</a>, which was launched in 1996. The "K" was a reference to <a href="Kryptonite">Kryptonite</a>. (In comic books, the only substance which could harm <a href="Superman">Superman</a> was Kryptonite. This is a reference to Intel's hegemony over the market, i.e., an anthropomorphization of them as Superman.) The numeral "5" refers to the fifth generation of x86 processors; rival Intel had previously introduced its line of fifth-generation x86 processors as <a href="Pentium">Pentium</a> because the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked.

In 1996, AMD purchased <a href="NexGen">NexGen</a>, specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money to rework the Nx686. The result was the <a href="AMD%20K6">K6</a> processor, introduced in 1997. Although the K6 was based on <a href="Socket%207">Socket 7</a>, variants such as K6-3/450 were faster than Intel's <a href="Pentium%20II">Pentium II</a> (sixth-generation processor).

The K7 was AMD's seventh-generation x86 processor, making its debut on June 23, 1999, under the brand name <a href="Athlon">Athlon</a>. Unlike previous AMD processors, it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intel's, due to licensing issues surrounding Intel's <a href="Slot%201">Slot 1</a> connector, and instead used a <a href="Slot%20A">Slot A</a> connector, referenced to the <a href="DEC%20Alpha">Alpha</a> processor bus. The <a href="Duron">Duron</a> was a lower-cost and limited version of the Athlon (64KB instead of 256KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA (socket A) or soldered directly onto the motherboard. <a href="Sempron">Sempron</a> was released as a lower-cost Athlon XP, replacing Duron in the <a href="socket%20A">socket A</a> PGA era. It has since been migrated upward to all new sockets, up to <a href="AM3">AM3</a>.

On October 9, 2001, the <a href="Athlon%20XP">Athlon XP</a> was released. On February 10, 2003, the Athlon XP with 512KB L2 Cache was released.

The K8 was a major revision of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being the addition of a <a href="64-bit%20computing">64-bit</a> extension to the x86 instruction set (called <a href="x86-64">x86-64</a>, AMD64, or x64), the incorporation of an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high performance point-to-point interconnect called <a href="HyperTransport">HyperTransport</a>, as part of the <a href="Direct%20Connect%20Architecture">Direct Connect Architecture</a>. The technology was initially launched as the <a href="Opteron">Opteron</a> server-oriented processor on April 22, 2003. Shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded <a href="Athlon%2064">Athlon 64</a>.

On April 21, 2005, AMD released the first <a href="dual%20core">dual core</a> <a href="Opteron">Opteron</a>, an x86-based server CPU. A month later, AMD released the <a href="Athlon%2064%20X2">Athlon 64 X2</a>, the first desktop-based <a href="Multi-core%20%28computing%29">dual core processor</a> family. In May 2007, AMD abandoned the string "64" in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of <a href="x86-64">64-bit computing</a> in its processors. Further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. In 2008, AMD started to release dual-core Sempron processors exclusively in China, branded as the Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache. Thus AMD completed its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment.

After K8 came <a href="AMD%20K10">K10</a>. In September 2007, AMD released the first K10 processors, Third Generation Opteron processors, followed in November by the <a href="Phenom%20%28processor%29">Phenom</a> processor for desktop. K10 processors came in dual-core, <a href="Multi-core">triple-core</a>, and <a href="Multi-core">quad-core</a> versions, with all cores on a single die. AMD released a new platform, codenamed "<a href="AMD%20Spider">Spider</a>", which utilized the new Phenom processor, as well as an R770 GPU and a 790 GX/FX chipset from the <a href="AMD%20700%20chipset%20series">AMD 700 chipset series</a>. However, AMD built the Spider at <a href="65nm">65nm</a>, which was uncompetitive with Intel's smaller and more power-efficient <a href="45nm">45nm</a>.

In January 2009, AMD released a new processor line dubbed <a href="Phenom%20II">Phenom II</a>, a refresh of the original <a href="AMD%20Phenom">Phenom</a> built using the 45 nm process. AMD's new platform, codenamed “<a href="AMD%20Dragon">Dragon</a>”, utilized the new Phenom II processor, and an <a href="ATI%20%28brand%29">ATI</a> R770 GPU from the <a href="Radeon%20R700">R700</a> GPU family, as well as a 790 GX/FX chipset from the <a href="AMD%20700%20chipset%20series">AMD 700 chipset series</a>. The Phenom II came in dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die, with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. The Phenom II resolved issues that the original Phenom had, including a low clock speed, a small L3 cache and a <a href="Cool%27n%27Quiet">Cool'n'Quiet</a> bug that decreased performance. The Phenom II cost less but was not performance-competitive with Intel's mid-to-high-range <a href="Core%202">Core 2</a> Quads. The Phenom II also enhanced the Phenom's memory controller, allowing it to use <a href="DDR3">DDR3</a> in a new native socket <a href="AM3">AM3</a>, while maintaining backwards compatibility with <a href="AM2%2B">AM2+</a>, the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the <a href="DDR2%20SDRAM">DDR2</a> memory that was used with the platform.

In April 2010, AMD released a new Phenom II hexa-core (6-core) processor codenamed "<a href="Phenom%20II%23Thuban">Thuban</a>". This was a totally new die based on the hexa-core “Istanbul” <a href="Opteron">Opteron</a> processor. It included AMD's “turbo core” technology, which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed.

The <a href="List%20of%20AMD%20Opteron%20microprocessors%23Opteron%206100-series%20.22Magny-Cours.22%20.2845%20nm.29">Magny Cours</a> and <a href="List%20of%20AMD%20Opteron%20microprocessors%23Opteron%204100-series%20.22Lisbon.22%20.2845%20nm.29">Lisbon</a> server parts were released in 2010. The Magny Cours part came in 8 to 12 cores and the Lisbon part in 4 and 6 core parts. Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM (<a href="multi-chip%20module">multi-chip module</a>) with two hexa-core “Istanbul” <a href="Opteron">Opteron</a> parts. This will use a new G34 socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses C32 socket certified for dual socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a <a href="45%20nm">45 nm</a> SOI process.

Following AMD's 2006 acquisition of Canadian graphics company <a href="ATI%20Technologies">ATI Technologies</a>, an initiative codenamed "<a href="AMD%20Fusion">Fusion</a>" was announced to integrate a <a href="CPU">CPU</a> and <a href="GPU">GPU</a> together on some of AMD's microprocessors, including a built in <a href="PCI%20Express">PCI Express</a> link to accommodate separate PCI Express peripherals, eliminating the <a href="Northbridge%20%28computing%29">northbridge</a> chip from the motherboard. The initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. <a href="floating-point%20unit">floating-point unit</a> operations) to the GPU, which is better optimized for some calculations. The Fusion was later renamed to the <a href="AMD%20APU">AMD APU</a> (Accelerated Processing Unit).

Llano was AMD's first APU built for <a href="laptop">laptop</a>s. Llano was the second APU released, targeted at the mainstream market. Incorporating a CPU and GPU on the same die, as well as northbridge functions, and using "<a href="Socket%20FM1">Socket FM1</a>" with <a href="DDR3">DDR3</a> memory. The CPU part of the processor was based on the <a href="Phenom%20II">Phenom II</a> "Deneb" processor. AMD suffered an unexpected decrease in revenue based on production problems for the Llano.

Bulldozer is AMD's microarchitecture codename for server and desktop <a href="AMD%20FX">AMD FX</a> processors first released on October 12, 2011. This <a href="List%20of%20AMD%20CPU%20microarchitectures%23x86%20microarchitectures">family 15h microarchitecture</a> is the successor to the <a href="AMD%2010h">family 10h (K10)</a> microarchitecture design. Bulldozer is designed from scratch, not a development of earlier processors. The core is specifically aimed at 10–125 <a href="watt">W</a> <a href="Thermal%20Design%20Power">TDP</a> computing products. AMD claims dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in <a href="high-performance%20computing">high-performance computing</a> (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores. While hopes were very high that Bulldozer would bring AMD to be performance competitive with archrival Intel once more, most benchmarks were disappointing. In some cases the new Bulldozer products were slower than the K10 model they were built to replace.

The <a href="Piledriver%20%28microarchitecture%29">Piledriver microarchitecture</a> was the 2012 successor to Bulldozer, increasing clock speeds and performance relative to its predecessor. Piledriver would be released in AMD FX, APU, and Opteron product lines. Piledriver was subsequently followed by the <a href="Steamroller%20%28microarchitecture%29">Steamroller microarchitecture</a> in 2013. Used exclusively in AMD's APUs, Steamroller focused on greater parallelism.

In 2015, the <a href="Excavator%20%28microarchitecture%29">Excavator microarchitecture</a> replaced Piledriver. Expected to be the last microarchitecture of the Bulldozer series, Excavator focused on improved power efficiency.

The <a href="Bobcat%20%28microarchitecture%29">Bobcat microarchitecture</a> was revealed during a speech from AMD executive vice-president Henri Richard in <a href="Computex">Computex</a> 2007 and was put into production Q1 2011. Based on the difficulty competing in the x86 market with a single core optimized for the 10–100 W range, AMD had developed a simpler core with a target range of 1–10 watts. In addition, it was believed that the core could migrate into the hand-held space if the power consumption can be reduced to less than 1 W.

<a href="Jaguar%20%28microarchitecture%29">Jaguar</a> is a microarchitecture codename for Bobcat's successor, released in 2013, that is used in various APUs from AMD aimed at the low-power/low-cost market. Jaguar and its derivates would go on to be used in the custom APUs of the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>, <a href="PlayStation%204%23PlayStation%204%20Pro">PlayStation 4 Pro</a>, <a href="Xbox%20One%20S">Xbox One S</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20One%20X">Xbox One X</a>. Jaguar would be later followed by the <a href="Puma%20%28microarchitecture%29">Puma microarchitecture</a> in 2014.

In 2012, AMD announced it was working on an <a href="ARM%20architecture">ARM architecture</a> products, both as a semi-custom product and server product. The initial server product was announced at the <a href="Opteron%20A1100">Opteron A1100</a> in 2014, and 8-core <a href="Cortex-A57">Cortex-A57</a> based <a href="ARMv8-A">ARMv8-A</a> <a href="System%20on%20a%20Chip">SoC</a>, and was expected to be followed by an APU incorporating a Graphic Core Next GPU. However, the Opteron A1100 was not released until 2016, with the delay attributed to adding software support. The A1100 was also criticed for not having support from major vendors upon its release.

In 2014, AMD also announced the <a href="AMD%20K12">K12</a> custom core for release in 2016. While being <a href="ARMv8-A">ARMv8-A</a> <a href="instruction%20set%20architecture">instruction set architecture</a> compliant, the K12 is expected to be entirely custom designed targeting server, embedded, and semi-custom markets. The K12 was subsequently delayed until 2017, in preference to the development of AMD's x86 based Zen microarchitecture.

<a href="Zen%20%28microarchitecture%29">Zen</a> is a new architecture for x86-64 based <a href="Ryzen">Ryzen series</a> CPUs and APUs, introduced in 2017 by AMD and built from the ground up by a team led by <a href="Jim%20Keller%20%28engineer%29">Jim Keller</a>, beginning with his arrival in 2012, and <a href="Tape-out">taping out</a> before his departure in September 2015. One of AMD's primary goals with Zen was an <a href="Instructions%20per%20cycle">IPC</a> increase of at least 40%, however in February 2017 AMD announced that they had actually achieved a 52% increase. Processors made on the Zen architecture are built on the 14 nm FinFET node and have a renewed focus on single-core performance and <a href="Heterogeneous%20System%20Architecture">HSA</a> compatibility. Previous processors from AMD were either built in the 32 nm process ("Bulldozer" and "Piledriver" CPUs) or the 28 nm process ("Steamroller" and "Excavator" APUs). Because of this, Zen is much more energy efficient. The Zen architecture is the first to encompass CPUs and APUs from AMD built for a single socket (Socket AM4). Also new for this architecture is the implementation of <a href="simultaneous%20multithreading">simultaneous multithreading</a> (SMT) technology, something Intel has had for years on some of their processors with their proprietary <a href="Hyper-threading">Hyper-Threading</a> implementation of SMT. This is a departure from the "<a href="Bulldozer%20%28microarchitecture%29%23CMT">Clustered MultiThreading</a>" design introduced with the Bulldozer architecture. Zen also has support for <a href="DDR4%20SDRAM">DDR4</a> memory. AMD released the Zen-based high-end Ryzen 7 "Summit Ridge" series CPUs on March 2, 2017, mid-range Ryzen 5 series CPUs on April 11, 2017, and entry level Ryzen 3 series CPUs on July 27, 2017. AMD later released the <a href="Epyc">Epyc</a> line of Zen derived server processors for 1P and 2P systems. AMD is also expected to release next-generation Zen-based "Raven Ridge" APUs sometime in 2017.

In 2008 the ATI division of AMD released the <a href="TeraScale%20%28microarchitecture%29">TeraScale microarchitecture</a> implementing a <a href="unified%20shader%20model">unified shader model</a>. This design replaced the previous fixed-function hardware of previous graphics cards with multipurpose, programmable shaders. Initially released a part of the GPU for the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> this technology would go on to be used in Radeon branded HD 2000 parts. Three generations of TeraScale would be designed and used in parts from 2008-2014.

In a 2009 restructuring, AMD merged the CPU and GPU divisions to support the companies APU's which fused both graphics and general purpose processing. In 2011, AMD released the successor to TeraScale, <a href="Graphics%20Core%20Next">Graphics Core Next (GCN)</a>. This new microarchitecture emphasized <a href="GPGPU">GPGPU</a> compute capability in addition to graphics processing, with a particular aim of supporting heterogeneous computing on AMD's APUs. GCN's <a href="reduced%20instruction%20set%20computer">reduced instruction set</a> <a href="Instruction%20set%20architecture">ISA</a> allowed for significantly increased compute capability over TeraScale's <a href="very%20long%20instruction%20word">very long instruction word</a> ISA. Since GCN's introduction with the <a href="Radeon%20HD%207000%20Series">HD 7970</a>, five generations of the GCN architecture have been produced from 2008 through at least 2017.

In September 2015, AMD separated the graphics technology division of the company into an independent internal unit called the Radeon Technology Group (RTG) headed by Raja Koduri. This gave the graphics division of AMD autonomy in product design and marketing. The RTG then went on to create and release the <a href="Graphics%20Core%20Next%23Polaris">Polaris</a> and <a href="Graphics%20Core%20Next%23Vega">Vega</a> microarchitectures released in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In particular the Vega, or 5th generation GCN, microarchitecture includes a number of major revisions to improve performance and compute capabilities.

In 2012, AMD's then CEO <a href="Rory%20Read">Rory Read</a> began a program to offer semi-custom designs. Rather than AMD simply designing and offering a single product, potential customers could work with AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD's intellectual property. Customers pay a non-recurring engineering fees for design and development, and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. In particular, AMD noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property. These semi-custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the <a href="Playstation%204">Playstation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> and the subsequent <a href="PlayStation%204%23PlayStation%204%20Pro">PlayStation 4 Pro</a>, <a href="Xbox%20One%20S">Xbox One S</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20One%20X">Xbox One X</a>. Financially, these semi-custom products would represent a majority of the company's revenue in 2016.

Before the launch of <a href="Athlon%2064">Athlon 64</a> processors in 2003, AMD designed <a href="chipset">chipset</a>s for their processors spanning the <a href="AMD%20K6">K6</a> and <a href="AMD%20K7">K7</a> processor generations. The chipsets include the AMD-640, AMD-751 and the AMD-761 chipsets. The situation changed in 2003 with the release of <a href="Athlon%2064">Athlon 64</a> processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets. This was the “<a href="Open%20Platform%20Management%20Architecture">Open Platform Management Architecture</a>” with <a href="ATI%20Technologies">ATI</a>, <a href="VIA%20Technologies">VIA</a> and <a href="Silicon%20Integrated%20Systems">SiS</a> developing their own chipset for <a href="Athlon%2064">Athlon 64</a> processors and later <a href="Athlon%2064%20X2">Athlon 64 X2</a> and <a href="Athlon%2064%20FX">Athlon 64 FX</a> processors, including the <a href="AMD%20Quad%20FX%20platform">Quad FX platform</a> chipset from Nvidia.

The initiative went further with the release of <a href="Opteron">Opteron</a> server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors. As of today, <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> and <a href="Broadcom">Broadcom</a> are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors.

As the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in 2006, the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the <a href="Xpress%20200">Radeon Xpress 200</a> and the <a href="Xpress%203200">Radeon Xpress 3200</a> chipsets. AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding (for instance, the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as <a href="AMD%20580%20chipset%20series">AMD 580X CrossFire chipset</a>). In February 2007, AMD announced the first AMD-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the AMD <a href="AMD%20690%20chipset%20series">690G</a> chipset (previously under the development codename "RS690"), targeted at mainstream <a href="Integrated%20Graphics%20Processor">IGP</a> computing. It was the industry's first to implement a <a href="HDMI">HDMI</a> 1.2 port on motherboards, shipping for more than a million units. While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset, the plan was scrapped and the inventories of <a href="AMD%20690%20chipset%20series%23Radeon%20Xpress%201250">Radeon Xpress 1250</a> (codenamed "RS600", sold under ATI brand) was sold to two OEMs, Abit and ASRock. Although AMD stated the firm would still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of FSB to ATI.

On November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the <a href="AMD%20700%20chipset%20series">AMD 7-Series chipsets</a>, covering from enthusiast multi-graphics segment to value IGP segment, to replace the <a href="AMD%20580%20chipset%20series">AMD 480/570/580 chipsets</a> and <a href="AMD%20690%20chipset%20series">AMD 690 series chipsets</a>, marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset. Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November 15, 2007, as part of the codenamed "Spider" desktop platform, and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in spring 2008 as part of the codenamed "Cartwheel" platform.

AMD returned to the server chipsets market with the <a href="AMD%20800%20chipset%20series">AMD 800S series server chipsets</a>. It includes support for up to six <a href="Serial%20ATA%23SATA%20Revision%203.0%20%28SATA%206Gb/s%29">SATA 6.0 Gbit/s</a> ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in <a href="AMD%20Fusion">Fusion</a> processors and <a href="Advanced%20Host%20Controller%20Interface">AHCI</a> 1.2 with SATA <a href="port%20multiplier%23FIS%28Frame%20Information%20Structure%29%E2%80%93based%20switching">FIS–based switching</a> support. This is a chipset family supporting <a href="Phenom%20%28processor%29">Phenom</a> processors and <a href="AMD%20Quad%20FX%20platform">Quad FX enthusiast platform</a> (890FX), <a href="Integrated%20Graphics%20Processor">IGP</a>(890GX).

With the advent of AMD's APUs in 2011, traditional north bridge features such as the connection to graphics and the PCI Express controller were incorporated into the APU die. Accordingly, APUs were connected to as single chip chipset, renamed the Fusion Controller Hub (FCH), which primarily provided southbridge functionality.

AMD released new chipsets in 2017 to support the release of their new <a href="Ryzen">Ryzen</a> products. As the <a href="Zen%20%28microarchitecture%29">Zen microarchitecture</a> already includes much of the northbridge connectivity, the AM4 based chipsets primarily varied in the number of additional PCI Express lanes, USB connections, and SATA connections available. These AM4 chipsets were designed in conjunction with <a href="ASMedia">ASMedia</a>.

In February 2002, AMD acquired Alchemy Semiconductor for its <a href="Alchemy%20%28processor%29">Alchemy</a> line of <a href="MIPS%20architecture">MIPS</a> processors for the hand-held and <a href="portable%20media%20player">portable media player</a> markets. On June 13, 2006, AMD officially announced that the line was to be transferred to Raza Microelectronics, Inc., a designer of MIPS processors for embedded applications.

In August 2003, AMD also purchased the <a href="Geode%20%28processor%29">Geode</a> business which was originally the <a href="Cyrix">Cyrix</a> <a href="MediaGX">MediaGX</a> from <a href="National%20Semiconductor">National Semiconductor</a> to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products. During the second quarter of 2004, it launched new low-power Geode NX processors based on the K7 Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of fanless processors and , and processor with fan, of <a href="Thermal%20Design%20Power">TDP</a> 25 W. This technology is used in a variety of embedded systems (Casino slot machines and customer kiosks for instance), several <a href="Ultra%20Mobile%20PC">UMPC</a> designs in Asia markets, as well as the <a href="One%20Laptop%20per%20Child">OLPC</a> <a href="OLPC%20XO-1">XO-1 computer</a>, an inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world. The Geode LX processor was announced in 2005 and is said will continue to be available through 2015.

AMD has also introduced <a href="x86-64">64-bit</a> processors into its embedded product line starting with the AMD <a href="Opteron">Opteron</a> processor. Leveraging the high throughput enabled through <a href="HyperTransport">HyperTransport</a> and the <a href="Direct%20Connect%20Architecture">Direct Connect Architecture</a> these server class processors have been targeted at high-end telecom and storage applications. In 2007, AMD added the AMD Athlon, AMD Turion, and Mobile AMD Sempron processors to its embedded product line. Leveraging the same <a href="x86-64">64-bit</a> instruction set and <a href="Direct%20Connect%20Architecture">Direct Connect Architecture</a> as the AMD <a href="Opteron">Opteron</a> but at lower power levels, these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications. Throughout 2007 and into 2008, AMD has continued to add both single-core Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors and <a href="Multi-core%20%28computing%29">dual-core</a> AMD Athlon X2 and AMD Turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded <a href="x86-64">64-bit</a> solutions starting with 8W TDP Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors for fan-less designs up to multi-processor systems leveraging multi-core AMD Opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability.

The ATI acquisition in 2006 included the <a href="Imageon">Imageon</a> and <a href="Xilleon">Xilleon</a> product lines. In late 2008, the entire handheld division was sold off to <a href="Qualcomm">Qualcomm</a>, who have since produced the <a href="Adreno">Adreno</a> series. Also in 2008, the Xilleon division was sold to <a href="Broadcom">Broadcom</a>.

In April 2007, AMD announced the release of the <a href="AMD%20690%20chipset%20series%23M690T">M690T</a> integrated graphics chipset for embedded designs. This enabled AMD to offer complete processor and chipset solutions targeted at embedded applications requiring high-performance 3D and video such as emerging digital signage, kiosk and Point of Sale applications. The M690T was followed by the <a href="AMD%20690%20chipset%20series%23M690E">M690E</a> specifically for embedded applications which removed the TV output, which required <a href="Macrovision">Macrovision</a> licensing for OEMs, and enabled native support for dual <a href="Transition%20Minimized%20Differential%20Signaling">TMDS</a> outputs, enabling dual independent <a href="Digital%20Visual%20Interface">DVI</a> interfaces.

In January 2011, AMD announced the AMD Embedded G-Series <a href="AMD%20Accelerated%20Processing%20Unit">Accelerated Processing Unit</a>. This was the first APU for embedded applications. These were followed by updates to the in 2013 and 2016.

In May 2012, AMD Announced the AMD Embedded R-Series <a href="AMD%20Accelerated%20Processing%20Unit">Accelerated Processing Unit</a>. This family of products incorporates the Bulldozer CPU architecture, and Discrete-class Radeon HD 7000G Series graphics. This was followed by a <a href="system%20on%20a%20chip">system on a chip (SoC)</a> version in 2015 which offered a faster CPU and faster graphics, with support for <a href="DDR4%20SDRAM">DDR4 SDRAM</a> memory.

AMD builds graphic processors for use in <a href="Embedded%20System">embedded</a> systems. They can be found in anything from casinos to healthcare, with a large portion of products being used in industrial machines. These products include a complete graphics processing device in a compact <a href="multi-chip%20module">multi-chip module</a> including RAM and the GPU. ATI began offering embedded GPUs with the E2400 in 2008. Since that time AMD has released regular updates to their embedded GPU lineup in 2009, 2011, 2015, and 2016; reflecting improvements in their GPU technology.

In 2011 AMD began selling Radeon branded <a href="DDR3%20SDRAM">DDR3 SDRAM</a> to support the higher bandwidth needs of AMD's APUs. While the RAM is sold by AMD, it was manufactured by <a href="Patriot%20Memory">Patriot Memory</a> and <a href="VisionTek">VisionTek</a>. This was later followed by higher speeds of gaming oriented DDR3 memory in 2013. Radeon branded <a href="DDR4%20SDRAM">DDR4 SDRAM</a> memory was released in 2015, despite no AMD CPUs or APUs supporting DDR4 at the time. AMD noted in 2017 that these products are "mostly distributed in Eastern Europe" and that it continues to be active in the business.

AMD announced in 2014 it would sell Radeon branded <a href="Solid%20state%20drives">Solid state drives</a> manufactured by <a href="OCZ">OCZ</a> with capacities up to 480 GB and using the <a href="SATA">SATA</a> interface.

Previously, AMD produced its chips at company owned <a href="Foundry%20%28electronics%29">semiconductor foundries</a>. AMD pursued a strategy of collaboration with other semiconductor manufacturers <a href="IBM">IBM</a> and <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a> to co-develop production technologies. AMD's founder Jerry Sanders termed this the "Virtual Gorilla" strategy to compete with Intel's significantly greater investments in fabrication.

In 2008 AMD spun off its chip foundries into an independent company named <a href="GlobalFoundries">GlobalFoundries</a>. This break-up of the company was attributed to the increasing costs of each process node. The <a href="Emirate%20of%20Abu%20Dhabi">Emirate of Abu Dhabi</a> purchased the newly created company through its subsidiary <a href="Advanced%20Technology%20Investment%20Company">Advanced Technology Investment Company</a> (ATIC), purchasing the final stake from AMD in 2009.

With the spin-off of its foundries, AMD became a <a href="Fabless%20manufacturing">fabless</a> semiconductor manufacturer, designing products to be produced at for-hire foundries. Part of the GlobalFoundries spin-off included an agreement with AMD to produce some number of products at GlobalFoundries. Both prior to the spin-off and after AMD has pursued production with other foundries including <a href="TSMC">TSMC</a> and <a href="Samsung">Samsung</a>.

Albrecht Dürer

Albrecht Dürer (; ; 21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528) was a <a href="German%20art">painter</a>, <a href="Old%20master%20prints">printmaker</a>, and <a href="history%20of%20geometry%23Renaissance">theorist</a> of the <a href="German%20Renaissance">German Renaissance</a>. Born in <a href="Free%20Imperial%20City%20of%20Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, Dürer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties due to his high-quality <a href="List%20of%20woodcuts%20by%20D%C3%BCrer">woodcut prints</a>.
He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Bellini">Giovanni Bellini</a> and <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a>. Dürer is commemorated by both the Lutheran and Episcopal Churches.

Dürer's vast body of work includes <a href="List%20of%20engravings%20by%20D%C3%BCrer">engraving</a>s, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, <a href="watercolour">watercolour</a>s and books. The woodcuts, such as the "<a href="Apocalypse%20%28D%C3%BCrer%29">Apocalypse</a>" series (1498), are more <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic</a> than the rest of his work. 
His well-known engravings include the "<a href="Knight%2C%20Death%2C%20and%20the%20Devil">Knight, Death, and the Devil</a>" (1513), "<a href="Saint%20Jerome%20in%20His%20Study%20%28D%C3%BCrer%29">Saint Jerome in his Study</a>" (1514) and "<a href="Melencolia%20I">Melencolia I</a>" (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European <a href="landscape%20art">landscape art</a>ists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.

Dürer's introduction of <a href="Roman%20mythology">classical motifs</a> into Northern art, through his knowledge of <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Italian artists</a> and <a href="Humanism%20in%20Germany">German humanists</a>, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a>. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, <a href="linear%20perspective">perspective</a>, and <a href="body%20proportions">ideal proportions</a>.

Dürer was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had at least fourteen and possibly as many as eighteen children. His father, <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer%20the%20Elder">Albrecht Dürer the Elder</a>, was a successful <a href="goldsmith">goldsmith</a>, originally Ajtósi, who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from <a href="Ajt%C3%B3s">Ajtós</a>, near <a href="Gyula%20%28town%29">Gyula</a> in <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>. One of Albrecht's brothers, <a href="Hans%20D%C3%BCrer">Hans Dürer</a>, was also a painter and trained under him. Another of Albrecht's brothers, Endres Dürer, took over their father's business and was a master goldsmith. The German name "Dürer" is a translation from the Hungarian, "Ajtósi". Initially, it was "Türer," meaning doormaker, which is "ajtós" in Hungarian (from "ajtó", meaning door). A door is featured in the <a href="coat-of-arms">coat-of-arms</a> the family acquired. Albrecht Dürer the Younger later changed "Türer", his father's diction of the family's surname, to "Dürer", to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect. Albrecht Dürer the Elder married Barbara Holper, the daughter of his master when he himself became a master in 1467.

Dürer's godfather was <a href="Anton%20Koberger">Anton Koberger</a>, who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of Dürer's birth and quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four <a href="printing-press">printing-press</a>es and having many offices in Germany and abroad. Koberger's most famous publication was the "<a href="Nuremberg%20Chronicle">Nuremberg Chronicle</a>", published in 1493 in German and Latin editions. It contained an unprecedented 1,809 <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> illustrations (albeit with many repeated uses of the same block) by the <a href="Wolgemut">Wolgemut</a> workshop. Dürer may have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.

Because Dürer left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources. After a few years of school, Dürer started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to <a href="Michael%20Wolgemut">Michael Wolgemut</a> at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a drawing in <a href="silverpoint">silverpoint</a>, is dated 1484 (<a href="Albertina%2C%20Vienna">Albertina, Vienna</a>) "when I was a child," as his later inscription says. Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, a relatively short distance across the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>.

After completing his term of apprenticeship, Dürer followed the common German custom of taking "<a href="Wanderjahre">Wanderjahre</a>"—in effect <a href="gap%20year">gap year</a>s —in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Dürer was to spend about four years away. He left in 1490, possibly to work under <a href="Martin%20Schongauer">Martin Schongauer</a>, the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before Dürer's arrival at <a href="Colmar">Colmar</a> in 1492. It is unclear where Dürer travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. In Colmar, Dürer was welcomed by Schongauer's brothers, the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig. In 1493 Dürer went to <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, where he would have experienced the sculpture of <a href="Nikolaus%20Gerhaert">Nikolaus Gerhaert</a>. Dürer's first painted self-portrait (now in the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiancée in Nuremberg.

In early 1492 Dürer travelled to <a href="Basel">Basel</a> to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer, the goldsmith Georg. Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23, Dürer was married to <a href="Agnes%20Frey">Agnes Frey</a> following an arrangement made during his absence. Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city. However, no children resulted from the marriage.

Within three months of his marriage, Dürer left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of <a href="Black%20Death">plague</a> in Nuremberg. He made watercolour sketches as he traveled over the Alps. Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving "Nemesis".

In Italy, he went to Venice to study its more advanced artistic world. Through Wolgemut's tutelage, Dürer had learned how to make prints in <a href="drypoint">drypoint</a> and design <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s in the German style, based on the works of <a href="Martin%20Schongauer">Martin Schongauer</a> and the <a href="Housebook%20Master">Housebook Master</a>. He also would have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him. He wrote that <a href="Giovanni%20Bellini">Giovanni Bellini</a> was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice. His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably <a href="Antonio%20Pollaiuolo">Antonio Pollaiuolo</a> with his interest in the proportions of the body, <a href="Andrea%20Mantegna">Andrea Mantegna</a>, <a href="Lorenzo%20di%20Credi">Lorenzo di Credi</a> and others. Dürer probably also visited <a href="Padua%2C%20Italy">Padua</a> and <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> on this trip.

On his return to <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> in 1495, Dürer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Dürer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as "The Men's Bath House" (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.

It is now thought unlikely that Dürer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Dürer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

His famous series of sixteen great designs for the "Apocalypse" is dated 1498, as is his engraving of" <a href="St.%20Michael%20Fighting%20the%20Dragon-Albrecht%20Durer">St. Michael Fighting the Dragon</a>". He made the first seven scenes of the "Great Passion" in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the <a href="Holy%20Family">Holy Family</a> and saints. The "<a href="Polyptych%20of%20the%20Seven%20Sorrows">Seven Sorrows Polyptych</a>", commissioned by <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony">Frederick III of Saxony</a> in 1496, was executed by Dürer and his assistants c. 1500. Around 1503–1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the "<a href="Life%20of%20the%20Virgin">Life of the Virgin</a>", which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the "Great Passion," were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.

During the same period Dürer trained himself in the difficult art of using the <a href="Burin%20%28engraving%29">burin</a> to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the "Prodigal Son", which the Italian Renaissance art historian <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a> singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably "Nemesis" (1502), "The Sea Monster" (1498), and "Saint Eustace" (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as "Pond in the Woods" and "Willow Mill", are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Madonna</a>s, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Dürer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.

The Venetian artist <a href="Jacopo%20de%27%20Barbari">Jacopo de' Barbari</a>, whom Dürer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Dürer said that he learned much about the new developments in <a href="perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a>, <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a>, and <a href="Body%20proportions">proportion</a> from him. De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so Dürer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of "<a href="Adam%20and%20Eve%20%28D%C3%BCrer%29">Adam and Eve</a>" (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces. This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.

Dürer created large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the "<a href="Betende%20H%C3%A4nde">Betende Hände</a>" ("Praying Hands") from circa 1508, a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece. He continued to make images in watercolour and <a href="bodycolour">bodycolour</a> (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his "<a href="Young%20Hare">Young Hare</a>" (1502) and the "<a href="Great%20Piece%20of%20Turf">Great Piece of Turf</a>" (1503).

In Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in <a href="tempera">tempera</a> on <a href="linen">linen</a>. These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the <a href="Paumgartner%20altarpiece">Paumgartner altarpiece</a> and the "<a href="Adoration%20of%20the%20Magi%20%28D%C3%BCrer%29">Adoration of the Magi</a>". In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507. By this time Dürer's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of <a href="San%20Bartolomeo%2C%20Venice">San Bartolomeo</a>. This was the altar-piece known as the "<a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Rosary">Adoration of the Virgin</a>" or the "Feast of Rose Garlands". It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Rudolf II</a> and taken to Prague. Other paintings Dürer produced in Venice include "The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch", "<a href="Christ%20among%20the%20Doctors%20%28D%C3%BCrer%29">Christ among the Doctors</a>" (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.

Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, Dürer returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Bellini">Giovanni Bellini</a> and—mainly through <a href="Lorenzo%20di%20Credi">Lorenzo di Credi</a>—<a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>.

Between 1507 and 1511 Dürer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: "<a href="Adam%20and%20Eve%20%28D%C3%BCrer%29">Adam and Eve</a>" (1507), "<a href="The%20Martyrdom%20of%20the%20Ten%20Thousand%20%28D%C3%BCrer%29">The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand</a>" (1508, for Frederick of Saxony), "Virgin with the Iris" (1508), the altarpiece "Assumption of the Virgin" (1509, for Jacob Heller of Frankfurt), and "<a href="Adoration%20of%20the%20Trinity">Adoration of the Trinity</a>" (1511, for Matthaeus Landauer). During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin, both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series. The post-Venetian woodcuts show Dürer's development of <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a> modelling effects, creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.

Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516. However, in 1513 and 1514 Dürer created his three most famous <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s: "<a href="Knight%2C%20Death%2C%20and%20the%20Devil">Knight, Death, and the Devil</a>" (1513, probably based on <a href="Desiderius%20Erasmus">Erasmus</a>'s treatise "<a href="Enchiridion%20militis%20Christiani">Enchiridion militis Christiani</a>"), "<a href="St.%20Jerome%20in%20His%20Study%20%28D%C3%BCrer%29">St. Jerome in his Study</a>", and the much-debated "<a href="Melencolia%20I">Melencolia I</a>" (both 1514). Further outstanding pen and ink drawings of Dürer´s period of art work of 1513 were drafts for his friend Willibald Prickheimer. These drafts were later used to design the famous chandeliers <a href="lusterweibchen">lusterweibchen</a>.

In 1515, he created his "<a href="D%C3%BCrer%27s%20Rhinoceros">woodcut of a Rhinoceros</a>" which had arrived in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the <a href="Indian%20rhinoceros">Indian rhinoceros</a>, the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century. In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515 and portraits in <a href="tempera">tempera</a> on <a href="linen">linen</a> in 1516.

From 1512, <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a> became Dürer's major patron. His commissions included "<a href="The%20Triumphal%20Arch">The Triumphal Arch</a>", a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer's translation of <a href="Horapollo">Horapollo</a>'s "Hieroglyphica". The design program and explanations were devised by <a href="Johannes%20Stabius">Johannes Stabius</a>, the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter Jörg Kölderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae, with Dürer as designer-in-chief. "The Arch" was followed by "<a href="The%20Triumphal%20Procession">The Triumphal Procession</a>", the program of which was worked out in 1512 by and includes woodcuts by <a href="Albrecht%20Altdorfer">Albrecht Altdorfer</a> and <a href="Hans%20Springinklee">Hans Springinklee</a>, as well as Dürer.

Dürer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-pageRank.Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in <a href="lithography">lithography</a>. Dürer's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a> and <a href="Hans%20Baldung">Hans Baldung</a>. Dürer also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before Maximilian's death in 1519.

Maximilian's death came at a time when Dürer was concerned he was losing "my sight and freedom of hand" (perhaps caused by <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a>) and increasingly affected by the writings of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>. In July 1520 Dürer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a>, who was to be crowned at <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>. Dürer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> to <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> and then to <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in <a href="silverpoint">silverpoint</a>, chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of <a href="Stefan%20Lochner">Stefan Lochner</a>), <a href="Nijmegen">Nijmegen</a>, <a href="%27s-Hertogenbosch">'s-Hertogenbosch</a>, <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> (where he saw <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s <a href="Madonna%20of%20Bruges">Madonna of Bruges</a>), <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a> (where he admired <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">van Eyck</a>'s altarpiece), and <a href="Zeeland">Zeeland</a>.

Dürer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much. This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time. Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented. While providing valuable documentary evidence, Dürer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, Dürer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, <a href="Margaret%20of%20Habsburg%20%281480%E2%80%931530%29">Margaret of Austria</a>, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met <a href="Bernard%20van%20Orley">Bernard van Orley</a>, <a href="Jan%20Provoost">Jan Provoost</a>, <a href="Gerard%20Horenbout">Gerard Horenbout</a>, <a href="Jean%20Mone">Jean Mone</a>, <a href="Joachim%20Patinir">Joachim Patinir</a> and <a href="Tommaso%20Vincidor">Tommaso Vincidor</a>, though he did not, it seems, meet <a href="Quentin%20Matsys">Quentin Matsys</a>.

At the request of <a href="Christian%20II%20of%20Denmark">Christian II of Denmark</a>, Dürer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait. There he saw "the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land"—the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> treasure that <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Cort%C3%A9s">Hernán Cortés</a> had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. Dürer wrote that this treasure "was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 <a href="Florin%20%28Italian%20coin%29">florin</a>s". Dürer also appears to have been collecting for his own <a href="cabinet%20of%20curiosities">cabinet of curiosities</a>, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of <a href="coral">coral</a>, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>.

Having secured his pension, Dürer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness—perhaps <a href="malaria">malaria</a> —which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.

On his return to Nuremberg, Dürer worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a <a href="Sacra%20conversazione">Sacra Conversazione</a>, though neither was completed. This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the <a href="body%20proportions">proportions</a> of men and horses, and <a href="fortification">fortification</a>.

However, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life, Dürer produced comparatively little as an artist. In painting, there was only a portrait of , a , , and two panels showing <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">St. John</a> with <a href="St.%20Peter">St. Peter</a> in and <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">St. Paul</a> with <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">St. Mark</a> in the . This last great work, <a href="the%20Four%20Apostles">the Four Apostles</a>, was given by Dürer to the City of Nuremberg—although he was given 100 guilders in return.

As for engravings, Dürer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector <a href="Albert%20of%20Mainz">Albert of Mainz</a>; <a href="Frederick%20the%20Wise">Frederick the Wise</a>, elector of Saxony; the <a href="Humanism">humanist</a> scholar <a href="Willibald%20Pirckheimer">Willibald Pirckheimer</a>; <a href="Philipp%20Melanchthon">Philipp Melanchthon</a>, and <a href="Desiderius%20Erasmus">Erasmus of Rotterdam</a>. For those of <a href="Albert%20of%20Mainz">the Cardinal</a>, Melanchthon, and Dürer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Dürer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.

Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Dürer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend <a href="Willibald%20Pirckheimer">Willibald Pirckheimer</a>, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Dürer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. "The Four Books on Measurement" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> in German, as well as being cited later by <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a> and <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Kepler</a>. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. "The Four Books on Human Proportion" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.

Dürer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins—a considerable sum. <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer%27s%20House">His large house</a> (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer <a href="Bernhard%20Walther">Bernhard Walther</a>), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark. It is now a museum. He is buried in the "Johannisfriedhof" cemetery.

Dürer's writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s ideas, though it is unclear if he ever left the Catholic Church. Dürer wrote of his desire to draw Luther in his diary in 1520: "And God help me that I may go to Dr. Martin Luther; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties." In a letter to <a href="Nicholas%20Kratzer">Nicholas Kratzer</a> in 1524, Dürer wrote "because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics." Most tellingly, <a href="Willibald%20Pirckheimer">Pirckheimer</a> wrote in a letter to Johann Tscherte in 1530: "I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our Albert of blessed memory...but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse." Dürer may even have contributed to the Nuremberg City Council's mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525. Notably, Dürer had contacts with various reformers, such as <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Zwingli</a>, <a href="Andreas%20Karlstadt">Andreas Karlstadt</a>, <a href="Philipp%20Melanchthon">Melanchthon</a>, <a href="Desiderius%20Erasmus">Erasmus</a> and Cornelius Grapheus from whom Dürer received Luther's "<a href="On%20the%20Babylonian%20Captivity%20of%20the%20Church">Babylonian Captivity</a>" in 1520.

Dürer's later works have also been claimed to show <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> sympathies. For example, his woodcut of "<a href="The%20Last%20Supper">The Last Supper</a>" of 1523 has often been understood to have an <a href="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>, as well the inclusion of the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>ic cup, an expression of Protestant <a href="Utraquist">utraquism</a>, although this interpretation has been questioned. The delaying of the engraving of <a href="Philip%20the%20Apostle">St Philip</a>, completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to Dürer's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if Dürer was not an <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclast</a>, in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.

Dürer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominantly in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, and <a href="Parmigianino">Parmigianino</a>, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work.

His work in <a href="engraving">engraving</a> seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the "<a href="Little%20Masters">Little Masters</a>" who attempted few large engravings but continued Dürer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. <a href="Lucas%20van%20Leyden">Lucas van Leyden</a> was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Dürer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (<a href="Giulio%20Campagnola">Giulio Campagnola</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Palumba">Giovanni Battista Palumba</a>, <a href="Benedetto%20Montagna">Benedetto Montagna</a> and <a href="Cristofano%20Robetta">Cristofano Robetta</a>), or whole prints (<a href="Marcantonio%20Raimondi">Marcantonio Raimondi</a> and <a href="Agostino%20Veneziano">Agostino Veneziano</a>). However, Dürer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.

In painting, Dürer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Dürer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the "Dürer Renaissance" of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a> from 1870 to 1945.

Dürer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by <a href="D%27Arcy%20Thompson">D'Arcy Thompson</a> in his book "On Growth and Form".

The <a href="Lutheran%20Church">Lutheran Church</a> remembers Dürer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a> and <a href="Hans%20Burgkmair">Hans Burgkmair</a>. The <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints%20%28Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America%29">liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (United States)</a> remembers him, Cranach and <a href="Matthias%20Gr%C3%BCnewald">Matthias Grünewald</a> on August 5.

In all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the <a href="German%20language">German language</a> rather than in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, Dürer used graphic expressions based on a <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a>, craftsmen's language. For example, "Schneckenlinie" ("snail-line") was his term for a spiral form. Thus, Dürer contributed to the expansion in German prose which <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> had begun with his translation of the <a href="Luther%20Bible">Bible</a>.

Dürer's work on <a href="geometry">geometry</a> is called the "Four Books on Measurement" ("Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt" or "Instructions for Measuring with <a href="Compass%20%28drawing%20tool%29">Compass</a> and Ruler"). The first book focuses on linear geometry. Dürer's geometric constructions include <a href="helices">helices</a>, <a href="Conchoid%20%28mathematics%29">conchoids</a> and <a href="epicycloid">epicycloid</a>s. He also draws on <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Perga">Apollonius</a>, and <a href="Johannes%20Werner">Johannes Werner</a>'s 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522.

The second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular <a href="polygon">polygon</a>s. Here Dürer favours the methods of <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> over <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a>. The third book applies these principles of geometry to <a href="architecture">architecture</a>, <a href="engineering">engineering</a> and <a href="typography">typography</a>. 

In architecture Dürer cites <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> but elaborates his own classical designs and <a href="classical%20orders">columns</a>. In <a href="typography">typography</a>, Dürer depicts the geometric construction of the <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>, relying on <a href="History%20of%20western%20typography%23Classical%20revival">Italian precedent</a>. However, his construction of the <a href="Gothic%20alphabet">Gothic alphabet</a> is based upon an entirely different <a href="modular">modular</a> system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of <a href="Polyhedron">polyhedra</a>. Here Dürer discusses the five <a href="Platonic%20solid">Platonic solid</a>s, as well as seven <a href="Archimedean%20solid">Archimedean</a> semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention.

In all these, Dürer shows the objects as <a href="Net%20%28polyhedron%29">nets</a>. Finally, Dürer discusses the <a href="Doubling%20the%20cube">Delian Problem</a> and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through <a href="linear%20perspective">linear perspective</a>. It was in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> that Dürer was taught (possibly by <a href="Luca%20Pacioli">Luca Pacioli</a> or <a href="Bramante">Bramante</a>) the principles of <a href="linear%20perspective">linear perspective</a>, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of <a href="Piero%20della%20Francesca">Piero della Francesca</a>. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. Although Dürer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Dürer discusses in this last book of "Underweysung der Messung" an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

Dürer's work on <a href="body%20proportions">human proportions</a> is called the "Four Books on Human Proportion" ("Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion") of 1528. The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height. Dürer based these constructions on both <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> and empirical observations of, "two to three hundred living persons," in his own words. The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an <a href="Leone%20Battista%20Alberti">Albertian</a> system, which Dürer probably learned from <a href="Francesco%20di%20Giorgio">Francesco di Giorgio</a>'s 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525. In the third book, Dürer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of <a href="convex%20mirror">convex</a> and <a href="concave%20mirror">concave mirror</a>s; here Dürer also deals with human <a href="physiognomy">physiognomy</a>. The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.

Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Dürer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. Dürer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Dürer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naïve approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Dürer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Dürer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or <a href="artistic%20inspiration">inspired</a> to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'. In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Dürer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that "one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year."

Australian rules football

Australian rules football, officially known as Australian football, or simply called football or footy, is a <a href="contact%20sport">contact sport</a> played between two teams of eighteen players on an <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20playing%20field">oval-shaped field</a>, often a modified <a href="cricket%20ground">cricket ground</a>.

The main way to score points is by kicking the <a href="Football%20%28ball%29%23Australian%20rules%20football">oval-shaped ball</a> between the two tall goal posts. The team with the higher score by the end of the match wins unless a <a href="Tie%20%28draw%29">draw</a> is declared.

During general play, players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are <a href="kick%20%28football%29">kicking</a>, <a href="handball%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">handballing</a> and running with the ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled: for example, players running with the ball must intermittently <a href="running%20bounce">bounce or touch it on the ground</a>. Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught <a href="holding%20the%20ball">holding the ball</a>. A distinctive feature of the game is the <a href="Mark%20%28Australian%20football%29">mark</a>, where players anywhere on the field who catch a ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded possession. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a <a href="Free%20kick%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">free kick</a> or mark is paid. Players can <a href="tackle%20%28football%20move%29">tackle</a> using their hands or use their whole body to <a href="Shepherding%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">obstruct</a> opponents. Dangerous physical contact (such as <a href="push%20in%20the%20back">pushing an opponent in the back</a>), interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, <a href="50-metre%20penalty">distance penalties</a> or <a href="suspension%20%28punishment%29">suspension</a> for a certain number of matches, depending on the seriousness of the infringement. The game features frequent physical contests, <a href="spectacular%20mark">spectacular mark</a>ing, fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring.

The <a href="Origins%20of%20Australian%20football">sport's origins</a> can be traced to football matches played in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> in 1858, inspired by <a href="English%20public%20school%20football%20games">English public school football games</a>. Seeking to develop a game more suited to adults and Australian conditions, the <a href="Melbourne%20Football%20Club">Melbourne Football Club</a> published the first <a href="laws%20of%20Australian%20football">laws of Australian football</a> in May 1859, making it the oldest of the world's major football codes.

Australian football has the highest spectator attendance and television viewership of all sports in Australia, while the <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Australian Football League</a> (AFL), the sport's only fully professional competition, is the nation's wealthiest sporting body. Its annual <a href="AFL%20Grand%20Final">Grand Final</a> is the <a href="List%20of%20sports%20attendance%20figures%23Top%20Leagues%20in%20recent%20domestic%20club%20championship%20event%20attendance">highest attended club championship event in the world</a>. The sport is also played at <a href="Countries%20playing%20Australian%20rules%20football">amateur level in many countries</a> and in <a href="variations%20of%20Australian%20rules%20football">several variations</a>. The game's <a href="Laws%20of%20Australian%20football">rules</a> are governed by the <a href="AFL%20Commission">AFL Commission</a> with the advice of the AFL's Laws of the Game Committee.

Australian rules football is known by several nicknames, including Aussie rules, football and footy. In some regions, it is marketed as AFL after the <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Australian Football League</a>.

There is evidence of football being played sporadically in the Australian colonies in the first half of the 19th century. Compared to <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and <a href="horse%20racing">horse racing</a>, football was viewed as a minor "amusement" at the time, and while little is known about these early one-off games, it is clear they share no causal link with Australian football. In 1858, in a move that would help to shape Australian football in its formative years, public schools in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> began organising football games inspired by <a href="English%20public%20school%20football%20games">precedents at English public schools</a>. The earliest such match, held in <a href="St%20Kilda%2C%20Victoria">St Kilda</a> on 15 June, was between <a href="Melbourne%20Grammar%20School">Melbourne Grammar</a> and St Kilda Grammar.

On 10 July 1858, the Melbourne-based "<a href="Bell%27s%20Life%20in%20Victoria%20and%20Sporting%20Chronicle">Bell's Life in Victoria and Sporting Chronicle</a>" published a letter by <a href="Tom%20Wills">Tom Wills</a>, captain of the <a href="Victoria%20cricket%20team">Victoria cricket team</a>, calling for the formation of a "foot-ball club" with a "code of laws" to keep cricketers fit during winter. Born in Australia, Wills played a nascent form of <a href="rugby%20football">rugby football</a> whilst a pupil at <a href="Rugby%20School">Rugby School</a> in England, and returned to his homeland a star athlete and cricketer. His letter is regarded by many historians as giving impetus for the development of a new code of football today known as Australian football. Two weeks later, Wills' friend, cricketer <a href="James%20Bryant%20%28Australian%20cricketer%29">Jerry Bryant</a>, posted an advertisement for a <a href="scratch%20match">scratch match</a> at the <a href="Richmond%20Paddock">Richmond Paddock</a> adjoining the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> (MCG). This was the first of several "kickabouts" held that year involving members of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>, including Wills, Bryant, <a href="William%20Hammersley">W. J. Hammersley</a> and <a href="J.%20B.%20Thompson">J. B. Thompson</a>. Trees were used as goalposts and play typically lasted an entire afternoon. Without an agreed upon code of laws, some players were guided by rules they had learned in the British Isles, "others by no rules at all".

Another significant milestone in 1858 was a match played under experimental rules between Melbourne Grammar and <a href="Scotch%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Scotch College</a>, held at the Richmond Paddock. This 40-a-side contest, umpired by Wills and Scotch College teacher <a href="John%20Macadam">John Macadam</a>, began on 7 August and continued over two subsequent Saturdays, ending in a draw with each side kicking one goal. It is commemorated with a statue outside the MCG, and the two schools have competed annually ever since in the <a href="Cordner-Eggleston%20Cup">Cordner-Eggleston Cup</a>, the world's <a href="oldest%20football%20competitions">oldest continuous football competition</a>.

Since the early 20th century, it has been suggested that Australian football was derived from the Irish sport of <a href="Gaelic%20football">Gaelic football</a>, which was not codified until 1885. There is no archival evidence in favour of a Gaelic influence, and the style of play shared between the two modern codes was evident in Australia long before the Irish game evolved in a similar direction. Another theory, first proposed in 1983, posits that Wills, having grown up amongst <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Aborigines</a> in Victoria, may have seen or played the Aboriginal game of <a href="Marn%20Grook">Marn Grook</a>, and incorporated some of its features into early Australian football. This evidence for this is only circumstantial, and according to biographer Greg de Moore's research, Wills was "almost solely influenced by his experience at Rugby School".

A loosely organised Melbourne side, captained by Wills, played against other football enthusiasts in the winter and spring of 1858. The following year, on 14 May, the <a href="Melbourne%20Football%20Club">Melbourne Football Club</a> officially came into being, making it one of the world's <a href="oldest%20football%20clubs">oldest football clubs</a>. Three days later, Wills, Hammersley, Thompson and teacher <a href="Thomas%20H.%20Smith">Thomas H. Smith</a> met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, and drafted ten rules: <a href="Melbourne%20rules%23Melbourne%20Rules%20of%201859">"The Rules of the Melbourne Football Club"</a>. These are the laws from which Australian football evolved. The document was signed by the rule-framers and three other club office bearers: Alex Bruce, T. Butterworth and J. Sewell. The club's stated aim was to create a simple code that was suited to the hard playing surfaces around Melbourne, and to eliminate the roughest aspects of English school games—such as "hacking" (shin-kicking) in Rugby School football—to lessen the chance of injuries to working men. In another significant departure from English public school football, the Melbourne rules omitted any <a href="offside%20%28sport%29">offside law</a>. "The new code was as much a reaction against the school games as influenced by them", writes Mark Pennings.

The rules were distributed throughout the colony; Thompson in particular did much to promote the new code in his capacity as a journalist. Australian football's date of codification predates that of any other major football code, including <a href="association%20football">soccer</a> (codified in 1863) and <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> (codified in 1871).

Following Melbourne's lead, <a href="Geelong%20Football%20Club">Geelong</a> and <a href="Melbourne%20University%20Football%20Club">Melbourne University</a> also formed football clubs in 1859. While many early Victorian teams participated in one-off matches, most had not yet formed clubs for regular competition. A <a href="South%20Yarra%2C%20Victoria">South Yarra</a> side devised its own rules. To ensure the supremacy of the Melbourne rules, the first-club level competition in Australia, the Caledonian Society's <a href="Challenge%20Cup%20%28Australia%29">Challenge Cup</a> (1861–64), stipulated that only the Melbourne rules were to be used. This law was reinforced by the Athletic Sports Committee (ASC), which ran a variation of the Challenge Cup in 1865–66. With input from other clubs, the rules underwent several minor revisions, establishing a uniform code known as "Victorian rules". In 1866, the "first distinctively Victorian rule", the <a href="running%20bounce">running bounce</a>, was formalised at a meeting of club delegates chaired by <a href="H.%20C.%20A.%20Harrison">H. C. A. Harrison</a>, an influential pioneer who took up football in 1859 at the invitation of Wills, his cousin.

The game around this time was defensive and low-scoring, played low to the ground in congested rugby-style scrimmages. The typical match was a 20-per-side affair, played with a ball that was roughly spherical, and lasted until a team scored two goals. The shape of the playing field was not standardised; matches often took place in rough, tree-spotted public parks, most notably the Richmond Paddock (<a href="Yarra%20Park">Yarra Park</a>), known colloquially as the Melbourne Football Ground. Wills argued that the turf of cricket fields would benefit from being trampled upon by footballers in winter, and, as early as 1859, football was allowed on the MCG. However, cricket authorities frequently prohibited football on their grounds until the 1870s, when they saw an opportunity to capitalise on the sport's growing popularity. Football gradually adapted to an oval-shaped field, and most grounds in Victoria expanded to accommodate the dual purpose—a situation that continues to this day.

As "Victorian rules" gained roots in other Australasian colonies—beginning with <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20South%20Australia">South Australia</a> (1860), <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20Tasmania">Tasmania</a> (1864), <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20Queensland">Queensland</a> (1866), and <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> (1871)—it came to be known as "Australian rules" or "Australasian rules". In 1877, the sport's first <a href="sports%20governing%20body">governing bodies</a>, the <a href="SANFL">South Australian Football Association</a> (SAFA) and the <a href="Victorian%20Football%20League">Victorian Football Association</a> (VFA), formed on 30 April and 17 May respectively. The game was introduced to <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in 1877 and <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> in 1881, where it took hold during <a href="Western%20Australian%20gold%20rush">the colony's gold rushes</a>.

By the 1880s, Australian football had become the prevailing football code in Australia's southern and western colonies, and experienced a period of dominance in Queensland, where, like in areas of New South Wales, it struggled to thrive, largely due to the spread of <a href="rugby%20football">rugby football</a>, <a href="Australian%20regional%20rivalries">regional rivalries</a> and the lack of strong local governing bodies. In the case of <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, denial of access to grounds, the influence of university headmasters from Britain who favoured rugby, and the loss of players to other codes inhibited the game's growth.

In 1879, the first <a href="interstate%20matches%20in%20Australian%20rules%20football">intercolonial match</a> took place in Melbourne between <a href="Victoria%20Australian%20rules%20football%20team">Victoria</a> and <a href="South%20Australia%20Australian%20rules%20football%20team">South Australia</a>, and clubs began touring the colonies. By this stage, the sport had become the first code of football to develop mass spectator appeal, with important matches drawing world record attendances for sports viewing. New rules such as <a href="holding%20the%20ball">holding the ball</a> led to a "golden era" of fast, long-kicking and <a href="spectacular%20mark">high-marking</a> football in the 1880s, a time which also saw the rise of <a href="professional%20sports">professionalism</a>, particularly in Western Australia and Victoria, and players such as <a href="George%20Coulthard">George Coulthard</a> achieve superstardom. Australian football was now widely referred to as "the people's game".

In 1896, delegates from six of the wealthiest VFA clubs—<a href="Carlton%20Football%20Club">Carlton</a>, <a href="Essendon%20Football%20Club">Essendon</a>, <a href="Fitzroy%20Football%20Club">Fitzroy</a>, Geelong, Melbourne and <a href="Sydney%20Swans">South Melbourne</a>—met to discuss the formation of a breakaway professional competition. Later joined by <a href="Collingwood%20Football%20Club">Collingwood</a> and <a href="St%20Kilda%20Football%20Club">St Kilda</a>, the clubs formed the <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Victorian Football League</a> (VFL), which held <a href="1897%20VFL%20season">its inaugural season in 1897</a>. The VFL's popularity grew rapidly as it made several innovations, such as instituting a finals system, reducing teams from 20 to 18 players, and introducing the <a href="Laws%20of%20Australian%20rules%20football%23Scoring">behind</a> as a score. <a href="Richmond%20Football%20Club">Richmond</a> and University joined the VFL in 1908, and by 1925, with the addition of <a href="Hawthorn%20Football%20Club">Hawthorn</a>, <a href="Western%20Bulldogs">Footscray</a> and <a href="North%20Melbourne%20Football%20Club">North Melbourne</a>, it had become the preeminent league in the country and would take a leading role in many aspects of the sport.

Both World War I and World War II had a devastating effect on Australian football and on Australian sport in general. While scratch matches were played by Australian "<a href="digger%20%28soldier%29">diggers</a>" in remote locations around the world, the game lost many of its great players to wartime service. Some clubs and competitions never fully recovered. Between 1914 and 1915, <a href="Universal%20football">a proposed hybrid code</a> of Australian football and <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>, the predominant code of football in New South Wales and Queensland, was trialed without success. World War I saw the game in New Zealand go into recess for three quarters of a century. In Queensland, the state league went into recess for the duration of the war. VFL club University left the league and went into recess due to severe casualties. The WAFL lost two clubs and the SANFL was suspended for one year in 1916 due to heavy club losses. <a href="The%20ANZAC%20Day%20clash">The ANZAC Day clash</a> is one example of how the war continues to be remembered in the football community.

The role of the <a href="Australian%20National%20Football%20Council">Australian National Football Council</a> (ANFC) was primarily to govern the game at a national level and to facilitate interstate representative and club competition. The ANFC ran the <a href="Championship%20of%20Australia">Championship of Australia</a>, the first national club competition, which commenced in 1888 and saw clubs from different states compete on an even playing field. Although clubs from other states were at times invited, the final was almost always between the premiers from the two strongest state competitions of the time—South Australia and Victoria—and the majority of matches were played in Adelaide at the request of the <a href="South%20Australian%20National%20Football%20League">SAFA/SAFL</a>. The last match was played in 1976, with <a href="North%20Adelaide%20Football%20Club">North Adelaide</a> being the last non-Victorian winner in 1972. Between 1976 and 1987, the ANFC, and later the Australian Football Championships (AFC) ran a <a href="Australian%20Football%20Championships%20Night%20Series">night series</a>, which invited clubs and representative sides from around the country to participate in a knock-out tournament parallel to the premiership seasons, which Victorian sides still dominated.

With the lack of international competition, state representative matches were regarded with great importance. The Australian Football Council co-ordinated regular interstate carnivals, including the <a href="1908%20Melbourne%20Carnival">Australasian Football Jubilee</a>, held in Melbourne in 1908 to celebrate the game's bicentenary. Due in part to the VFL poaching talent from other states, Victoria dominated interstate matches for three quarters of a century. <a href="Interstate%20matches%20in%20Australian%20rules%20football%23State%20of%20origin">State of Origin</a> rules, introduced in 1977, stipulated that rather than representing the state of their adopted club, players would return to play for the state they were first recruited in. This instantly broke Victoria's stranglehold over state titles and Western Australia and South Australia began to win more of their games against Victoria. Both New South Wales and Tasmania scored surprise victories at home against Victoria in 1990.

The term "<a href="Barassi%20Line">Barassi Line</a>", named after VFL star <a href="Ron%20Barassi">Ron Barassi</a>, was coined by scholar Ian Turner in 1978 to describe the "fictitious geographical barrier" separating large parts of New South Wales and Queensland which predominately followed rugby from the rest of the country, where Australian football reigned. It became a reference point for the expansion of Australian football and for establishing a national league.

The way the game was played had changed dramatically due to innovative coaching tactics, with the phasing out of many of the game's kicking styles and the increasing use of handball; while presentation was influenced by television.

In 1982, in a move that heralded big changes within the sport, one of the original VFL clubs, South Melbourne, relocated to Sydney and became known as the <a href="Sydney%20Swans">Sydney Swans</a>. In the late 1980s, due to the poor financial standing of many of the Victorian clubs, the VFL pursued a more national competition. Two more non-Victorian clubs, <a href="West%20Coast%20Eagles">West Coast</a> and <a href="Brisbane%20Bears%20Football%20Club">Brisbane</a>, joined the league in 1987. In their early years, the Sydney and Brisbane clubs struggled both on and off-field because the substantial TV revenues they generated by playing on a Sunday went to the VFL. To protect these revenues the VFL granted significant draft concessions and financial aid to keep the expansion clubs competitive. Each club was required to pay a licence fee which allowed the Victorian-based clubs to survive.

The VFL changed its name to the <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Australian Football League</a> (AFL) for the <a href="1990%20AFL%20season">1990 season</a>, and over the next decade, three non-Victorian clubs gained entry: <a href="Adelaide%20Football%20Club">Adelaide</a> (1991), <a href="Fremantle%20Football%20Club">Fremantle</a> (1995) and the SANFL's <a href="Port%20Adelaide%20Football%20Club">Port Adelaide</a> (1997), the only pre-existing club outside Victoria to join the league. In 2011 and 2012 respectively, two new non-Victorian clubs were added to the competition: <a href="Gold%20Coast%20Football%20Club">Gold Coast</a> and <a href="Greater%20Western%20Sydney%20Giants">Greater Western Sydney</a>. The AFL, currently with 18 member clubs, is the sport's elite competition and most powerful body. Following the emergence of the AFL, state leagues were quickly relegated to a second-tier status. The VFA merged with the former VFL reserves competition in 1998, adopting the VFL name. State of Origin also declined in importance, especially after an increasing number of player withdrawals. The AFL turned its focus to the annual <a href="International%20Rules%20Series">International Rules Series</a> against Ireland in 1998 before abolishing State of Origin the following year. State and territorial leagues still contest interstate matches, as do AFL Women players.

Although a <a href="Tasmanian%20AFL%20bid">Tasmanian AFL bid</a> is ongoing, the AFL's focus has been on expanding into markets outside Australian football's traditional heartlands. The AFL regularly schedules pre-season exhibition matches in all Australian states and territories as part of the <a href="Regional%20Challenge">Regional Challenge</a>. The AFL signalled further attempts at expansion in the 2010s by hosting home-and-away matches in New Zealand, followed by China.

Australian rules football playing fields have no fixed dimensions but at senior level are typically between 135 and 185 metres long and 110 and 155 metres wide wing-to-wing. The field, like the ball, is oval-shaped, and in Australia, <a href="cricket%20ground">cricket ground</a>s are often used. No more than 18 players of each team are permitted to be on the field at any time.

Up to four <a href="Interchange%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">interchange</a> (reserve) players may be swapped for those on the field at any time during the game. In <a href="Glossary%20of%20Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules terminology</a>, these players wait for substitution "on the bench"—an area with a row of seats on the sideline. Players must interchange through a designated interchange "gate" with strict penalties for too many players from one team on the field. In addition, some leagues like the AFL have each team designate one player as a substitute who can be used to make a single permanent exchange of players during a game.

There is no <a href="offside%20%28sport%29">offside rule</a> nor are there set positions in the rules; unlike many other forms of football, players from both teams may disperse across the whole field before the start of play. However, a typical on-field structure consists of six <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20positions%23Full%20forward">forwards</a>, six <a href="Fullback%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">defenders</a> or "backmen" and six <a href="Midfielder%20%28Australian%20Rules%29">midfielders</a>, usually two <a href="Centre%20line%20%28football%29">wingmen</a>, one <a href="Centre%20line%20%28football%29">centre</a> and three <a href="Follower%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">followers</a>, including a <a href="Ruckman%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%20position%29">ruckman</a>, <a href="Follower%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">ruck-rover</a> and <a href="Follower%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">rover</a>. Only four players from each team are allowed within the centre square () at every centre bounce, which occurs at the commencement of each quarter, and to restart the game after a goal is scored. There are also other rules pertaining to allowed player positions during set plays (that is, after a mark or free kick) and during kick-ins following the scoring of a behind.

A game consists of four quarters and a timekeeper officiates their duration. At the professional level, each quarter consist of 20 minutes of play, with the clock being stopped for instances such as scores, the ball going out of bounds or at the umpire's discretion, e.g. for serious injury. Lower grades of competition might employ shorter quarters of play. The umpire signals "time-off" to stop the clock for various reasons, such as the player in possession being tackled into stagnant play. Time resumes when the umpire signals "time-on" or when the ball is brought into play. Stoppages cause quarters to extend approximately 5–10 minutes beyond the 20 minutes of play. 6 minutes of rest is allowed before the second and fourth quarters, and 20 minutes of rest is allowed at "half-time".

The official game clock is available only to the timekeeper(s), and is not displayed to the players, umpires or spectators. The only public knowledge of game time is when the timekeeper sounds a siren at the start and end of each quarter. Coaching staff may monitor the game time themselves and convey information to players via on-field trainers or substitute players. Broadcasters usually display an approximation of the official game time for television audiences, although some will now show the exact time remaining in a quarter. 

Games are officiated by <a href="umpire%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">umpires</a>. Before the game, the winner of a <a href="coin%20toss">coin toss</a> determines which directions the teams will play to begin. Australian football begins after the first <a href="siren%20%28noisemaker%29">siren</a>, when the umpire <a href="Ball-up">bounces the ball on the ground</a> (or throws it into the air if the condition of the ground is poor), and the two <a href="Ruckman%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%20position%29">ruckmen</a> (typically the tallest players from each team) battle for the ball in the air on its way back down. This is known as the "ball-up". Certain disputes during play may also be settled with a "ball-up" from the point of contention. If the ball is kicked or hit from a ball-up or boundary throw-in over the boundary line or into a behind post without the ball bouncing, a free kick is paid for <a href="Out%20of%20bounds%23Australian%20rules%20football">out of bounds on the full</a>. A free kick is also paid if the ball is deemed by the umpire to have been <a href="Deliberate%20out%20of%20bounds">deliberately carried or directed out of bounds</a>. If the ball travels out of bounds in any other circumstances (for example, contested play results in the ball being knocked out of bounds) a boundary umpire will stand with his back to the infield and return the ball into play with a "throw-in", a high backwards toss back into the field of play.

The ball can be propelled in any direction by way of a foot, clenched fist (called a <a href="handball%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">handball</a> or "handpass") or open-hand tap but it cannot be thrown under any circumstances. Once a player takes possession of the ball he must dispose of it by either kicking or handballing it. Any other method of disposal is illegal and will result in a <a href="Free%20kick%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">free kick</a> to the opposing team. This is usually called "incorrect disposal", "dropping the ball" or "throwing". If the ball is not in the possession of one player it can be moved on with any part of the body.

A player may run with the ball, but it must be <a href="Running%20bounce">bounced or touched on the ground</a> at least once every 15 metres. Opposition players may <a href="Shepherding%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">bump</a> or <a href="tackle%20%28football%20move%29">tackle</a> the player to obtain the ball and, when tackled, the player must dispose of the ball cleanly or risk being penalised for <a href="holding%20the%20ball">holding the ball</a>. The ball carrier may only be tackled between the shoulders and knees. If the opposition player forcefully contacts a player in the back while performing a tackle, the opposition player will be penalised for a <a href="push%20in%20the%20back">push in the back</a>. If the opposition tackles the player with possession below the knees (a "low tackle" or a "trip") or above the shoulders (a "high tackle"), the team with possession of the football gets a free kick.

If a player takes possession of the ball that has travelled more than from another player's kick, by way of a catch, it is claimed as a "<a href="mark%20%28Australian%20football%29">mark</a>" (meaning that the game stops while he prepares to kick from the point at which he marked). Alternatively, he may choose to "play on" forfeiting the set shot in the hope of pressing an advantage for his team (rather than allowing the opposition to reposition while he prepares for the free kick). Once a player has chosen to play on, normal play resumes and the player who took the mark is again able to be tackled.

There are different <a href="kick%20%28football%29">styles of kicking</a> depending on how the ball is held in the hand. The most common style of kicking seen in today's game, principally because of its superior accuracy, is the <a href="drop%20punt">drop punt</a>, where the ball is dropped from the hands down, almost to the ground, to be kicked so that the ball rotates in a reverse end over end motion as it travels through the air. Other commonly used kicks are the <a href="torpedo%20punt">torpedo punt</a> (also known as the spiral, barrel, or screw punt), where the ball is held flatter at an angle across the body, which makes the ball spin around its long axis in the air, resulting in extra distance (similar to the traditional motion of an <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">American football punt</a>), and the <a href="checkside%20punt">checkside punt</a> or "banana", kicked across the ball with the outside of the foot used to curve the ball (towards the right if kicked off the right foot) towards targets that are on an angle. There is also the "snap", which is almost the same as a checkside punt except that it is kicked off the inside of the foot and curves in the opposite direction. It is also possible to kick the ball so that it bounces along the ground. This is known as a "grubber". Grubbers can bounce in a straight line, or curve to the left or right.

Apart from free kicks, marks or when the ball is in the possession of an umpire for a "ball up" or "throw in", the ball is always in dispute and any player from either side can take possession of the ball.

A "goal", worth 6 points, is scored when the football is propelled through the goal posts at any height (including above the height of the posts) by way of a kick from the attacking team. It may fly through "on the full" (without touching the ground) or bounce through, but must not have been touched, on the way, by any player from either team. A goal cannot be scored from the foot of an opposition (defending) player.

A "behind", worth 1 point, is scored when the ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if any player sends the ball between the goal posts by touching it with any part of the body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including his foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort to ensure that a goal is not scored) this is termed a <a href="rushed%20behind">rushed behind</a>. As of the <a href="2009%20AFL%20season">2009 AFL season</a>, a free kick is awarded against any player who deliberately rushes a behind.

The <a href="Umpire%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29">goal umpire</a> signals a goal with two hands pointed forward at elbow height, or a behind with one hand. The goal umpire then waves flags above their heads to confirm the goal or behind to the goal umpire at the opposite end of the ground.

The team that has scored the most points at the end of play wins the game. If the scores are level on points at the end of play, then the game is a draw; extra time applies only during finals matches in some competitions.

As an example of a score report, consider a match between and with the former as the home team. Essendon's score of 11 goals and 14 behinds equates to 80 points. Melbourne's score of 10 goals and 7 behinds equates to a 67-point tally. Essendon wins the match by a margin of 13 points. Such a result would be written as:

And spoken as:

Additionally, it can be said that:

The home team is typically listed first and the visiting side is listed second. The scoreline is written with respect to the home side.

For example, won in successive weeks, once as the home side and once as the visiting side. These would be written out thus:

A draw would be written as:

The "football season" proper is from March to August (early autumn to late winter in Australia) with finals being held in September and October. In the <a href="tropics">tropics</a>, the game is sometimes played in the <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a> (October to March). Pre-season competitions in <a href="southern%20Australia">southern Australia</a> usually begin in late February.

The AFL is recognised by the <a href="Australian%20Sports%20Commission">Australian Sports Commission</a> as being the National Sporting Organisation for Australian Football. There are also seven state/territory-based organisations in Australia, most of which are now either owned by or affiliated to the AFL. Most of these hold annual semi-professional club competitions while the others oversee more than one league. Local semi-professional or amateur organisations and competitions are often affiliated to their state organisations.

The AFL is the "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" world governing body for Australian football. There are also a number of affiliated organisations governing <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20rules%20football%20leagues%20outside%20Australia">amateur clubs and competitions around the world</a>.

For almost all Australian football club competitions the aim is to win the "Premiership". The premiership is always decided by a "finals series". The teams that occupy the highest positions on the "ladder" after the "home-and-away" season play off in a "semi-knockout" finals series, culminating in a single <a href="Grand%20Final">Grand Final</a> match to determine the premiers. Typically between four and eight teams contest the finals series. The team which finishes first on the ladder after the home-and-away season is referred to as a "<a href="minor%20premier">minor premier</a>", but this usually holds little stand-alone significance, other than receiving a better draw in the finals.

Many suburban and amateur leagues have a sufficient number of teams to be played across several tiered divisions, with <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> of the lower division premiers and <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a> of the upper division's last placed team at the end of each year. At present, none of the top level national or state level leagues in Australia are large enough to warrant this structure.

The level of interest shown by women in Australian football is considered unique among the world's football codes. It was the case in the 19th-century, as it is in modern times, that women made up approximately half of crowds at Australian football matches—a far greater proportion than soccer and the two rugby codes. This has been attributed in part to the <a href="egalitarian">egalitarian</a> character of Australian football's origins in public parks where women could mingle freely and support the game in various ways.

In 2016, over 380,000 women played in organised games across Australia. The <a href="AFL%20Women%27s%20National%20Championships">AFL Women's National Championships</a> is women's football's state of origin competition. On the back of the inaugural AFL Women's Draft in 2013 and a series of exhibition matches at the MCG, the AFL stated that, by 2020, it would like to establish <a href="AFL%20Women%27s">AFL Women's</a>, a semi-professional, nationally televised women's league. A surge in viewing interest and participation in women's football prompted the AFL to push the founding date of the competition to 2017.

Many related games have emerged from Australian football, mainly with variations of contact to encourage greater participation. These include <a href="Auskick">Auskick</a> (played by children aged between 5 and 12), <a href="kick-to-kick">kick-to-kick</a> (and its variants <a href="Kick-to-kick%23End-to-end%20footy">end-to-end footy</a> and <a href="Kick-to-kick%23Marks%20up.2C%20King%20of%20the%20pack%20and%20Points%20Up.2C%20Jack%20in%20the%20Pack.2C%20No%20Torps">marks up</a>), <a href="rec%20footy">rec footy</a>, <a href="9-a-side%20footy">9-a-side footy</a>, <a href="masters%20Australian%20football">masters Australian football</a>, handball and longest-kick competitions. Players outside of Australia sometimes engage in related games adapted to available fields, like <a href="metro%20footy">metro footy</a> (played on gridiron fields) and <a href="Samoa%20rules">Samoa rules</a> (played on rugby fields).

The similarities between Australian football and the Irish sport of <a href="Gaelic%20football">Gaelic football</a> have allowed for the creation of a <a href="hybrid%20sport">hybrid code</a> known as <a href="international%20rules%20football">international rules football</a>. The first international rules matches were contested in Ireland during the 1967 <a href="Australian%20Football%20World%20Tour">Australian Football World Tour</a>. Since then, various sets of compromise rules have been trialed, and in 1984 the <a href="International%20Rules%20Series">International Rules Series</a> commenced with national representative sides selected by Australia's state leagues (later by the AFL) and the <a href="Gaelic%20Athletic%20Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> (GAA). The competition became an annual event in 1998, but was postponed indefinitely in 2007 when the GAA pulled out due to Australia's severe and aggressive style of play. It resumed in Australia in 2008 under new rules to protect the player with the ball.

Australian football is played at an amateur level in <a href="Countries%20playing%20Australian%20rules%20football">various countries</a> throughout the world. Twenty countries participated in the <a href="EU%20Cup">Euro Cup</a> and 23 countries have participated in the <a href="Australian%20Football%20International%20Cup">International Cup</a> with both competitions prohibiting Australian players. Over 20 countries have either affiliation or working agreements with the AFL. There have been many <a href="List%20of%20overseas-born%20AFL%20players">VFL/AFL players who were born outside Australia</a>, an increasing number of which have been recruited through initiatives such as the <a href="Irish%20experiment">Irish experiment</a> and more recently, international scholarship programs.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the game spread with the <a href="Australian%20diaspora">Australian diaspora</a> to areas such as New Zealand and South Africa; however this growth went into rapid decline following World War I. After World War II, the sport experienced a small amount of growth in the Pacific region, particularly in <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20Nauru">Nauru</a> (where Australian football is the <a href="national%20sport">national sport</a>) as well as <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> and <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

Most of the current amateur clubs and leagues in existence have developed since the 1980s, when leagues began to be established in <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20the%20Americas">North America</a>, <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20Asia">Asia</a>. The sport developed a cult following in the <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States</a> when matches were broadcast on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> in the late 1980s. As the size of the Australian diaspora has increased, so has the number of clubs outside Australia. This expansion has been further <a href="List%20of%20overseas-born%20AFL%20players">aided by multiculturalism</a> and assisted by <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20exhibition%20matches">exhibition matches</a> as well as exposure generated through <a href="players%20who%20have%20converted%20from%20one%20football%20code%20to%20another">players who have converted to and from other football codes</a>. In Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and the United States there are many thousands of players.

A fan of the sport since attending school in Geelong, <a href="Prince%20Charles">Prince Charles</a> is the Patron of <a href="AFL%20Europe">AFL Europe</a>. In 2013, participation across AFL Europe's 21 member nations was more than 5,000 players, the majority of which are European nationals rather than Australian expats. The sport also has a growing presence in India.

The AFL became the de facto governing body when it pushed for the closure of the <a href="International%20Australian%20Football%20Council">International Australian Football Council</a> in 2002. The <a href="Australian%20Football%20International%20Cup">Australian Football International Cup</a>, held triennially in Melbourne since 2002, is the highest level of international competition.

Australian football is a sport rich in tradition and <a href="Australian%20culture">Australian cultural</a> references, especially surrounding the rituals of gameday for players, officials and supporters.

Australian football has been an inspiration for writers and poets including <a href="Manning%20Clarke">Manning Clarke</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Dawe">Bruce Dawe</a> and <a href="Philip%20Hodgins">Philip Hodgins</a>. Paintings by <a href="Arthur%20Streeton">Arthur Streeton</a> ("The National Game", 1889) and <a href="Sidney%20Nolan">Sidney Nolan</a> ("<a href="Footballer%20%28painting%29">Footballer</a>", 1946) helped to establish Australian football as a serious subject for artists. Many <a href="contemporary%20Indigenous%20Australian%20art">Aboriginal artists</a> have explored the game, often fusing it with the mythology of their region. <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20rules%20football%20statues">Statues of Australian football identities</a> can be found throughout the country. In cartooning, <a href="William%20Ellis%20Green">WEG</a>'s VFL/AFL premiership posters—inaugurated in 1954—have achieved iconic status among Australian football fans. Dance sequences based on Australian football feature heavily in <a href="Robert%20Helpmann">Robert Helpmann</a>'s 1964 ballet "<a href="The%20Display">The Display</a>", his first and most famous work for the <a href="Australian%20Ballet">Australian Ballet</a>. The game has also inspired well-known plays such as "<a href="And%20the%20Big%20Men%20Fly">And the Big Men Fly</a>" (1963) by <a href="Alan%20Hopgood">Alan Hopgood</a> and <a href="David%20Williamson">David Williamson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Club%20%28play%29">The Club</a>" (1977), which was <a href="The%20Club%20%281980%20film%29">adapted into a 1980 film</a>, directed by <a href="Bruce%20Beresford">Bruce Beresford</a>. <a href="Mike%20Brady%20%28musician%29">Mike Brady</a>'s 1979 hit "<a href="Up%20There%20Cazaly">Up There Cazaly</a>" is considered an Australian football anthem, and references to the sport can be found in works by popular musicians, from singer-songwriter <a href="Paul%20Kelly%20%28Australian%20musician%29">Paul Kelly</a> to the alternative rock band <a href="TISM">TISM</a>. Many <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20rules%20football%20video%20games">Australian football video games</a> have been released, most notably the <a href="AFL%20%28video%20game%20series%29">AFL series</a>.
Australian football has attracted more overall interest among Australians (as measured by the Sweeney Sports report) than any other football code, and, when compared with all sports throughout the nation, has consistently ranked first in the winter reports, and most recently third behind <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and <a href="swimming%20%28sport%29">swimming</a> in summer. Over 875,000 fans were paying members of AFL clubs in 2016, which is equal to one in every 28 Australians. The <a href="2016%20AFL%20Grand%20Final">2016 AFL Grand Final</a> was the year's most-watched television broadcast in Australia, with an in-home audience of up to 6.5 million watching the match.

In 2006, 615,549 registered participants played Australian football in Australia. Participation increased 7.84% between 2005 and 2006. The <a href="Australian%20Sports%20Commission">Australian Sports Commission</a> statistics show a 64% increase in the total number of participants over the 10-year period between 2001 and 2010. In 2008 there were 35,000 people in 32 countries playing in structured competitions of Australian football outside of Australia.

For the centenary of the VFL/AFL in 1996, the Australian Football Hall of Fame was established. In that year 136 identities were inducted, including 100 players, 10 coaches, 10 umpires, 10 administrators and six media representatives.

The elite "<a href="Australian%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame%23Legends">Legend</a>" status was bestowed on 12 members of the Hall of Fame in 1996: <a href="Ron%20Barassi">Ron Barassi</a>, <a href="Haydn%20Bunton%20Sr.">Haydn Bunton Sr.</a>, <a href="Roy%20Cazaly">Roy Cazaly</a>, <a href="John%20Coleman%20%28Australian%20footballer%29">John Coleman</a>, <a href="Jack%20Dyer">Jack Dyer</a>, <a href="Polly%20Farmer">Polly Farmer</a>, <a href="Leigh%20Matthews">Leigh Matthews</a>, <a href="John%20Nicholls%20%28footballer%29">John Nicholls</a>, <a href="Bob%20Pratt">Bob Pratt</a>, <a href="Dick%20Reynolds">Dick Reynolds</a>, <a href="Bob%20Skilton">Bob Skilton</a> and <a href="Ted%20Whitten">Ted Whitten</a>. The "Legend" status is the highest honour which can be bestowed on an Australian footballer.

Aon (company)

Aon plc is a global professional services firm that provides risk, retirement and health consulting. Aon has approximately 500 offices worldwide, serving 120 countries with 50,000 employees.

In 2011, Aon was ranked as the largest insurance broker in the world based on revenue. Aon was the principal partner and global shirt sponsor of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> team <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United F.C.</a> from 2010 until 2014.

Aon was created in 1982 when the Ryan Insurance Group merged with the <a href="Combined%20Insurance">Combined Insurance Company of America</a>. In 1987, that company was renamed Aon, a <a href="Goidelic%20languages">Gaelic</a> word meaning [one].

In January 2012, Aon announced that its headquarters would be moved to London.

W. Clement Stone's mother bought a small Detroit insurance agency, and in 1918 brought her son into the business. Mr. Stone sold low-cost, low-benefit accident insurance, underwriting and issuing policies on-site. The next year he founded his own agency, the Combined Registry Co.

As the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> began, Stone reduced his workforce and improved training. Forced by his son's respiratory illness to winter in the South, Stone moved to Arkansas and Texas. In 1939 he bought <a href="American%20Casualty%20Insurance%20Co.">American Casualty Insurance Co.</a> of Dallas, Texas. It was consolidated with other purchases as the <a href="Combined%20Insurance">Combined Insurance Co. of America</a> in 1947. The company continued through the 1950s and 1960s, continuing to sell health and accident policies. In the 1970s, Combined expanded overseas despite being hit hard by the recession.

In 1982, after 10 years of stagnation under Clement Stone Jr., the elder Stone, then 79, resumed control until the completion of a <a href="merger">merger</a> with Ryan Insurance Co. allowed him to transfer control to <a href="Pat%20Ryan%20%28executive%29">Patrick Ryan</a>. Ryan, the son of a Ford dealer in Wisconsin, had started his company as an auto credit insurer in 1964. In 1976, the company bought the insurance brokerage units of the <a href="Esmark">Esmark</a> conglomerate. Ryan focused on insurance brokering and added more upscale insurance products. He also trimmed staff and took other cost-cutting measures, and in 1987 he changed Combined's name to Aon. In 1992, he bought Dutch insurance broker Hudig-Langeveldt. In 1995, the company sold its remaining direct life insurance holdings to <a href="Genworth%20Financial">General Electric</a> to focus on consulting. The following year, it began offering hostile takeover insurance policies to small and mid-sized companies.

Aon built a global presence through purchases. In 1997, it bought The Minet Group, as well as insurance brokerage Alexander & Alexander Services, Inc. in a deal that made Aon (temporarily) the largest insurance broker worldwide. The firm made no US buys in 1998, but doubled its employee base with purchases including Spain's largest retail insurance broker, Gil y Carvajal, and the formation of Aon Korea, the first non-Korean firm of its kind to be licensed there.

Responding to industry demands, Aon announced its new fee disclosure policy in 1999, and the company reorganised to focus on buying personal line insurance firms and to integrate its acquisitions. That year it bought Nikols Sedgwick Group, an Italian insurance firm, and formed RiskAttack (with <a href="Zurich%20Financial%20Services">Zurich US</a>), a risk analysis and financial management concern aimed at technology companies. The cost of integrating its numerous purchases, however, hammered profits in 1999.

Despite its troubles, in 2000 Aon bought Reliance Group's accident and health insurance business, as well as Actuarial Sciences Associates, a compensation and employee benefits consulting company. Later in that year, however, the company decided to cut 6% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort. In 2003, the company saw revenues increase primarily because of rate hikes in the insurance industry. Also that year, Endurance Specialty, a Bermuda-based underwriting operation that Aon helped to establish in November 2001 along with other investors, went public. The next year Aon sold most of its holdings in Endurance.

In late 2007, Aon announced the divestiture of its underwriting business. With this move, the firm sold off its two major underwriting subsidiaries: Combined Insurance Company of America (acquired by ACE Limited for $2.4 billion) and Sterling Life Insurance Company (purchased by Munich Re Group for $352 million). The low margin and capital-intensive nature of the underwriting industry was the primary reason for the firm's decision to divest. Upon completion of the move, Aon turned its attention to expanding its broking and consulting capabilities.

This growth strategy manifested in November 2008 when Aon announced it had acquired reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor Benfield Group Limited for $1.75 billion. The acquisition amplified the firm's broking capabilities, positioning Aon one of the largest players in the reinsurance brokerage industry.

In 2010, Aon made its most significant acquisition to date with the purchase of Lincolnshire, Illinois-based Hewitt Associates for $4.9 billion. Aside from drastically boosting Aon's human resources consulting capacity and entering the firm into the business process outsourcing industry, the move added 23,000 colleagues and more than $3 billion in revenue.

In 10 February 2017, Aon announced that it is selling its employee benefits outsourcing business to Private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) for US$4.8 billion (£3.8 billion) 

Aon's New York offices were on the 92nd and 98th–105th floors of the <a href="Two%20World%20Trade%20Center%20tenants">South Tower</a> of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973-2001%29">World Trade Center</a> at the time of the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">11 September 2001 terrorist attack</a>. When the North Tower was struck at 8:46 a.m., many executives began evacuating their employees from the upper floors of the South Tower. The evacuation of Aon's offices, ordered by Eric Eisenberg, was carried out quickly as 924 of the estimated 1,100 Aon employees present at the time managed to evacuate the building before <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%20175">United Airlines Flight 175</a> struck it twenty stories below them at 9:03 a.m.

However, many were influenced to stay by security guards and security announcements, or did not exit the building in time. As a result, 176 employees of Aon were killed in the attacks, including Eisenberg and <a href="Kevin%20Cosgrove">Kevin Cosgrove</a>, a vice-president of the company, who made a call to 911 when the tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m.

In 2004–2005, Aon, along with other brokers including <a href="Marsh%20%26amp%3B%20McLennan">Marsh & McLennan</a> and <a href="Willis%20Group%20Holdings">Willis</a>, fell under regulatory investigation under <a href="New%20York%20Attorney%20General">New York Attorney General</a> <a href="Eliot%20Spitzer">Eliot Spitzer</a> and other <a href="State%20attorney%20general">state attorneys general</a>. At issue was the practice of insurance companies' payments to brokers (known as contingent commissions). The payments were thought to bring a conflict of interest, swaying broker decisions on behalf of carriers, rather than customers. In the spring of 2005, without acknowledging any wrongdoing, Aon agreed to a $190 million <a href="Settlement%20%28litigation%29">settlement</a>, payable over 30 months.

In January 2009, Aon was fined £5.25 million in the UK by the Financial Services Authority, who stated that the fine related to the company's inadequate bribery and corruption controls, claiming that between 14 January 2005 and 30 September 2007 Aon had failed to properly assess the risks involved in its dealings with overseas firms and individuals. The Authority did not find that any money had actually made its way to illegal organisations. Aon qualified for a 30% discount on the fine as a result of its co-operation with the investigation. Aon said its conduct was not deliberate, adding it had since "significantly strengthened and enhanced its controls around the usage of third parties".

In December 2011, Aon Corporation paid a $16.26 million penalty to the <a href="US%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) and the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Justice">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) for violations of the US <a href="Foreign%20Corrupt%20Practices%20Act">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a> (FCPA).
According to the SEC, Aon's subsidiaries made improper payments of over $3.6 million to government officials and third-party facilitators in <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> and <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, between 1983 and 2007, to obtain and retain insurance contracts.

On 10 February 2017, Aon announced that it is selling its employee benefits outsourcing business to Private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) for US$4.8 billion (£3.8 billion) 

On 31 October 2016, Aon's Aon Risk Solutions completed acquisition of Stroz Friedberg LLC, a specialised risk management firm focusing on cybersecurity.

On 16 June 2014, Aon announced that it agreed to buy National Flood Services, Inc., a leading processor of flood insurance, from Stoneriver Group, L.P.

On 22 October 2012, Aon announced that it agreed to buy OmniPoint, Inc, a <a href="Workday%2C%20Inc.">Workday</a> consulting firm. Financial terms were not disclosed.

On 19 July 2011, Aon announced that it bought Westfield Financial Corp., the owner of insurance-industry consulting firm Ward Financial Group, from Ohio Farmers Insurance Co. Financial terms were not disclosed.

On 7 April 2011, Aon announced that it had acquired Johannesburg, South Africa-based Glenrand MIB. Financial terms were not disclosed.

On 12 July 2010, Aon announced that it had agreed to buy <a href="Lincolnshire%2C%20Illinois">Lincolnshire, Illinois</a>-based <a href="Hewitt%20Associates">Hewitt Associates</a> for $4.9 billion in cash and stock.

On 5 Mar 2010, <a href="Hewitt%20Associates">Hewitt Associates</a> announced that it acquired Senior Educators Ltd. The acquisition offers companies a new way to address retiree medical insurance commitments.

On 22 August 2008, Aon announced that it had acquired London-based <a href="Benfield%20Group">Benfield Group</a>. The acquiring price was US$1.75 billion or £935 million, with US$170 million of debt.

On February 10, 2017, Aon PLC agreed to sell its human resources outsourcing platform for $4.3 billion to <a href="Blackstone%20Group%20L.P.">Blackstone Group L.P.</a>, creating a new company.

In September 2017, Aon announced its intent to purchase real estate investment management firm The Townsend Group from <a href="Colony%20NorthStar">Colony NorthStar</a> for $475 million, expanding Aon's property investment management portfolio.

On 3 June 2009, it was reported that Aon had signed a four-year shirt sponsorship deal with English <a href="Association%20football">football</a> giant <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. On 1 June 2010, Aon replaced American insurance company <a href="American%20International%20Group">AIG</a> as the principal sponsor of the club. The Aon logo was prominently displayed on the front of the club's shirts until the 2014/2015 season when <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> replaced them. The deal was said to be worth £80 million over four years, replacing United's deal with AIG as the most lucrative shirt deal in history at the time.

In April 2013, Aon signed a new eight-year deal with Manchester United to rename their training ground as the <a href="Trafford%20Training%20Centre">Aon Training Complex</a> and sponsor the club's training kits, reportedly worth £180 million to the club.

Alban Berg

Alban Maria Johannes Berg (; ; February 9, 1885 – December 24, 1935) was an <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n <a href="composer">composer</a> of the <a href="Second%20Viennese%20School">Second Viennese School</a>. His compositional style combined <a href="Romantic%20music">Romantic</a> lyricism with <a href="twelve-tone%20technique">twelve-tone technique</a>.

Berg was born in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, the third of four children of Johanna and Conrad Berg. His family lived comfortably until the death of his father in 1900.

He was more interested in <a href="literature">literature</a> than <a href="music">music</a> as a child and did not begin to compose until he was fifteen, when he started to teach himself music. In late February or early March 1902 he fathered a child with Marie Scheuchl, a servant girl in the Berg family household. His daughter, Albine, was born on December 4, 1902.

Berg had little formal music education before he became a student of <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a> in October 1904. With Schoenberg he studied <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>, <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a>, and <a href="harmony">harmony</a>. By 1906, he was studying music full-time; by 1907, he began <a href="musical%20composition">composition</a> lessons. His student compositions included five drafts for <a href="piano%20sonata">piano sonata</a>s. He also wrote songs, including his "<a href="Seven%20Early%20Songs%20%28Berg%29">Seven Early Songs</a>" ("Sieben Frühe Lieder"), three of which were Berg's first publicly performed work in a concert that featured the music of Schoenberg's pupils in Vienna that year. The early sonata sketches eventually culminated in Berg's <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20%28Berg%29">Piano Sonata</a>, <a href="opus%20number">Op</a>. 1 (1907–1908); it is one of the most formidable "first" works ever written. Berg studied with Schoenberg for six years until 1911. Berg admired him as a composer and mentor, and they remained close lifelong friends.

Among Schoenberg's teaching was the idea that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea; this idea was later known as "developing variation". Berg passed this on to his students, one of whom, <a href="Theodor%20W.%20Adorno">Theodor W. Adorno</a>, stated: "The main principle he conveyed was that of variation: everything was supposed to develop out of something else and yet be intrinsically different". The Piano Sonata is an example—the whole composition is derived from the work's opening <a href="quartal%20and%20quintal%20harmony">quartal</a> gesture and its opening phrase.

Berg was a part of Vienna's cultural elite during the heady "<a href="fin%20de%20si%C3%A8cle">fin de siècle</a>" period. His circle included the musicians <a href="Alexander%20von%20Zemlinsky">Alexander von Zemlinsky</a> and <a href="Franz%20Schreker">Franz Schreker</a>, the painter <a href="Gustav%20Klimt">Gustav Klimt</a>, the writer and satirist <a href="Karl%20Kraus%20%28writer%29">Karl Kraus</a>, the architect <a href="Adolf%20Loos">Adolf Loos</a>, and the poet <a href="Peter%20Altenberg">Peter Altenberg</a>. In 1906, Berg met the singer <a href="Helene%20Nahowski">Helene Nahowski</a>, daughter of a wealthy family (said by some to be in fact the illegitimate daughter of Emperor <a href="Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria">Franz Joseph I of Austria</a> from his liaison with <a href="Anna%20Nahowski">Anna Nahowski</a>); despite the outward hostility of her family, the two were married on May 3, 1911.

In 1913, two of Berg's "<a href="Altenberg%20Lieder">Five Songs on Picture Postcard Texts by Peter Altenberg</a>" (1912) were premièred in Vienna, <a href="conducting">conducted</a> by Schoenberg in the infamous "<a href="Skandalkonzert">Skandalkonzert</a>". Settings of aphoristic poetic utterances, the songs are accompanied by a very large orchestra. The performance caused a riot, and had to be halted. This was a crippling blow to Berg's self-confidence: he effectively withdrew the work, which is surely one of his most innovative and assured first orchestral compositions in the literature, and it was not performed in full until 1952. The full score remained unpublished until 1966.

From 1915 to 1918, Berg served in the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> and during a period of leave in 1917 he accelerated work on his first <a href="opera">opera</a>, "<a href="Wozzeck">Wozzeck</a>". After the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, he settled again in Vienna, where he taught private pupils. He also helped Schoenberg run his <a href="Society%20for%20Private%20Musical%20Performances">Society for Private Musical Performances</a>, which sought to create the ideal environment for the exploration and appreciation of unfamiliar new music by means of open rehearsals, repeat performances, and the exclusion of professional critics.

Berg had a particular interest in the number 23, using it to structure several works. Various suggestions have been made as to the reason for this interest: that he took it from the <a href="Biorhythms">Biorhythms</a> theory of <a href="Wilhelm%20Fliess">Wilhelm Fliess</a>, in which a 23-day cycle is considered significant, or because he first suffered an asthma attack on 23rd of the month.

Three excerpts from "Wozzeck" were performed in 1924, and this brought Berg his first public success. The opera, which Berg completed in 1922, was first performed on December 14, 1925, when <a href="Erich%20Kleiber">Erich Kleiber</a> conducted the first performance in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. Today "Wozzeck" is seen as one of the century's most important works. Berg made a start on his second opera, the three-act "<a href="Lulu%20%28opera%29">Lulu</a>", in 1928 but interrupted the work in 1929 for the concert aria "Der Wein" which he completed that summer. "Der Wein" presaged "Lulu" in a number of ways, including vocal style, orchestration, design and text.

Other well-known Berg compositions include the "<a href="Lyric%20Suite%20%28Berg%29">Lyric Suite</a>" (1926), which was later shown to employ elaborate cyphers to document a secret love affair; the post-Mahlerian "Three Pieces for Orchestra" (completed in 1915 but not performed until after "Wozzeck"); and the <a href="Kammerkonzert%20%28Berg%29">Chamber Concerto</a> ("Kammerkonzert", 1923–25) for violin, piano, and 13 wind instruments: this latter is written so conscientiously that Pierre Boulez has called it "Berg's strictest composition" and it, too, is permeated by cyphers and posthumously disclosed hidden programs.

Life for the musical world was becoming increasingly difficult in the 1930s both in Vienna and Germany due to the rising tide of <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> and the <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> cultural ideology that denounced <a href="modernity">modernity</a>. Even to have an association with someone who was Jewish could lead to denunciation, and Berg's "crime" was to have studied with the Jewish composer <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>. Berg found that opportunities for his work to be performed in Germany were becoming rare, and eventually his music was <a href="proscribed">proscribed</a> and placed on the list of <a href="degenerate%20music">degenerate music</a>. In 1932 Berg and his wife acquired an isolated lodge, the "Waldhaus" on the southern shore of the "<a href="W%C3%B6rthersee">Wörthersee</a>", near <a href="Schiefling%20am%20See">Schiefling am See</a> in <a href="Carinthia">Carinthia</a>, where he was able to work in seclusion, mainly on <a href="Lulu%20%28opera%29">Lulu</a> and the <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Berg%29">Violin Concerto</a>. At the end of 1934 Berg became involved in the political intrigues around finding a replacement for <a href="Clemens%20Krauss">Clemens Krauss</a> as director of the <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Vienna State Opera</a>. As more of the performances of his work in Germany were cancelled by the <a href="Nazis">Nazis</a>, who had come to power in early 1933, he needed to ensure the new director would be an advocate for modernist music. Originally the premiere of Lulu had been planned for the <a href="Berlin%20State%20Opera">Berlin State Opera</a>, where <a href="Erich%20Kleiber">Erich Kleiber</a> continued to champion his music and had conducted the premiere of "Wozzeck" in 1925, but now this was looking increasingly uncertain, and Lulu was rejected by the Berlin authorities in the spring of 1934. Kleiber's production of the Lulu symphonic suite on 30 November 1934 in Berlin was also the occasion of his resignation in protest at the extent of conflation of culture with politics. Even in Vienna, the opportunities for the Vienna School of musicians was dwindling.

Berg had interrupted the orchestration of "Lulu" because of an unexpected (and financially much-needed) commission from the Russian-American violinist <a href="Louis%20Krasner">Louis Krasner</a> for a <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Berg%29">Violin Concerto</a> (1935). This profoundly elegiac work, composed at unaccustomed speed and posthumously premièred, has become Berg's best-known and beloved composition. Like much of his mature work, it employs an idiosyncratic adaptation of Schoenberg's "dodecaphonic" or <a href="twelve-tone%20technique">twelve-tone technique</a>, that enables the composer to produce passages openly evoking tonality, including quotations from historical tonal music, such as a <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> chorale and a <a href="Carinthia%20%28state%29">Carinthian</a> folk song. The Violin Concerto was dedicated "to the memory of an Angel", <a href="Manon%20Gropius">Manon Gropius</a>, the deceased daughter of architect <a href="Walter%20Gropius">Walter Gropius</a> and <a href="Alma%20Mahler">Alma Mahler</a>.

Berg died aged 50 in Vienna, on Christmas Eve 1935, from <a href="blood%20poisoning">blood poisoning</a> apparently caused by an insect-sting-induced <a href="carbuncle">carbuncle</a> on his back that occurred in November.

Berg completed the orchestration of only the first two acts of "Lulu" before he died. The first two acts were successfully premièred in Zürich in 1937, but for personal reasons Helene Berg subsequently imposed a ban on any attempt to "complete" the final act, which Berg had in fact completed in particell (short score) format. An orchestration was therefore commissioned in secret from <a href="Friedrich%20Cerha">Friedrich Cerha</a> and premièred in Paris (under <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a>) only in 1979, soon after Helene Berg's own death. The complete opera has rapidly entered the repertoire as one of the landmarks of contemporary music and, like "Wozzeck", remains a consistent audience draw.

Berg is remembered as one of the most important composers of the 20th century and to date is the most widely performed opera composer among the Second Viennese School. He is considered to have brought more "human values" to the twelve-tone system, his works seen as more "emotional" than Schoenberg's. Critically, he is seen as having preserved the Viennese tradition in his music. His popularity has been more easily secured than many other Modernists since he plausibly combined both Romantic and Expressionist idioms. Though Berg's Romanticism at one time seemed a drawback for some more modernist composers, the Berg scholar Douglas Jarman writes in the <a href="New%20Grove">New Grove</a>: "As the 20th century closed, the 'backward-looking' Berg suddenly came as [George] <a href="George%20Perle">Perle</a> remarked, to look like its most forward-looking composer."

The asteroid <a href="4528%20Berg">4528 Berg</a> is named after him.

Analytical chemistry

Analytical chemistry studies and uses instruments and methods used to <a href="Separation%20process">separate</a>, identify, and <a href="Quantification%20%28science%29">quantify</a> matter. In practice separation, identification or quantification may constitute the entire analysis or be combined with another method. Separation isolates <a href="analyte">analyte</a>s. <a href="Qualitative%20inorganic%20analysis">Qualitative analysis</a> identifies analytes, while <a href="Quantitative%20analysis%20%28chemistry%29">quantitative analysis</a> determines the numerical amount or concentration.

Analytical chemistry consists of classical, <a href="wet%20chemistry">wet chemical methods</a> and modern, <a href="%23instrumental%20methods">instrumental methods</a>. Classical qualitative methods use separations such as <a href="Precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitation</a>, <a href="Extraction%20%28chemistry%29">extraction</a>, and <a href="distillation">distillation</a>. Identification may be based on differences in color, odor, melting point, boiling point, radioactivity or reactivity. Classical quantitative analysis uses mass or volume changes to quantify amount. Instrumental methods may be used to separate samples using <a href="chromatography">chromatography</a>, <a href="electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a> or <a href="field%20flow%20fractionation">field flow fractionation</a>. Then qualitative and quantitative analysis can be performed, often with the same instrument and may use <a href="spectroscopy">light interaction</a>, <a href="thermodynamics">heat interaction</a>, <a href="electrochemistry">electric fields</a> or <a href="Nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance%20spectroscopy">magnetic fields</a> . Often the same instrument can separate, identify and quantify an analyte.

Analytical chemistry is also focused on improvements in <a href="experimental%20design">experimental design</a>, <a href="chemometrics">chemometrics</a>, and the creation of new measurement tools. Analytical chemistry has broad applications to forensics, medicine, science and engineering.

Analytical chemistry has been important since the early days of chemistry, providing methods for determining which elements and chemicals are present in the object in question. During this period significant contributions to analytical chemistry include the development of systematic <a href="elemental%20analysis">elemental analysis</a> by <a href="Justus%20von%20Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a> and systematized organic analysis based on the specific reactions of functional groups.

The first instrumental analysis was flame emissive spectrometry developed by <a href="Robert%20Bunsen">Robert Bunsen</a> and <a href="Gustav%20Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a> who discovered <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a> (Rb) and <a href="caesium">caesium</a> (Cs) in 1860.

Most of the major developments in analytical chemistry take place after 1900. During this period instrumental analysis becomes progressively dominant in the field. In particular many of the basic spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques were discovered in the early 20th century and refined in the late 20th century.

The <a href="separation%20processes">separation sciences</a> follow a similar time line of development and also become increasingly transformed into high performance instruments. In the 1970s many of these techniques began to be used together as hybrid techniques to achieve a complete characterization of samples.

Starting in approximately the 1970s into the present day analytical chemistry has progressively become more inclusive of biological questions (bioanalytical chemistry), whereas it had previously been largely focused on inorganic or <a href="Small%20molecule">small organic molecules</a>. Lasers have been increasingly used in chemistry as probes and even to initiate and influence a wide variety of reactions. The late 20th century also saw an expansion of the application of analytical chemistry from somewhat academic chemical questions to <a href="Forensic%20chemistry">forensic</a>, <a href="Environmental%20chemistry">environmental</a>, <a href="Chemical%20industry">industrial</a> and <a href="clinical%20chemistry">medical</a> questions, such as in <a href="histology">histology</a>.

Modern analytical chemistry is dominated by instrumental analysis. Many analytical chemists focus on a single type of instrument. Academics tend to either focus on new applications and discoveries or on new methods of analysis. The discovery of a chemical present in blood that increases the risk of cancer would be a discovery that an analytical chemist might be involved in. An effort to develop a new method might involve the use of a <a href="tunable%20laser">tunable laser</a> to increase the specificity and sensitivity of a spectrometric method. Many methods, once developed, are kept purposely static so that data can be compared over long periods of time. This is particularly true in industrial <a href="Quality%20Assurance">quality assurance</a> (QA), forensic and environmental applications. Analytical chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry where, aside from QA, it is used in discovery of new drug candidates and in clinical applications where understanding the interactions between the drug and the patient are critical.

Although modern analytical chemistry is dominated by sophisticated instrumentation, the roots of analytical chemistry and some of the principles used in modern instruments are from traditional techniques many of which are still used today. These techniques also tend to form the backbone of most undergraduate analytical chemistry educational labs.

A qualitative analysis determines the presence or absence of a particular compound, but not the mass or concentration. By definition, qualitative analyses do not measure quantity.

There are numerous qualitative chemical tests, for example, the <a href="acid%20test%20%28gold%29">acid test</a> for <a href="gold">gold</a> and the <a href="Kastle-Meyer%20test">Kastle-Meyer test</a> for the presence of <a href="blood">blood</a>.

Inorganic qualitative analysis generally refers to a systematic scheme to confirm the presence of certain, usually aqueous, ions or elements by performing a series of reactions that eliminate ranges of possibilities and then confirms suspected ions with a confirming test. Sometimes small carbon containing ions are included in such schemes. With modern instrumentation these tests are rarely used but can be useful for educational purposes and in field work or other situations where access to state-of-the-art instruments are not available or expedient.

Quantitative analysis is the measurement of the quantities of particular chemical constituents present in a substance.

Gravimetric analysis involves determining the amount of material present by weighing the sample before and/or after some transformation. A common example used in undergraduate education is the determination of the amount of water in a hydrate by heating the sample to remove the water such that the difference in weight is due to the loss of water.

Titration involves the addition of a reactant to a solution being analyzed until some equivalence point is reached. Often the amount of material in the solution being analyzed may be determined. Most familiar to those who have taken chemistry during secondary education is the acid-base titration involving a color changing indicator. There are many other types of titrations, for example potentiometric titrations.
These titrations may use different types of indicators to reach some equivalence point.

Spectroscopy measures the interaction of the molecules with <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic radiation</a>. Spectroscopy consists of many different applications such as <a href="atomic%20absorption%20spectroscopy">atomic absorption spectroscopy</a>, <a href="emission%20spectroscopy">atomic emission spectroscopy</a>, <a href="ultraviolet-visible%20spectroscopy">ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy</a>, <a href="x-ray%20fluorescence%20spectroscopy">x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy</a>, <a href="infrared%20spectroscopy">infrared spectroscopy</a>, <a href="Raman%20spectroscopy">Raman spectroscopy</a>, <a href="dual%20polarisation%20interferometry">dual polarization interferometry</a>, <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance%20spectroscopy">nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a>, <a href="photoemission%20spectroscopy">photoemission spectroscopy</a>, <a href="M%C3%B6ssbauer%20spectroscopy">Mössbauer spectroscopy</a> and so on.

Mass spectrometry measures <a href="mass-to-charge%20ratio">mass-to-charge ratio</a> of molecules using <a href="Electric%20field">electric</a> and <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s. There are several ionization methods: electron impact, <a href="chemical%20ionization">chemical ionization</a>, electrospray, fast atom bombardment, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization, and others. Also, mass spectrometry is categorized by approaches of mass analyzers: <a href="magnetic-sector">magnetic-sector</a>, <a href="quadrupole%20mass%20analyzer">quadrupole mass analyzer</a>, <a href="quadrupole%20ion%20trap">quadrupole ion trap</a>, <a href="time-of-flight%20mass%20spectrometry">time-of-flight</a>, <a href="Fourier%20transform%20ion%20cyclotron%20resonance">Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance</a>, and so on.

Electroanalytical methods measure the <a href="electric%20potential">potential</a> (<a href="volts">volts</a>) and/or <a href="electric%20current">current</a> (<a href="Ampere">amps</a>) in an <a href="electrochemical%20cell">electrochemical cell</a> containing the analyte. These methods can be categorized according to which aspects of the cell are controlled and which are measured. The four main categories are <a href="Ion%20selective%20electrode">potentiometry</a> (the difference in electrode potentials is measured), <a href="coulometry">coulometry</a> (the transferred charge is measured over time), <a href="amperometry">amperometry</a> (the cell's current is measured over time), and <a href="voltammetry">voltammetry</a> (the cell's current is measured while actively altering the cell's potential).

Calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis measure the interaction of a material and <a href="heat">heat</a>.

Separation processes are used to decrease the complexity of material mixtures. <a href="Chromatography">Chromatography</a>, <a href="electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a> and <a href="Field%20Flow%20Fractionation">Field Flow Fractionation</a> are representative of this field.

Combinations of the above techniques produce a "hybrid" or "hyphenated" technique. Several examples are in popular use today and new hybrid techniques are under development. For example, <a href="gas%20chromatography-mass%20spectrometry">gas chromatography-mass spectrometry</a>, gas chromatography-<a href="infrared%20spectroscopy">infrared spectroscopy</a>, <a href="liquid%20chromatography-mass%20spectrometry">liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry</a>, liquid chromatography-<a href="NMR%20spectroscopy">NMR spectroscopy</a>. liquid chromagraphy-infrared spectroscopy and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry.

Hyphenated separation techniques refers to a combination of two (or more) techniques to detect and separate chemicals from solutions. Most often the other technique is some form of <a href="chromatography">chromatography</a>. Hyphenated techniques are widely used in <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>. A <a href="Slash%20%28punctuation%29">slash</a> is sometimes used instead of <a href="hyphen">hyphen</a>, especially if the name of one of the methods contains a hyphen itself.

The visualization of single molecules, single cells, biological tissues and <a href="nanomaterial">nanomaterial</a>s is an important and attractive approach in analytical science. Also, hybridization with other traditional analytical tools is revolutionizing analytical science. <a href="Microscopy">Microscopy</a> can be categorized into three different fields: <a href="optical%20microscopy">optical microscopy</a>, <a href="electron%20microscopy">electron microscopy</a>, and <a href="scanning%20probe%20microscopy">scanning probe microscopy</a>. Recently, this field is rapidly progressing because of the rapid development of the computer and camera industries.

Devices that integrate (multiple) laboratory functions on a single chip of only millimeters to a few square centimeters in size and that are capable of handling extremely small fluid volumes down to less than picoliters.

Error can be defined as numerical difference between observed value and true value.

In error the true value and observed value in chemical analysis can be related with each other by the equation
where 
Error of a measurement is an inverse measure of accurate measurement i.e. smaller the error greater the accuracy of the measurement. Errors are expressed relatively as:

A general method for analysis of concentration involves the creation of a <a href="calibration%20curve">calibration curve</a>. This allows for determination of the amount of a chemical in a material by comparing the results of unknown sample to those of a series of known standards. If the concentration of element or compound in a sample is too high for the detection range of the technique, it can simply be diluted in a pure solvent. If the amount in the sample is below an instrument's range of measurement, the method of addition can be used. In this method a known quantity of the element or compound under study is added, and the difference between the concentration added, and the concentration observed is the amount actually in the sample.

Sometimes an <a href="internal%20standard">internal standard</a> is added at a known concentration directly to an analytical sample to aid in quantitation. The amount of analyte present is then determined relative to the internal standard as a calibrant. An ideal internal standard is isotopically-enriched analyte which gives rise to the method of <a href="isotope%20dilution">isotope dilution</a>.

The method of <a href="standard%20addition">standard addition</a> is used in instrumental analysis to determine concentration of a substance (<a href="analyte">analyte</a>) in an unknown sample by comparison to a set of samples of known concentration, similar to using a <a href="calibration%20curve">calibration curve</a>. Standard addition can be applied to most analytical techniques and is used instead of a <a href="calibration%20curve">calibration curve</a> to solve the <a href="matrix%20effect">matrix effect</a> problem.

One of the most important components of analytical chemistry is maximizing the desired signal while minimizing the associated <a href="Noise%20%28electronics%29">noise</a>. The analytical figure of merit is known as the <a href="signal-to-noise%20ratio">signal-to-noise ratio</a> (S/N or SNR).

Noise can arise from environmental factors as well as from fundamental physical processes.

Thermal noise results from the motion of charge carriers (usually electrons) in an electrical circuit generated by their thermal motion. Thermal noise is <a href="white%20noise">white noise</a> meaning that the power <a href="spectral%20density">spectral density</a> is constant throughout the <a href="frequency%20spectrum">frequency spectrum</a>.

The <a href="root%20mean%20square">root mean square</a> value of the thermal noise in a resistor is given by

where "k" is <a href="Boltzmann%27s%20constant">Boltzmann's constant</a>, "T" is the <a href="temperature">temperature</a>, "R" is the resistance, and formula_5 is the <a href="Bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidth</a> of the frequency formula_6.

Shot noise is a type of <a href="electronic%20noise">electronic noise</a> that occurs when the finite number of particles (such as <a href="electron">electron</a>s in an electronic circuit or <a href="photon">photon</a>s in an optical device) is small enough to give rise to statistical fluctuations in a signal.

Shot noise is a <a href="Poisson%20process">Poisson process</a> and the charge carriers that make up the current follow a <a href="Poisson%20distribution">Poisson distribution</a>. The root mean square current fluctuation is given by

where "e" is the <a href="elementary%20charge">elementary charge</a> and "I" is the average current. Shot noise is white noise.

Flicker noise is electronic noise with a 1/"ƒ" frequency spectrum; as "f" increases, the noise decreases. Flicker noise arises from a variety of sources, such as impurities in a conductive channel, generation and <a href="Carrier%20generation%20and%20recombination">recombination</a> noise in a <a href="transistor">transistor</a> due to base current, and so on. This noise can be avoided by <a href="modulation">modulation</a> of the signal at a higher frequency, for example through the use of a <a href="lock-in%20amplifier">lock-in amplifier</a>.

<a href="Environmental%20noise">Environmental noise</a> arises from the surroundings of the analytical instrument. Sources of electromagnetic noise are <a href="power%20lines">power lines</a>, radio and television stations, <a href="wireless%20device">wireless device</a>s, <a href="Compact%20fluorescent%20lamp">Compact fluorescent lamp</a>s and <a href="electric%20motor">electric motor</a>s. Many of these noise sources are narrow bandwidth and therefore can be avoided. Temperature and <a href="vibration%20isolation">vibration isolation</a> may be required for some instruments.

Noise reduction can be accomplished either in <a href="computer%20hardware">computer hardware</a> or <a href="software">software</a>. Examples of hardware noise reduction are the use of <a href="shielded%20cable">shielded cable</a>, <a href="analog%20filter">analog filter</a>ing, and signal modulation. Examples of software noise reduction are <a href="digital%20filter">digital filter</a>ing, <a href="ensemble%20average">ensemble average</a>, <a href="boxcar%20average">boxcar average</a>, and <a href="correlation">correlation</a> methods.

Analytical chemistry has applications including in <a href="forensic%20science">forensic science</a>, <a href="bioanalysis">bioanalysis</a>, <a href="Clinical%20chemistry">clinical analysis</a>, <a href="environmental%20analysis">environmental analysis</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20materials%20analysis%20methods">materials analysis</a>. Analytical chemistry research is largely driven by performance (sensitivity, <a href="detection%20limit">detection limit</a>, selectivity, robustness, <a href="dynamic%20range">dynamic range</a>, <a href="linear%20range">linear range</a>, accuracy, precision, and speed), and cost (purchase, operation, training, time, and space). Among the main branches of contemporary analytical atomic spectrometry, the most widespread and universal are optical and mass spectrometry. In the direct elemental analysis of solid samples, the new leaders are <a href="laser-induced%20breakdown%20spectroscopy">laser-induced breakdown</a> and <a href="laser%20ablation">laser ablation</a> mass spectrometry, and the related techniques with transfer of the laser ablation products into <a href="inductively%20coupled%20plasma">inductively coupled plasma</a>. Advances in design of diode lasers and optical parametric oscillators promote developments in fluorescence and ionization spectrometry and also in absorption techniques where uses of optical cavities for increased effective absorption pathlength are expected to expand. The use of plasma- and laser-based methods is increasing. An interest towards absolute (standardless) analysis has revived, particularly in emission spectrometry.

Great effort is being put in shrinking the analysis techniques to <a href="Integrated%20circuit">chip</a> size. Although there are few examples of such systems competitive with traditional analysis techniques, potential advantages include size/portability, speed, and cost. (micro <a href="total%20analysis%20system">total analysis system</a> (µTAS) or <a href="lab-on-a-chip">lab-on-a-chip</a>). <a href="Microscale%20chemistry">Microscale chemistry</a> reduces the amounts of chemicals used.

Many developments improve the analysis of biological systems. Examples of rapidly expanding fields in this area are <a href="genomics">genomics</a>, <a href="DNA%20sequencing">DNA sequencing</a> and related research in <a href="genetic%20fingerprinting">genetic fingerprinting</a> and <a href="DNA%20microarray">DNA microarray</a>; <a href="proteomics">proteomics</a>, the analysis of protein concentrations and modifications, especially in response to various stressors, at various developmental stages, or in various parts of the body, <a href="metabolomics">metabolomics</a>, which deals with metabolites; <a href="transcriptomics">transcriptomics</a>, including mRNA and associated fields; <a href="lipidomics">lipidomics</a> - lipids and its associated fields; <a href="peptidomics">peptidomics</a> - peptides and its associated fields; and <a href="metalomics">metalomics</a>, dealing with metal concentrations and especially with their binding to proteins and other molecules.

Analytical chemistry has played critical roles in the understanding of basic science to a variety of practical applications, such as biomedical applications, environmental monitoring, quality control of industrial manufacturing, forensic science and so on.

The recent developments of computer automation and information technologies have extended analytical chemistry into a number of new biological fields. For example, automated DNA sequencing machines were the basis to complete human genome projects leading to the birth of <a href="genomics">genomics</a>. Protein identification and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry opened a new field of <a href="proteomics">proteomics</a>.

Analytical chemistry has been an indispensable area in the development of <a href="nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>. Surface characterization instruments, <a href="electron%20microscopes">electron microscopes</a> and scanning probe microscopes enables scientists to visualize atomic structures with chemical characterizations.

A cappella

A cappella (Italian for "in the manner of the chapel") music is specifically group or solo singing without <a href="Musical%20instrument">instrumental</a> <a href="accompaniment">accompaniment</a>, or a piece intended to be performed in this way. It contrasts with <a href="cantata">cantata</a>, which is usually accompanied singing. The term "a cappella" was originally intended to differentiate between <a href="Renaissance%20music">Renaissance</a> <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a> and <a href="Baroque%20%28music%29">Baroque</a> <a href="concertato">concertato</a> style. In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music. The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for <a href="alla%20breve">alla breve</a>.

A cappella music was originally used in religious music, especially <a href="church%20music">church music</a> as well as <a href="anasheed">anasheed</a> and <a href="zemirot">zemirot</a>. <a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian chant</a> is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the <a href="Renaissance%20music">Renaissance</a>. The <a href="Madrigal%20%28music%29">madrigal</a>, up until its development in the early <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form. Jewish and Christian music were originally a cappella, and this practice has continued in both of these religions as well as in Islam.

The <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a> of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century AD, with compositions by <a href="Josquin%20des%20Prez">Josquin des Prez</a>. The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a> had further developed, but gradually, the <a href="cantata">cantata</a> began to take the place of a cappella forms. 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ "doubling" some or all of the voices. Such is seen in the life of <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Palestrina</a> becoming a major influence on <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, most notably in the "<a href="Mass%20in%20B%20Minor">Mass in B Minor</a>". Other composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were <a href="Claudio%20Monteverdi">Claudio Monteverdi</a> and his masterpiece, "Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata" (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610, and <a href="Andrea%20Gabrieli">Andrea Gabrieli</a> when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style. Learning from the preceding two composeres, <a href="Heinrich%20Sch%C3%BCtz">Heinrich Schütz</a> utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and <a href="Passion%20%28Christianity%29">the Passion</a>. Five of Schutz's "Historien" were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of <a href="Matthew%20the%20Apostle">Matthew</a>, <a href="Luke%20the%20Evangelist">Luke</a> and <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John</a>, were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a <a href="plainchant">plainchant</a>.

In the Byzantine Rite of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> and the <a href="Eastern%20Catholic%20Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a>, the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, "The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found." This "a cappella" behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, "Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord." In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian "musika" which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as "khorovïye kontsertï" (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, "Grammatika musikiyskaya" (1675), by <a href="Nikolai%20Diletsky">Nikolai Diletsky</a>. Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as <a href="Liturgy%20of%20St.%20John%20Chrysostom%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Peter Tchaikovsky</a>, <a href="Liturgy%20of%20St.%20John%20Chrysostom%20%28Rachmaninoff%29">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Arkhangelsky%20%28composer%29">Alexander Arkhangelsky</a>, and <a href="Liturgy%20of%20St.%20John%20Chrysostom%20%28Leontovych%29">Mykola Leontovych</a> are fine examples of this.

Present-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include some <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> churches devoted to the <a href="regulative%20principle%20of%20worship">regulative principle of worship</a>, <a href="Old%20Regular%20Baptist">Old Regular Baptist</a>s, <a href="Primitive%20Baptist">Primitive Baptist</a>s, <a href="Plymouth%20Brethren">Plymouth Brethren</a>, <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Churches of Christ</a>, Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), the <a href="Old%20German%20Baptist%20Brethren">Old German Baptist Brethren</a>, <a href="Doukhobor">Doukhobor</a>s the <a href="Byzantine%20Rite">Byzantine Rite</a> and the <a href="Amish">Amish</a>, <a href="Old%20Order%20Mennonites">Old Order Mennonites</a> and <a href="Conservative%20Mennonites">Conservative Mennonites</a>. Certain <a href="high%20church">high church</a> services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the Roman Catholic <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> and the <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> <a href="Divine%20Service%20%28Lutheran%29">Divine Service</a>) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times. Many <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a>s also conduct some or all of their services without instruments. <a href="Sacred%20Harp">Sacred Harp</a>, a type of <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>, is an a cappella style of religious singing with <a href="shape%20notes">shape notes</a>, usually sung at singing conventions.

Opponents of <a href="musical%20instruments%20in%20the%20Christian%20worship">musical instruments in the Christian worship</a> believe that such opposition is supported by the Christian scriptures and Church history. The scriptures typically referenced are <a href="http%3A//www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fsearch%3DMatthew%252026%3A30%3B%2520Acts%252016%3A25%3B%2520Romans%252015%3A9%3B%25201%2520Corinthians%252014%3A15%3B%2520Ephesians%25205%3A19%3B%2520Colossians%25203%3A16%3B%2520Hebrews%25202%3A12%2C%252013%3A15%3B%2520James%25205%3A13%3B%26amp%3Bversion%3D49%3B">Matthew 26:30; Acts 16:25; Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 2:12, 13:15; James 5:13</a>, which show examples and exhortations for Christians to sing.

There is no reference to instrumental music in early church worship in the New Testament, or in the worship of churches for the first six centuries. Several reasons have been posited throughout church history for the absence of instrumental music in church worship.

Christians who believe in a cappella music today believe that in the Israelite worship assembly during Temple worship only the Priests of Levi sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, whereas in the church era, all Christians are commanded to sing praises to God. They believe that if God wanted instrumental music in New Testament worship, He would have commanded not just singing, but singing and playing like he did in the Hebrew scriptures.

The first recorded example of a musical instrument in Roman Catholic worship was a <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a> introduced by <a href="Pope%20Vitalian">Pope Vitalian</a> into a cathedral in Rome around 670.

Instruments have divided Christendom since their introduction into worship. They were considered a Catholic innovation, not widely practiced until the 18th century, and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of <a href="Protestant%20Reformers">Protestant Reformers</a>, including <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> (1483–1546), <a href="Ulrich%20Zwingli">Ulrich Zwingli</a>, <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a> (1509–1564) and <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a> (1703–1791). Alexander Campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship as "a cow bell in a concert". In <a href="Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a>'s "<a href="The%20Heart%20of%20Midlothian">The Heart of Midlothian</a>", the heroine, <a href="Jeanie%20Deans">Jeanie Deans</a>, a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England (bold added):

Those who do not adhere to the <a href="regulative%20principle">regulative principle</a> of interpreting Christian scripture, believe that limiting praise to the unaccompanied chant of the early church is not commanded in scripture, and that churches in any age are free to offer their songs with or without musical instruments.

Those who subscribe to this interpretation believe that since the Christian scriptures never counter instrumental language with any negative judgment on instruments, opposition to instruments instead comes from an interpretation of history. There is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the first century and a half of Christian churches (33 AD to 180AD). The use of instruments for Christian worship during this period is also undocumented. Toward the end of the 2nd century, Christians began condemning the instruments themselves. Those who oppose instruments today believe these Church Fathers had a better understanding of God's desire for the church, but there are significant differences between the teachings of these Church Fathers and Christian opposition to instruments today.

Since "a cappella" singing brought a new polyphony (more than one note at a time) with instrumental accompaniment, it is not surprising that Protestant reformers who opposed the instruments (such as Calvin and Zwingli) also opposed the polyphony. While Zwingli was burning organs in Switzerland – Luther called him a fanatic – the Church of England was burning books of polyphony.

Some <a href="Holiness%20Churches">Holiness Churches</a> such as the <a href="Free%20Methodist%20Church">Free Methodist Church</a> opposed the use of musical instruments in church worship until the mid-20th century. The Free Methodist Church allowed for local church decision on the use of either an organ or piano in the 1943 Conference before lifting the ban entirely in 1955.

While worship in the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a> included musical instruments (), traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the last destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments given the practice of scriptural <a href="cantillation">cantillation</a>. The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as <a href="zemirot">zemirot</a> outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During <a href="the%20Three%20Weeks">the Three Weeks</a> musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the <a href="Counting%20of%20the%20Omer">counting of the omer</a> between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time. This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as "sefirah" music.

The popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher <a href="Philo">Philo</a>, born 20 BCE. Weaving together Jewish and Greek thought, Philo promoted praise without instruments, and taught that "silent singing" (without even vocal chords) was better still. This view parted with the Jewish scriptures, where Israel offered praise with instruments by God's own command (). The <a href="shofar">shofar</a> is the only temple instrument still being used today in the synagogue, and it is only used from <a href="Rosh%20Chodesh">Rosh Chodesh</a> <a href="Elul">Elul</a> through the end of <a href="Yom%20Kippur">Yom Kippur</a>. The shofar is used by itself, without any vocal accompaniment, and is limited to a very strictly defined set of sounds and specific places in the synagogue service. However, silver <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s, as described in , have been made in recent years and used in prayer services at the <a href="Western%20Wall">Western Wall</a>.

Peter Christian Lutkin, dean of the <a href="Bienen%20School%20of%20Music">Northwestern University School of Music</a>, helped popularize a cappella music in the United States by founding the Northwestern A Cappella Choir in 1906. The A Cappella Choir was "the first permanent organization of its kind in America."

A strong and prominent a cappella tradition was begun in the midwest part of the United States in 1911 by <a href="F.%20Melius%20Christiansen">F. Melius Christiansen</a>, a music faculty member at <a href="St.%20Olaf%20College">St. Olaf College</a> in <a href="Northfield%2C%20Minnesota">Northfield, Minnesota</a>. The <a href="St.%20Olaf%20Choir">St. Olaf College Choir</a> was established as an outgrowth of the local <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Lutheran%20Church%20%28Northfield%2C%20Minnesota%29">St. John's Lutheran Church</a>, where Christiansen was organist and the choir was composed, at least partially, of students from the nearby St. Olaf campus. The success of the ensemble was emulated by other regional conductors, and a rich tradition of a cappella choral music was born in the region at colleges like <a href="Concordia%20College%2C%20Moorhead">Concordia College</a> (Moorhead, Minnesota), <a href="Augustana%20College%20%28Illinois%29">Augustana College</a> (Rock Island, Illinois), <a href="Wartburg%20College">Wartburg College</a> (Waverly, Iowa), <a href="Luther%20College%20%28Iowa%29">Luther College</a> (Decorah, Iowa), <a href="Gustavus%20Adolphus%20College">Gustavus Adolphus College</a> (St. Peter, Minnesota), <a href="Augustana%20College%20%28South%20Dakota%29">Augustana College</a> (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), and <a href="Augsburg%20University">Augsburg University</a> (Minneapolis, Minnesota). The choirs typically range from 40 to 80 singers and are recognized for their efforts to perfect blend, intonation, phrasing and pitch in a large choral setting.

Major movements in modern a cappella over the past century include <a href="Barbershop%20music">Barbershop</a> and <a href="doo%20wop">doo wop</a>. The <a href="Barbershop%20Harmony%20Society">Barbershop Harmony Society</a>, <a href="Sweet%20Adelines%20International">Sweet Adelines International</a>, and Harmony Inc. host educational events including Harmony University, Directors University, and the International Educational Symposium, and international contests and conventions, recognizing international champion <a href="List%20of%20chorus%20champions%20by%20year">choruses</a> and <a href="List%20of%20quartet%20champions%20by%20year">quartets</a>.

These days, many a cappella groups can be found in high schools and colleges. There are amateur <a href="Barbershop%20Harmony%20Society">Barbershop Harmony Society</a> and professional groups that sing a cappella exclusively. Although a cappella is technically defined as singing without instrumental accompaniment, some groups use their voices to emulate instruments; others are more traditional and focus on harmonizing. A cappella styles range from gospel music to contemporary to barbershop quartets and choruses.

The <a href="Contemporary%20A%20Cappella%20Society">Contemporary A Cappella Society</a> (CASA) is a membership option for former students, whose funds support hosted competitions and events.

A cappella music was popularized between the late 2000s and the early to mid-2010s with media hits such as the 2009–2014 TV show "<a href="The%20Sing-Off">The Sing-Off</a>", the <a href="Musical%20theatre">musical</a> "<a href="Perfect%20Harmony%20%28musical%29">Perfect Harmony</a>", and the musical comedy film series "<a href="Pitch%20Perfect">Pitch Perfect</a>".

In <a href="Number-one%20hits%20of%201943%20%28United%20States%29">July 1943</a>, as a result of the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Musicians">American Federation of Musicians</a> boycott of US recording studios, the a cappella vocal group "The Song Spinners" had a best-seller with "Comin' In On A Wing And A Prayer". In the 1950s several recording groups, notably <a href="The%20Hi-Los">The Hi-Los</a> and the <a href="Four%20Freshmen">Four Freshmen</a>, introduced complex jazz harmonies to a cappella performances. The <a href="King%27s%20Singers">King's Singers</a> are credited with promoting interest in small-group a cappella performances in the 1960s. Frank Zappa loves Doo wop and A cappella, so Zappa released <a href="The%20Persuasions">The Persuasions</a> first album from his label in 1970. In 1983 an a cappella group known as <a href="The%20Flying%20Pickets">The Flying Pickets</a> had a Christmas 'number one' in the UK with a cover of <a href="Yazoo%20%28band%29">Yazoo</a>'s (known in the US as <a href="Yazoo%20%28band%29">Yaz</a>) "<a href="Only%20You%20%28Yazoo%20song%29">Only You</a>". A cappella music attained renewed prominence from the late 1980s onward, spurred by the success of Top 40 recordings by artists such as <a href="The%20Manhattan%20Transfer">The Manhattan Transfer</a>, <a href="Bobby%20McFerrin">Bobby McFerrin</a>, <a href="Huey%20Lewis%20and%20the%20News">Huey Lewis and the News</a>, <a href="All-4-One">All-4-One</a>, <a href="The%20Nylons">The Nylons</a>, <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a> and <a href="Boyz%20II%20Men">Boyz II Men</a>.

Contemporary a cappella includes many vocal groups and bands who add <a href="vocal%20percussion">vocal percussion</a> or <a href="beatboxing">beatboxing</a> to create a pop/rock/gospel sound, in some cases very similar to bands with instruments. Examples of such professional groups include <a href="Straight%20No%20Chaser%20%28group%29">Straight No Chaser</a>, <a href="Pentatonix">Pentatonix</a>, <a href="The%20House%20Jacks">The House Jacks</a>, <a href="Rockapella">Rockapella</a>, <a href="Mosaic%20%28vocal%20band%29">Mosaic</a>, <a href="Home%20Free%20%28group%29">Home Free</a> and <a href="M-pact">M-pact</a>. There also remains a strong a cappella presence within Christian music, as some denominations purposefully do not use instruments during worship. Examples of such groups are <a href="Take%206">Take 6</a>, <a href="Glad%20%28band%29">Glad</a> and <a href="Acappella%20%28group%29">Acappella</a>. Arrangements of popular music for small a cappella ensembles typically include one voice singing the lead melody, one singing a rhythmic bass line, and the remaining voices contributing chordal or <a href="Polyphony">polyphonic</a> accompaniment.

A cappella can also describe the isolated vocal track(s) from a <a href="multitrack%20recording">multitrack recording</a> that originally included instrumentation. These vocal tracks may be <a href="remix">remix</a>ed or put onto vinyl records for DJs, or released to the public so that fans can remix them. One such example is the a cappella release of <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>'s "<a href="The%20Black%20Album%20%28Jay-Z%20album%29">Black Album</a>", which <a href="Danger%20Mouse%20%28artist%29">Danger Mouse</a> mixed with <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' "<a href="The%20Beatles%20%28album%29">White Album</a>" to create "<a href="The%20Grey%20Album">The Grey Album</a>".

A cappella's growth is not limited to live performance, with hundreds of recorded a cappella albums produced over the past decade. As of December 2006, the Recorded A Cappella Review Board (RARB) had reviewed over 660 a cappella albums since 1994, and its popular discussion forum had over 900 users and 19,000 articles.

On their 1966 album titled "Album", Peter, Paul and Mary included the song "Normal Normal." All the sounds on that song, both vocals and instruments, were created by Paul's voice, with no actual instruments used.

In 2013, an artist by the name <a href="Smooth%20McGroove">Smooth McGroove</a> rose to prominence with his style of a cappella music. He is best known for his a cappella covers of <a href="video%20game">video game</a> music tracks on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>.

in 2015, an a cappella version of Jerusalem by multi-instrumentalist <a href="Jacob%20Collier">Jacob Collier</a> was selected for <a href="Beats%20Electronics">Beats by Dre</a> "The Game Starts Here" for the <a href="England%20at%20the%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">England Rugby World Cup</a> campaign.

A cappella has been used as the sole orchestration for original works of <a href="musical%20theater">musical theater</a> that have had commercial runs <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> (theaters in New York City with 99 to 500 seats) only four times. The first was Avenue X which opened on 28 January 1994 and ran for 77 performances. It was produced by <a href="Playwrights%20Horizons">Playwrights Horizons</a> with book by John Jiler, music and lyrics by Ray Leslee. The musical style of the show's score was primarily <a href="Doo-Wop">Doo-Wop</a> as the plot revolved around Doo-Wop group singers of the 1960s.

In 2001, <a href="The%20Kinsey%20Sicks">The Kinsey Sicks</a>, produced and starred in the critically acclaimed <a href="off-Broadway">off-Broadway</a> hit, "DRAGAPELLA! Starring the Kinsey Sicks" at New York's legendary <a href="Studio%2054">Studio 54</a>. That production received a nomination for a <a href="Lucille%20Lortel">Lucille Lortel</a> award as Best Musical and a Drama Desk nomination for Best Lyrics. It was directed by Glenn Casale with original music and lyrics by Ben Schatz.

The a cappella musical <a href="Perfect%20Harmony%20%28musical%29">Perfect Harmony</a>, a comedy about two high school a cappella groups vying to win the National championship, made its Off Broadway debut at Theatre Row’s Acorn Theatre on 42nd Street in New York City in October, 2010 after a successful out-of-town run at the Stoneham Theatre, in Stoneham, Massachusetts. Perfect Harmony features the hit music of The Jackson 5, Pat Benatar, Billy Idol, Marvin Gaye, Scandal, Tiffany, The Romantics, The Pretenders, The Temptations, The Contours, The Commodores, Tommy James & the Shondells and The Partridge Family, and has been compared to a cross between <a href="Altar%20Boyz">Altar Boyz</a> and <a href="The%2025th%20Annual%20Putnam%20County%20Spelling%20Bee">The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</a>.

The fourth a cappella musical to appear Off-Broadway, In Transit, premiered 5 October 2010 and was produced by <a href="Primary%20Stages">Primary Stages</a> with book, music, and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez, James-Allen Ford, Russ Kaplan, and Sara Wordsworth. Set primarily in the New York City subway system its score features an eclectic mix of musical genres (including jazz, hip hop, Latin, rock, and country). In Transit incorporates vocal beat boxing into its contemporary a cappella arrangements through the use of a subway beat boxer character. Beat boxer and actor <a href="Chesney%20Snow">Chesney Snow</a> performed this role for the 2010 Primary Stages production. According to the show's website, it is scheduled to reopen for an open-ended commercial run in the Fall of 2011. In 2011 the production received four Lucille Lortel Award nominations including Outstanding Musical, Outer Critics Circle and Drama League nominations, as well as five Drama Desk nominations including Outstanding Musical and won for Outstanding Ensemble Performance.

In December 2016, In Transit became the first a cappella musical on Broadway.

<a href="Barbershop%20music">Barbershop music</a> is one of several uniquely American art forms. The earliest reports of this style of a cappella music involved African Americans. The earliest documented quartets all began in barbershops. In 1938, the first formal men's barbershop organization was formed, known as the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A), and in 2004 rebranded itself and officially changed its public name to the <a href="Barbershop%20Harmony%20Society">Barbershop Harmony Society</a> (BHS). Today the BHS has over 22,000 members in approximately 800 chapters across the United States, and the barbershop style has spread around the world with organizations in many other countries. The Barbershop Harmony Society provides a highly organized competition structure for a cappella quartets and choruses singing in the barbershop style.

In 1945, the first formal women's barbershop organization, Sweet Adelines, was formed. In 1953 Sweet Adelines became an international organization, although it didn't change its name to <a href="Sweet%20Adelines%20International">Sweet Adelines International</a> until 1991. The membership of nearly 25,000 women, all singing in English, includes choruses in most of the fifty United States as well as in Australia, Canada, England, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland, Sweden, Wales and the Netherlands. Headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the organization encompasses more than 1,200 registered quartets and 600 choruses.

In 1959, a second women's barbershop organization started as a break off from Sweet Adelines due to ideological differences. Based on democratic principles which continue to this day, <a href="http%3A//www.harmonyinc.org">Harmony, Inc.</a> is smaller than its counterpart, but has an atmosphere of friendship and competition. With about 2,500 members in the United States and Canada, Harmony, Inc. uses the same rules in contest that the Barbershop Harmony Society uses. Harmony, Inc. is registered in Providence, Rhode Island.

The popularity of a cappella among high schools and amateurs was revived by television shows and movies such as "Glee" and "Pitch Perfect". High school groups have conductors or student leaders who keep the tempo for the group.

Composer <a href="Dinesh%20Subasinghe">Dinesh Subasinghe</a> became the first <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>n to write a cappella pieces for <a href="SATB">SATB</a> choirs. He wrote "The Princes of the Lost Tribe" and "Ancient Queen of Somawathee" for Menaka De Shabandu and Bridget Halpe's choirs, respectively, based on historical incidents in ancient Sri Lanka. Voice Print is also a professional a cappella music group in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.

The European a cappella tradition is especially strong in the countries around the Baltic and perhaps most so in Sweden as described by <a href="Richard%20Sparks">Richard Sparks</a> in his doctoral thesis "The Swedish Choral Miracle" in 2000.

Swedish a cappella choirs have over the last 25 years won around 25% of the annual prestigious <a href="European%20Grand%20Prix%20for%20Choral%20Singing">European Grand Prix for Choral Singing (EGP)</a> that despite its name is open to choirs from all over the world (see list of laureates in the Wikipedia article on the EGP competition).

The reasons for the strong Swedish dominance are as explained by Richard Sparks manifold; suffice to say here that there is a long-standing tradition, an unsusually large proportion of the populations (5% is often cited) regularly sing in choirs, the Swedish choral director <a href="Eric%20Ericson">Eric Ericson</a> had an enormous impact on a cappella choral development not only in Sweden but around the world, and finally there are a large number of very popular primary and secondary schools ("music schools") with high admission standards based on auditions that combine a rigid academic regimen with high level choral singing on every school day, a system that started with <a href="Adolf%20Fredrik%27s%20Music%20School">Adolf Fredrik's Music School</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> in 1939 but has spread over the country.

A cappella has gained attention in the UK in recent years, with many groups forming at British universities by students seeking an alternative singing pursuit to traditional choral and chapel singing. This movement has been bolstered by organisations such as <a href="The%20Voice%20Festival%20UK">The Voice Festival UK</a>.

It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of <a href="Rensselaer%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group. However the longest continuously-singing group is probably <a href="The%20Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a> of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, which was formed in 1909 and once included <a href="Cole%20Porter">Cole Porter</a> as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include <a href="Colgate%20University">Colgate University</a>'s The Colgate 13 (1942), <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a>'s Aires (1946), <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a>'s Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the <a href="University%20of%20Maine">University of Maine</a> Maine Steiners (1958), the <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> Kingsmen (1949), the <a href="http%3A//www.jabberwocks.com">Jabberwocks</a> of <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a> (1949), and the <a href="University%20of%20Rochester">University of Rochester</a> YellowJackets (1956). All-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a <a href="parody">parody</a> of the men's groups: the <a href="Smiffenpoofs">Smiffenpoofs</a> of <a href="Smith%20College">Smith College</a> (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and <a href="The%20Chattertocks%20of%20Brown%20University">The Chattertocks of Brown University</a> (1951). A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the <a href="Beelzebubs">Tufts University Beelzebubs</a> and the <a href="Dear%20Abbeys">Boston University Dear Abbeys</a>. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including <a href="vocal%20percussion">vocal percussion</a>/"<a href="beatboxing">beatboxing</a>". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as <a href="the%20Georgetown%20Chimes">the Georgetown Chimes</a>' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as <a href="List%20of%20quartet%20champions%20by%20year">International Quartet Champions</a> <a href="Boston%20Common%20%28quartet%29">The Boston Common</a> and the contemporary commercial a cappella group <a href="Rockapella">Rockapella</a>. Co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists, including <a href="John%20Legend">John Legend</a>, an alumnus of the Counterparts at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="Sara%20Bareilles">Sara Bareilles</a>, an alumna of Awaken A Cappella at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a>. <a href="Mira%20Sorvino">Mira Sorvino</a> is an alumna of <a href="the%20Harvard-Radcliffe%20Veritones">the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones</a> of <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a>, where she had the solo on <a href="Only%20You%20%28Yazoo%20song%29">Only You</a> by <a href="Yazoo%20%28band%29">Yaz</a>.

A cappella is gaining popularity among South Asians with the emergence of primarily Hindi-English College groups. The first South Asian a cappella group was <a href="Penn%20Masala">Penn Masala</a>, founded in 1996 at the University of Pennsylvania. Co-ed South Asian a cappella groups are also gaining in popularity. The first co-ed south Asian a cappella was Anokha, from the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland">University of Maryland</a>, formed in 2001. Also, Dil se, another co-ed a cappella from UC Berkeley, hosts the "Anahat" competition at the University of California, Berkeley annually. Maize Mirchi, the co-ed a cappella group from the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> hosts "Sa Re Ga Ma Pella", an annual South Asian a cappella invitational with various groups from the Midwest. Another South Asian group from the Midwest is Chai Town who is based in the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.

Jewish-interest groups such as <a href="Tufts%20University">Tufts University</a>'s Shir Appeal, <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>'s Rhythm and Jews, <a href="Binghamton%20University">Binghamton University</a>'s Kaskeset, <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a>'s Meshuganotes, <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a>'s Kol Halayla, <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>'s Ani V'Ata and <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>'s Magevet are also gaining popularity across the U.S.

Increased interest in modern a cappella (particularly collegiate a cappella) can be seen in the growth of awards such as the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (overseen by the <a href="Contemporary%20A%20Cappella%20Society">Contemporary A Cappella Society</a>) and competitions such as the <a href="International%20Championship%20of%20Collegiate%20A%20Cappella">International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella</a> for college groups and the <a href="Harmony%20Sweepstakes">Harmony Sweepstakes</a> for all groups. In December 2009, a new television competition series called "<a href="The%20Sing-Off">The Sing-Off</a>" aired on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. The show featured eight a cappella groups from the United States and Puerto Rico vying for the prize of $100,000 and a recording contract with <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic Records</a>/<a href="Sony%20Music">Sony Music</a>. The show was judged by <a href="Ben%20Folds">Ben Folds</a>, <a href="Shawn%20Stockman">Shawn Stockman</a>, and <a href="Nicole%20Scherzinger">Nicole Scherzinger</a> and was won by an all-male group from Puerto Rico called <a href="Nota%20%28group%29">Nota</a>. The show returned for a second, third and fourth season, won by <a href="Committed%20%28group%29">Committed</a>, <a href="Pentatonix">Pentatonix</a> and <a href="Home%20Free">Home Free</a> respectively.

Each year, hundreds of Collegiate a cappella groups submit their strongest songs in a competition to be on The Best of College A Cappella (BOCA), an album compilation of tracks from the best college a cappella groups around the world. The album is produced by Varsity Vocals – which also produces the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella – and <a href="Deke%20Sharon">Deke Sharon</a>. A group chosen to be on the BOCA album earns much credibility among the a cappella community.

Collegiate a cappella groups may also submit their tracks to Voices Only, a two-disc series released at the beginning of each school year. A Voices Only album has been released every year since 2005.

In addition, all women's a cappella groups can send their strongest song tracks to the Women’s A Cappella Association (WACA) for its annual best of women's a cappella album. WACA offers another medium for women's voices to receive recognition and has released an album every year since 2014, featuring women's groups from across the United States.

In addition to singing words, some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their <a href="vocal%20cords">vocal cords</a> and mouth. One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were <a href="The%20Mills%20Brothers">The Mills Brothers</a> whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally. More recently, "<a href="Twilight%20Zone%20%28dance%20song%29">Twilight Zone</a>" by <a href="2%20Unlimited">2 Unlimited</a> was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series "Tompkins Square". Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for "<a href="The%20New%20Addams%20Family">The New Addams Family</a>" series on <a href="Fox%20Family%20Channel">Fox Family Channel</a> (now <a href="ABC%20Family">ABC Family</a>). Groups such as <a href="Vocal%20Sampling">Vocal Sampling</a> and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music. Vocal artist <a href="Bobby%20McFerrin">Bobby McFerrin</a> is famous for his instrumental emulation. A cappella group <a href="Naturally%20Seven">Naturally Seven</a> recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument.

The <a href="Swingle%20Singers">Swingle Singers</a> used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments. <a href="Beatboxing">Beatboxing</a>, more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the <a href="hip-hop">hip-hop</a> community, where <a href="Rapping">rap</a> is often performed a cappella also. The advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements. Jazz vocalist <a href="Petra%20Haden">Petra Haden</a> used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of "<a href="The%20Who%20Sell%20Out">The Who Sell Out</a>" including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album "" in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of <a href="Journey%20%28band%29">Journey</a>'s "<a href="Don%27t%20Stop%20Believin%27">Don't Stop Believin'</a>", <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">The Beach Boys</a>' "<a href="God%20Only%20Knows">God Only Knows</a>" and <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "<a href="Thriller%20%28song%29">Thriller</a>".

Christian rock group <a href="Relient%20K">Relient K</a> recorded the song "Plead the Fifth" a cappella on its album "<a href="Five%20Score%20and%20Seven%20Years%20Ago">Five Score and Seven Years Ago</a>". The group recorded lead singer <a href="Matt%20Thiessen">Matt Thiessen</a> making drum noises and played them with an electronic drum machine to record the song.

The German <a href="Heavy%20Metal%20Music">metal</a> band <a href="van%20Canto">van Canto</a> uses vocal noises to imitate guitars on covers of well-known rock and metal songs (such as "<a href="Master%20of%20Puppets%20%28song%29">Master of Puppets</a>" by <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>) as well as original compositions. Although they are generally classified as a cappella metal, the band also includes a drummer, and uses amplifiers on some songs to distort the voice to sound more like an electric guitar.

Arrangement

In <a href="music">music</a>, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from <a href="Orchestration%23Orchestration%20as%20adaptation">orchestration</a> as the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for <a href="performance">performance</a> by an <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>, <a href="concert%20band">concert band</a>, or other <a href="musical%20ensemble">musical ensemble</a>. Arranging "involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or <a href="modulation%20%28music%29">modulations</a>, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety".

Arrangement and transcriptions of classical and <a href="Art%20music">serious music</a> go back to the early history of this genre. In particular, music written for the piano has frequently undergone this treatment. The suite of ten piano pieces "<a href="Pictures%20at%20an%20Exhibition%23Arrangements%20and%20interpretations">Pictures at an Exhibition</a>", by <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Modest Mussorgsky</a>, has been arranged over twenty times, notably by <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>.

Due to his lack of expertise in orchestration, the American composer <a href="George%20Gershwin">George Gershwin</a> had his "<a href="Rhapsody%20in%20Blue">Rhapsody in Blue</a>" orchestrated and arranged by <a href="Ferde%20Grof%C3%A9">Ferde Grofé</a>.

Popular music recordings often include parts for brass, string, and other instruments which were added by arrangers and not composed by the original songwriters. Popular music arrangements may also be considered to include new releases of existing songs with a new musical treatment. These changes can include alterations to <a href="tempo">tempo</a>, <a href="meter%20%28music%29">meter</a>, <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a>, <a href="instrumentation%20%28music%29">instrumentation</a>, and other musical elements.

Well-known examples include <a href="Joe%20Cocker">Joe Cocker</a>'s version of <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' "<a href="With%20a%20Little%20Help%20from%20My%20Friends">With a Little Help from My Friends</a>," <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a>'s <a href="Cross%20Road%20Blues">Crossroads</a>, and <a href="Ike%20Turner">Ike And Tina Turner</a>'s version of <a href="Creedence%20Clearwater%20Revival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>'s "<a href="Proud%20Mary">Proud Mary</a>". The American group <a href="Vanilla%20Fudge">Vanilla Fudge</a> and British group <a href="Yes%20%28band%29">Yes</a> based their early careers on radical re-arrangements of contemporary hits. Bonnie Pointer performed disco and Motown-themed versions of "Heaven Must Have Sent You." <a href="Remix">Remix</a>es, such as in <a href="dance%20music">dance music</a>, can also be considered arrangements.

Though arrangers may contribute substantially to finished musical products, for copyright and royalty purposes, they usually hold no legal claim to their work.

Arrangements for small jazz combos are usually informal, minimal, and uncredited. Larger ensembles have generally had greater requirements for notated arrangements, though the early <a href="Count%20Basie">Count Basie</a> <a href="big%20band">big band</a> is known for its many "head" arrangements, so called because they were worked out by the players themselves, memorized (in the player's "head"), and never written down. Most arrangements for big bands, however, were written down and credited to a specific arranger, as with arrangements by <a href="Sammy%20Nestico">Sammy Nestico</a> and <a href="Neal%20Hefti">Neal Hefti</a> for Count Basie's later big bands.

<a href="Don%20Redman">Don Redman</a> made innovations in jazz arranging as a part of <a href="Fletcher%20Henderson">Fletcher Henderson</a>'s orchestra in the 1920s. Redman's arrangements introduced a more intricate melodic presentation and "soli" performances for various sections of the big band. <a href="Benny%20Carter">Benny Carter</a> became Henderson's primary arranger in the early 1930s, becoming known for his arranging abilities in addition to his previous recognition as a performer. Beginning in 1938, <a href="Billy%20Strayhorn">Billy Strayhorn</a> became an arranger of great renown for the <a href="Duke%20Ellington">Duke Ellington</a> orchestra. <a href="Jelly%20Roll%20Morton">Jelly Roll Morton</a> is sometimes considered the earliest jazz arranger. While he toured around the years 1912 to 1915, he wrote down parts to enable "pick-up" bands to perform his compositions.

Big band arrangements are informally called "charts". In the swing era they were usually either arrangements of popular songs or they were entirely new compositions. <a href="Duke%20Ellington">Duke Ellington</a>'s and <a href="Billy%20Strayhorn">Billy Strayhorn</a>'s arrangements for the Duke Ellington big band were usually new compositions, and some of <a href="Eddie%20Sauter">Eddie Sauter</a>'s arrangements for the <a href="Benny%20Goodman">Benny Goodman</a> band and <a href="Artie%20Shaw">Artie Shaw</a>'s arrangements for his own band were new compositions as well. It became more common to arrange sketchy jazz combo compositions for big band after the bop era.

After 1950, the big bands declined in number. However, several bands continued and arrangers provided renowned arrangements. <a href="Gil%20Evans">Gil Evans</a> wrote a number of large-ensemble arrangements in the late 1950s and early 1960s intended for recording sessions only. Other arrangers of note include <a href="Vic%20Schoen">Vic Schoen</a>, <a href="Pete%20Rugolo">Pete Rugolo</a>, <a href="Oliver%20Nelson">Oliver Nelson</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Richards">Johnny Richards</a>, <a href="Billy%20May">Billy May</a>, <a href="Thad%20Jones">Thad Jones</a>, <a href="Maria%20Schneider%20%28musician%29">Maria Schneider</a>, <a href="Bob%20Brookmeyer">Bob Brookmeyer</a>, <a href="Lou%20Marini">Lou Marini</a>, <a href="Nelson%20Riddle">Nelson Riddle</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Burns">Ralph Burns</a>, <a href="Billy%20Byers">Billy Byers</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Jenkins">Gordon Jenkins</a>, <a href="Ray%20Conniff">Ray Conniff</a>, <a href="Henry%20Mancini">Henry Mancini</a>, <a href="Ray%20Reach">Ray Reach</a>, <a href="Vince%20Mendoza">Vince Mendoza</a>, and <a href="Claus%20Ogerman">Claus Ogerman</a>.

In the 21st century, the Big Band arrangement has made a modest comeback. <a href="Gordon%20Goodwin">Gordon Goodwin</a>, <a href="Roy%20Hargrove">Roy Hargrove</a>, and <a href="Christian%20McBride">Christian McBride</a> have all rolled out <a href="New%20Big%20Band">New Big Band</a>s with both original compositions and new arrangements of standard tunes.

The <a href="string%20section">string section</a> is a body of instruments composed of various stringed instruments. By the 19th century <a href="orchestral%20music">orchestral music</a> in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> had standardized the string section into the following homogeneous instrumental groups: first <a href="violin">violin</a>s, second violins (the same instrument as the first violins, but typically playing an <a href="accompaniment">accompaniment</a> or <a href="harmony%20part">harmony part</a> to the first violins, and often at a lower pitch), <a href="viola">viola</a>s, <a href="cello">cello</a>s, and <a href="double%20bass">double bass</a>es. The string section in a multi-sectioned orchestra is referred sometimes to as the "string choir."

The <a href="harp">harp</a> is also a stringed instrument, but is not a member of nor homogeneous with the violin family and is not considered part of the string choir. <a href="Samuel%20Adler%20%28composer%29">Samuel Adler</a> classifies the harp as a plucked string instrument in the same category as the <a href="guitar">guitar</a> (<a href="Acoustic%20guitar">acoustic</a> or <a href="Electric%20guitar">electric</a>), <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>, <a href="banjo">banjo</a>, or <a href="zither">zither</a>. Like the harp these instruments do not belong to the violin family and are not <a href="homogeneous">homogeneous</a> with the string choir. In modern arranging these instruments are considered part of the rhythm section. The <a href="electric%20bass">electric bass</a> and upright string bass—depending on the circumstance—can be treated by the arranger as either string section or <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a> instruments.

A group of instruments in which each member plays a unique part—rather than playing in unison with other like instruments—is referred to as a <a href="Chamber%20music">chamber ensemble</a>. A chamber ensemble made up entirely of strings of the violin family is referred to by its size. A <a href="string%20trio">string trio</a> consists of three players, a <a href="string%20quartet">string quartet</a> four, a <a href="string%20quintet">string quintet</a> five, and so on.

In most circumstances the string section is treated by the arranger as one <a href="homogeneous">homogeneous</a> unit and its members are required to play preconceived material rather than <a href="Musical%20improvisation">improvise</a>.

A string section can be utilized on its own (this is referred to as a string orchestra) or in conjunction with any of the other instrumental sections. More than one string orchestra can be utilized.

A standard string section (vln., vln 2., vla., vcl, cb.) with each section playing unison allows the arranger to create a five-part texture. Often an arranger will divide each violin section in half or thirds to achieve a denser texture. It is possible to carry this division to its logical extreme in which each member of the string section plays his or her own unique part.

Artistic, budgetary and logistical concerns will determine the size and instrumentation of a string section. The <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> <a href="Musical%20theatre">musical</a> <a href="West%20Side%20Story">West Side Story</a>, in 1957, was booked into the Winter Garden theater; composer <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> disliked the playing of "house" viola players he would have to use there, and so he chose to leave them out of the show's instrumentation; a benefit was the creation of more space in the pit for an expanded percussion section.

<a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a>, <a href="Producer%20%28music%29">producer</a> and arranger for <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, warns arrangers about the <a href="Intonation%20%28music%29">intonation</a> issues when only two like instruments play in unison. "After a string quartet," Martin explains, "I do not think there is a satisfactory sound for strings until one has at least three players on each line...as a rule two stringed instruments together create a slight "beat" which does not give a smooth sound."

While any combination and number of string instruments is possible in a section, a traditional string section sound is achieved with a violin-heavy balance of instruments.

Athanasian Creed

The Athanasian Creed, also known as Pseudo-Athanasian Creed or Quicunque Vult (also Quicumque Vult), is a <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="Creed">statement of belief</a> focused on <a href="Trinity">Trinitarian</a> doctrine and <a href="Christology">Christology</a>. The <a href="Latin">Latin</a> name of the creed, "Quicunque vult", is taken from the <a href="Incipit">opening words</a>, "Whosoever wishes". The creed has been used by Christian churches since the sixth century. It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated. It differs from the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene-Constantinopolitan</a> and <a href="Apostles%27%20Creed">Apostles' Creed</a>s in the inclusion of <a href="anathema">anathema</a>s, or condemnations of those who disagree with the creed (like the <a href="Nicene%20Creed%23The%20original%20Nicene%20Creed%20of%20325">original Nicene Creed</a>).

Widely accepted among <a href="Western%20Christianity">Western Christians</a>, including the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and some <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican churches</a>, <a href="Lutheran%20church">Lutheran church</a>es (it is considered part of <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> confessions in the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Concord">pageRank.Book of Concord</a>), and ancient, <a href="liturgical">liturgical</a> churches generally, the Athanasian Creed has been used in public worship less and less frequently, but part of it can be found as an "Authorized Affirmation of Faith" in the recent (2000) Common Worship liturgy of the Church of England [Main Volume page 145].

It was designed to distinguish <a href="Nicene%20Christianity">Nicene Christianity</a> from the heresy of <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a>. Liturgically, this Creed was recited at the Sunday Office of <a href="Prime%20%28liturgy%29">Prime</a> in the Western Church; it is not in common use in the Eastern Church. The creed has never gained acceptance in liturgy among <a href="Eastern%20Christianity">Eastern Christians</a> since it was considered as one of many unorthodox fabrications that contained the <a href="Filioque">Filioque</a> clause. Today, the Athanasian Creed is rarely used even in the Western Church. When used, one common practice is to use it once a year on <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity Sunday</a>.

A medieval account credited <a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius of Alexandria</a>, the famous defender of <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">Nicene theology</a>, as the author of the Creed. According to this account, Athanasius composed it during his exile in <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a> and presented it to <a href="Pope%20Julius%20I">Pope Julius I</a> as a witness to his orthodoxy. This traditional attribution of the Creed to Athanasius was first called into question in 1642 by Dutch Protestant theologian <a href="Gerhard%20Johann%20Vossius">G. J. Voss</a>. 

It has since been widely accepted by modern scholars that the creed was not authored by Athanasius, that it was not originally called a creed at all, nor was Athanasius' name originally attached to it. Athanasius' name seems to have become attached to the creed as a sign of its strong declaration of Trinitarian faith. The reasoning for rejecting Athanasius as the author usually relies on a combination of the following:


The use of the creed in a sermon by <a href="Caesarius%20of%20Arles">Caesarius of Arles</a>, as well as a theological resemblance to works by <a href="Vincent%20of%20L%C3%A9rins">Vincent of Lérins</a>, point to Southern <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> as its origin. The most likely time frame is in the late fifth or early sixth century AD – at least 100 years after Athanasius. The <a href="Christian%20theology">theology</a> of the creed is firmly rooted in the <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustinian tradition</a>, using exact terminology of Augustine's "On the Trinity" (published 415 AD). In the late 19th century, there was a great deal of speculation about who might have authored the creed, with suggestions including <a href="Ambrose%20of%20Milan">Ambrose of Milan</a>, <a href="Venantius%20Fortunatus">Venantius Fortunatus</a>, and <a href="Hilary%20of%20Poitiers">Hilary of Poitiers</a>, among others. 

The 1940 discovery of a lost work by <a href="Vincent%20of%20L%C3%A9rins">Vincent of Lérins</a>, which bears a striking similarity to much of the language of the Athanasian Creed, have led many to conclude that the creed originated either with Vincent or with his students. For example, in the authoritative modern monograph about the creed, <a href="J.%20N.%20D.%20Kelly">J. N. D. Kelly</a> asserts that Vincent of Lérins was not its author, but that it may have come from the same milieu, namely the area of Lérins in southern Gaul. The oldest surviving manuscripts of the Athanasian Creed date from the late 8th century.

The Athanasian Creed is usually divided into two sections: lines 1–28 addressing the doctrine of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>, and lines 29–44 addressing the doctrine of <a href="Christology">Christology</a>. Enumerating the three persons of the Trinity (i.e., <a href="God%20the%20Father%23Christianity">Father</a>, the <a href="Christian%20views%20of%20Jesus">Son</a>, and the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>), the first section of the creed ascribes the <a href="divine%20attribute">divine attribute</a>s to each individually. Thus, each person of the Trinity is described as uncreated ("increatus"), limitless ("Immensus"), eternal ("æternus"), and omnipotent ("omnipotens"). 

While ascribing the divine attributes and divinity to each person of the Trinity, thus avoiding <a href="subordinationism">subordinationism</a>, the first half of the Athanasian Creed also stresses the unity of the three persons in the one Godhead, thus avoiding a theology of <a href="tritheism">tritheism</a>. Furthermore, although one God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct from each other. For the Father is neither made nor begotten; the Son is not made but is begotten from the Father; the Holy Spirit is neither made nor begotten but proceeds from the Father - Western churches include "and the Son" (<a href="filioque">filioque</a>), a concept which Eastern and Oriental Orthodox reject.

The text of the Athanasian Creed is as follows:

The Christology of the second section is more detailed than that of the Nicene Creed, and reflects the teaching of the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Ephesus">First Council of Ephesus</a> (431) and the definition of the <a href="Council%20of%20Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451). The Athanasian Creed uses the term "substantia" (a Latin translation of the Nicene "<a href="homoousios">homoousios</a>": 'same being' or 'consubstantial') not only with respect to the relation of the Son to the Father according to his divine nature, but also says the Son is "substantia" of his mother Mary according to his human nature.

The Creed's wording thus excludes not only <a href="Sabellianism">Sabellianism</a> and <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a>, but the Christological heresies of <a href="Nestorianism">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="Eutychianism">Eutychianism</a>. A need for a clear confession against Arianism arose in western Europe when the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a> and <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a>, who had Arian beliefs, invaded at the beginning of the 5th century.

The final section of this Creed also moved beyond the Nicene (and Apostles') Creeds in making negative statements about the people's fate: "They that have done good shall go into life everlasting: and they that have done evil into everlasting fire." This caused considerable debate in England in the mid-nineteenth century, centred on the teaching of <a href="Frederick%20Denison%20Maurice">Frederick Denison Maurice</a>.

Composed of 44 rhythmic lines, the Athanasian Creed appears to have been intended as a liturgical document – that is, the original purpose of the creed was to be spoken or sung as a part of worship. The creed itself uses the language of public worship, speaking of the worship of God rather than the language of belief ("Now this is the catholic faith: We worship one God"). In the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> in medieval times, this creed was recited following the Sunday sermon or at the Sunday Office of <a href="Prime%20%28liturgy%29">Prime</a>. The creed was often set to music and used in the place of a Psalm.

Early <a href="Protestantism">Protestants</a> inherited the late medieval devotion to the Athanasian Creed, and it was considered to be authoritative in many Protestant churches. The statements of Protestant belief (confessional documents) of various Reformers commend the Athanasian Creed to their followers, including the <a href="Augsburg%20Confession">Augsburg Confession</a>, the <a href="Formula%20of%20Concord">Formula of Concord</a>, the <a href="Second%20Helvetic%20Confession">Second Helvetic Confession</a>, the <a href="Belgic%20Confession">Belgic Confession</a>, the Bohemian Confession and the <a href="Thirty-nine%20Articles">Thirty-nine Articles</a>. A <a href="meter%20%28hymn%29">metric</a> version titled "Quicumque vult", with a musical setting, was published in "The Whole Booke of Psalmes" printed by <a href="John%20Day%20%28printer%29">John Day</a> in 1562. Among modern Lutheran and Reformed churches adherence to the Athanasian Creed is prescribed by the earlier confessional documents, but the creed does not receive much attention outside of occasional use – especially on <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity Sunday</a>.

In Reformed circles, it is included (for example) in the Christian Reformed Churches of Australia's pageRank.Book of Forms (publ. 1991). However, it is rarely recited in public worship.

In the successive Books of Common Prayer of the reformed Church of England, from 1549 to 1662, its recitation was provided for on 19 occasions each year, a practice which continued until the nineteenth century, when vigorous controversy regarding its statement about 'eternal damnation' saw its use gradually decline. It remains one of the three Creeds approved in the Thirty-Nine Articles, and is printed in several current Anglican prayer books (e.g. A Prayer pageRank.Book for Australia (1995)). As with Roman Catholic practice, its use is now generally only on Trinity Sunday or its octave. The Episcopal Church based in the United States has never provided for its use in worship, but added it to its pageRank.Book of Common Prayer for the first time in 1979, where it is included in small print in a reference section entitled "Historical Documents of the Church."

In <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> churches, it was traditionally said at <a href="Prime%20%28liturgy%29">Prime</a> on Sundays when the <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Office</a> was of the Sunday. The 1911 reforms reduced this to Sundays after Epiphany and Pentecost, and on <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity Sunday</a>, except when a commemoration of a Double feast or a day within an Octave occurred. The 1960 reforms further reduced its use to once a year, on Trinity Sunday. It has been effectively dropped from the Catholic liturgy since the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a>. It is however maintained in the "Forma Extraordinaria", per the decree <a href="Summorum%20Pontificum">Summorum Pontificum</a>, and also in the rite of exorcism, both in the "Forma Ordinaria" and the "Forma Extraordinaria" of the Roman Rite.

In <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a>, the Athanasian Creed is—along with the <a href="Apostles%27%20Creed">Apostles'</a> and <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a>s—one of the three <a href="ecumenical%20creeds">ecumenical creeds</a> placed at the beginning of the 1580 <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Concord">pageRank.Book of Concord</a>, the historic collection of authoritative doctrinal statements (confessions) of the Lutheran Church. It is still used in the liturgy on <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity Sunday</a>.

Alicante

Alicante (, ), or (), both the Spanish and Valencian being official names, is a city and port in <a href="Spain">Spain</a> on the <a href="Costa%20Blanca">Costa Blanca</a>, the capital of the <a href="province%20of%20Alicante">province of Alicante</a> and of the <a href="comarca">comarca</a> of <a href="Alacant%C3%AD">Alacantí</a>, in the south of the <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencian Community</a>. It is also a historic <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> port. The population of the city of Alicante proper was 330,525, estimated , ranking as the second-largest <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencian</a> city. Including nearby municipalities, the Alicante <a href="conurbation">conurbation</a> had 452,462 residents. The population of the <a href="metropolitan%20area">metropolitan area</a> (including <a href="Elche">Elche</a> and satellite towns) was 757,085 estimates, ranking as the eighth-largest <a href="List%20of%20metropolitan%20areas%20in%20Spain">metropolitan area of Spain</a>.
The name of the city echoes the Arabic name "Laqant" (لَقَنْت) or "Al-Laqant" (ألَلَقَنْت), which in turn reflects the Latin "<a href="Lucentum">Lucentum</a>".

The area around Alicante has been inhabited for over 7000 years. The first tribes of <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a>s moved down gradually from Central Europe between 5000 and 3000 BC. Some of the earliest settlements were made on the slopes of <a href="Mount%20Benacantil">Mount Benacantil</a>. By 1000 BC <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n traders had begun to visit the eastern coast of Spain, establishing small trading ports and introducing the native Iberian tribes to the alphabet, iron and the pottery wheel. The town of Leuce Akra (white cape) was then founded by Greek settlers from Marseille around 325/324 b.C. By the 3rd century BC, the rival armies of <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a> began to invade and fight for control of the Iberian Peninsula. The Carthaginian general <a href="Hamilcar%20Barca">Hamilcar Barca</a> established the fortified settlement of "Akra Leuka" (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>: , meaning "White Mountain" or "White Point"), where Alicante stands today.
Although the Carthaginians conquered much of the land around Alicante, the Romans would eventually rule <a href="Hispania%20Tarraconensis">Hispania Tarraconensis</a> for over 700 years. By the 5th century AD, Rome was in decline and the Roman predecessor town of Alicante, known as "<a href="Lucentum">Lucentum</a>" (<a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a>), was more or less under the control of the <a href="Visigoths">Visigothic</a> warlord <a href="Theudimer">Theudimer</a>. However neither the Romans nor the Goths put up much resistance to the <a href="Umayyad%20conquest%20of%20Hispania">Arab conquest</a> of "Medina Laqant" in the 8th century. The Moors ruled southern and eastern Spain until the 13th century "<a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>" (Reconquest). Alicante was finally taken in 1246 by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castilian</a> king <a href="Alfonso%20X">Alfonso X</a>, but it passed soon and definitively to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Valencia">Kingdom of Valencia</a> in 1298 with King <a href="James%20II%20of%20Aragon">James II of Aragon</a>. It gained the status of Royal Village ("Vila Reial") with representation in the medieval <a href="Corts%20Valencianes">Valencian Parliament</a> ("Corts Valencianes").
After several decades of being the battlefield where the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Kingdom of Castile</a> and the <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a> clashed, Alicante became a major Mediterranean trading station exporting rice, wine, olive oil, oranges and wool. But between 1609 and 1614 <a href="Philip%20III%20of%20Spain">King Felipe III</a> expelled thousands of <a href="Morisco">Morisco</a>s who had remained in Valencia after the Reconquista, due to their cooperation with <a href="Barbary%20pirates">Barbary pirates</a> who continually attacked coastal cities and caused much harm to trade. This act cost the region dearly; with so many skilled artisans and agricultural labourers gone, the feudal nobility found itself sliding into bankruptcy. Things got worse in the early 18th century; after the <a href="War%20of%20Spanish%20Succession">War of Spanish Succession</a>, Alicante went into a long, slow decline, surviving through the 18th and 19th centuries by making shoes and growing agricultural produce such as oranges and almonds, and thanks to its fisheries. The end of the 19th century witnessed a sharp recovery of the local economy with increasing international trade and the growth of the city harbour leading to increased exports of several products (particularly during World War I when Spain was a neutral country).
During the early 20th century, Alicante was a minor capital that enjoyed the benefit of Spain's neutrality during World War I, and that provided new opportunities for local industry and agriculture. The <a href="Rif%20War%20%281920%29">Rif War</a> in the 1920s saw numerous "alicantinos" drafted to fight in the long and bloody campaigns in the former Spanish protectorate (Northern Morocco) against the Rif rebels. The political unrest of the late 1920s led to the victory of Republican candidates in local council elections throughout the country, and the abdication of <a href="King%20Alfonso%20XIII">King Alfonso XIII</a>. The proclamation of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a> was much celebrated in the city on 14 April 1931. The <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> broke out on 17 July 1936. Alicante was the last city loyal to the Republican government to be occupied by General Franco's troops on 1 April 1939, and its harbour saw the last Republican government officials fleeing the country. Vicious air bombings were targeted on Alicante during the three years of civil conflict, most notably the bombing by the Italian "<a href="Aviazione%20Legionaria">Aviazione Legionaria</a>" of the <a href="Mercado%20Central%20de%20Alicante">Mercado de Abastos</a> on 25 May 1938 in which more than 300 civilians perished.
The late 1950s and early 1960s saw the onset of a lasting transformation of the city by the tourist industry. Large buildings and complexes rose in nearby <a href="Albufereta">Albufereta</a> (e.g. <a href="El%20Barco%2C%20Alicante">El Barco</a>) and <a href="Playa%20de%20San%20Juan">Playa de San Juan</a>, with the benign climate being the biggest draw to attract prospective buyers and tourists who kept the hotels reasonably busy. New construction benefited the whole economy, as the development of the tourism sector also spawned new businesses such as restaurants, bars and other tourist-oriented enterprises. Also, the old airfield at Rabassa was closed and air traffic moved to the new <a href="El%20Altet%20Airport">El Altet Airport</a>, which made a more convenient and modern facility for charter flights bringing tourists from northern European countries.

When Franco died in 1975, his successor <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain">Juan Carlos I</a> played his part as the living symbol of the transition of Spain to a democratic constitutional monarchy. The governments of regional communities were given constitutional status as "<a href="Nationalities%20and%20regions%20of%20Spain">nationalities</a>", and their governments were given more autonomy, including that of the Valencian region, the "<a href="Generalitat%20Valenciana">Generalitat Valenciana</a>".

The <a href="Port%20of%20Alicante">Port of Alicante</a> has been reinventing itself since the <a href="deindustrialization">industrial decline</a> the city suffered in the 1980s (with most mercantile traffic lost to Valencia's harbour). In recent years, the Port Authority has established it as one of the most important ports in Spain for cruises, with 72 calls to port made by cruise ships in 2007 bringing some 80,000 passengers and 30,000 crew to the city each year. The moves to develop the port for more tourism have been welcomed by the city and its residents, but the latest plans to develop an <a href="industrial%20park">industrial estate</a> in the port have caused great controversy.

Until the <a href="Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%9308">global recession which started in 2008</a>, Alicante was one of the fastest-growing cities in Spain. The boom depended partly on tourism directed to the beaches of the <a href="Costa%20Blanca">Costa Blanca</a> and particularly on the second residence-construction boom which started in the 1960s and revived again by the late 1990s. <a href="Tertiary%20sector">Services</a> and public administration also play a major role in the city's economy. The construction boom has raised many environmental concerns and both the local autonomous government and city council are under scrutiny by the European Union. The construction surge was the subject of hot debates among politicians and citizens alike. The latest of many public battles concerns the plans of the Port Authority of Alicante to construct an industrial estate on reclaimed land in front of the city's coastal strip, in breach of local, national and European regulations. (See <a href="Port%20of%20Alicante">Port of Alicante</a> for details).
The city serves as the headquarters of the <a href="European%20Union%20Intellectual%20Property%20Office">European Union Intellectual Property Office</a> and a sizeable population of European public workers live there.

The campus of the <a href="University%20of%20Alicante">University of Alicante</a> lies in <a href="San%20Vicente%20del%20Raspeig">San Vicente del Raspeig</a>, bordering the city of Alicante to the north. More than 27,000 students attend the University.

Since 2005 <a href="Ciudad%20de%20la%20Luz">Ciudad de la Luz</a>, one of the largest film studios in Europe, has had its base in Alicante. The studio has shot Spanish and international movies such as <a href="Asterix%20at%20the%20Olympic%20Games%20%28film%29">"Asterix at the Olympic Games"</a> by Frédéric Forestier and Thomas Langmann, and <a href="Manolete%20%28film%29">"Manolete"</a> by <a href="Menno%20Meyjes">Menno Meyjes</a>.

The official population of Alicante in 2014 was 332,067 inhabitants and 757,085 in the metropolitan area "Alicante-<a href="Elche">Elche</a>". About 15% of the population is foreign, most of them immigrants from <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> who have arrived in the previous 20 years. There are also immigrants from other countries such as <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> and <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, many of whom coming outside the <a href="European%20Union">EU</a> are under illegal alien status and therefore are not accounted for in official population figures. The real percentage of foreign residents is higher, since the Alicante metropolitan area is home to many Northern European retirees who are officially still residents of their own countries. In the same pattern, a sizable number of permanent residents are Spanish nationals who officially still live in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque provinces</a>, or other areas of the country.

<a href="Gabriel%20Ech%C3%A1varri">Gabriel Echávarri</a> is the Mayor of the city. He was elected for the post on June 13, 2015, following the <a href="Spanish%20local%20and%20regional%20elections%2C%202015">municipal elections</a> on May 24, 2015. He was supported by the votes from his own group (6), plus those from leftist parties <a href="Guanyar%20Alacant">Guanyar Alacant</a> (6) and <a href="Comprom%C3%ADs">Compromís</a> (3), as well as from centre-right party <a href="Ciudadanos">Ciudadanos</a> (6). The <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29">People's Party</a> ("Partido Popular", PP), with only 8 elected seats, lost the majority.

In the previous <a href="Spanish%20local%20and%20regional%20elections%2C%202011">municipal elections</a> of May 2011, <a href="Sonia%20Castedo">Sonia Castedo</a> of People's Party won the elections with an <a href="absolute%20majority">absolute majority</a>, but resigned in December 2014 due to her involvement in several corruption scandals, at present being under investigation. Her fellow party member <a href="Miguel%20Valor">Miguel Valor</a> went on to become mayor up until Echávarri's election.

At the foot of the main staircase of the City Hall Building ("<a href="Ayuntamiento">Ayuntamiento</a>") is the zero point ("cota cero"), used as the point of reference for measuring the height above or below sea level of any point in Spain, due to the marginal tidal variations of the Mediterranean sea in Alicante.

Alicante enjoys mild winter temperatures, hot summers and little rain, concentrated in equinoctial periods. The climate of the Alicante region according to <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> is a <a href="Hot%20semi-arid%20climate">Hot semi-arid climate</a> ("BSh"). On average the temperature ranges between and in January, and between and in August, with an average annual temperature of . Daily variations in temperature are generally small because of the stabilising influence of the sea, although occasional periods of westerly wind can produce temperature changes of or more. Seasonal variations in temperature are also relatively small, meaning that winters are mild and summers are hot.

The average rainfall is per year. The <a href="cold%20drop">cold drop</a> means that September and October are the wettest months. Rarely, the rainfall can be torrential, reaching over in a 24-hour period, leading to severe flooding. Because of this irregularity, only 35 rainy days are observed on average per year, and the annual number of sunshine hours is 2,953.

The record maximum temperature of was observed on 4 July 1994. The record minimum temperature of was recorded on 2 January 1971. The worst flooding in modern history occurred on 30 September 1997 when of rain fell within six hours. Temperatures under are very rare. Snow is unknown since 1926 The climate of Alicante is very similar to the climate of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>.

<a href="Alicante%20Airport">Alicante Airport</a> outranks its <a href="Valencia%20Airport">Valencian counterpart</a>, being among the busiest airports in Spain after <a href="Madrid%20Airport">Madrid</a>, <a href="Barcelona%20Airport">Barcelona</a>, <a href="Palma%20de%20Mallorca%20Airport">Palma de Mallorca</a> and <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20Airport">Málaga</a>. It is connected with Madrid and Barcelona by frequent <a href="Iberia%20Airlines">Iberia</a> and <a href="Vueling%20Airlines">Vueling</a> flights, and with many Western European cities through carriers such as <a href="Ryanair">Ryanair</a>, <a href="Easyjet">Easyjet</a>, <a href="Air%20Berlin">Air Berlin</a>, <a href="Monarch%20Airlines">Monarch Airlines</a>, and <a href="Jet2.com">Jet2.com</a>. There are also regular flights to <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> and Russia.
<a href="Alicante%20railway%20station">Alicante railway station</a> is used by <a href="Cercan%C3%ADas">Cercanías</a> linking Alicante with suburbs and <a href="Murcia">Murcia</a>. Long-range <a href="RENFE">RENFE</a> trains run frequently to <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, and <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>.

The city has regular <a href="ferry">ferry</a> services to the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a> and <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>. The city is strongly fortified, with a spacious harbour.

Amongst the most notable features of the city are the <a href="Castle%20of%20Santa%20B%C3%A1rbara">Castle of Santa Bárbara</a>, which sits high above the city, and the <a href="port%20of%20Alicante">port of Alicante</a>. The latter was the subject of bitter controversy in 2006–2007 as residents battled, successfully, to keep it from being changed into an industrial estate.

The <a href="Castle%20of%20Santa%20B%C3%A1rbara">Santa Bárbara castle</a> is situated on <a href="Mount%20Benacantil">Mount Benacantil</a>, overlooking the city. The tower ("La Torreta") at the top, is the oldest part of the castle, while part of the lowest zone and the walls were constructed later in the 18th century.
The promenade "Explanada de España", lined by palm trees, is paved with 6.5 million marble floor tiles creating a wavy form and is one of the most lovely promenades in Spain. The Promenade extends from the Port of Alicante to the Gran Vía and ends at the famous statue of Mark Hersch. For the people of Alicante, the promenade is the meeting place for the traditional Spanish "paseo", or stroll along the waterfront in the evenings, and a venue for outdoor musical concerts. At the end of the promenade is a monument by the artist Bañuls of the 19th century.

"Barrio de la Santa Cruz" is a colourful quarter of the old city, situated on the south-west of <a href="Castle%20of%20Santa%20B%C3%A1rbara">Santa Bárbara castle</a>. Its small houses climb up the hill leading to the walls and the castle, through narrow streets decorated with flags and tubs of flowers.

"L'Ereta Park" is situated on the foothills of <a href="Mount%20Benacantil">Mount Benacantil</a>, on the way to the castle. It runs from the Santa Bárbara castle down to the old part of Alicante and consists of several levels, routes, decks and rest stops which offer a panoramic view overlooking the city.

"El Palmeral Park" is one of the favorite parks of Alicante's citizens. It includes walking trails, children's playgrounds, ponds and brooks, picnic tables and an auditorium for concerts.

Just a few kilometers from Alicante on the Mediterranean Sea lies <a href="Tabarca">Tabarca</a> island. What was once a haven for <a href="Barbary%20pirates">Barbary pirates</a> is now a beautiful tourist attraction.
Other sights include:

There are a dozen museums in Alicante. On exhibition at the <a href="Archaeological%20Museum%20of%20Alicante">Archaeological Museum of Alicante</a> (MARQ) are local artifacts dating from 100,000 years ago till the early 20th century. The collection is divided into different rooms representing three divisions of archaeological methodology: ground, urban and underwater archaeology, with <a href="dioramas">dioramas</a>, audiovisual and interactive zones. The archaeological museum won the <a href="European%20Museum%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">European Museum of the Year Award</a> in 2004. <a href="Gravina%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Gravina Museum of Fine Arts</a> presents a number of paintings and sculptures from the 16th century to the 19th century. <a href="Asegurada%20Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art">Asegurada Museum of Contemporary Art</a> houses a major collection of twentieth-century art, composed mainly of works donated by .

The most important festival, the "<a href="Bonfires%20of%20Saint%20John">Bonfires of Saint John</a>" ("Fogueres de Sant Joan"), takes place during the summer <a href="solstice">solstice</a>. This is followed a week later by seven nights of firework and pyrotechnic contests between companies on the urban beach "Playa del Postiguet". Another well-known festival is "<a href="Moros%20i%20Cristians">Moros i Cristians</a>" in Altozano or "San Blas" district. Overall, the city boasts a year-round nightlife for the enjoyment of tourists, residents, and a large student population of the <a href="University%20of%20Alicante">University of Alicante</a>. The nightlife social scene tends to shift to nearby Playa de San Juan (St. John's Beach) during the summer months.

Every summer in Alicante, a two-month-long programme of music, theatre and dance is staged in the Paseo del Puerto.

The two established Alicante football teams are <a href="H%C3%A9rcules%20CF">Hércules CF</a>, which competes in the Spanish Segunda División B, and <a href="Alicante%20CF">Alicante CF</a>, which plays in Tercera División and was dissolved in 2014 due to economic problems. Hércules CF is more well known as it was in the first division in Spain during 96/97 and had many popular players such as David Trezeguet, Royston Drenthe and Aedo Valvez. It is also known because, thanks to this team beating Barcelona, Real Madrid won the league in 1997. Nowadays their home games are played in the Estadio José Rico Pérez.

Basketball club <a href="CB%20Lucentum%20Alicante">Lucentum Alicante</a> participates in the <a href="Liga%20ACB">Spanish basketball league</a>. It plays in the <a href="Centro%20de%20Tecnificaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Alicante">Centro de Tecnificación de Alicante</a>.

She then read <a href="Latin">Latin</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a> and later attended <a href="Lady%20Margaret%20Hall%2C%20Oxford">Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford</a>, to read <a href="Philosophy%2C%20Politics%20and%20Economics">Philosophy, Politics and Economics</a> (PPE). She worked for <a href="Unilever">Unilever</a> (1973–75) and then as an administrator at the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> (1975–87) before entering Parliament.

From 1976 to 1978, Widdecombe was a <a href="councillor">councillor</a> on <a href="Runnymede%20%28borough%29">Runnymede District</a> Council in Surrey. She contested the seat of <a href="Burnley%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Burnley</a> in Lancashire in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201979">1979 general election</a> and then, against <a href="David%20Owen">David Owen</a>, the <a href="Plymouth%20Devonport%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Plymouth Devonport</a> seat in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201983">1983 general election</a>.

She was first elected to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201987">1987 general election</a> as member for the constituency of <a href="Maidstone%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Maidstone</a> (which became <a href="Maidstone%20and%20The%20Weald%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Maidstone and The Weald</a> in 1997).

As an MP, Widdecombe expressed conservative views, including opposition to abortion; it was understood during her time in frontline politics that she would not become <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health">Health Secretary</a> as long as this involved responsibility for abortions. Although a committed Christian, she has characterised the issue as one of life and death on which her view had been the same when she was agnostic. Along with <a href="John%20Gummer">John Gummer</a> MP, she converted from the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> to the Catholic Church following the decision of the Church of England on the <a href="Ordination%20of%20women">Ordination of women</a> as priests. In her speech at the 2000 Conservative conference, she called for a <a href="zero%20tolerance">zero tolerance</a> policy of prosecution, with the punishment of £100 fines for users of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a>. This was well received by rank-and-file Conservative delegates.

Widdecombe consistently opposed <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> equality. On the issue of an equal age of consent, she said in 2000: "I do not believe that issues of equality should override the imperatives of protecting the young." In 2003, Widdecombe proposed an amendment opposing repeal of <a href="Section%2028">Section 28</a> of the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201988">Local Government Act</a>, which banned the promotion of homosexuality by local governments. Out of the 17 parliamentary votes considered by the <a href="Public%20Whip">Public Whip</a> website to concern equal rights for homosexuals, Widdecombe took the opposing position in 15 cases, not being present at the other two votes. Widdecombe has also expressed her opposition to <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">same-sex marriage</a>, introduced by <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>'s government in 2014, claiming that "the state must have a preferred model" and "a union that is generally open to procreation".

She is a committed animal lover and one of the few Conservative MPs to have consistently voted for the ban on <a href="fox%20hunting">fox hunting</a>. Widdecombe was among more than 20 high-profile people who signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 to oppose David Cameron's plan to amend the <a href="Hunting%20Act%202004">Hunting Act 2004</a>.

She has expressed a variety of views on scientific issues such as <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> but has been opposed to legislation reducing emissions. Her views on the subject appear to have hardened over time. In 2007, she wrote that she did not want to belittle the issue but was sceptical of the claims that specific actions would prevent catastrophe, then in 2008 that her doubts had been "crystalised" by Nigel Lawson's book "<a href="An%20Appeal%20to%20Reason">An Appeal to Reason</a>", before stating in 2009 that "There is no climate change, hasn’t anybody looked out of their window recently?" She was one of the five MPs who voted against the <a href="Climate%20Change%20Act%202008">Climate Change Act 2008</a>. In 2011 she expressed the view that "climate change money should go to armed services". The previous year, she voted to support a parliamentary motion supporting <a href="homeopathy">homeopathy</a>, criticizing the Science and Technology Committee's Report on the subject.

Over the years, Widdecombe has expressed her support for a reintroduction of the death penalty, which was abolished in the UK in 1965. She notably spoke of her support for its reintroduction for the worst cases of murder in the aftermath of the murder of two 10-year-old girls from <a href="Soham">Soham</a>, Cambridgeshire, in August 2002, in the <a href="Soham%20murders">Soham murders</a>. She supported the argument that the death penalty would have deterrent value, as within five years of its abolition the national murder rate had more than doubled.

Widdecombe joined <a href="John%20Major">John Major</a>'s government as <a href="Parliamentary%20Under-Secretary%20of%20State">Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State</a> for Social Security in 1990. In 1993, she was moved to the <a href="Department%20of%20Employment">Department of Employment</a>, and she was promoted to <a href="Minister%20of%20State">Minister of State</a> the following year. In 1995, she joined the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> as Minister of State for Prisons and visited every prison in Britain.

After the fall of the Conservative government to <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> in 1997, she served as <a href="Shadow%20Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health">Shadow Health Secretary</a> between 1998 and 1999 and later as <a href="Shadow%20Home%20Secretary">Shadow Home Secretary</a> between 1999 and 2001 under <a href="William%20Hague">William Hague</a>.

During the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29%20leadership%20election%2C%202001">2001 Conservative leadership election</a>, she could not find sufficient support amongst Conservative MPs for her leadership candidacy. She first supported <a href="Michael%20Ancram">Michael Ancram</a>, who was eliminated in the first round, and then <a href="Kenneth%20Clarke">Kenneth Clarke</a>, who lost in the final round. She afterwards declined to serve in <a href="Shadow%20Cabinet%20of%20Iain%20Duncan%20Smith">Iain Duncan Smith's Shadow Cabinet</a> (although she indicated on the television programme "<a href="When%20Louis%20Met...">When Louis Met...</a>", prior to the leadership contest, that she wished to retire to the <a href="backbenches">backbenches</a> anyway).

In the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29%20leadership%20election%2C%202005">2005 leadership election</a>, she initially supported Kenneth Clarke again. Once he was eliminated, she turned support towards <a href="Liam%20Fox">Liam Fox</a>. Following Fox's subsequent elimination, she took time to reflect before finally declaring for <a href="David%20Davis%20%28British%20politician%29">David Davis</a>. She expressed reservations over the eventual winner <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>, feeling that he did not, like the other candidates, have a proven track record, and she was later a leading figure in parliamentary opposition to his A-List policy, which she has said is "an insult to women". At the October 2006 Conservative Conference, she was Chief Dragon in a political version of the television programme "<a href="Dragons%27%20Den">Dragons' Den</a>", in which A-list candidates were invited to put forward a policy proposal, which was then torn apart by her team of <a href="Rachel%20Elnaugh">Rachel Elnaugh</a>, <a href="Oliver%20Letwin">Oliver Letwin</a> and <a href="Michael%20Brown%20%28UK%20politician%29">Michael Brown</a>.

In an interview with "<a href="Metro%20%28Associated%20Metro%20Limited%29">Metro</a>" in September 2006 she stated that if Parliament were of a normal length, it was likely she would retire at the next general election. She confirmed her intention to stand down to "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>"'s Pendennis diary in September 2007, and again in October 2007 after Prime Minister <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> quashed speculation of an autumn 2007 general election.

In November 2006, she moved into the house of an <a href="Islington">Islington</a> Labour Councillor to experience life on a <a href="council%20estate">council estate</a>, her response to her experience being "Five years ago I made a speech in the House of Commons about the forgotten decents. I have spent the last week on estates in the Islington area finding out that they are still forgotten."

Widdecombe was one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret. When the expenses claims were <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Parliamentary%20expenses%20scandal">leaked</a>, however, Widdecombe was described by "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" as one of the "saints" amongst all MPs.

In May 2009, following the resignation of <a href="Michael%20Martin%2C%20Baron%20Martin%20of%20Springburn">Michael Martin</a> as <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20British%20House%20of%20Commons">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, it was reported that Widdecombe was gathering support for election as interim Speaker until the next general election. On 11 June 2009, she confirmed her bid to be the Speaker. She made it through to the second ballot but came last and was eliminated.

Widdecombe retired from politics at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 general election</a>. It was rumoured that she would be a Conservative candidate for <a href="Police%20and%20Crime%20Commissioner">Police and Crime Commissioner</a> in 2012, but she refused. She has since spoken about her opposition to the Coalition Government and her surprise at not being given a peerage by <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>.

In 2016, she backed <a href="Britain%27s%20withdrawal%20from%20the%20European%20Union">Britain's withdrawal from the European Union</a> during the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20European%20Union%20membership%20referendum%2C%202016">2016 EU referendum</a> and, following the resignation of <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>, endorsed <a href="Andrea%20Leadsom">Andrea Leadsom</a> in her candidacy for <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29%20leadership%20election%2C%202016">election for the leadership of the governing Conservative Party</a>.

Until her retirement at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 general election</a>, Widdecombe divided her time between her two homes – one in London and one in the village of <a href="Sutton%20Valence">Sutton Valence</a>, Kent, in her constituency. She sold both of these properties, however, upon deciding to retire at the next general election. She shared her home in London with her widowed mother, Rita Widdecombe, until Rita's death, on 25 April 2007, aged 95. In March 2008, she purchased a house in <a href="Haytor%20Vale">Haytor Vale</a>, on <a href="Dartmoor">Dartmoor</a> in Devon, to where she has now retired. Her brother, Malcolm (1937–2010), who was an <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">Canon</a> in Bristol, retired in May 2009 and died of <a href="metastasis">metastatic</a> <a href="oesophageal%20cancer">oesophageal cancer</a> on 12 October 2010. Her nephew, Roger Widdecombe, is an Anglican priest.

She has never married nor had any children. In November 2007 on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> she described how a journalist once produced a profile on her with the assumption that she had had at least "one sexual relationship", to which Widdecombe replied: "Be careful, that's the way you get sued". When interviewer <a href="Jenni%20Murray">Jenni Murray</a> asked if she had ever had a sexual relationship, Widdecombe laughed "it's nobody else's business".

Widdecombe has a fondness for cats and has a section of her website devoted to all the pet cats with which she has shared her life. In an interview, Widdecombe talked about her appreciation of music despite describing herself as "pretty well tone-deaf".

Her non-political accomplishments include being a popular novelist. Widdecombe also currently writes a weekly column for the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>".

In January 2011 Widdecombe was joint President of the <a href="North%20of%20England%20Education%20Conference">North of England Education Conference</a> in <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a>. She shared the responsibility with a young person from the town. She has also become a patron of The Grace Charity for M.E.

Widdecombe revealed, in an April 2012 interview with Matt Chorley of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", that she was writing her autobiography, which she described as "rude about all and sundry, but an amount of truth is always necessary".

Widdecombe is a Patron of the charity <a href="Safe%20Haven%20for%20Donkeys%20in%20the%20Holy%20Land">Safe Haven for Donkeys in the Holy Land</a> (SHADH) and in 2014 visited the SHADH Donkey Sanctuary in <a href="West%20Bank">Palestine</a>.

Widdecombe is a practising <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>. She <a href="Religious%20conversion">converted</a> in 1993 after leaving the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. Her reasons for leaving the latter were many, as she explained to reporters from the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>":

In October 2006, she pledged to boycott <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a> for suspending a worker who refused to hide her <a href="Christian%20cross">cross</a>. The matter was resolved when the company reversed the suspension.

In 2010, Widdecombe turned down an offer to be Britain's next ambassador to the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>, being prevented from accepting by suffering a <a href="detached%20retina">detached retina</a>. She was made a Dame of the <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Gregory%20the%20Great">Order of St. Gregory the Great</a> by <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> for services to politics and public life on 31 January 2013.

In 1990, following the assassination of the Conservative politician <a href="Ian%20Gow">Ian Gow</a> by the <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA), the <a href="Eastbourne%20by-election%2C%201990">Eastbourne by-election</a> for his seat in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> was won by the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrat</a> <a href="David%20Bellotti">David Bellotti</a>. Upon the announcement, Widdecombe told the voters that the IRA would be "toasting their success".

In 1996, Widdecombe, as prisons minister, defended the Government's policy to <a href="Use%20of%20restraints%20on%20pregnant%20women">shackle pregnant prisoners</a> with handcuffs and chains when in hospital receiving ante-natal care. Widdecombe told the Commons the restrictions were needed to prevent prisoners from escaping. "Some MPs may like to think that a pregnant woman would not or could not escape. Unfortunately this is not true. The fact is that hospitals are not secure places in which to keep prisoners, and since 1990, 20 women have escaped from hospitals". <a href="Jack%20Straw">Jack Straw</a>, Labour's Home Affairs spokesman at the time, said it was "degrading and unnecessary" for a woman to be shackled at any stage.

In 1997, during the Conservative leadership election of <a href="William%20Hague">William Hague</a>, Widdecombe spoke out against <a href="Michael%20Howard">Michael Howard</a>, under whom she had served when he was Home Secretary. She remarked in the House of Commons that there is "something of the night" about him. The remark was considered to be <a href="antisemitic">antisemitic</a> by some and was damaging to Howard, who came last in the first round, an opinion both former ministers share. Howard still became party leader in 2003, and Widdecombe then stated, "I explained fully what my objections were in 1997 and I do not retract anything I said then. But ... we have to look to the future and not the past."

In 2001, when <a href="Michael%20Portillo">Michael Portillo</a> was running for leader of the Conservative Party, Widdecombe described him and his allies as "backbiters". She went on to say that, should he be appointed leader, she would never give him her allegiance.

In 2002, she took part in the ITV programme "<a href="Celebrity%20Fit%20Club%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Celebrity Fit Club</a>". Also in 2002 she took part in a <a href="Louis%20Theroux">Louis Theroux</a> television documentary, depicting her life, both in and out of politics. In March 2004 she briefly became "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" newspaper's <a href="agony%20aunt">agony aunt</a>, introduced with an <a href="Emma%20Brockes">Emma Brockes</a> interview. In 2005 <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> showed six episodes of "The Widdecombe Project", an agony aunt television programme. In 2005, she appeared in a new series of "Celebrity Fit Club", but this time as a panel member dispensing wisdom and advice to the celebrities taking part. Also in 2005, she presented the show "Ann Widdecombe to the Rescue" in which she acted as an agony aunt, dispensing no-nonsense advice to disputing families, couples, and others across the UK. In 2005, she also appeared in a discussion programme on <a href="Channel%205%20%28UK%29">Five</a> to discuss who had been England's greatest monarch since the <a href="Norman%20Conquest">Norman Conquest</a>; her choice of monarch was <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>.

She was the guest host of news quiz "<a href="Have%20I%20Got%20News%20for%20You">Have I Got News for You</a>" twice, in 2006 and 2007. Following her second appearance, Widdecombe vowed she would never appear on the show again because of comments made by panellist <a href="Jimmy%20Carr">Jimmy Carr</a>. She wrote, "His idea of wit is a barrage of filth and the sort of humour most men grow out of in their teens... [T]here's no amount of money for which I would go through those two recording hours again. At one stage I nearly walked out." She did, however, stand by her appraisal of regular panellists <a href="Ian%20Hislop">Ian Hislop</a> and <a href="Paul%20Merton">Paul Merton</a>, whom she has called "the fastest wits in showbusiness".

In 2007, she awarded the "<a href="University%20Challenge">University Challenge</a>" trophy to the winners. In the same year, she was cast as herself in "<a href="The%20Sound%20of%20Drums%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The Sound of Drums</a>", the 12th episode of the third series of the science-fiction drama "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" supporting <a href="Mr%20Saxon">Mr Saxon</a>, the alias of <a href="Master%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">the Master</a>.

Since 2007, Widdecombe has fronted a television <a href="Television%20season">series</a> called "Ann Widdecombe Versus", on <a href="ITV1">ITV1</a>, in which she speaks to various people about things related to her as an <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a>, with an emphasis on confronting those responsible for problems she wished to tackle. On 15 August 2007 she talked about prostitution, the next week about <a href="Social%20welfare%20provision">benefits</a> and the week after that about <a href="truancy">truancy</a>. A fourth episode was screened on 18 September 2008 in which she travelled around London and <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> talking to girl gangs.

In 2009, Widdecombe appeared with Archbishop <a href="John%20Onaiyekan">John Onaiyekan</a> in an "<a href="Intelligence%20Squared">Intelligence Squared</a>" debate in which they defended the motion that the Catholic Church was a force for good. Arguing against the motion were <a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a>, who won the debate overall.

In October 2010, she appeared on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>'s "<a href="Strictly%20Come%20Dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a>", partnered by <a href="Anton%20du%20Beke">Anton du Beke</a>, winning the support of some viewers despite low marks from the judges. After nine weeks of routines strongly flavoured by comedy the couple had received enough support in the public vote to stay in the contest. Widdecombe was eliminated from the competition on Sunday 5 December after the public vote had been combined with the judges' score; she was with <a href="Scott%20Maslen">Scott Maslen</a> of "EastEnders" in the bottom two.

In 2012, Widdecombe hosted a new quiz show with herself as questionmaster, for the <a href="Sky%20Atlantic">Sky Atlantic</a> channel, called "<a href="Cleverdicks">Cleverdicks</a>". The show ran for one series with 30 one-hour episodes. It featured four contestants, usually high quality members of the UK national quiz circuit and ended with a money round for the winner of each show.

On 23 April 2012, Widdecombe presented an hour-long documentary for <a href="BBC%20Radio%205%20Live">BBC Radio 5 Live</a>, "Drunk Again: Ann Widdecombe Investigates", looking at how the British attitude to getting drunk has changed over the last few years.

In October 2014, she appeared in the BBC series "<a href="Antiques%20Road%20Trip">Celebrity Antiques Road Trip</a>", partnered with expert <a href="Mark%20Stacey">Mark Stacey</a>, where the pair beat the rival team of <a href="Craig%20Revel%20Horwood">Craig Revel Horwood</a> and Catherine Southon.

Widdecombe was a part of television series "<a href="24%20Hours%20in%20the%20Past">24 Hours in the Past</a>", along with Colin Jackson, Alistair McGowan, Miquita Oliver, Tyger Drew-Honey and Zoe Lucker.

Aurangzeb

Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad (3 November 1618 – 3 March 1707), commonly known by the sobriquet Aurangzeb (<a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>: "Ornament of the Throne") or by his regnal title Alamgir (Persian: "Conqueror of the World"), was the sixth, and widely considered the last effective <a href="Mughal%20emperors">Mughal emperor</a>. His reign lasted for 49 years from 1658 until his death in 1707.

Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and during his reign, the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a> reached its greatest extent, ruling over nearly all of the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>. During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres, and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects, with an annual yearly revenue of $450 million (more than ten times that of his contemporary <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a>), or £38,624,680 (2,879,469,894 rupees) in 1690. Under his reign, India surpassed <a href="China">China</a> to become the world's largest economy, worth over $90 billion, nearly a quarter of <a href="world%20GDP">world GDP</a> in 1700.

Aurangzeb is considered one of India's most controversial kings. Some historians argue that his policies abandoned his predecessors' legacy of pluralism and religious tolerance, citing his destruction of <a href="Hindu%20temple">Hindu temple</a>s and execution of a <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> guru, while other historians question this, arguing that his destruction of temples has been exaggerated and were politically motivated, and noting that he built more temples than he destroyed, also destroyed Islamic <a href="mosque">mosque</a>s, paid for the maintenance of temples, employed significantly more <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>s in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, and opposed bigotry against Hindus and <a href="Shia%20Muslims">Shia Muslims</a>.

It was at the end of his reign that the downfall of the Mughal Empire began. Rebellions and wars eventually led to the exhaustion of the imperial Mughal treasury and army. He was a strong-handed authoritarian ruler, and following his death the expansionary period of the Mughal Empire came to an end. Nevertheless, the contiguous territory of the Mughal Empire still remained intact more or less until the reign of <a href="Muhammad%20Shah">Muhammad Shah</a>.

Aurangzeb was born on 3 November 1618, in <a href="Dahod">Dahod</a>, Gujarat. He was the third son and sixth child of <a href="Shah%20Jahan">Shah Jahan</a> and <a href="Mumtaz%20Mahal">Mumtaz Mahal</a>. In June 1626, after an unsuccessful rebellion by his father, Aurangzeb and his brother <a href="Dara%20Shukoh">Dara Shukoh</a> were kept as hostages under their grandparents' (<a href="Nur%20Jahan">Nur Jahan</a> and <a href="Jahangir">Jahangir</a>) <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a> court. On 26 February 1628, Shah Jahan was officially declared the Mughal Emperor, and Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents at <a href="Agra%20Fort">Agra Fort</a>, where Aurangzeb received his formal education in <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> and <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>. His daily allowance was fixed at Rs. 500, which he spent on religious education and the study of history.

On 28 May 1633, Aurangzeb escaped death when a powerful <a href="war%20elephant">war elephant</a> stampeded through the Mughal Imperial encampment. He rode against the elephant and struck its trunk with a <a href="lance">lance</a>, and successfully defended himself from being crushed. Aurangzeb's valour was appreciated by his father who conferred him the title of "<a href="Rao%20Bahadur">Bahadur</a>" (Brave) and had him weighed in gold and presented gifts worth Rs. 200,000. This event was celebrated in Persian and <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> verses, and Aurangzeb said:

Aurangzeb was nominally in charge of the force sent to <a href="Bundelkhand">Bundelkhand</a> with the intent of subduing the rebellious ruler of <a href="Orchha%20State">Orchha</a>, <a href="Jhujhar%20Singh">Jhujhar Singh</a>, who had attacked another territory in defiance of Shah Jahan's policy and was refusing to atone for his actions. By arrangement, Aurangzeb stayed in the rear, away from the fighting, and took the advice of his generals as the <a href="Mughal%20Army">Mughal Army</a> gathered and commenced the Siege of Orchha in 1635.The campaign was successful and Singh was removed from power.

Aurangzeb was appointed viceroy of the <a href="Deccan">Deccan</a> in 1636. After Shah Jahan's vassals had been devastated by the alarming expansion of <a href="Ahmednagar">Ahmednagar</a> during the reign of the <a href="Nizam%20Shahi">Nizam Shahi</a> boy-prince <a href="Murtaza%20Shah%20III">Murtaza Shah III</a>, the emperor dispatched Aurangzeb, who in 1636 brought the Nizam Shahi dynasty to an end. In 1637, Aurangzeb married the <a href="Safavid">Safavid</a> princess <a href="Dilras%20Banu%20Begum">Dilras Banu Begum</a>, posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani. She was his first wife and chief consort as well as his favourite. He also had an infatuation with a slave girl, Hira Bai, whose death at a young age greatly affected him. In his old age, he was under the charms of his concubine, Udaipuri Bai. The latter had formerly been a companion to Dara Shikoh. In the same year, 1637, Aurangzeb was placed in charge of annexing the small <a href="Rajput">Rajput</a> kingdom of <a href="Baglana">Baglana</a>, which he did with ease.

In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister, <a href="Jahanara%20Begum%20Sahib">Jahanara</a>, was burned when the chemicals in her perfume were ignited by a nearby lamp while in <a href="Agra">Agra</a>. This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure by not returning to Agra immediately but rather three weeks later. Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara back to health in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects. Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of viceroy of the Deccan; Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor. Other sources tell us that Aurangzeb was dismissed from his position because Aurangzeb left the life of luxury and became a Faqir.

In 1645, he was barred from the court for seven months and mentioned his grief to fellow Mughal commanders. Thereafter, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of Gujarat where he served well and was rewarded for bringing stability.

In 1647, Shah Jahan moved Aurangzeb from Gujarat to be governor of <a href="Balkh">Balkh</a>, replacing a younger son, <a href="Murad%20Baksh">Murad Baksh</a>, who had proved ineffective there. The area was under attack from <a href="Uzbeks">Uzbek</a> and <a href="Turkmen%20people">Turkmen</a> tribes. Whilst the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through snow to <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a>. By the end of this two-year campaign, into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage, a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain.

Further inauspicious military involvements followed, as Aurangzeb was appointed governor of <a href="Multan">Multan</a> and <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a>. His efforts in 1649 and 1652 to dislodge the Safavids at <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, which they had recently retaken after a decade of Mughal control, both ended in failure as winter approached. The logistical problems of supplying an army at the extremity of the empire, combined with the poor quality of armaments and the intransigence of the opposition have been cited by John Richards as the reasons for failure, and a third attempt in 1653, led by Dara Shikoh, met with the same outcome.

Aurangzeb became viceroy of the Deccan again after he was replaced by Dara Shikoh in the attempt to recapture Kandahar. Aurangzeb regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's two "<a href="jagir">jagir</a>s" (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required from <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a> and Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that things could be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation. Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khan to extend to the Deccan the "zabt" revenue system used in northern India. Murshid Quli Khan organised a survey of agricultural land and a tax assessment on what it produced. To increase revenue, Murshid Quli Khan granted loans for seed, livestock, and irrigation infrastructure. The Deccan returned to prosperity, but too slowly to satisfy the emperor.

Aurangzeb proposed to resolve the situation by attacking the dynastic occupants of <a href="Golconda">Golconda</a> (the <a href="Qutb%20Shahi">Qutb Shahi</a>s) and <a href="Bijapur%20district%2C%20Karnataka">Bijapur</a> (the <a href="Adil%20Shahi">Adil Shahi</a>s). As an adjunct to resolving the financial difficulties, the proposal would also extend Mughal influence by accruing more lands. Again, he was to feel that Dara had exerted influence on his father: believing that he was on the verge of victory in both instances, Aurangzeb was frustrated that Shah Jahan chose then to settle for negotiations with the opposing forces rather than pushing for complete victory.

The four sons of Shah Jahan all held governorships during their father's reign. The emperor favoured the eldest, <a href="Dara%20Shukoh">Dara Shukoh</a>. This had caused resentment among the younger three, who sought at various times to strengthen alliances between themselves and against Dara. There was no Mughal tradition of <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, the systematic passing of rule, upon an emperor's death, to his eldest son. Instead it was customary for sons to overthrow their father and for brothers to war to the death among themselves. Historian <a href="Satish%20Chandra">Satish Chandra</a> says that "In the ultimate resort, connections among the powerful military leaders, and military strength and capacity [were] the real arbiters". The contest for power was primarily between Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb because, although all four sons had demonstrated competence in their official roles, it was around these two that the supporting cast of officials and other influential people mostly circulated. There were ideological differences — Dara was an intellectual and a religious liberal in the mould of Akbar, while Aurangzeb was much more conservative — but, as historians <a href="Barbara%20D.%20Metcalf">Barbara D. Metcalf</a> and <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Metcalf">Thomas R. Metcalf</a> say, "To focus on divergent philosophies neglects the fact that Dara was a poor general and leader. It also ignores the fact that factional lines in the succession dispute were not, by and large, shaped by ideology." Marc Gaborieau, professor of Indian studies at l'<a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Hautes%20%C3%89tudes%20en%20Sciences%20Sociales">École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales</a>, explains that "The loyalties of [officials and their armed contingents] seem to have been motivated more by their own interests, the closeness of the family relation and above all the charisma of the pretenders than by ideological divides." Muslims and Hindus did not divide along religious lines in their support for one pretender or the other nor, according to Chandra, is there much evidence to support the belief that Jahanara and other members of the royal family were split in their support. Jahanara, certainly, interceded at various times on behalf of all of the princes and was well-regarded by Aurangzeb even though she shared the religious outlook of Dara.

In 1656, a general under <a href="Qutb%20Shahi%20dynasty">Qutb Shahi dynasty</a> named Musa Khan led an army of 12,000 Musketeers to attack Aurangzeb, and later on the same campaign Aurangzeb in turn rode against an army consisting 8,000 horsemen and 20,000 <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> Musketeers

Having made clear that he wanted Dara to succeed him, Shah Jahan became ill with <a href="stranguary">stranguary</a> in 1657 and was closeted under the care of his favourite son in the newly built city of <a href="Shahjahanabad">Shahjahanabad</a> (Old Delhi). Rumours of the death of Shah Jahan abounded and the younger sons were concerned that Dara might be hiding it for <a href="Machiavellian">Machiavellian</a> reasons. Thus, they took action: <a href="Shah%20Shuja%20%28Mughal%29">Shah Shuja</a> prepared to contest the throne from <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>, where he had been governor since 1637, while Murad did the same in his governorship of Gujarat and Aurangzeb did so in the Deccan. It is not known whether these preparations were made in the mistaken belief that the rumours of death were true or whether the challengers were just taking advantage of the situation.

After regaining some of his health, Shah Jahan moved to Agra and Dara urged him to send forces to challenge Shah Shuja and Murad, who had declared themselves rulers in their respective territories. While Shah Shuja was defeated at <a href="Varanasi">Banares</a> in February 1658, the army sent to deal with Murad discovered to their surprise that he and Aurangzeb had combined their forces, the two brothers having agreed to partition the empire once they had gained control of it. The two armies clashed at Dharmat in April 1658, with Aurangzeb being the victor. Shuja was being chased through <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a> and the victory of Aurangzeb proved this to be a poor decision by Dara Shikoh, who now had a defeated force on one front and a successful force unnecessarily pre-occupied on another. Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzeb's advance, Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates. When Dara's disparate, hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzeb's well-disciplined, battle-hardened force at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Samugarh">Battle of Samugarh</a> in late May, neither Dara's men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb. Dara had also become over-confident in his own abilities and, by ignoring advice not to lead in battle while his father was alive, he cemented the idea that he had usurped the throne. "After the defeat of Dara, Shah Jahan was imprisoned in the fort of Agra where he spent eight long years under the care of his favourite daughter Jahanara."

Aurangzeb then broke his arrangement with Murad Baksh, which probably had been his intention all along. Instead of looking to partition the empire between himself and Murad, he had his brother arrested and imprisoned at Gwalior Fort. Murad was executed on 4 December 1661, ostensibly for the murder of the "<a href="Diwan%20%28title%29">diwan</a>" of Gujarat some time earlier. The allegation was encouraged by Aurangzeb, who caused the "diwan's" son to seek retribution for the death under the principles of <a href="Sharia%20law">Sharia law</a>. Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to the <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab</a>. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generals <a href="Jai%20Singh%20I">Jai Singh</a> and Dilir Khan submitted to Aurangzeb, but Dara's son, Suleiman Shikoh, escaped. Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal. This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja, who had declared himself emperor in Bengal began to annex more territory and this prompted Aurangzeb to march from Punjab with a new and large army that fought during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Khajwa">Battle of Khajwa</a>, where Shah Shuja and his <a href="chain%20mail">chain-mail</a> armoured war elephants were routed by the forces loyal to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja then fled to <a href="Rakhine%20State">Arakan</a> (in present-day Burma), where he was executed by the local rulers.

With Shuja and Murad disposed of, and with his father immured in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara Shikoh, chasing him across the north-western bounds of the empire. Aurangzeb claimed that Dara was no longer a Muslim and accused him of poisoning the Mughal <a href="Grand%20Vizier">Grand Vizier</a> Saadullah Khan. Both of these statements however lacked any evidence. After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him. In 1658, Aurangzeb arranged his formal coronation in Delhi.

On 10 August 1659, Dara was executed on grounds of apostasy and his head was sent to Shahjahan. Having secured his position, Aurangzeb confined his frail father at the Agra Fort but did not mistreat him. Shah Jahan was cared for by Jahanara and died in 1666.

Aurangzeb's imperial bureaucracy employed significantly more <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>s than that of his predecessors. Between 1679 and 1707, the number of Hindu officials in the Mughal administration rose by half, many of them <a href="Marathas">Marathas</a> and <a href="Rajputs">Rajputs</a>. His increasing employment of Hindus and <a href="Shia%20Muslim">Shia Muslim</a>s was deemed controversial at the time, with several of his fellow <a href="Sunni%20Muslim">Sunni Muslim</a> officials petitioning against it, which he rejected, and responded, "What connection have earthly affairs with religion? And what right have administrative works to meddle with bigotry? 'For you is your religion and for me is mine.'" He insisted on employment based on ability rather than religion.

Under Aurangzeb's reign, Hindus rose to represent 31.6% of Mughal nobility, the highest in the Mughal era. This was largely due to a substantial influx of Marathas, who played a key role in his successful <a href="Deccan">Deccan</a> campaign. During his time, the number of Hindu Mansabdars increased from 22% to over 31% in the Mughal administration, as he needed them to continue his fight in the Deccan. However, one of his Rajput nobles, <a href="Jaswant%20Singh%20of%20Marwar">Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur</a>, Hindu ruler of <a href="Jodhpur">Jodhpur</a>, “destroyed <a href="mosques">mosques</a> and built idol-temples in their stead” around 1658-1659, according to Aurangzeb. Despite this, relationships did not turn sour between the two, as they worked together for the next two decades up until Singh's death in the late 1670s.

Historian Katherine Brown has noted that "The very name of Aurangzeb seems to act in the popular imagination as a signifier of politico-religious bigotry and repression, regardless of historical accuracy." The subject is controversial and, despite no proof, has resonated in modern times with popularly accepted claims that he intended to destroy the <a href="Bamiyan%20Buddhas">Bamiyan Buddhas</a>. As a political and religious conservative, Aurangzeb chose not to follow the liberal religious viewpoints of his predecessors after his ascension. Shah Jahan had already moved away from the liberalism of <a href="Akbar">Akbar</a>, although in a token manner rather than with the intent of suppressing Hinduism, and Aurangzeb took the change still further. Though the approach to faith of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan was more syncretic than <a href="Babur">Babur</a>, the founder of the empire, Aurangzeb's position is not so obvious. His emphasis on <a href="sharia">sharia</a> competed, or was directly in conflict, with his insistence that "zawabit" or secular decrees could supersede sharia. Despite claims of sweeping edicts and policies, contradictory accounts exist. He sought to codify <a href="Hanafi">Hanafi</a> law by the work of several hundred jurists, called <a href="Fatawa-e-Alamgiri">Fatawa-e-Alamgiri</a>. It is possible the War of Succession and continued incursions combined with Shah Jahan's spending made cultural expenditure impossible.

As emperor, Aurangzeb banned the drinking of alcohol, gambling, castration, servitude, <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a>s, music, <a href="nautch">nautch</a> and <a href="narcotic">narcotic</a>s in the Mughal Empire. He learnt that at <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a>, <a href="Multan">Multan</a>, <a href="Thatta">Thatta</a> and particularly at <a href="Varanasi">Varanasi</a>, the Hindu <a href="Brahmins">Brahmins</a> attracted large numbers of indigenous local Muslims to their discourses. He ordered the Subahdars of these provinces to demolish the schools and the temples of non-Muslims. Aurangzeb also ordered Subahdars to punish Muslims who dressed like non-Muslims. The executions of the <a href="antinomian">antinomian</a> Sufi mystic <a href="Sarmad%20Kashani">Sarmad Kashani</a> and the ninth Sikh Guru <a href="Tegh%20Bahadur">Tegh Bahadur</a> bear testimony to Aurangzeb's religious policy; the former was beheaded on multiple accounts of heresy, the latter, according to Sikhs, because he objected to Aurangzeb's <a href="forced%20conversion">forced conversion</a>s.

He imposed <a href="Jizya">Jizya</a>, a military tax on non-Muslims who were not fighting for Mughal Empire in his second decade on ruling in the year 1679. Further, Aurangzeb levied discriminatory taxes on Hindu merchants at the rate of 5% as against 2.5% on Muslim merchants. He ordered to dismiss Hindu "quanungos" and "patwaris" from revenue administration. However, he also employed many Hindus as Jizya tax collectors.

The introduction of Jizya in 1679 was a response to several events shortly before its introduction: the great <a href="Rajput">Rajput</a> rebellion of 1678, the Maratha alliance with the <a href="Shia">Shia</a> <a href="Golconda">Golconda</a>, and the Mughal expansion into the Deccan. However, the contemporary historian Khafi Khan (died 1733), whose family had served Aurangzeb, noted that Jizya could not be levied and remained largely a tax on paper only.

During his reign, Aurangzeb generally maintained a similar policy on both <a href="Hindu%20temple">Hindu temple</a>s and Islamic <a href="mosque">mosque</a>s. Like his predecessors, he issued land grants for the maintenance of Hindu temples. However, he also ordered the destruction of temples and mosques. For example, he ordered the destruction of <a href="Kashi%20Vishwanath%20Temple">Vishvanath Temple</a> at <a href="Varanasi">Varanasi</a> for being a centre of conspiracy against the state, and he ordered the destruction of the <a href="Jama%20Masjid">Jama Masjid</a> at <a href="Golkonda">Golkunda</a> after finding out that its ruler had built the mosque in order to hide revenues from the state. Aurangzeb also ordered a <a href="rescue">rescue</a> raid on a temple, in order to rescue a <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> minister's female family members who went there on a <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>.

Aurangzeb's policy on temples was mixed: he destroyed many, but also built many, building more temples than he destroyed. During his reign, 15 temples were destroyed. Indian historian <a href="Harbans%20Mukhia">Harbans Mukhia</a> wrote: "In the end, as recently recorded in Richard Eaton's careful tabulation, some 80 temples were demolished between 1192 and 1760 (15 in Aurangzeb's reign) and he compares this figure with the claim of 60,000 demolitions, advanced rather nonchalantly by '<a href="Hindu%20nationalist">Hindu nationalist</a>' <a href="propagandists">propagandists</a>, although even in that camp professional historians are slightly more moderate." Among the Hindu temples he demolished were three of the most sacred, the <a href="Kashi%20Vishwanath%20temple">Kashi Vishwanath temple</a>, <a href="Kesava%20Deo%20temple">Kesava Deo temple</a>, and <a href="Somnath%20temple">Somnath temple</a>, and built large mosques in their place. In 1679, he ordered destruction of several prominent temples that had become associated with his enemies: these included the temples of Khandela, Udaipur, Chittor and Jodhpur. The historian Richard Eaton argues that the overall understanding of temples to be flawed. As early as the sixth century, temples became vital political landmarks as well as religious ones. He writes that, not only was temple desecration widely practised and accepted, it was a necessary part of political struggle.

Other scholars point out that Aurangzeb also built many temples; Ian Copland says that he built more temples than he destroyed. <a href="Ram%20Puniyani">Ram Puniyani</a> states that Aurangzeb was not always fanatically anti-Hindu, and kept changing his policies depending on the needs of the situation. He banned the construction of new temples, but permitted the repair and maintenance of existing temples. He also made generous donations of "jagirs" to several temples to win the sympathies of his Hindu subjects. There are several "firman"s (orders) in his name, supporting temples and <a href="gurudwara">gurudwara</a>s, including <a href="Mahakaleshwar%20Jyotirlinga">Mahakaleshwar temple</a> of <a href="Ujjain">Ujjain</a>, Balaji temple of <a href="Chitrakoot%20district">Chitrakoot</a>, <a href="Umananda%20Temple">Umananda Temple</a> of <a href="Guwahati">Guwahati</a> and the <a href="Shatrunjaya">Shatrunjaya</a> <a href="Jain">Jain</a> temples.

The first prominent execution during the long reign of Aurangzeb started with that of his brother Prince <a href="Dara%20Shikoh">Dara Shikoh</a>, who was accused of being influenced by Hinduism although some sources argue it was done for political reasons. Aurangzeb had his allied brother Prince <a href="Murad%20Baksh">Murad Baksh</a> held for murder, judged and then executed. Aurangzeb is accused of poisoning his imprisoned nephew <a href="Sulaiman%20Shikoh">Sulaiman Shikoh</a>.

Later, <a href="Sambhaji">Sambhaji</a> was executed during his reign. In a trial, he was found guilty of murder and violence, atrocities against the Muslims of <a href="Burhanpur">Burhanpur</a> and Bahadurpur in <a href="Berar%20Subah">Berar</a> by Marathas under his command. The atrocities that Sambhaji perpetrated included plunder, killing, rape, and torture, when he raided Burhanpur with 20,000 troops. The <a href="ulema">ulema</a> of the Mughal Empire sentenced him to death for his atrocities against Muslims.

The <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> leader <a href="Guru%20Tegh%20Bahadur">Guru Tegh Bahadur</a> was arrested on orders by Aurangzeb, found guilty of blasphemy by a <a href="Qadi">Qadi</a>'s court and executed.

32 nd Da'i al-Mutlaq (Absolute Missionary) of the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Musta‘lī Islam Syedna Qutubkhan Qutubuddin was executed by Aurangzeb, then governor of Gujarat, for heresy; on 27 Jumadil Akhir 1056 AH/ 1648 AD), Ahmedabad, India.

Throughout his reign, Aurangzeb engaged in almost constant warfare. He built up a massive army and began a program of military expansion along all the boundaries of his empire. He pushed north-west into the <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab</a> and also drove south, conquering two further Muslim kingdoms - the Adil Shahis of Bijapur and Qutbshahis of Golconda — to add to the defeat of the <a href="Ahmednagar%20Sultanate">Ahmednagar Sultanate</a> that had been accomplished in 1636 while he had been viceroy of the Deccan. These new territories were administered by the Mughal <a href="Nawab">Nawab</a>s loyal to Aurangzeb.

Soon after seizing the throne, Aurangzeb began advancements against the unruly <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> of Bijapur and during 1657, the Mughals are known to have utilised <a href="rocket">rocket</a>s during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Bidar">Siege of Bidar</a>, against <a href="Sidi%20Marjan">Sidi Marjan</a>. Aurangzeb's forces discharged rockets and grenades while scaling the walls, and Sidi Marjan himself was mortally wounded after a rocket struck his large gunpowder depot. After twenty-seven days of hard fighting, <a href="Bidar">Bidar</a> was captured by the Mughals.

In 1663, during his visit to <a href="Ladakh">Ladakh</a>, Aurangzeb established direct control over that part of the empire and loyal subjects such as Deldan Namgyal agreed to pledge tribute and loyalty. Deldan Namgyal is also known to have constructed a Grand Mosque in <a href="Leh">Leh</a>, which he dedicated to Mughal rule.

In 1664, Aurangzeb appointed <a href="Shaista%20Khan">Shaista Khan</a> <a href="subedar">subedar</a> (governor) of Bengal. Shaista Khan eliminated Portuguese and <a href="Arakanese%20people">Arakanese</a> pirates from the region, and in 1666 recaptured the port of <a href="Chittagong">Chittagong</a> from the Arakanese king, <a href="Sanda%20Thudhamma">Sanda Thudhamma</a>. Chittagong remained a key port throughout Mughal rule.

In 1685, Aurangzeb dispatched his son, <a href="Muhammad%20Azam%20Shah">Muhammad Azam Shah</a>, with a force of nearly 50,000 men to capture <a href="Bijapur%20Fort">Bijapur Fort</a> and defeat <a href="Sikandar%20Adil%20Shah">Sikandar Adil Shah</a> (the ruler of Bijapur) who refused to be a vassal. The Mughals could not make any advancements upon Bijapur Fort mainly because of the superior usage of cannon batteries on both sides. Outraged by the stalemate Aurangzeb himself arrived on 4 September 1686 and commanded the <a href="Siege%20of%20Bijapur">Siege of Bijapur</a>; after eight days of fighting, the Mughals were victorious.

Only one remaining ruler, <a href="Abul%20Hasan%20Qutb%20Shah">Abul Hasan Qutb Shah</a> (the Qutbshahi ruler of Golconda), refused to surrender. He and his servicemen fortified themselves at Golconda and fiercely protected the <a href="Kollur%20Mine">Kollur Mine</a>, which was then probably the world's most productive diamond mine, and an important economic asset. In 1687, Aurangzeb led his grand Mughal army against the Deccan Qutbshahi fortress during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Golconda">Siege of Golconda</a>. The Qutbshahis had constructed massive fortifications throughout successive generations on a <a href="granite">granite</a> hill over 400 ft high with an enormous eight-mile long wall enclosing the city. The main gates of Golconda had the ability to repulse any war elephant attack. Although the Qutbshahis maintained the impregnability of their walls, at night Aurangzeb and his infantry erected complex <a href="scaffold">scaffold</a>ing that allowed them to scale the high walls. During the eight-month siege the Mughals faced many hardships including the death of their experienced commander <a href="Kilich%20Khan%20II">Kilich Khan Bahadur</a>. Eventually, Aurangzeb and his forces managed to penetrate the walls by capturing a gate, and their entry into the fort led Abul Hasan Qutb Shah to surrender peacefully.

Mughal <a href="cannon">cannon</a> making skills advanced during the 17th century. One of the most impressive Mughal cannons is known as the <a href="Zafarbaksh">Zafarbaksh</a>, which is a very rare "composite cannon", that required skills in both wrought-iron forge welding and <a href="bronze">bronze</a>-casting technologies and the in-depth knowledge of the qualities of both metals.

Aurangzeb military entourage consisted of 16 cannons including the "Azdaha Paikar" (which, was capable of firing a 33.5 kg ordnance) and "Fateh Rahber" (20 feet long with Persian and Arabic inscriptions).

The "Ibrahim Rauza" was also a famed cannon, which was well known for its multi-barrels. François Bernier, the personal physician to Aurangzeb, observed versatile Mughal gun-carriages each drawn by two horses.

Despite these innovations, most soldiers used bows and arrows, the quality of sword manufacture was so poor that they preferred to use ones imported from England, and the operation of the cannons was entrusted not to Mughals but to European gunners. Other weapons used during the period included rockets, cauldrons of boiling oil, muskets and <a href="manjaniq">manjaniq</a>s (stone-throwing catapults).

Infantry who were later called <a href="Sepoy">Sepoy</a> and who specialised in siege and artillery emerged during the reign of Aurangzeb

In 1703, the Mughal commander at <a href="Coromandel%20Coast">Coromandel</a>, Daud Khan Panni spent 10,500 coins to purchase 30 to 50 <a href="war%20elephant">war elephant</a>s from <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>.

Aurangzeb was known to be of a more austere nature than his predecessors. Being religious he encouraged Islamic calligraphy. His reign also saw the building of the Lahore badshahi Mosque, and Bibi ka Maqbara in Aurangabad for his wife Rabia-ud-Daurani.

The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb is known to have patronised works of Islamic Calligraphy during his reign particularly <a href="Syed%20Ali%20Tabrizi">Syed Ali Tabrizi</a>.

Unlike his father, Aurangzeb was not much interested in architecture. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the <a href="Moti%20Masjid%20%28Delhi%29">Moti Masjid</a> (Pearl Mosque) in the <a href="Red%20Fort">Red Fort</a> complex in Delhi. He ordered the construction of the <a href="Badshahi%20Mosque">Badshahi Mosque</a> in <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>. He also constructed a mosque on <a href="Benares">Benares</a>. The mosque he constructed in Srinagar is still the largest in <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>. The structure of <a href="Bibi%20Ka%20Maqbara">Bibi Ka Maqbara</a> in Aurangabad, which now is a historical monument was constructed by the sons of Aurangzeb in remembrance of their mother. The inspiration came from Taj mahal as is quite visible from its architecture.

The textile industry in the Mughal Empire emerged very firmly during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and was particularly well noted by Francois Bernier, a French physician of the Mughal Emperor. Francois Bernier writes how "Karkanahs", or workshops for the artisans, particularly in textiles flourished by "employing hundreds of embroiderers, who were superintended by a master". He further writes how "Artisans manufacture of silk, fine brocade, and other fine muslins, of which are made turbans, robes of gold flowers, and tunics worn by females, so delicately fine as to wear out in one night, and cost even more if they were well embroidered with fine needlework".

He also explains the different techniques employed to produce such complicated textiles such as "Himru" (whose name is Persian for "brocade"), "Paithani" (whose pattern is identical on both sides), "Mushru" (satin weave) and how "Kalamkari", in which fabrics are painted or block-printed, was a technique that originally came from Persia. Francois Bernier provided some of the first, impressive descriptions of the designs and the soft, delicate texture of <a href="Shawl">Pashmina Shawls</a> also known as "Kani", which were very valued for their warmth and comfort among the Mughals, and how these textiles and shawls eventually began to find their way to France and England.

As soon as he became emperor, Aurangzeb sent some of the finest ornate gifts such as carpets, lamps, <a href="tile">tile</a>s and others to the Islamic shrines at <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> and <a href="Medina">Medina</a>. He also ordered the construction of very large ships in <a href="Surat">Surat</a> that would transport these gifts and even pilgrims to the <a href="Hijaz">Hijaz</a>. These annual expeditions organised by Aurangzeb were led by Mir Aziz Badakhshi who died in Mecca of natural causes but managed to deliver more than 45,000 silver coins and several thousand <a href="Kaftan">Kaftan</a>s of honour.

Subhan Quli, <a href="Balkh">Balkh</a>'s Uzbek ruler was the first to recognise him in 1658 and requested for a general alliance, he worked alongside the new Mughal Emperor since 1647, when Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Balkh.

Aurangzeb received the embassy of <a href="Abbas%20II%20of%20Persia">Abbas II of Persia</a> in 1660 and returned them with gifts. However relations between the Mughal Empire and the <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid dynasty</a> were tense because the Persians attacked the Mughal army positioned near <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>. Aurangzeb prepared his armies in the Indus River Basin for a counteroffensive, but Abbas II's death in 1666 caused Aurangzeb to end all hostilities. Aurangzeb's rebellious son, <a href="Sultan%20Muhammad%20Akbar">Sultan Muhammad Akbar</a>, sought refuge with <a href="Suleiman%20I%20of%20Persia">Suleiman I of Persia</a>, who had rescued him from the <a href="Imam">Imam</a> of <a href="Musqat">Musqat</a> and later refused to assist him in any military adventures against Aurangzeb.

In 1667, the French East India Company ambassadors Le Gouz and Bebert presented <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a>'s letter which urged the protection of French merchants from various rebels in the Deccan. In response to the letter Aurangzeb issued a <a href="Firman">Firman</a> allowing the French to open a factory in <a href="Surat">Surat</a>.

In the 1660s, the Sultan of the Maldives, <a href="Ibrahim%20Iskandar%20I">Ibrahim Iskandar I</a>, requested help from Aurangzeb's representative, the <a href="Faujdar">Faujdar</a> of <a href="Balasore">Balasore</a>. The sultan was concerned about the impact of Dutch and English trading ships but the powers of Aurangzeb did not extend to the seas, the Maldives were not under his governance and nothing came of the request.

In 1688, the desperate <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> Sultan <a href="Suleiman%20II">Suleiman II</a> urgently requested for assistance against the rapidly advancing <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austrians</a>, during the <a href="Great%20Turkish%20War">Ottoman–Habsburg War</a>. However, Aurangzeb and his forces were heavily engaged in the Deccan Wars against the <a href="Marathas">Marathas</a> to commit any formal assistance to their Ottoman allies.

In 1686, the English East India Company, which had unsuccessfully tried to obtain a <a href="firman">firman</a>, an imperial directive that would grant England regular trading privileges throughout the Mughal empire, initiated the so-called <a href="Child%27s%20War">Child's War</a>. This hostility against the empire ended in disaster for the English, particularly when Aurangzeb dispatched a strong fleet from <a href="Janjira%20State">Janjira</a> commanded by the <a href="Sidi%20Yaqub">Sidi Yaqub</a> and manned by <a href="Mappila">Mappila</a> loyal to <a href="Arakkal%20kingdom">Ali Raja Ali II</a> and <a href="People%20of%20Ethiopia">Abyssinian</a> sailors firmly blockaded Bombay in 1689. In 1690, the company sent envoys to Aurangzeb's camp to plead for a pardon. The company's envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large indemnity, and promise better behaviour in the future.

In September 1695, English pirate <a href="Henry%20Every">Henry Every</a> perpetrated one of the most profitable pirate raids in history with his capture of a Grand Mughal convoy near <a href="Surat">Surat</a>. The Indian ships had been returning home from their annual pilgrimage to Mecca when the pirates struck, capturing the "<a href="Ganj-i-Sawai">Ganj-i-Sawai</a>", reportedly the greatest ship in the Muslim fleet, and its escorts in the process. When news of the piracy reached the mainland, a livid Aurangzeb nearly ordered an armed attack against the English-governed city of <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a>, though he finally agreed to compromise after the East India Company promised to pay financial reparations, estimated at £600,000 by the Mughal authorities. Meanwhile, Aurangzeb shut down four of the East India Company's <a href="Factory%20%28trading%20post%29">factories</a>, imprisoned the workers and captains (who were nearly lynched by a rioting mob), and threatened to put an end to all English trading in India until Every was captured. The Privy Council and East India Company offered a massive bounty for Every's apprehension, leading to the first worldwide manhunt in recorded history. However, Every successfully eluded capture.

In 1702, Aurangzeb sent <a href="Daud%20Khan%20Panni">Daud Khan Panni</a>, the Mughal Empire's Subhedar of the <a href="Carnatic%20region">Carnatic region</a>, to besiege and blockade <a href="Fort%20St.%20George">Fort St. George</a> for more than three months. The governor of the fort <a href="Thomas%20Pitt">Thomas Pitt</a> was instructed by the English East India Company to sue for peace.

Aurangzeb's exchequer raised a record £100 million in annual revenue through various sources like taxes, customs and land revenue, "et al." from 24 provinces. He had an annual yearly revenue of $450 million, more than ten times that of his contemporary <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a>.

Aurangzeb felt that verses from the "Quran" should not be stamped on coins, as done in former times, because they were constantly touched by the hands and feet of people. His coins had the name of the mint city and the year of issue on one face, and, the following couplet on other:

By 1700, the Marathas attacked the Mughal provinces from the Deccan and secessionist agendas from the Rajputs, <a href="Hindu%20Jats">Hindu Jats</a>, <a href="Pashtuns">Pashtuns</a> and <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a>s rebelled against the Mughal Empire's administrative and economic systems.

In 1669, <a href="Hindu%20Jats">Hindu Jats</a> began to organise a rebellion that is believed to have been caused by Aurangzeb's imposition of <a href="Jizya">Jizya</a> (a form of organised religious taxation). The Jats were led by "<a href="Gokula">Gokula</a>", a rebel landholder from <a href="Tilpat">Tilpat</a>. By the year 1670 20,000 Jat rebels were quelled and the Mughal Army took control of Tilpat, Gokula's personal fortune amounted to 93,000 gold coins and hundreds of thousands of silver coins.

Gokula was caught and executed. But the Jats continued to terrorise the Mughals and attacked <a href="Akbar">Akbar</a>'s mausoleum the gold, silver and fine carpets within the tomb . There are claims that Jats caused two large silver doors at the entrance of the <a href="Taj%20Mahal">Taj Mahal</a> to be stolen and melted down. However, Jats later established their independent state of <a href="Bharatpur%2C%20India">Bharatpur</a>.

In 1657, while Aurangzeb attacked Golconda and Bijapur in the Deccan, the Hindu <a href="Maratha">Maratha</a> warrior aristocrat, <a href="Shivaji">Shivaji</a>, used guerrilla tactics to take control of three Adil Shahi forts formerly under his father's command. With these victories, Shivaji assumed de facto leadership of many independent Maratha clans. The Marathas harried the flanks of the warring Adil Shahis and Mughals, gaining weapons, forts, and territory. Shivaji's small and ill-equipped army survived an all out Adil Shahi attack, and Shivaji personally killed the Adil Shahi general, Afzal Khan. With this event, the Marathas transformed into a powerful military force, capturing more and more Adil Shahi and Mughal territories. Shivaji went on to neutralise Mughal power in the region.

In 1659, Aurangzeb sent his trusted general and maternal uncle Shaista Khan, the <a href="Wali">Wali</a> in Golconda to recover forts lost to the Maratha rebels. Shaista Khan drove into Maratha territory and took up residence in <a href="Pune">Pune</a>. But in a daring raid on the governor's palace in Pune during a midnight wedding celebration, the Marathas killed Shaista Khan's son and maimed Shaista Khan by cutting off the fingers of his hand. Shaista Khan, however, survived and was re-appointed the administrator of Bengal going on to become a key commander in the war against the Ahoms.

Shivaji captured forts belonging to both Mughals and Bijapur. At last Aurangzeb ordered the armament of the <a href="Daulatabad%2C%20Maharashtra">Daulatabad Fort</a> with two <a href="Bombard%20%28weapon%29">bombards</a> (the Daulatabad Fort was later utilised as a Mughal bastion during the Deccan Wars). Aurangzeb also sent his general <a href="Jai%20Singh%20I">Raja Jai Singh</a> of <a href="Amber%2C%20India">Amber</a>, a Hindu Rajput, to attack the Marathas. Jai Singh won the <a href="Purandar%20fort">fort of Purandar</a> after fierce battle in which the Maratha commander <a href="Murarbaji">Murarbaji</a> fell. Foreseeing defeat, Shivaji agreed for a truce and a meeting with Aurangzeb at Delhi. Jai Singh also promised Shivaji his safety, placing him under the care of his own son, the future Raja <a href="Ram%20Singh%20I">Ram Singh I</a>. However, circumstances at the Mughal court were beyond the control of the Raja, and when Shivaji and his son <a href="Sambhaji">Sambhaji</a> went to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, they were placed under house arrest, from which they managed to effect a daring escape.

Shivaji returned to the Deccan, and crowned himself "Chhatrapati" or the ruler of the Maratha Kingdom in 1674. While Aurangzeb continued to send troops against him, Shivaji expanded Maratha control throughout the Deccan until his death in 1680. Shivaji was succeeded by his son, Sambhaji. Militarily and politically, Mughal efforts to control the Deccan continued to fail.

On the other hand, Aurangzeb's third son <a href="Sultan%20Muhammad%20Akbar">Akbar</a> left the Mughal court along with a few Muslim Mansabdar supporters and joined Muslim rebels in the Deccan. Aurangzeb in response moved his court to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. The rebels were defeated and Akbar fled south to seek refuge with Sambhaji, Shivaji's successor. More battles ensued, and Akbar fled to <a href="Persia">Persia</a> and never returned.

In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured and executed Sambhaji. His successor <a href="Rajaram%20Chhatrapati">Rajaram</a>, later Rajaram's widow <a href="Tarabai">Tarabai</a> and their Maratha forces fought individual battles against the forces of the Mughal Empire. Territory changed hands repeatedly during the years (1689–1707) of interminable warfare . As there was no central authority among the Marathas, Aurangzeb was forced to contest every inch of territory, at great cost in lives and money. Even as Aurangzeb drove west, deep into Maratha territory – notably conquering <a href="Satara%20district">Satara</a> — the Marathas expanded their attacks further into Mughal lands – <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a>, <a href="Hyderabad%20State">Hyderabad</a> and <a href="Gingee">Jinji</a> in Tamil Nadu. Aurangzeb waged continuous war in the Deccan for more than two decades with no resolution. He thus lost about a fifth of his army fighting rebellions led by the Marathas in <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan India</a>. He travelled a long distance to the Deccan to conquer the Marathas and eventually died at the age of 90, still fighting the Marathas.

Aurangzeb's shift from conventional warfare to anti-insurgency in the Deccan region shifted the paradigm of Mughal military thought. There were conflicts between Marathas and Mughals in <a href="Pune">Pune</a>, Jinji, Malwa and <a href="Vadodara">Vadodara</a>. The Mughal Empire's port city of <a href="Surat">Surat</a> was sacked twice by the Marathas during the reign of Aurangzeb and the valuable port was in ruins.

While Aurangzeb and his brother Shah Shuja had been fighting against each other, the Hindu rulers of <a href="Kuch%20Behar">Kuch Behar</a> and <a href="Assam">Assam</a> took advantage of the disturbed conditions in the Mughal Empire, had invaded imperial dominions. For three years they were not attacked, but in 1660 <a href="Mir%20Jumla%20II">Mir Jumla II</a>, the viceroy of Bengal, was ordered to recover the lost territories.

The Mughals set out in November 1661, and within weeks occupied the capital of Kuch Behar after a few fierce skirmishes. The Kuch Behar was annexed, and the Mughal Army reorganised and began to retake their territories in Assam. Mir Jumla II's forces captured Pandu, <a href="Guwahati">Guwahati</a>, and Kajali practically unopposed. In February 1662, Mir Jumla II initiated the Siege of Simalugarh and after the Mughal <a href="cannon">cannon</a> breached the fortifications, the Ahoms abandoned the fort and escaped. Mir Jumla II then proceeded towards Garhgaon the capital of the <a href="Ahom%20kingdom">Ahom kingdom</a>, which was reached on 17 March 1662, although the ruler <a href="Raja">Raja</a> <a href="Sutamla">Sutamla</a> fled and the victorious Mughals captured 100 elephants, about 300,000 coins of silver, 8000 shields, 1000 ships, and 173 massive stores of rice.

Later that year in December 1663, the aged Mir Jumla II died on his way back to <a href="Dacca">Dacca</a> of natural causes, but skirmishes continued between the Mughals and Ahoms after the rise of <a href="Chakradhwaj%20Singha">Chakradhwaj Singha</a>, who refused to pay further indemnity to the Mughals and during the wars that continued the Mughals suffered great hardships. Munnawar Khan emerged as a leading figure and is known to have supplied food to vulnerable Mughal forces in the region near Mathurapur. Although the Mughals under the command of Syed Firoz Khan the <a href="Faujdar">Faujdar</a> at Guwahati were overrun by two Ahom armies in the year 1667, but they continued to hold and maintain presence along their the eastern territories even after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saraighat">Battle of Saraighat</a> in the year 1671.

The Battle of Saraighat was fought in 1671 between the Mughal empire (led by the Kachwaha king, Raja Ramsingh I), and the Ahom Kingdom (led by Lachit Borphukan) on the Brahmaputra river at Saraighat, now in Guwahati. Although much weaker, the Ahom Army defeated the Mughal Army by brilliant uses of the terrain, clever diplomatic negotiations to buy time, guerrilla tactics, psychological warfare, military intelligence and by exploiting the sole weakness of the Mughal forces—its navy.

The Battle of Saraighat was the last battle in the last major attempt by the Mughals to extend their empire into Assam. Though the Mughals managed to regain Guwahati briefly after a later Borphukan deserted it, the Ahoms wrested control in the Battle of Itakhuli in 1682 and maintained it till the end of their rule.

In May 1672, the Satnami sect obeying the commandments of an "old toothless woman" (according to Mughal accounts) organised a massive revolt in the agricultural heartlands of the Mughal Empire. The Satnamis were known to have shaved off their heads and even eyebrows and had temples in many regions of <a href="Northern%20India">Northern India</a>. They began a large-scale rebellion 75 miles southwest of <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>.

The Satnamis believed they were invulnerable to Mughal bullets and believed they could multiply in any region they entered. The Satnamis initiated their march upon Delhi and overran small-scale Mughal infantry units.

Aurangzeb responded by organising a <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Mughal%20Empire">Mughal army</a> of 10,000 troops and artillery, and dispatched detachments of his own personal Mughal imperial guards to carry out several tasks. To boost Mughal morale, Aurangzeb wrote Islamic prayers, made <a href="amulet">amulet</a>s, and drew designs that would become emblems in the Mughal Army. This rebellion would have a serious aftermath effect on the Punjab.

Early in Aurangzeb's reign, various insurgent groups of Sikhs engaged Mughal troops in increasingly bloody battles. The ninth Sikh Guru, <a href="Guru%20Tegh%20Bahadur">Guru Tegh Bahadur</a>, like his predecessors was opposed to conversion of the local population as he considered it wrong. According to Sikh sources, approached by <a href="Kashmiri%20Pandit">Kashmiri Pandit</a>s to help them retain their faith and avoid <a href="forced%20conversion">forced religious conversions</a>, Guru Tegh Bahadur took on Aurangzeb. The emperor perceived the rising popularity of the Guru as a threat to his sovereignty and in 1670 had him executed, which infuriated the Sikhs. In response, Guru Tegh Bahadur's son and successor, <a href="Guru%20Gobind%20Singh">Guru Gobind Singh</a>, further militarised his followers, starting with the establishment of <a href="Khalsa">Khalsa</a> in 1699, eight years before Aurangzeb's death. In 1705, Guru Gobind Singh sent a letter entitled "<a href="Zafarnama%20%28letter%29">Zafarnamah</a>" to Aurangzeb. This drew attention to Auranzeb's cruelty and how he had betrayed Islam. The letter caused him much distress and remorse. Guru Gobind Singh's formation of Khalsa in 1699 led to the establishment of the Sikh Confederacy and later <a href="Sikh%20Empire">Sikh Empire</a>.

The Pashtun revolt in 1672 under the leadership of the warrior poet <a href="Khushal%20Khan%20Khattak">Khushal Khan Khattak</a> of <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a>, was triggered when soldiers under the orders of the Mughal Governor Amir Khan allegedly molested women of the <a href="Pashtun%20tribes">Pashtun tribes</a> in modern-day <a href="Kunar%20Province">Kunar Province</a> of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. The Safi tribes retaliated against the soldiers. This attack provoked a reprisal, which triggered a general revolt of most of tribes. Attempting to reassert his authority, Amir Khan led a large Mughal Army to the <a href="Khyber%20Pass">Khyber Pass</a>, where the army was surrounded by tribesmen and routed, with only four men, including the Governor, managing to escape.

After that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority in the Pashtun belt. The closure of the important <a href="Attock">Attock</a>-<a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> trade route along the <a href="Grand%20Trunk%20road">Grand Trunk road</a> was particularly disastrous. By 1674, the situation had deteriorated to a point where Aurangzeb camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebels and partially suppressed the revolt, although they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route.

By 1689, almost all of <a href="Southern%20India">Southern India</a> was a part of the Mughal Empire and after the conquest of Golconda, Aurangzeb may have been the richest and most powerful man alive. Mughal victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres, with a population estimated to be over 158 million. But this supremacy was short-lived. Jos Gommans, Professor of Colonial and Global History at the <a href="University%20of%20Leiden">University of Leiden</a>, says that "... the highpoint of imperial centralisation under emperor Aurangzeb coincided with the start of the imperial downfall."

Aurangzeb's vast imperial campaigns against rebellion-affected areas of the Mughal Empire caused his opponents to exaggerate the "importance" of their rebellions. The results of his campaigns were made worse by the incompetence of his regional Nawabs.

Muslim views regarding Aurangzeb vary. Most Muslim historians believe that Aurangzeb was the last powerful ruler of an empire inevitably on the verge of decline. The major rebellions organised by the Sikhs and the Marathas had deep roots in the remote regions of the Mughal Empire.

Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury to be held in trust for the citizens of his empire. He made caps and copied the Quran to earn money for his use. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the <a href="Moti%20Masjid%20%28Delhi%29">Moti Masjid</a> (Pearl Mosque) in the <a href="Red%20Fort">Red Fort</a> complex in Delhi. However, his constant warfare, especially with the Marathas, drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy just as much as the wasteful personal spending and opulence of his predecessors. Aurangzeb knew he would not return to the throne after his final campaign against the Marathas in 1706, in which he was joined by newly emerging commanders in the Mughal army such as <a href="Sayyid%20Brothers">Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha</a>, <a href="Saadat%20Ali%20Khan%20I">Saadat Ali Khan</a> and <a href="Qamar-ud-din%20Khan%2C%20Asaf%20Jah%20I">Asaf Jah I</a>, and Daud Khan.

The Indologist <a href="Stanley%20Wolpert">Stanley Wolpert</a>, emeritus professor at <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a>, says that:

Even when ill and dying, Aurangzeb made sure that the populace knew he was still alive, for if they had thought otherwise then the turmoil of another war of succession was likely. He died in Ahmednagar on 20 February 1707 at the age of 88, having outlived many of his children. His modest open-air grave in <a href="Khuldabad">Khuldabad</a> expresses his deep devotion to his Islamic beliefs. It is sited in the courtyard of the shrine of the Sufi saint Shaikh Burhan-u'd-din Gharib, who was a disciple of <a href="Nizamuddin%20Auliya">Nizamuddin Auliya</a> of Delhi.

Brown writes that after his death, "a string of weak emperors, wars of succession, and coups by noblemen heralded the irrevocable weakening of Mughal power". She notes that the populist but "fairly old-fashioned" explanation for the decline is that there was a reaction to Aurangzeb's oppression. Aurangzeb's son, <a href="Bahadur%20Shah%20I">Bahadur Shah I</a>, succeeded him and the empire, both because of Aurangzeb's over-extension and because of Bahadur Shah's weak military and leadership qualities, entered a period of terminal decline. Immediately after Bahadur Shah occupied the throne, the <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha Empire</a> – which Aurangzeb had held at bay, inflicting high human and monetary costs even on his own empire – consolidated and launched effective invasions of Mughal territory, seizing power from the weak emperor. Within decades of Aurangzeb's death, the Mughal Emperor had little power beyond the walls of Delhi.

Aurangzeb's full imperial title was:

"Al-Sultan al-Azam wal Khaqan al-Mukarram Hazrat Abul Muzaffar Muhy-ud-Din Muhammad Aurangzeb Bahadur Alamgir I",
"Badshah Ghazi", 
"Shahanshah-e-Sultanat-ul-Hindiya Wal Mughaliya".

Alexandrine

Alexandrine is a name used for several distinct types of verse line with related <a href="Metre%20%28poetry%29">metrical</a> structures, most of which are ultimately derived from the classical <a href="French%20alexandrine">French alexandrine</a>. The line's name derives from its use in the Medieval French "<a href="Roman%20d%27Alexandre">Roman d'Alexandre</a>" of 1170, although it had already been used several decades earlier in "<a href="Le%20P%C3%A8lerinage%20de%20Charlemagne">Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne</a>". The foundation of most alexandrines consists of two hemistichs (half-lines) of six syllables each, separated by a caesura (a word break, though often realized as a stronger syntactic break):

However, no tradition remains this simple. Each applies additional constraints (such as obligatory stress or nonstress on certain syllables) and options (such as a permitted or required additional syllable at the end of one or both hemistichs). Thus a line that is metrical in one tradition may be unmetrical in another.

The term "alexandrine" may be used with greater or lesser rigor. Peureux suggests that only French syllabic verse with a 6+6 structure is, strictly speaking, an alexandrine. Preminger "et al". allow a broader scope: "Strictly speaking, the term 'alexandrine' is appropriate to French syllabic meters, and it may be applied to other metrical systems only where they too espouse syllabism as their principle, introduce phrasal accentuation, or rigorously observe the medial caesura, as in French." Common usage within the literatures of European languages is broader still, embracing lines syllabic, accentual-syllabic, and (inevitably) stationed ambivalently between the two; lines of 12, 13, or even 14 syllables; lines with obligatory, predominant, and optional caesurae.

Although alexandrines occurred in French verse as early as the 12th century, they were slightly looser rhythmically, and vied with the "décasyllabe" and "octosyllabe" for cultural prominence and use in various genres. "The alexandrine came into its own in the middle of the sixteenth century with the poets of the <a href="Pl%C3%A9iade">Pléiade</a> and was firmly established in the seventeenth century." It became the preferred line for the prestigious genres of <a href="Epic%20poetry">epic</a> and <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a>. The structure of the classical French alexandrine is

Classical alexandrines are always rhymed, often in <a href="couplet">couplet</a>s alternating <a href="masculine%20rhyme">masculine rhyme</a>s and <a href="feminine%20rhyme">feminine rhyme</a>s, though other configurations (such as <a href="quatrain">quatrain</a>s and <a href="sonnet">sonnet</a>s) are also common.

<a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> began the process of loosening the strict two-hemistich structure. While retaining the medial caesura, he often reduced it to a mere word-break, creating a three-part line ("alexandrin ternaire") with this structure:

The <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolists</a> further weakened the classical structure, sometimes eliminating any or all of these caesurae. However, at no point did the newer line "replace" the older; rather, they were used concurrently, often in the same poem. This loosening process eventually led to "vers libéré" and finally to "<a href="vers%20libre">vers libre</a>".

In English verse, "alexandrine" is typically used to mean "iambic hexameter":

Whereas the French alexandrine is syllabic, the English is accentual-syllabic; and the central caesura (a defining feature of the French) is not always rigidly preserved in English.

Though English alexandrines have occasionally provided the sole metrical line for a poem, for example in lyric poems by <a href="Henry%20Howard%2C%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey</a> and Sir <a href="Philip%20Sidney">Philip Sidney</a>, and in two notable long poems, <a href="Michael%20Drayton">Michael Drayton</a>'s "<a href="Poly-Olbion">Poly-Olbion</a>" and <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a>'s "Fifine at the Fair", they have more often featured alongside other lines. During the Middle Ages they typically occurred with heptameters (seven-beat lines), both exhibiting metrical looseness. Around the mid-16th century stricter alexandrines were popular as the first line of poulter's measure couplets, <a href="fourteener">fourteener</a>s (strict iambic heptameters) providing the second line.

The strict English alexandrine may be exemplified by a passage from "Poly-Olbion", which features a rare caesural enjambment (symbolized codice_1) in the first line:

<poem style="margin-left:2em">
Ye sacred Bards, that to ¦ your harps' melodious strings
Sung th'ancient Heroes' deeds (the monuments of Kings)
And in your dreadful verse ingrav'd the prophecies,
The agèd world's descents, and geneaologies; (lines 31-34)
</poem>

<a href="The%20Faerie%20Queene">The Faerie Queene</a> by <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a>, with its stanzas of eight <a href="iambic%20pentameter">iambic pentameter</a> lines followed by one alexandrine, exemplifies what came to be its chief role: as a somewhat infrequent variant line in an otherwise iambic pentameter context. Alexandrines provide occasional variation in the <a href="blank%20verse">blank verse</a> of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> and his contemporaries (but rarely; they constitute only about 1% of Shakespeare's blank verse). <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a> and his contemporaries and followers likewise occasionally employed them as the second (rarely the first) line of <a href="heroic%20couplet">heroic couplet</a>s, or even more distinctively as the third line of a triplet.

The Spanish "alejandrino" is a line of 7+7 syllables, probably developed in imitation of the French alexandrine.

It was used beginning about 1200 for "<a href="mester%20de%20clerec%C3%ADa">mester de clerecía</a>" (clerical verse), typically occurring in the "cuaderna vía", a stanza of four "alejandrinos" all with a single end-rhyme.

The "alejandrino" was most prominent during the 13th and 14th centuries, after which time it was eclipsed by the metrically more flexible "<a href="arte%20mayor">arte mayor</a>". <a href="Juan%20Ruiz">Juan Ruiz</a>'s <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Good%20Love">pageRank.Book of Good Love</a> is one of the best-known examples of "cuaderna vía", though other verse forms also appear in the work.

The mid-16th-century poet <a href="Jan%20van%20der%20Noot">Jan van der Noot</a> pioneered syllabic Dutch alexandrines on the French model, but within a few decades Dutch alexandrines had been transformed into strict iambic hexameters with a caesura after the third foot. From Holland the accentual-syllabic alexandrine spread to other continental literatures.

Similarly, in early 17th-century Germany, <a href="Georg%20Rudolf%20Weckherlin">Georg Rudolf Weckherlin</a> advocated for an alexandrine with free rhythms, reflecting French practice; whereas <a href="Martin%20Opitz">Martin Opitz</a> advocated for a strict accentual-syllabic iambic alexandrine in imitation of contemporary Dutch practice — and German poets followed Opitz. The alexandrine (strictly iambic with a consistent medial caesura) became the dominant long line of the German baroque.

Unlike many similar lines, the Polish alexandrine developed not from French verse but from Latin, specifically, the 13-syllable <a href="goliard">goliard</a>ic line:

Though looser instances of this (nominally) 13-syllable line were occasionally used in Polish literature, it was <a href="Miko%C5%82aj%20Rej">Mikołaj Rej</a> and <a href="Jan%20Kochanowski">Jan Kochanowski</a> who, in the 16th century, introduced the syllabically strict line as a vehicle for major works.

The Czech alexandrine is a comparatively recent development, based on the French alexandrine and introduced by <a href="Karel%20Hynek%20M%C3%A1cha">Karel Hynek Mácha</a> in the 19th century. Its structure forms a halfway point between features usual in syllabic and in accentual-syllabic verse, being more highly constrained than most syllabic verse, and less so than most accentual-syllabic verse. Moreover, it equally encourages the very different rhythms of iambic hexameter and dactyllic tetrameter to emerge by preserving the constants of both measures:

In the comic book "<a href="Asterix%20and%20Cleopatra">Asterix and Cleopatra</a>", the author Goscinny inserted a pun about alexandrines: when the Druid Panoramix ("Getafix" in the English translation) meets his Alexandrian (Egyptian) friend the latter exclaims "Je suis, mon cher ami, || très heureux de te voir" at which Panoramix observes "C'est un Alexandrin" ("That's an alexandrine!"/"He's an Alexandrian!"). The pun can also be heard in the theatrical adaptations. The English translation renders this as "My dear old Getafix || How good to see you here", with the reply "Aha, an Alexandrine".

Analog computer

An analog computer or analogue computer is a form of <a href="computer">computer</a> that uses the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as <a href="Electrical%20network">electrical</a>, <a href="Mechanics">mechanical</a>, or <a href="Hydraulics">hydraulic</a> quantities to <a href="Scientific%20modelling">model</a> the problem being solved. In contrast, <a href="digital%20computer">digital computer</a>s represent varying quantities symbolically, as their numerical values change. As an analog computer does not use discrete values, but rather continuous values, processes cannot be reliably repeated with exact equivalence, as they can with <a href="Turing%20Machine">Turing machines</a>. Unlike <a href="digital%20signal%20processing">digital signal processing</a>, analog computers do not suffer from the <a href="quantization%20noise">quantization noise</a>, but are limited by <a href="Noise%20%28electronics%29">analog noise</a>.

Analog computers were widely used in scientific and industrial applications where digital computers of the time lacked sufficient performance. Analog computers can have a very wide range of complexity. <a href="Slide%20rule">Slide rule</a>s and <a href="nomograph">nomograph</a>s are the simplest, while naval gunfire control computers and large hybrid digital/analog computers were among the most complicated. Systems for <a href="process%20control">process control</a> and <a href="protective%20relay">protective relay</a>s used analog computation to perform control and protective functions.

The advent of digital computing made simple analog computers obsolete as early as the 1950s and 1960s, although analog computers remained in use in some specific applications, like the <a href="flight%20computer">flight computer</a> in <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a>, and for teaching <a href="control%20system">control system</a>s in universities. More complex applications, such as <a href="synthetic%20aperture%20radar">synthetic aperture radar</a>, remained the domain of analog computing well into the 1980s, since digital computers were insufficient for the task.

Setting up an analog computer required scale factors to be chosen, along with initial conditions—that is, starting values. Another essential was creating the required network of interconnections between computing elements. Sometimes it was necessary to re-think the structure of the problem so that the computer would function satisfactorily. No variables could be allowed to exceed the computer's limits, and differentiation was to be avoided, typically by rearranging the "network" of interconnects, using integrators in a different sense.

Running an electronic analog computer, assuming a satisfactory setup, started with the computer held with some variables fixed at their initial values. Moving a switch released the holds and permitted the problem to run. In some instances, the computer could, after a certain running time interval, repeatedly return to the initial-conditions state to reset the problem, and run it again.

This is a list of examples of early computation devices which are considered to be precursors of the modern computers. Some of them may even have been dubbed as 'computers' by the press, although they may fail to fit the modern definitions.

The <a href="south-pointing%20chariot">south-pointing chariot</a>, invented in <a href="ancient%20China">ancient China</a> during the first millennium BC, can be considered the earliest analog computer. It was a mechanical-geared wheeled vehicle used to discern the southern cardinal direction.
The <a href="Antikythera%20mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a> was an <a href="orrery">orrery</a> and is claimed to be an early mechanical analog computer, according to <a href="Derek%20J.%20de%20Solla%20Price">Derek J. de Solla Price</a>. It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the <a href="Antikythera%20wreck">Antikythera wreck</a> off the Greek island of <a href="Antikythera">Antikythera</a>, between <a href="Kythera">Kythera</a> and <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, and has been dated to "circa" 100 BC. Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later.

Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use.
The <a href="planisphere">planisphere</a> was a <a href="star%20chart">star chart</a> invented by <a href="Ab%C5%AB%20Ray%E1%B8%A5%C4%81n%20al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB">Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī</a> in the early 11th century. The <a href="astrolabe">astrolabe</a> was invented in the <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic world</a> in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a>. A combination of the planisphere and <a href="dioptra">dioptra</a>, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in <a href="spherical%20astronomy">spherical astronomy</a>. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical <a href="calendar">calendar</a> computer and <a href="gear">gear</a>-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of <a href="Isfahan">Isfahan</a>, <a href="Persia">Persia</a> in 1235. <a href="Ab%C5%AB%20Rayh%C4%81n%20al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB">Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī</a> invented the first mechanical geared <a href="lunisolar%20calendar">lunisolar calendar</a> astrolabe, an early fixed-<a href="wire">wire</a>d knowledge processing <a href="machine">machine</a> with a <a href="gear%20train">gear train</a> and gear-wheels, "circa" 1000 AD. The <a href="castle%20clock">castle clock</a>, a <a href="hydropower">hydropower</a>ed mechanical <a href="astronomical%20clock">astronomical clock</a> invented by <a href="Al-Jazari">Al-Jazari</a> in 1206, was the first <a href="Computer%20programming">programmable</a> analog computer.

The <a href="Sector%20%28instrument%29">sector</a>, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.

The <a href="planimeter">planimeter</a> was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.
The <a href="slide%20rule">slide rule</a> was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after the publication of the concept of the <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as <a href="transcendental%20function">transcendental function</a>s such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other <a href="Function%20%28mathematics%29">functions</a>. Aviation is one of the few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use, particularly for solving time–distance problems in light aircraft.

The <a href="tide-predicting%20machine">tide-predicting machine</a> invented by <a href="William%20Thomson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Kelvin">Sir William Thomson</a> in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.

The <a href="differential%20analyser">differential analyser</a>, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve <a href="differential%20equations">differential equations</a> by <a href="integral">integration</a>, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876 <a href="James%20Thomson%20%28engineer%29">James Thomson</a> had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the <a href="ball-and-disk%20integrator">ball-and-disk integrator</a>s. In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The <a href="torque%20amplifier">torque amplifier</a> was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a> and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.

The <a href="Dumaresq">Dumaresq</a> was a mechanical calculating device invented around 1902 by Lieutenant <a href="John%20Saumarez%20Dumaresq">John Dumaresq</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. It was an analog computer which related vital variables of the fire control problem to the movement of one's own ship and that of a target ship. It was often used with other devices, such as a <a href="Vickers%20range%20clock">Vickers range clock</a> to generate range and deflection data so the gun sights of the ship could be continuously set. A number of versions of the Dumaresq were produced of increasing complexity as development proceeded.

By 1912 <a href="Arthur%20Pollen">Arthur Pollen</a> had developed an electrically driven mechanical analog computer for <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>s, based on the differential analyser. It was used by the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Starting in 1929, <a href="Network%20analyzer%20%28AC%20power%29">AC network analyzers</a> were constructed to solve calculation problems related to electrical power systems that were too large to solve with <a href="numerical%20method">numerical method</a>s at the time. These were essentially scale models of the electrical properties of the full-size system. Since network analyzers could handle problems too large for analytic methods or hand computation, they were also used to solve problems in nuclear physics and in the design of structures. More than 50 large network analyzers were built by the end of the 1950s.

<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> era gun <a href="Director%20%28military%29">directors</a>, <a href="gun%20data%20computer">gun data computer</a>s, and <a href="bomb%20sight">bomb sight</a>s used mechanical analog computers. In 1941 <a href="Helmut%20H%C3%B6lzer">Helmut Hölzer</a> built a fully electronic general-purpose analog computer at <a href="Peenem%C3%BCnde%20Army%20Research%20Center">Peenemünde Army Research Center</a>. Mechanical analog computers were very important in <a href="Fire%20control%20system">gun fire control</a> in World War II, The Korean War and well past the Vietnam War; they were made in significant numbers.

The <a href="FERMIAC">FERMIAC</a> was an analog computer invented by physicist Enrico Fermi in 1947 to aid in his studies of neutron transport. Project Cyclone was an analog computer developed by Reeves in 1950 for the analysis and design of dynamic systems. Project Typhoon was an analog computer developed by RCA in 1952. It consisted of over 4000 electron tubes and used 100 dials and 6000 plug-in connectors to program. The <a href="MONIAC%20Computer">MONIAC Computer</a> was a hydraulic model of a national economy first unveiled in 1949.

Computer Engineering Associates was spun out of <a href="Caltech">Caltech</a> in 1950 to provide commercial services using the "Direct Analogy Electric Analog Computer" ("the largest and most impressive general-purpose analyzer facility for the solution of field problems") developed there by Gilbert D. McCann, Charles H. Wilts, and <a href="Bart%20N.%20Locanthi">Bart Locanthi</a>.

Educational analog computers illustrated the principles of analog calculation. The <a href="Heathkit">Heathkit</a> EC-1, a $199 educational analog computer, was made by the Heath Company, USA c. 1960. It was programmed using patch cords that connected nine operational amplifiers and other components. <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> also marketed an "educational" analog computer kit of a simple design in the early 1960s consisting of a two transistor tone generator and three potentiometers wired such that the frequency of the oscillator was nulled when the potentiometer dials were positioned by hand to satisfy an equation. The relative resistance of the potentiometer was then equivalent to the formula of the equation being solved. Multiplication or division could be performed depending on which dials were considered inputs and which was the output. Accuracy and resolution was limited and a simple slide rule was more accurate; however, the unit did demonstrate the basic principle.

In industrial <a href="process%20control">process control</a>, thousands of analog loop controllers were used to automatically regulate temperature, flow, pressure, or other process conditions. The technology of these controllers ranged from purely mechanical integrators, through vacuum-tube and solid-state devices, to emulation of analog controllers by microprocessors.

The similarity between linear mechanical components, such as <a href="spring%20%28device%29">spring</a>s and <a href="dashpot">dashpot</a>s (viscous-fluid dampers), and electrical components, such as <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>s, <a href="inductor">inductor</a>s, and <a href="resistor">resistor</a>s is striking in terms of mathematics. They can be modeled using equations of the same form.

However, the difference between these systems is what makes analog computing useful. If one considers a simple mass–spring system, constructing the physical system would require making or modifying the springs and masses. This would be followed by attaching them to each other and an appropriate anchor, collecting test equipment with the appropriate input range, and finally, taking measurements. In more complicated cases, such as suspensions for racing cars, experimental construction, modification, and testing is both complicated and expensive.

The electrical equivalent can be constructed with a few <a href="operational%20amplifier">operational amplifier</a>s (op amps) and some passive linear components; all measurements can be taken directly with an <a href="oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a>. In the circuit, the (simulated) 'stiffness of the spring', for instance, can be changed by adjusting the parameters of a <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>. The electrical system is an analogy to the physical system, hence the name, but it is less expensive to construct, generally safer, and typically much easier to modify.

As well, an electronic circuit can typically operate at higher frequencies than the system being simulated. This allows the simulation to run faster than real time (which could, in some instances, be hours, weeks, or longer). Experienced users of electronic analog computers said that they offered a comparatively intimate control and understanding of the problem, relative to digital simulations.

The drawback of the mechanical-electrical analogy is that electronics are limited by the range over which the variables may vary. This is called <a href="dynamic%20range">dynamic range</a>. They are also limited by <a href="noise%20%28physics%29">noise levels</a>. Floating-point digital calculations have a comparatively huge dynamic range.

These electric circuits can also easily perform a wide variety of simulations. For example, <a href="voltage">voltage</a> can simulate <a href="water%20pressure">water pressure</a> and <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a> can simulate <a href="Volumetric%20flow%20rate">rate of flow</a> in terms of cubic metres per second. An integrator can provide the total accumulated volume of liquid, using an input current proportional to the (possibly varying) flow rate.

Analog computers are especially well-suited to representing situations described by differential equations. Occasionally, they were used when a differential equation proved very difficult to solve by traditional means.

The accuracy of an analog computer is limited by its computing elements as well as quality of the internal power and electrical interconnections. The precision of the analog computer readout was limited chiefly by the precision of the readout equipment used, generally three or four significant figures. The precision of a digital computer is limited by the word size; <a href="arbitrary-precision%20arithmetic">arbitrary-precision arithmetic</a>, while relatively slow, provides any practical degree of precision that might be needed.

Many small computers dedicated to specific computations are still part of industrial regulation equipment, but from the 1950s to the 1970s, general-purpose analog computers were the only systems fast enough for real time simulation of dynamic systems, especially in the aircraft, military and aerospace field.

In the 1960s, the major manufacturer was <a href="Electronic%20Associates">Electronic Associates</a> of <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>, with its 231R Analog Computer (vacuum tubes, 20 integrators) and subsequently its 8800 Analog Computer (solid state operational amplifiers, 64 integrators). Its challenger was <a href="Applied%20Dynamics">Applied Dynamics</a> of <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>.

Although the basic technology for analog computers is usually operational amplifiers (also called "continuous current amplifiers" because they have no low frequency limitation), in the 1960s an attempt was made in the French <a href="ANALAC">ANALAC</a> computer to use an alternative technology: medium frequency carrier and non dissipative reversible circuits.

In the 1970s every big company and administration concerned with problems in dynamics had a big analog computing center, for example:

Analog computing devices are fast, digital computing devices are more versatile and accurate, so the idea is to combine the two processes for the best efficiency. An example of such hybrid elementary device is the hybrid multiplier where one input is an analog signal, the other input is a digital signal and the output is analog. It acts as an analog potentiometer upgradable digitally. This kind of hybrid technique is mainly used for fast dedicated real time computation when computing time is very critical as signal processing for radars and generally for controllers in <a href="embedded%20system">embedded system</a>s.

In the early 1970s analog computer manufacturers tried to tie together their analog computer with a digital computer to get the advantages of the two techniques. In such systems, the digital computer controlled the analog computer, providing initial set-up, initiating multiple analog runs, and automatically feeding and collecting data. The digital computer may also participate to the calculation itself using <a href="Analog-to-digital%20converter">analog-to-digital</a> and <a href="digital-to-analog%20converter">digital-to-analog converter</a>s.

The largest manufacturer of <a href="hybrid%20computer">hybrid computer</a>s was Electronics Associates. Their hybrid computer model 8900 was made of a digital computer and one or more analog consoles. These systems were mainly dedicated to large projects such as the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a> and Space Shuttle at NASA, or Ariane in Europe, especially during the integration step where at the beginning everything is simulated, and progressively real components replace their simulated part.

Only one company was known as offering general commercial computing services on its hybrid computers, <a href="CISI%20%28French%20company%29">CISI</a> of France, in the 1970s.

The best reference in this field is the 100,000 simulations runs for each certification of the automatic landing systems of <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a> and <a href="Concorde">Concorde</a> aircraft.

After 1980, purely digital computers progressed more and more rapidly and were fast enough to compete with analog computers.
One key to the speed of analog computers was their fully parallel computation, but this was also a limitation. The more equations required for a problem, the more analog components were needed, even when the problem wasn't time critical. "Programming" a problem meant interconnecting the analog operators; even with a removable wiring panel this was not very versatile. Today there are no more big hybrid computers, but only hybrid components.

While a wide variety of mechanisms have been developed throughout history, some stand out because of their theoretical importance, or because they were manufactured in significant quantities.

Most practical mechanical analog computers of any significant complexity used rotating shafts to carry variables from one mechanism to another. Cables and pulleys were used in a Fourier synthesizer, a <a href="tide-predicting%20machine">tide-predicting machine</a>, which summed the individual harmonic components. Another category, not nearly as well known, used rotating shafts only for input and output, with precision racks and pinions. The racks were connected to linkages that performed the computation. At least one US Naval sonar fire control computer of the later 1950s, made by Librascope, was of this type, as was the principal computer in the Mk. 56 Gun Fire Control System.

Online, there is a remarkably clear illustrated reference (OP 1140) that describes the fire control computer mechanisms.
For adding and subtracting, precision miter-gear differentials were in common use in some computers; the Ford Instrument <a href="Mark%20I%20Fire%20Control%20Computer">Mark I Fire Control Computer</a> contained about 160 of them.

Integration with respect to another variable was done by a rotating disc driven by one variable. Output came from a pickoff device (such as a wheel) positioned at a radius on the disc proportional to the second variable. (A carrier with a pair of steel balls supported by small rollers worked especially well. A roller, its axis parallel to the disc's surface, provided the output. It was held against the pair of balls by a spring.)

Arbitrary functions of one variable were provided by cams, with gearing to convert follower movement to shaft rotation.

Functions of two variables were provided by three-dimensional cams. In one good design, one of the variables rotated the cam. A hemispherical follower moved its carrier on a pivot axis parallel to that of the cam's rotating axis. Pivoting motion was the output. The second variable moved the follower along the axis of the cam. One practical application was ballistics in gunnery.

Coordinate conversion from polar to rectangular was done by a mechanical resolver (called a "component solver" in US Navy fire control computers). Two discs on a common axis positioned a sliding block with pin (stubby shaft) on it. One disc was a face cam, and a follower on the block in the face cam's groove set the radius. The other disc, closer to the pin, contained a straight slot in which the block moved. The input angle rotated the latter disc (the face cam disc, for an unchanging radius, rotated with the other (angle) disc; a differential and a few gears did this correction).

Referring to the mechanism's frame, the location of the pin corresponded to the tip of the vector represented by the angle and magnitude inputs. Mounted on that pin was a square block.

Rectilinear-coordinate outputs (both sine and cosine, typically) came from two slotted plates, each slot fitting on the block just mentioned. The plates moved in straight lines, the movement of one plate at right angles to that of the other. The slots were at right angles to the direction of movement. Each plate, by itself, was like a <a href="Scotch%20yoke">Scotch yoke</a>, known to steam engine enthusiasts.

During World War II, a similar mechanism converted rectilinear to polar coordinates, but it was not particularly successful and was eliminated in a significant redesign (USN, Mk. 1 to Mk. 1A).

Multiplication was done by mechanisms based on the geometry of similar right triangles. Using the trigonometric terms for a right triangle, specifically opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse, the adjacent side was fixed by construction. One variable changed the magnitude of the opposite side. In many cases, this variable changed sign; the hypotenuse could coincide with the adjacent side (a zero input), or move beyond the adjacent side, representing a sign change.

Typically, a pinion-operated rack moving parallel to the (trig.-defined) opposite side would position a slide with a slot coincident with the hypotenuse. A pivot on the rack let the slide's angle change freely. At the other end of the slide (the angle, in trig, terms), a block on a pin fixed to the frame defined the vertex between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side.

At any distance along the adjacent side, a line perpendicular to it intersects the hypotenuse at a particular point. The distance between that point and the adjacent side is some fraction that is the product of "1" the distance from the vertex, and "2" the magnitude of the opposite side.

The second input variable in this type of multiplier positions a slotted plate perpendicular to the adjacent side. That slot contains a block, and that block's position in its slot is determined by another block right next to it. The latter slides along the hypotenuse, so the two blocks are positioned at a distance from the (trig.) adjacent side by an amount proportional to the product.

To provide the product as an output, a third element, another slotted plate, also moves parallel to the (trig.) opposite side of the theoretical triangle. As usual, the slot is perpendicular to the direction of movement. A block in its slot, pivoted to the hypotenuse block positions it.

A special type of integrator, used at a point where only moderate accuracy was needed, was based on a steel ball, instead of a disc. It had two inputs, one to rotate the ball, and the other to define the angle of the ball's rotating axis. That axis was always in a plane that contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball computer mouse (in this mechanism, the pickoff rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The pickoff roller axes were at right angles.

A pair of rollers "above" and "below" the pickoff plane were mounted in rotating holders that were geared together. That gearing was driven by the angle input, and established the rotating axis of the ball. The other input rotated the "bottom" roller to make the ball rotate.

Essentially, the whole mechanism, called a component integrator, was a variable-speed drive with one motion input and two outputs, as well as an angle input. The angle input varied the ratio (and direction) of coupling between the "motion" input and the outputs according to the sine and cosine of the input angle.

Although they did not accomplish any computation, electromechanical position servos were essential in mechanical analog computers of the "rotating-shaft" type for providing operating torque to the inputs of subsequent computing mechanisms, as well as driving output data-transmission devices such as large torque-transmitter synchros in naval computers.

Other non-computational mechanisms included internal odometer-style counters with interpolating drum dials for indicating internal variables, and mechanical multi-turn limit stops.

Considering that accurately controlled rotational speed in analog fire-control computers was a basic element of their accuracy, there was a motor with its average speed controlled by a balance wheel, hairspring, jeweled-bearing differential, a twin-lobe cam, and spring-loaded contacts (ship's AC power frequency was not necessarily accurate, nor dependable enough, when these computers were designed).

Electronic analog computers typically have front panels with numerous jacks (single-contact sockets) that permit patch cords (flexible wires with plugs at both ends) to create the interconnections which define the problem setup. In addition, there are precision high-resolution potentiometers (variable resistors) for setting up (and, when needed, varying) scale factors. In addition, there is likely to be a zero-center analog pointer-type meter for modest-accuracy voltage measurement. Stable, accurate voltage sources provide known magnitudes.

Typical electronic analog computers contain anywhere from a few to a hundred or more <a href="operational%20amplifier">operational amplifier</a>s ("op amps"), named because they perform mathematical operations. Op amps are a particular type of feedback amplifier with very high gain and stable input (low and stable offset). They are always used with precision feedback components that, in operation, all but cancel out the currents arriving from input components. The majority of op amps in a representative setup are summing amplifiers, which add and subtract analog voltages, providing the result at their output jacks. As well, op amps with capacitor feedback are usually included in a setup; they integrate the sum of their inputs with respect to time.

Integrating with respect to another variable is the nearly exclusive province of mechanical analog integrators; it is almost never done in electronic analog computers. However, given that a problem solution does not change with time, time can serve as one of the variables.

Other computing elements include analog multipliers, nonlinear function generators, and analog comparators.

Electrical elements such as inductors and capacitors used in electrical analog computers had to be carefully manufactured to reduce non-ideal effects. For example, in the construction of <a href="Network%20analyzer%20%28AC%20power%29">AC power network analyzers</a>, one motive for using higher frequencies for the calculator (instead of the actual power frequency) was that higher-quality inductors could be more easily made. Many general-purpose analog computers avoided the use of inductors entirely, re-casting the problem in a form that could be solved using only resistive and capacitive elements, since high-quality capacitors are relatively easy to make.

The use of electrical properties in analog computers means that calculations are normally performed in <a href="real-time%20computing">real time</a> (or faster), at a speed determined mostly by the frequency response of the operational amplifiers and other computing elements. In the history of electronic analog computers, there were some special high-speed types.

<a href="Nonlinear">Nonlinear</a> functions and calculations can be constructed to a limited precision (three or four digits) by designing <a href="function%20generator">function generator</a>s—special circuits of various combinations of resistors and diodes to provide the nonlinearity. Typically, as the input voltage increases, progressively more diodes conduct.

When compensated for temperature, the forward voltage drop of a transistor's base-emitter junction can provide a usably accurate logarithmic or exponential function. Op amps scale the output voltage so that it is usable with the rest of the computer.

Any physical process which models some computation can be interpreted as an analog computer. Some examples, invented for the purpose of illustrating the concept of analog computation, include using a bundle of <a href="spaghetti">spaghetti</a> as <a href="Spaghetti%20sort">a model of sorting numbers</a>; a board, a set of nails, and a rubber band as a model of finding the <a href="convex%20hull">convex hull</a> of a set of points; and strings tied together as a model of finding the shortest path in a network. These are all described in <a href="Alexander%20Dewdney">Dewdney</a> (1984).

Analog computers often have a complicated framework, but they have, at their core, a set of key components which perform the calculations, which the operator manipulates through the computer's framework.

Key hydraulic components might include pipes, valves and containers.

Key mechanical components might include rotating shafts for carrying data within the computer, <a href="miter%20gear">miter gear</a> <a href="differential%20%28mechanical%20device%29">differential</a>s, disc/ball/roller integrators, <a href="cam">cam</a>s (2-D and 3-D), mechanical resolvers and multipliers, and torque servos.

Key electrical/electronic components might include:

The core mathematical operations used in an electric analog computer are:

In some analog computer designs, multiplication is much preferred to division. Division is carried out with a multiplier in the feedback path of an Operational Amplifier.

Differentiation with respect to time is not frequently used, and in practice is avoided by redefining the problem when possible. It corresponds in the frequency domain to a high-pass filter, which means that high-frequency noise is amplified; differentiation also risks instability.

In general, analog computers are limited by non-ideal effects. An <a href="analog%20signal">analog signal</a> is composed of four basic components: DC and AC magnitudes, frequency, and phase. The real limits of range on these characteristics limit analog computers. Some of these limits include the operational amplifier offset, finite gain, and frequency response, <a href="noise%20floor">noise floor</a>, <a href="non-linearity">non-linearities</a>, <a href="temperature%20coefficient">temperature coefficient</a>, and <a href="Microelectronics">parasitic effects</a> within semiconductor devices. For commercially available electronic components, ranges of these aspects of input and output signals are always <a href="figures%20of%20merit">figures of merit</a>.

In 1950s to 1970s, digital computers based on first vacuum tubes, transistors, integrated circuits and then micro-processors became more economical and precise. This led digital computers to largely replace analog computers. Even so, some research in analog computation is still being done. A few universities still use analog computers to teach <a href="Control%20theory">control system theory</a>. The American company Comdyna manufactures small analog computers. At Indiana University Bloomington, <a href="http%3A//www.cs.indiana.edu/%7Ejwmills/ANALOG.NOTEBOOK/klm/klm.html">Jonathan Mills</a> has developed the Extended Analog Computer based on sampling voltages in a foam sheet. At the <a href="http%3A//hrl.harvard.edu/">Harvard Robotics Laboratory</a>, analog computation is a research topic. Lyric Semiconductor's error correction circuits use analog probabilistic signals. <a href="Slide%20rule">Slide rule</a>s are still popular among aircraft personnel. 

With the development of <a href="very-large-scale%20integration">very-large-scale integration</a> (VLSI) technology, Yannis Tsividis' group at Columbia University has been revisiting analog/hybrid computers design in standard CMOS process. Two VLSI chips have been developed, an 80th-order analog computer (250 nm) by Glenn Cowan in 2005 and an 4th-order hybrid computer (65 nm) developed by Ning Guo in 2015, both targeting at energy-efficient ODE/PDE applications. Glenn's chip contains 16 macros, in which there are 25 analog computing blocks, namely integrators, multipliers, fanouts, few nonlinear blocks. Ning's chip contains one macro block, in which there are 26 computing blocks including integrators, multipliers, fanouts, ADCs, SRAMs and DACs. Arbitrary nonlinear function generation is made possible by the ADC+SRAM+DAC chain, where the SRAM block stores the nonlinear function data. The experiments from the related publications revealed that VLSI analog/hybrid computers demonstrated about 1–2 orders magnitude of advantage in both solution time and energy while achieving accuracy within 5%, which points to the promise of using analog/hybrid computing techniques in the area of energy-efficient approximate computing.

These are examples of analog computers that have been constructed or practically used:

<a href="Analog%20synthesizer">Analog (audio) synthesizer</a>s can also be viewed as a form of analog computer, and their technology was originally based in part on electronic analog computer technology. The <a href="ARP%202600">ARP 2600</a>'s Ring Modulator was actually a moderate-accuracy analog multiplier.

The Simulation Council (or Simulations Council) was an association of analog computer users in USA. It is now known as The Society for Modeling and Simulation International. The Simulation Council newsletters from 1952 to 1963 are available online and show the concerns and technologies at the time, and the common use of analog computers for missilry.

Computer theorists often refer to idealized analog computers as <a href="Real%20computation">real computer</a>s (because they operate on the set of <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s). Digital computers, by contrast, must first <a href="Quantization%20%28signal%20processing%29">quantize</a> the signal into a finite number of values, and so can only work with the <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a> set (or, with an approximation of irrational numbers).

These idealized analog computers may "in theory" solve problems that are <a href="Intractably">intractable</a> on digital computers; however as mentioned, in reality, analog computers are far from attaining this ideal, largely because of noise minimization problems. "In theory", ambient noise is limited by <a href="quantum%20noise">quantum noise</a> (caused by the quantum movements of ions). Ambient noise may be severely reduced – but never to zero – by using <a href="Cryogenics">cryogenically</a> cooled <a href="Parametric%20oscillator">parametric amplifiers</a>. Moreover, given unlimited time and memory, the (ideal) digital computer may also solve real number problems.

Minute and second of arc

A minute of arc, arcminute (arcmin), arc minute, or minute arc is a unit of <a href="Angular%20unit">angular</a> measurement equal to of one <a href="Degree%20%28angle%29">degree</a>. Since one degree is of a <a href="turn%20%28geometry%29">turn</a> (or complete rotation), one minute of arc is of a turn (or, in <a href="radian">radian</a>s, ). A second of arc, arcsecond (arcsec), or arc second is of an arcminute, of a degree, of a turn, and (about ) of a radian. These units originated in <a href="Babylonian%20astronomy">Babylonian astronomy</a> as <a href="sexagesimal">sexagesimal</a> subdivisions of the degree; they are used in fields that involve very small angles, such as <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="optometry">optometry</a>, <a href="ophthalmology">ophthalmology</a>, <a href="optics">optics</a>, <a href="navigation">navigation</a>, <a href="land%20surveying">land surveying</a> and <a href="marksmanship">marksmanship</a>.

To express even smaller angles, standard <a href="SI%20prefix">SI prefix</a>es can be employed; the milliarcsecond (mas) and microarcsecond (μas), for instance, are commonly used in astronomy.

The number of square arcminutes in a complete sphere is formula_1 square arcminutes.

The standard symbol for marking the arcminute is the <a href="prime%20%28symbol%29">prime</a> (′) (U+2032), though a single quote (') (U+0027) is commonly used where only <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> characters are permitted. One arcminute is thus written 1′. It is also abbreviated as arcmin or amin or, less commonly, the prime with a <a href="circumflex">circumflex</a> over it (formula_2).

The standard symbol for the arcsecond is the <a href="double%20prime">double prime</a> (″) (U+2033), though a double quote (") (U+0022) is commonly used where only <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> characters are permitted. One arcsecond is thus written 1″. It is also abbreviated as arcsec or asec.

In <a href="celestial%20navigation">celestial navigation</a>, seconds of arc are rarely used in calculations, the preference usually being for degrees, minutes and decimals of a minute, for example, written as 42° 25.32′ or 42° 25.322′. This notation has been carried over into <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">marine GPS</a> receivers, which normally display latitude and longitude in the latter format by default.

An arcsecond is approximately the <a href="Subtended%20angle">angle subtended</a> by a <a href="Dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">U.S. dime coin</a> (18 mm) at a distance of .

An arcsecond is also the angle subtended by

A milliarcsecond is about the size of a dime atop the <a href="Eiffel%20Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> as seen from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

A microarcsecond is about the size of a period at the end of a sentence in the Apollo mission manuals left on the Moon as seen from Earth.

Since antiquity the arcminute and arcsecond have been used in <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>. In the <a href="ecliptic%20coordinate%20system">ecliptic coordinate system</a>, latitude (β) and longitude (λ); in the <a href="Horizontal%20coordinate%20system">horizon system</a>, altitude (Alt) and <a href="azimuth">azimuth</a> (Az); and in the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, <a href="declination">declination</a> (δ), are all measured in degrees, arcminutes and arcseconds. The principal exception is <a href="Right%20ascension">Right ascension</a> (RA) in equatorial coordinates, which is measured in time units of hours, minutes, and seconds.

The arcsecond is also often used to describe small astronomical angles such as the angular diameters of planets (e.g. the angular diameter of Venus which varies between 10″ and 60″), the <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of stars, the separation of components of <a href="binary%20star%20system">binary star system</a>s, and <a href="parallax">parallax</a>, the small change of position of a star in the course of a year or of a solar system body as the Earth rotates. These small angles may also be written in milliarcseconds (mas), or thousandths of an arcsecond. The unit of distance, the <a href="parsec">parsec</a>, named from the parallax of one arcsecond, was developed for such parallax measurements. It is the distance at which the mean radius of the Earth's orbit would subtend an angle of one arcsecond.

The ESA <a href="astrometry">astrometric</a> space probe <a href="Gaia%20mission">Gaia</a> is hoped to measure star positions to 20 microarcseconds (µas) when it begins producing catalog positions sometime after 2016. There are about 1.3 trillion µas in a turn. Currently the best catalog positions of stars actually measured are in terms of milliarcseconds, by the <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Observatory">U.S. Naval Observatory</a>.

Apart from the Sun, the star with the largest <a href="angular%20diameter">angular diameter</a> from Earth is <a href="R%20Doradus">R Doradus</a>, a red <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a> with a diameter of 0.05 arcsecond. Because of the effects of atmospheric <a href="astronomical%20seeing">seeing</a>, ground-based <a href="telescope">telescope</a>s will smear the image of a star to an angular diameter of about 0.5 arcsecond; in poor seeing conditions this increases to 1.5 arcseconds or even more. The dwarf planet <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a> has proven difficult to resolve because its <a href="angular%20diameter">angular diameter</a> is about 0.1 arcsecond.

Space telescopes are not affected by the Earth's atmosphere but are <a href="Diffraction%20limit%23Diffraction%20limit%20of%20telescopes">diffraction limited</a>. For example, the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> can reach an angular size of stars down to about 0.1″. Techniques exist for improving seeing on the ground. <a href="Adaptive%20optics">Adaptive optics</a>, for example, can produce images around 0.05 arcsecond on a 10 m class telescope.

Minutes (′) and seconds (″) of arc are also used in <a href="cartography">cartography</a> and <a href="navigation">navigation</a>. At <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> one minute of arc along the <a href="equator">equator</a> or a <a href="Meridian%20%28geography%29">meridian</a> (indeed, any <a href="great%20circle">great circle</a>) equals exactly one <a href="geographical%20mile">geographical mile</a> along the Earth's equator or approximately one <a href="nautical%20mile">nautical mile</a> (1852 meters, or ≈1.15078 <a href="statute%20mile">statute mile</a>s). A second of arc, one sixtieth of this amount, is roughly 30 meters or 100 feet. The exact distance varies along <a href="meridian%20arc">meridian arc</a>s because the <a href="figure%20of%20the%20Earth">figure of the Earth</a> is slightly <a href="Oblate%20spheroid">oblate</a> (bulges a third of a percent at the equator).

Positions are traditionally given using degrees, minutes, and seconds of arcs for <a href="latitude">latitude</a>, the arc north or south of the equator, and for <a href="longitude">longitude</a>, the arc east or west of the <a href="Prime%20Meridian">Prime Meridian</a>. Any position on or above the Earth's <a href="reference%20ellipsoid">reference ellipsoid</a> can be precisely given with this method. However, when it is inconvenient to use <a href="radix">base</a>-60 for minutes and seconds, positions are frequently expressed as decimal fractional degrees to an equal amount of precision. Degrees given to three decimal places ( of a degree) have about the precision of degrees-minutes-seconds ( of a degree) and specify locations within about 120 meters or 400 feet.

Related to cartography, property boundary <a href="surveying">surveying</a> using the <a href="metes%20and%20bounds">metes and bounds</a> system relies on fractions of a degree to describe property lines' angles in reference to <a href="cardinal%20direction">cardinal direction</a>s. A boundary "mete" is described with a beginning reference point, the cardinal direction North or South followed by an angle less than 90 degrees and a second cardinal direction, and a linear distance. The boundary runs the specified linear distance from the beginning point, the direction of the distance being determined by rotating the first cardinal direction the specified angle toward the second cardinal direction. For example, "North 65° 39′ 18″ West 85.69 feet" would describe a line running from the starting point 85.69 feet in a direction 65° 39′ 18″ (or 65.655°) away from north toward the west.

The arcminute is commonly found in the <a href="firearm">firearm</a>s industry and literature, particularly concerning the accuracy of <a href="rifle">rifle</a>s, though the industry refers to it as minute of angle (MOA). It is especially popular with shooters familiar with the <a href="imperial%20measurement%20system">imperial measurement system</a> because 1 MOA <a href="subtend">subtend</a>s 1.047 <a href="inch">inch</a>es at 100 <a href="yard">yard</a>s (approximately 3 cm at 100 m), a traditional distance on U.S. <a href="Shooting%20range">target ranges</a>. The subtension is linear with the distance, for example, 500 yards = 5.235 inches, and 1000 yards = 10.47 inches. Since many modern <a href="telescopic%20sight">telescopic sight</a>s are adjustable in half (), quarter (), or eighth () MOA increments, also known as "clicks", zeroing and adjustments are made by counting 2, 4 and 8 clicks per MOA respectively.

For example, if the point of impact is 3 inches high and 1.5 inches left of the point of aim at 100 yards (which for instance could be measured by using a <a href="spotting%20scope">spotting scope</a> with a calibrated reticle), the scope needs to be adjusted 3 MOA down, and 1.5 MOA right. Such adjustments are trivial when the scope's adjustment dials have a MOA scale printed on them, and even figuring the right number of clicks is relatively easy on scopes that "click" in fractions of MOA. This makes zeroing and adjustments much easier:


Another common system of measurement in firearm scopes is the <a href="milliradian">milliradian</a>. Zeroing a mil based scope is easy for users familiar with <a href="decimal">base ten</a> systems. The most common adjustment value in mil based scopes is mil (which approximates MOA).


One thing to be aware of is that some MOA scopes, including some higher-end models, are calibrated such that an adjustment of 1 MOA on the scope knobs corresponds to exactly 1 inch of impact adjustment on a target at 100 yards, rather than the mathematically correct 1.047". This is commonly known as the Shooter's MOA (SMOA) or Inches Per Hundred Yards (IPHY). While the difference between one true MOA and one SMOA is less than half of an inch even at 1000 yards, this error compounds significantly on longer range shots that may require adjustment upwards of 20-30 MOA to compensate for the bullet drop. If a shot requires an adjustment of 20 MOA or more, the difference between true MOA and SMOA will add up to 1 inch or more. In competitive target shooting, this might mean the difference between a hit and a miss.

The physical group size equivalent to "m" minutes of arc can be calculated as follows: group size = tan() × distance. In the example previously given, for 1 minute of arc, and substituting 3,600 inches for 100 yards, 3,600 tan() ≈ 1.047 inches. In <a href="metric%20units">metric units</a> 1 MOA at 100 meters ≈ 2.908 centimeters.

Sometimes, a precision firearm's accuracy will be measured in MOA. This simply means that under ideal conditions i.e. no wind, match-grade ammo, clean barrel, and a vise or a benchrest used to eliminate shooter error, the gun is capable of producing a <a href="shot%20grouping">group of shots</a> whose center points (center-to-center) fit into a circle, the average diameter of circles in several groups can be subtended by that amount of arc. For example, a "1 MOA rifle" should be capable, under ideal conditions, of shooting an average 1-inch groups at 100 yards. Most higher-end rifles are warrantied by their manufacturer to shoot under a given MOA threshold (typically 1 MOA or better) with specific ammunition and no error on the shooter's part. For example, Remington's <a href="M24%20Sniper%20Weapon%20System">M24 Sniper Weapon System</a> is required to shoot 0.8 MOA or better, or be rejected.

Rifle manufacturers and gun magazines often refer to this capability as "sub-MOA", meaning it shoots under 1 MOA. This means that a single group of 3 to 5 shots at 100 yards, or the average of several groups, will measure less than 1 MOA between the two furthest shots in the group, i.e. all shots fall within 1 MOA. If larger samples are taken (i.e., more shots per group) then group size typically increases, however this will ultimately average out. If a rifle was truly a 1 MOA rifle, it would be just as likely that two consecutive shots land exactly on top of each other as that they land 1 MOA apart. For 5 shot groups, based on 95% <a href="confidence%20interval">confidence</a> a rifle that normally shoots 1 MOA can be expected to shoot groups between 0.58 MOA and 1.47 MOA, although the majority of these groups will be under 1 MOA. What this means in practice is if a rifle that shoots 1-inch groups on average at 100 yards shoots a group measuring 0.7 inches followed by a group that is 1.3 inches this is not statistically abnormal.

The <a href="Metric%20system">Metric System</a> counterpart of the MOA is the <a href="milliradian">milliradian</a> or mil, being equal to one 1000th of the target range, laid out on a circle that has the observer as centre and the target range as radius. The number of mils on a full such circle therefore always is equal to 2 × × 1000, regardless the target range. Therefore, 1 MOA ≈ 0.2908 mil. This means that an object which spans 1 mil on the <a href="reticle">reticle</a> is at a range that is in meters equal to the object's size in millimeters (e.g. an object of 100 mm @ 1 Milrad is 100 meters away). So there is no conversion factor required, contrary to the MOA system. A reticle with markings (hashes or dots) spaced with a one mil apart (or a fraction of a mil) are collectively called a mil reticle. If the markings are round they are called mil-dots.

In the table below conversions from mil to metric values are exact (e.g. 0.1 mil equals exactly 1 cm at 100 meters), while conversions of minutes of arc to both metric and imperial values are approximate.


In humans, <a href="Normal%20vision">20/20 vision</a> is the ability to resolve a <a href="spatial%20pattern">spatial pattern</a> separated by a <a href="visual%20angle">visual angle</a> of one minute of arc.
A 20/20 letter subtends 5 minutes of arc total.

The deviation from parallelism between two surfaces, for instance in <a href="optical%20engineering">optical engineering</a>, is usually measured in arcminutes or arcseconds.
In addition, arcseconds are sometimes used in <a href="rocking%20curve">rocking curve</a> (ω-scan) <a href="x%20ray%20diffraction">x ray diffraction</a> measurements of high-quality <a href="epitaxy">epitaxial</a> thin films.

Alberto Giacometti

Alberto Giacometti (; 10 October 1901 – 11 January 1966) was a Swiss sculptor, painter, draughtsman and printmaker.
He was born in the canton <a href="Graub%C3%BCnden">Graubünden</a>'s southerly alpine valley <a href="Val%20Bregaglia">Val Bregaglia</a>, as the eldest of four children to <a href="Giovanni%20Giacometti">Giovanni Giacometti</a>, a well-known <a href="Post-Impressionism">post-Impressionist</a> painter and Annetta Giacometti-Stampa. Coming from an artistic background, he was interested in art from an early age.

Giacometti was born in <a href="Borgonovo">Borgonovo</a>, now part of the Switzerland municipality of <a href="Bregaglia">Bregaglia</a>, near the Italian border. He was a descendant of Protestant refugees escaping the <a href="Italian%20Inquisition">inquisition</a>. Alberto attended the <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> School of <a href="Fine%20art">Fine Arts</a>. His brothers <a href="Diego%20Giacometti">Diego</a> (1902–85) and <a href="Bruno%20Giacometti">Bruno</a> (1907–2012) would go on to become artists as well. Additionally, <a href="Zaccaria%20Giacometti">Zaccaria Giacometti</a>, later professor of constitutional law and chancellor of the <a href="University%20of%20Zurich">University of Zurich</a>, grew up together with them, having been orphaned at the age of 12 in 1905.

In 1922, he moved to Paris to study under the sculptor <a href="Antoine%20Bourdelle">Antoine Bourdelle</a>, an associate of <a href="Auguste%20Rodin">Rodin</a>. It was there that Giacometti experimented with <a href="cubism">cubism</a> and <a href="surrealism">surrealism</a> and came to be regarded as one of the leading surrealist sculptors. Among his associates were <a href="Joan%20Mir%C3%B3">Miró</a>, <a href="Max%20Ernst">Max Ernst</a>, <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a>, <a href="Bror%20Hjorth">Bror Hjorth</a>, and <a href="Balthus">Balthus</a>.

Between 1936 and 1940, Giacometti concentrated his sculpting on the human head, focusing on the sitter's gaze. He preferred models he was close to—his sister and the artist <a href="Isabel%20Rawsthorne">Isabel Rawsthorne</a> (then known as Isabel Delmer). This was followed by a phase in which his statues of Isabel became stretched out; her limbs elongated. Obsessed with creating his sculptures exactly as he envisioned through his unique view of reality, he often carved until they were as thin as nails and reduced to the size of a pack of cigarettes, much to his consternation. A friend of his once said that if Giacometti decided to sculpt you, "he would make your head look like the blade of a knife". After his marriage to Annette Arm in 1946 his tiny sculptures became larger, but the larger they grew, the thinner they became. Giacometti said that the final result represented the sensation he felt when he looked at a woman.

His paintings underwent a parallel procedure. The figures appear isolated and severely attenuated, as the result of continuous reworking. Subjects were frequently revisited: one of his favorite models was his younger brother <a href="Diego%20Giacometti">Diego Giacometti</a>. A third brother, <a href="Bruno%20Giacometti">Bruno Giacometti</a>, was a noted architect.

In 1958 Giacometti was asked to create a monumental sculpture for the <a href="Chase%20Manhattan%20Bank">Chase Manhattan Bank</a> building in New York, which was beginning construction. Although he had for many years "harbored an ambition to create work for a public square", he "had never set foot in New York, and knew nothing about life in a rapidly evolving metropolis. Nor had he ever laid eyes on an actual <a href="skyscraper">skyscraper</a>", according to his biographer James Lord. Giacometti's work on the project resulted in the four figures of standing women—his largest sculptures—entitled "Grande femme debout" I through IV (1960). The commission was never completed, however, because Giacometti was unsatisfied by the relationship between the sculpture and the site, and abandoned the project.

In 1962, Giacometti was awarded the grand prize for sculpture at the <a href="Venice%20Biennale">Venice Biennale</a>, and the award brought with it worldwide fame. Even when he had achieved popularity and his work was in demand, he still reworked models, often destroying them or setting them aside to be returned to years later. The prints produced by Giacometti are often overlooked but the catalogue raisonné, "Giacometti – The Complete Graphics and 15 Drawings by Herbert Lust" (Tudor 1970), comments on their impact and gives details of the number of copies of each print. Some of his most important images were in editions of only 30 and many were described as rare in 1970.

In his later years Giacometti's works were shown in a number of large exhibitions throughout Europe. Riding a wave of international popularity, and despite his declining health, he travelled to the United States in 1965 for an exhibition of his works at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> in New York. As his last work he prepared the text for the book "Paris sans fin", a sequence of 150 <a href="lithographs">lithographs</a> containing memories of all the places where he had lived.

Giacometti died in 1966 of heart disease (<a href="pericarditis">pericarditis</a>) and <a href="chronic%20bronchitis">chronic bronchitis</a> at the Kantonsspital in <a href="Chur">Chur</a>, Switzerland. His body was returned to his birthplace in Borgonovo, where he was interred close to his parents. In May 2007 the executor of his widow's estate, former French foreign minister <a href="Roland%20Dumas">Roland Dumas</a>, was convicted of illegally selling Giacometti's works to a top auctioneer, Jacques Tajan, who was also convicted. Both were ordered to pay €850,000 to the Alberto and Annette Giacometti Foundation.

Regarding Giacometti's sculptural technique and according to the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>: "The rough, eroded, heavily worked surfaces of Three Men Walking (II), 1949, typify his technique. Reduced, as they are, to their very core, these figures evoke lone trees in winter that have lost their foliage. Within this style, Giacometti would rarely deviate from the three themes that preoccupied him—the walking man; the standing, nude woman; and the bust—or all three, combined in various groupings".""

In a letter to <a href="Pierre%20Matisse">Pierre Matisse</a>, Giacometti wrote: "Figures were never a compact mass but like a transparent construction". In the letter, Giacometti writes about how he looked back at the realist, classical busts of his youth with nostalgia, and tells the story of the existential crisis which precipitated the style he became known for.

"[I rediscovered] the wish to make compositions with figures. For this I had to make (quickly I thought; in passing), one or two studies from nature, just enough to understand the construction of a head, of a whole figure, and in 1935 I took a model. This study should take, I thought, two weeks and then I could realize my compositions...I worked with the model all day from 1935 to 1940...Nothing was as I imagined. A head, became for me an object completely unknown and without dimensions."

Since Giacometti achieved exquisite realism with facility when he was executing busts in his early adolescence, Giacometti's difficulty in re-approaching the figure as an adult is generally understood as a sign of existential struggle for meaning, rather than as a technical deficit.

Giacometti was a key player in the <a href="Surrealist">Surrealist</a> art movement, but his work resists easy categorization. Some describe it as formalist, others argue it is expressionist or otherwise having to do with what <a href="Deleuze">Deleuze</a> calls "blocs of sensation" (as in Deleuze's analysis of <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29">Francis Bacon</a>). Even after his excommunication from the Surrealist group, while the intention of his sculpting was usually imitation, the end products were an expression of his emotional response to the subject. He attempted to create renditions of his models the way he saw them, and the way he thought they ought to be seen. He once said that he was sculpting not the human figure but "the shadow that is cast".

Scholar <a href="William%20Barrett%20%28philosopher%29">William Barrett</a> in "Irrational Man: A Study in Existential Philosophy" (1962), argues that the attenuated forms of Giacometti's figures reflect the view of 20th century <a href="modernism">modernism</a> and <a href="existentialism">existentialism</a> that modern life is increasingly empty and devoid of meaning. "All the sculptures of today, like those of the past, will end one day in pieces...So it is important to fashion ones work carefully in its smallest recess and charge every particle of matter with life."

A 2011-2012 exhibition at the <a href="Pinacoth%C3%A8que%20de%20Paris">Pinacothèque de Paris</a> focussed on showing how Giacometti was inspired by <a href="Etruscan%20art">Etruscan art</a>.

Giacometti's work has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions including <a href="Pera%20Museum">Pera Museum</a>, Istanbul (2015) <a href="Pushkin%20Museum">Pushkin Museum</a>, Moscow (2008); “The Studio of Alberto Giacometti: Collection of the Fondation Alberto et Annette Giacometti”, <a href="Centre%20Pompidou">Centre Pompidou</a>, Paris (2007–2008); Kunsthal Rotterdam (2008); <a href="Fondation%20Beyeler">Fondation Beyeler</a>, Basel (2009), Buenos Aires (2012); <a href="Kunsthalle%20Hamburg">Kunsthalle Hamburg</a> (2013), and the <a href="High%20Museum%20of%20Art">High Museum of Art</a>, Atlanta (1970).

The <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Portrait Gallery, London</a>'s first solo exhibition of Giacometti's work, "Pure Presence" opened to five star reviews on 13 October 2015 (to January 10, 2016, in honour of the fiftieth anniversary of the artist's death).

Giacometti's work is displayed in numerous public collections, including:

The <a href="Fondation%20Alberto%20et%20Annette%20Giacometti">Fondation Alberto et Annette Giacometti</a>, having received a bequest from Alberto Giacometti's widow Annette, holds a collection of circa 5,000 works, frequently displayed around the world through exhibitions and long-term loans. A public interest institution, the Foundation was created in 2003 and aims at promoting, disseminating, preserving and protecting Alberto Giacometti's work.

The <a href="http%3A//www.giacometti-stiftung.ch/">Alberto Giacometti-Stiftung</a> established in Zürich in 1965, holds a smaller collection of works acquired from the collection of the Pittsburgh industrialist <a href="G.%20David%20Thompson">G. David Thompson</a>.

In November 2000 a Giacometti bronze, "Grande Femme Debout I", sold for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>14.3 million. "Grande Femme Debout II" was bought by the <a href="Gagosian%20Gallery">Gagosian Gallery</a> for $27.4 million at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> auction in New York City on May 6, 2008.

"<a href="L%27Homme%20qui%20marche%20I">L'Homme qui marche I</a>", a life-sized bronze sculpture of a man, became one of the most expensive works of art and the most expensive sculpture ever sold at auction on February 2, 2010, when it sold for £65 million (US$104.3 million) at <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a>, London.

Anthem

An anthem is a <a href="musical%20composition">musical composition</a> of <a href="wikt%3Acelebration">celebration</a>, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a>s of <a href="country">countries</a>. Originally, and in <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a> and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred <a href="choral%20music">choral work</a> and still more particularly to a specific form of <a href="Anglican%20church%20music">Anglican church music</a>.

"Anthem" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Greek</a> ("antíphōna") via <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> . Both words originally referred to <a href="antiphon">antiphon</a>s, a <a href="call%20and%20response%20%28music%29">call-and-response</a> style of singing. The adjectival form is "anthemic".

Anthems were originally a form of <a href="liturgical%20music">liturgical music</a>. In the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, the <a href="rubric">rubric</a> appoints them to follow the third <a href="collect">collect</a> at morning and evening prayer. Several anthems are included in the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">British coronation service</a>. The words are selected from <a href="Holy%20Scripture">Holy Scripture</a> or in some cases from the <a href="Liturgy">Liturgy</a> and the music is generally more elaborate and varied than that of <a href="psalm">psalm</a> or <a href="hymn%20tune">hymn tune</a>s. Being written for a trained <a href="choir">choir</a> rather than the congregation, the Anglican anthem is analogous to the <a href="motet">motet</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="Lutheran%20Church">Lutheran Church</a>es but represents an essentially English <a href="musical%20form">musical form</a>. Anthems may be described as "<a href="verse%20anthem">verse</a>", "full", or "full with verse", depending on whether they are intended for <a href="solo%20%28music%29">solo</a>ists, the <a href="choir">full choir</a>, or both.

The anthem developed as a replacement for the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> "votive antiphon" commonly sung as an appendix to the main <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">office</a> to the <a href="Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> or <a href="saint%20%28Christianity%29">other saints</a>. During the <a href="Elizabethan%20period">Elizabethan period</a>, notable anthems were composed by <a href="Thomas%20Tallis">Thomas Tallis</a>, <a href="William%20Byrd">William Byrd</a>, Tye, and Farrant but they were not mentioned in the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">pageRank.Book of Common Prayer</a> until 1662 when the famous <a href="rubric">rubric</a> "In quires and places where they sing here followeth the Anthem" first appears. Early anthems tended to be simple and <a href="homophony">homophonic</a> in texture, so that the words could be clearly heard. During the 17th century, notable anthems were composed by <a href="Orlando%20Gibbons">Orlando Gibbons</a>, <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>, and <a href="John%20Blow">John Blow</a>, with the <a href="verse%20anthem">verse anthem</a> becoming the dominant musical form of the <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a>. In the 18th century, famed anthems were composed by Croft, Boyce, <a href="James%20Kent">James Kent</a>, <a href="James%20Nares">James Nares</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Cooke">Benjamin Cooke</a>, and <a href="Samuel%20Arnold%20%28composer%29">Samuel Arnold</a>. In the 19th, <a href="Samuel%20Sebastian%20Wesley">Samuel Sebastian Wesley</a> wrote anthems influenced by contemporary <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> which stretch to several <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movements</a> and last twenty minutes or longer. Later in the century, <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a> used symphonic techniques to produce a more concise and unified structure. Many anthems have been composed since this time, generally by <a href="organist">organist</a>s rather than professional <a href="composer">composer</a>s and often in a conservative style. Major composers have usually composed anthems in response to commissions and for special occasions. Examples include <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a>'s 1912 "Great is the Lord" and 1914 "Give unto the Lord" (both with orchestral accompaniment), <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>'s 1943 "<a href="Rejoice%20in%20the%20Lamb">Rejoice in the Lamb</a>" (a modern example of a multi-movement anthem, today heard mainly as a concert piece), and, on a much smaller scale, <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>'s 1952 "O Taste and See" written for the coronation of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. With the relaxation of the rule, in <a href="England">England</a> at least, that anthems should be only in English, the repertoire has been greatly enhanced by the addition of many works from the Latin repertoire.

The word "anthem" is now commonly used to describe any celebratory song or composition for a distinct group, as in <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a>s. Many <a href="Pop%20music">pop song</a>s are used as <a href="sports%20anthem">sports anthem</a>s, notably including <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>'s "<a href="We%20Are%20the%20Champions">We Are the Champions</a>" and "<a href="We%20Will%20Rock%20You">We Will Rock You</a>", and some sporting events have their own anthems, most notably including <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Anthem">UEFA Champions League</a>. Further, some songs are artistically styled as anthems, whether or not they are used as such, including <a href="Marilyn%20Manson%20%28band%29">Marilyn Manson</a>'s "<a href="Irresponsible%20Hate%20Anthem">Irresponsible Hate Anthem</a>", <a href="Silverchair">Silverchair</a>'s "<a href="Anthem%20for%20the%20Year%202000">Anthem for the Year 2000</a>", and <a href="Toto%20%28band%29">Toto</a>'s "Child's Anthem".

Albrecht Altdorfer

Albrecht Altdorfer (c. 1480 – February 12, 1538) was a German painter, engraver and architect of the Renaissance working in <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>. Along with <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a> and <a href="Wolf%20Huber">Wolf Huber</a> he is regarded to be the main representative of the so-called <a href="Danube%20School">Danube School</a> setting biblical and historical subjects against landscape backgrounds of expressive colours. As an artist also making small intricate engravings he is seen to belong to the Nuremberg <a href="Little%20Masters">Little Masters</a>.

Altdorfer was born in <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a> or <a href="Altdorf%2C%20Lower%20Bavaria">Altdorf</a> around 1480.

He acquired an interest in art from his father, Ulrich Altdorfer, who was a painter and miniaturist. At the start of his career, he won public attention by creating small, intimate modestly scaled works in unconventional media and with eccentric subject matter. He settled in the <a href="free%20imperial%20city">free imperial city</a> of Regensburg, a town located on the <a href="Danube%20River">Danube River</a> in 1505, eventually becoming the town architect and a town councillor. His first signed works date to c. 1506, including engravings and drawings such the "Stygmata of St. Francis" and "St. Jerome". His models were <a href="niello">niello</a>s and copper engravings from the workshops of <a href="Jacopo%20de%20Barbari">Jacopo de Barbari</a> and <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>.

Around 1511 or earlier, he travelled down the river and south into the Alps, where the scenery moved him so deeply that he became the first <a href="Landscape%20painting">landscape painter</a> in the modern sense, making him the leader of the <a href="Danube%20School">Danube School</a>, a circle that pioneered landscape as an independent genre, in southern <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. From 1513 he was at the service of <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a> in <a href="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a>, where he received several commissions from the imperial court. During the turmoil of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, he dedicated mostly to architecture; paintings of the period, showing his increasing attention to architecture, include the "<a href="Nativity%20of%20the%20Virgin%20%28Altdorfer%29">Nativity of the Virgin</a>".

In 1529 he executed "<a href="The%20Battle%20of%20Alexander%20at%20Issus">The Battle of Alexander at Issus</a>" for Duke <a href="William%20IV%20of%20Bavaria">William IV of Bavaria</a>. In the 1520s he returned to Regensburg as a wealthy man, and became a member of the city's council. He was also responsible for the fortifications of Regensburg.

In that period his works are influenced by artists such as <a href="Giorgione">Giorgione</a> and <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Lucas Cranach</a>, as shown by his "<a href="Crucifixion%20%28Altdorfer%29">Crucifixion</a>". In 1535 he was in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. He died at <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a> in 1538.

The remains of Altdorfer's surviving work comprises 55 panels, 120 drawings, 125 woodcuts, 78 engravings, 36 etchings, 24 paintings on parchment, and fragments from a mural for the bathhouse of the Kaiserhof in Regensburg. This production extends at least over the period 1504–1537. He signed and dated each one of his works.

Altdorfer was the pioneer painter of pure landscape, making them the subject of the painting, as well as compositions dominated by their landscape; these <a href="List%20of%20landscapes%20by%20Albrecht%20Altdorfer">comprise much of his oeuvre</a>. He believed that the human figure should not disrupt nature, but rather participate in it or imitate its natural processes. Taking and developing the landscape style of <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a>, he shows the hilly landscape of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> valley with thick forests of drooping and crumbling firs and larches hung with moss, and often dramatic colouring from a rising or setting sun. His "<a href="Landscape%20with%20Footbridge">Landscape with Footbridge</a>" (<a href="National%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Gallery, London</a>) of 1518–1520 is claimed to be the first pure landscape in oil. In this painting, Altdorfer places a large tree that is cut off by the margins at the center of the landscape, making it the central axis and focus within the piece. He uses <a href="Anthropomorphize">anthropomorphism</a> to give the tree human qualities such as the drapery of its limbs. He also made many fine finished drawings, mostly landscapes, in pen and <a href="watercolour">watercolour</a> such as the "Landscape with the Woodcutter" in 1522. The drawing opens at ground level on a clearing surrounding an enormous tree that is placed in the center, dominating the picture. It poses and gesticulates as if it was human, splaying its branches out in every corner. Halfway up the tree trunk, hangs a gabled shrine. At the time, a shrine like this might shelter an image of the Crucifixion or the Virgin Mary, but since it is turned away from the viewer, we are not sure what it truly is. At the bottom of the tree, a tiny figure of a seated man, crossed legged, holds a knife and axe, declaring his status in society/occupation.

Also, he often painted scenes of historical and biblical subjects, set in atmospheric landscapes. His best religious scenes are intense, with their glistening lights and glowing colours sometimes verging on the expressionistic. They often depict moments of intimacy between Christ and his mother, or various saints. His sacral masterpiece and one of the most famous religious works of art of the later <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> is "The Legend of <a href="St.%20Sebastian">St. Sebastian</a>" and "The <a href="Passion%20of%20Christ">Passion of Christ</a>" of the so-called "Sebastian Altar" in "<a href="St.%20Florian%27s%20Priory">St. Florian's Priory</a>" ("Stift Sankt Florian") near <a href="Linz">Linz</a>, <a href="Upper%20Austria">Upper Austria</a>. When closed the altarpiece displayed the four panels of the legend of St. Sebastian’s Martyrdom, while the opened wings displayed the <a href="Stations%20of%20the%20Cross">Stations of the Cross</a>. Today the altarpiece is dismantled and the <a href="predella">predella</a>s depicting the two final scenes, "<a href="Entombment">Entombment</a>" and "<a href="Resurrection">Resurrection</a>" were sold to <a href="Kunsthistorisches%20Museum">Kunsthistorisches Museum</a> in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> in 1923 and 1930. Both these paintings share a similar formal structure that consists of an open landscape that is seen beyond and through the opening of a dark grotto. The date of completion on the resurrection panel is 1518.

Altdorfer often distorts perspective to subtle effect. His donor figures are often painted completely out of scale with the main scene, as in paintings of the previous centuries. He also painted some portraits; overall his painted oeuvre was not large. In his later works, Altdorfer moved more towards mannerism and began to depict the human form to the conformity of the Italian model, as well as dominate the picture with frank colors.

His rather atypical "<a href="The%20Battle%20of%20Alexander%20at%20Issus">Battle of Issus</a>" (or of "<a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander</a>") of 1529 was commissioned by <a href="William%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">William IV, Duke of Bavaria</a> as part of a series of eight historical battle scenes destined to hang in the Residenz in Munich. Albrecht Altdorfer's depiction of the moment in 333 BCE when Alexander the Great routed Darius III for supremacy in Asia Minor is vast in ambition, sweeping in scope, vivid in imagery, rich in symbols, and obviously heroic—the Iliad of painting, as literary critic Friedrich Schlegel suggested In the painting, a swarming cast of thousands of soldiers surround the central action: Alexander on his white steed, leading two rows of charging cavalrymen, dashes after a fleeing Darius, who looks anxiously over his shoulder from a chariot. The opposing armies are distinguished by the colors of their uniforms: Darius' army in red and Alexander's in blue. The upper half of "The Battle of Alexander" expands with unreal rapidity into an arcing panorama comprehending vast coiling tracts of globe and sky. The victory also lies on the planar surface; The sun outshone the moon just as the Imperial and allied army successfully repel the Turks.
By making the mass number of soldiers blend within the landscape/painting, it shows that he believed that the usage and depiction of landscape was just as significant as a historical event, such as a war. He renounced the office of "Mayor of Regensburg" to accept the commission. Few of his other paintings resemble this apocalyptic scene of two huge armies dominated by an extravagant landscape seen from a very high viewpoint, which looks south over the whole Mediterranean from modern Turkey to include the island of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and the mouths of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> and the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> (behind the isthmus to the left) on the other side. However his style here is a development of that of a number of miniatures of battle-scenes he had done much earlier for <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a> in his <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a> "<a href="Triumphal%20Procession">Triumphal Procession</a>" in 1512-14. It is thought to be the earliest painting to show the curvature of the Earth from a great height.

The "Battle" is now in the <a href="Alte%20Pinakothek">Alte Pinakothek</a>, which has the best collection of Altdorfer's paintings, including also his small "St. George and the Dragon" (1510), in oil on <a href="parchment">parchment</a>, where the two figures are tiny and almost submerged in the lush, dense forest that towers over them. Altdorfer seems to exaggerate the measurements of the forest in comparison to the figures: the leaves appear to be larger than the horse, showing the significance of nature and landscape. He also emphasizes line within the work, by displaying the upward growth of the forest with the vertical and diagonal lines of the trunks. There is a small opening of the forest on the lower right hand corner that provides a rest for your eyes. It serves to create depth within the painting and is the only place you can see the characters. The human form is completely absorbed by the thickness of the forest. Fantastic light effects provide a sense of mystery and dissolve the outline of objects. Without the contrast of light, the figures would blend in with its surrounding environment. Altdorfer's figures are invariably the complement of his romantic landscapes; for them he borrowed <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>'s inventive iconography, but the panoramic setting is personal and has nothing to do with the fantasy landscapes of the Netherlands A "" (1526) set outside an Italianate skyscraper of a palace shows his interest in architecture. Another small oil on parchment, "Danube Landscape with Castle Wörth" (c. 1520) is one of the earliest accurate topographical paintings of a particular building in its setting, of a type that was to become a cliché in later centuries.

Altdorfer was a significant <a href="printmaker">printmaker</a>, with numerous <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s and about ninety-three <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s. These included some for the "Triumphs of Maximilian", where he followed the overall style presumably set by <a href="Hans%20Burgkmair">Hans Burgkmair</a>, although he was able to escape somewhat from this in his depictions of the more disorderly baggage-train, still coming through a mountain landscape. However most of his best <a href="Old%20master%20print">prints</a> are <a href="etching">etching</a>s, many of landscapes; in these he was able most easily to use his drawing style. He was one of the most successful early etchers, and was unusual for his generation of German printmakers in doing no book illustrations. He often combined etching and engraving techniques in a single plate, and produced about 122 intaglio prints altogether. Many of Altdorfer's prints are quite small in size, and he is considered to be of the main members of the group of artists known as the <a href="Little%20Masters">Little Masters</a>. <a href="Arthur%20Mayger%20Hind">Arthur Mayger Hind</a> considers his graphical work to be somewhat lacking in technical skill but with an "intimate personal touch", and notes his characteristic feeling for landscape.

As the superintendent of the municipal buildings Altdorfer had overseen the construction of several commercial structures, such as a slaughterhouse and a building for wine storage, possibly even designing them. He was considered to be an outstanding politician of his day. In 1517 he was a member of the "Ausseren Rates", the council on external affairs, and in this capacity was involved in the expulsion of the Jews, the destruction of the <a href="Regensburg%20Synagogue">synagogue</a> and in its place the construction of a church and shrine to the Schöne Maria that occurred in 1519. Altdorfer made etchings of the interior of the synagogue and designed a woodcut of the cult image of the Schöne Maria. In 1529–1530 he was also charged with reinforcing certain city fortifications in response to the Turkish threat.

Albrecht's brother, <a href="Erhard%20Altdorfer">Erhard Altdorfer</a>, was also a painter and printmaker in woodcut and engraving, and a pupil of <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a>.

House of Ascania

The House of Ascania () is a <a href="dynasty">dynasty</a> of German rulers. It is also known as the House of Anhalt, which refers to its longest-held possession, <a href="Principality%20of%20Anhalt">Anhalt</a>.

The Ascanians are named after Ascania (or Ascaria) Castle, "Schloss Askanien", which was located near and named after <a href="Aschersleben">Aschersleben</a>. The castle was the seat of the County of Ascania, a title that was later subsumed into the titles of the princes of Anhalt.

The earliest known member of the house, <a href="Esiko%2C%20Count%20of%20Ballenstedt">Esiko, Count of Ballenstedt</a>, first appears in a document of 1036. He is assumed to have been a grandson (through his mother) of <a href="Odo%20I%2C%20Margrave%20of%20the%20Saxon%20Ostmark">Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark</a>. From Odo, the Ascanians inherited large properties in the <a href="Saxon%20Eastern%20March">Saxon Eastern March</a>.

Esiko's grandson was <a href="Otto%2C%20Count%20of%20Ballenstedt">Otto, Count of Ballenstedt</a>, who died in 1123. By Otto's marriage to <a href="Eilika%20of%20Saxony">Eilika</a>, daughter of <a href="Magnus%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxony">Magnus, Duke of Saxony</a>, the Ascanians became heirs to half of the property of the House of <a href="Billung">Billung</a>, former dukes of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Saxony">Saxony</a>.

Otto's son, <a href="Albert%20the%20Bear">Albert the Bear</a>, became, with the help of his mother's inheritance, the first Ascanian duke of Saxony in 1139. However, he soon lost control of Saxony to the rival <a href="House%20of%20Guelph">House of Guelph</a>. 

Albert inherited the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a> in 1157 from its last <a href="Wends">Wendish</a> ruler, <a href="Pribislav%20of%20Brandenburg">Pribislav</a>, and he became the first Ascanian margrave. Albert, and his descendants of the House of Ascania, then made considerable progress in <a href="Christianity">Christianizing</a> and <a href="Germanisation">Germanizing</a> the lands. As a borderland between German and <a href="Slavs">Slavic</a> cultures, the country was known as a <a href="marches">march</a>.

In 1237 and 1244, two towns, <a href="C%C3%B6lln">Cölln</a> and Berlin, were founded during the rule of Otto and Johann, grandsons of Margrave Albert the Bear. Later, they were united into one city, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. The emblem of the House of Ascania, a red eagle and bear, became the heraldic emblems of Berlin. In 1320, the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end.

After the Emperor had deposed the Guelph rulers of Saxony in 1180, Ascanians returned to rule the Duchy of Saxony, which had been reduced to its eastern half by the Emperor. However, even in eastern Saxony, the Ascanians could establish control only in limited areas, mostly near the River Elbe.

In the 13th century, the <a href="Principality%20of%20Anhalt">Principality of Anhalt</a> was split off from the Duchy of Saxony. Later, the remaining state was split into <a href="Saxe-Lauenburg">Saxe-Lauenburg</a> and <a href="Saxe-Wittenberg">Saxe-Wittenberg</a>. The Ascanian dynasties in the two Saxon states became extinct in 1689 and in 1422, respectively, but Ascanians continued to rule in the smaller state of Anhalt and its various subdivisions until the monarchy was abolished in 1918.

<a href="Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia">Catherine the Great</a>, Empress of Russia from 1762–1796, was a member of the House of Ascania, herself the daughter of <a href="Christian%20August%2C%20Prince%20of%20Anhalt-Zerbst">Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst</a>.

Acceleration

Acceleration, in <a href="physics">physics</a>, is the <a href="Rate%20%28mathematics%29">rate</a> of change of <a href="velocity">velocity</a> of an object with respect to time. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all <a href="force">force</a>s acting on the object, as described by <a href="Newton%27s%20Second%20Law">Newton's Second Law</a>. The <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">SI</a> unit for acceleration is <a href="metre%20per%20second%20squared">metre per second squared</a> Accelerations are <a href="Euclidean%20vector">vector</a> quantities (they have <a href="Magnitude%20%28mathematics%29">magnitude</a> and <a href="Direction%20%28geometry%29">direction</a>) and add according to the <a href="parallelogram%20law">parallelogram law</a>. As a <a href="Vector%20space">vector</a>, the calculated net <a href="force">force</a> is equal to the product of the object's mass (a <a href="Scalar%20%28physics%29">scalar</a> quantity) and its acceleration.

For example, when a car starts from a standstill (zero relative velocity) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. If the car turns, an acceleration occurs toward the new-direction. In this example, we can call the forward acceleration of the car a "linear acceleration", which passengers in the car might experience as a force pushing them back into their seats. When changing direction, we might call this "non-linear acceleration", which passengers might experience as a sideways force. If the speed of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction from the direction of the vehicle, sometimes called deceleration. Passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them forwards. Mathematically, there is no separate formula for deceleration: both are changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations (linear, non-linear, deceleration) might be felt by passengers until their velocity (speed and direction) matches that of the car. 

An object's average acceleration over a period of <a href="time%20in%20physics">time</a> is its change in <a href="velocity">velocity</a> formula_1 divided by the duration of the period formula_2. Mathematically,

Instantaneous acceleration, meanwhile, is the <a href="limit%20of%20a%20function">limit</a> of the average acceleration over an <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a> interval of time. In the terms of <a href="calculus">calculus</a>, instantaneous acceleration is the <a href="derivative">derivative</a> of the velocity vector with respect to time:

It can be seen that the <a href="integral">integral</a> of the acceleration function is the velocity function ; that is, the area under the curve of an acceleration vs. time ( vs. ) graph corresponds to velocity.

As acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity, , with respect to time and velocity is defined as the derivative of position, , with respect to time, acceleration can be thought of as the <a href="second%20derivative">second derivative</a> of with respect to :

Acceleration has the <a href="dimensional%20analysis">dimensions</a> of velocity (L/T) divided by time, i.e. <a href="length">L</a>.<a href="time">T</a>. The <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">SI</a> unit of acceleration is the <a href="metre%20per%20second%20squared">metre per second squared</a> (m s); or "metre per second per second", as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value, every second.

An object moving in a circular motion—such as a satellite orbiting the Earth—is accelerating due to the change of direction of motion, although its speed may be constant. In this case it is said to be undergoing "centripetal" (directed towards the center) acceleration.

<a href="Proper%20acceleration">Proper acceleration</a>, the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition, is measured by an instrument called an <a href="accelerometer">accelerometer</a>.

In <a href="classical%20mechanics">classical mechanics</a>, for a body with constant mass, the (vector) acceleration of the body's center of mass is proportional to the net <a href="force">force</a> vector (i.e. sum of all forces) acting on it (<a href="Newton%27s%20laws%20of%20motion">Newton's second law</a>):
where F is the net force acting on the body, "m" is the <a href="mass">mass</a> of the body, and a is the center-of-mass acceleration. As speeds approach the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>, <a href="Special%20relativity">relativistic effects</a> become increasingly large.

The velocity of a particle moving on a curved path as a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> of time can be written as:

with "v"("t") equal to the speed of travel along the path, and

a <a href="Differential%20geometry%20of%20curves%23Tangent%20vector">unit vector tangent</a> to the path pointing in the direction of motion at the chosen moment in time. Taking into account both the changing speed "v(t)" and the changing direction of u, the acceleration of a particle moving on a curved path can be written using the <a href="chain%20rule">chain rule</a> of differentiation for the product of two functions of time as:

where u is the unit (inward) <a href="Differential%20geometry%20of%20curves%23Normal%20or%20curvature%20vector">normal vector</a> to the particle's trajectory (also called "the principal normal"), and r is its instantaneous <a href="Curvature%23Curvature%20of%20plane%20curves">radius of curvature</a> based upon the <a href="Osculating%20circle%23Mathematical%20description">osculating circle</a> at time "t". These components are called the <a href="tangential%20acceleration">tangential acceleration</a> and the normal or radial acceleration (or centripetal acceleration in circular motion, see also <a href="circular%20motion">circular motion</a> and <a href="centripetal%20force">centripetal force</a>).

Geometrical analysis of three-dimensional space curves, which explains tangent, (principal) normal and binormal, is described by the <a href="Frenet%E2%80%93Serret%20formulas">Frenet–Serret formulas</a>.

"Uniform" or "constant" acceleration is a type of motion in which the <a href="velocity">velocity</a> of an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period.

A frequently cited example of uniform acceleration is that of an object in <a href="free%20fall">free fall</a> in a uniform gravitational field. The acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a> strength "<a href="standard%20gravity">g</a>" (also called "acceleration due to gravity"). By <a href="Newton%27s%20Second%20Law">Newton's Second Law</a> the <a href="force">force</a>, "F", acting on a body is given by:

Because of the simple analytic properties of the case of constant acceleration, there are simple formulas relating the <a href="Displacement%20%28vector%29">displacement</a>, initial and time-dependent <a href="velocity">velocities</a>, and acceleration to the <a href="time%20in%20physics">time elapsed</a>:

where

In particular, the motion can be resolved into two orthogonal parts, one of constant velocity and the other according to the above equations. As <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a> showed, the net result is parabolic motion, which describes, e. g., the trajectory of a projectile in a vacuum near the surface of Earth.

Uniform <a href="circular%20motion">circular motion</a>, that is constant speed along a circular path, is an example of a body experiencing acceleration resulting in velocity of a constant magnitude but change of direction. In this case, because the direction of the object's motion is constantly changing, being tangential to the circle, the object's linear <a href="velocity">velocity</a> vector also changes, but its speed does not. This acceleration is a radial acceleration since it is always directed toward the centre of the circle and takes the magnitude:

where formula_24 is the object's linear <a href="speed">speed</a> along the circular path. Equivalently, the radial acceleration vector (formula_25) may be calculated from the object's <a href="angular%20velocity">angular velocity</a> formula_26:

where formula_28 is a vector directed from the centre of the circle and equal in magnitude to the radius. The negative shows that the acceleration vector is directed towards the centre of the circle (opposite to the radius).

The acceleration and the net force acting on a body in uniform circular motion are directed "toward" the centre of the circle; that is, it is <a href="centripetal%20force">centripetal</a>. Whereas the so-called '<a href="centrifugal%20force">centrifugal force</a>' appearing to act outward on the body is really a <a href="pseudo%20force">pseudo force</a> experienced in the <a href="frame%20of%20reference">frame of reference</a> of the body in circular motion, due to the body's <a href="linear%20momentum">linear momentum</a> at a tangent to the circle.

With nonuniform circular motion, i.e., the speed along the curved path changes, a transverse acceleration is produced equal to the rate of change of the angular speed around the circle times the radius of the circle. That is,

The transverse (or tangential) acceleration is directed at right angles to the radius vector and takes the sign of the <a href="angular%20acceleration">angular acceleration</a> (formula_30).

The special theory of relativity describes the behavior of objects traveling relative to other objects at speeds approaching that of light in a vacuum. <a href="Newtonian%20mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a> is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality, valid to great accuracy at lower speeds. As the relevant speeds increase toward the speed of light, acceleration no longer follows classical equations.

As speeds approach that of light, the acceleration produced by a given force decreases, becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached; an object with mass can approach this speed <a href="asymptotically">asymptotically</a>, but never reach it.

Unless the state of motion of an object is known, it is impossible to distinguish whether an observed force is due to <a href="gravity">gravity</a> or to acceleration—gravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects. <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> called this the <a href="principle%20of%20equivalence">principle of equivalence</a>, and said that only observers who feel no force at all—including the force of gravity—are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating.

Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage

The conservation-restoration of cultural heritage focuses on protection and care of tangible <a href="cultural%20heritage">cultural heritage</a>, including <a href="Collection%20%28artwork%29">artworks</a>, <a href="Architectural%20conservation">architecture</a>, <a href="Archaeological%20conservation">archaeology</a>, and <a href="Museum">museum collections</a>. Conservation activities include <a href="collections%20care">preventive conservation</a>, examination, <a href="Documentation%20of%20cultural%20property">documentation</a>, research, treatment, and education. This field is closely allied with <a href="Conservation%20science%20%28cultural%20heritage%29">conservation science</a>, <a href="curator">curator</a>s and <a href="Registrar%20%28museum%29">registrars</a>.

Conservation of <a href="cultural%20heritage">cultural heritage</a> involves protection and restoration using "any methods that prove effective in keeping that property in as close to its original condition as possible for as long as possible." Conservation of cultural heritage is often associated with <a href="Collection%20%28artwork%29">art collections</a> and <a href="museum">museum</a>s and involves collection care and management through tracking, examination, documentation, exhibition, storage, preventative conservation, and restoration.

The scope has widened from art conservation, involving protection and care of artwork and architecture, to conservation of cultural heritage, also including protection and care of a broad set of other cultural and historical works. Conservation of cultural heritage can be described as a type of ethical <a href="stewardship">stewardship</a>.

Conservation of cultural heritage applies simple ethical guidelines:

Often there are compromises between preserving appearance, maintaining original design and material properties, and ability to reverse changes. Reversibility is now emphasized so as to reduce problems with future treatment, investigation, and use.

In order for conservators to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy and apply their professional expertise accordingly, they must take into account views of the <a href="Project%20stakeholder">stakeholder</a>, the <a href="Values%20%28heritage%29">values</a> and <a href="Preservation%20of%20meaning">meaning</a> of the work, and the physical needs of the material.

Cesare Brandi in his "Theory of Restoration", describes restoration as "the methodological moment in which the work of art is appreciated in its material form and in its historical and aesthetic duality, with a view to transmitting it to the future".

Some consider the tradition of conservation of cultural heritage in Europe to have begun in 1565 with the <a href="restoration%20of%20the%20Sistine%20Chapel%20frescoes">restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes</a>, but more ancient examples include the work of <a href="Cassiodorus">Cassiodorus</a>.

The care of cultural heritage has a long history, one that was primarily aimed at fixing and mending objects for their continued use and aesthetic enjoyment. Until the early 20th century, artists were normally the ones called upon to repair damaged artworks. During the 19th century, however, the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as <a href="Michael%20Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art. <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> carried out scientific analysis on paint as well. However, perhaps the first organized attempt to apply a theoretical framework to the conservation of cultural heritage came with the founding in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> of the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Ancient%20Buildings">Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings</a> in 1877. The society was founded by <a href="William%20Morris">William Morris</a> and <a href="Philip%20Webb">Philip Webb</a>, both of whom were deeply influenced by the writings of <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>. During the same period, a French movement with similar aims was being developed under the direction of <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Viollet-le-Duc">Eugène Viollet-le-Duc</a>, an architect and theorist, famous for his restorations of medieval buildings.
Conservation of cultural heritage as a distinct field of study initially developed in Germany, where in 1888 <a href="Friedrich%20Rathgen">Friedrich Rathgen</a> became the first <a href="chemist">chemist</a> to be employed by a <a href="Museum">Museum</a>, the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin (<a href="Royal%20Museum%20%28Berlin%29">Royal Museums of Berlin</a>). He not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach by publishing a Handbook of Conservation in 1898. The early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. In the United Kingdom, pioneering research into painting materials and conservation, ceramics, and stone conservation was conducted by <a href="Arthur%20Pillans%20Laurie">Arthur Pillans Laurie</a>, academic chemist and Principal of <a href="Heriot-Watt%20University">Heriot-Watt University</a> from 1900. Laurie's interests were fostered by <a href="William%20Holman%20Hunt">William Holman Hunt</a>. In 1924 the chemist <a href="Dr%20Harold%20Plenderleith">Dr Harold Plenderleith</a> began to work at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> with Dr. Alexander Scott in the recently created Research Laboratory, although he was actually employed by the <a href="Department%20of%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Scientific and Industrial Research</a> in the early years. Plenderleith's appointment may be said to have given birth to the conservation "profession" in the UK, although there had been craftsmen in many museums and in the commercial art world for generations. This department was created by the museum to address the deteriorating condition of objects in the collection, damages which were a result of their being stored in the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> tunnels during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. The creation of this department moved the focus for the development of conservation theory and practice from Germany to Britain, and made the latter a prime force in this fledgling field. In 1956 Plenderleith wrote a significant handbook called The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art, which supplanted Rathgen's earlier tome and set new standards for the development of art and <a href="Conservation%20science%20%28cultural%20heritage%29">conservation science</a>.

In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, the development of conservation of cultural heritage can be traced to the <a href="Fogg%20Art%20Museum">Fogg Art Museum</a>, and Edward Waldo Forbes, its director from 1909 to 1944. He encouraged technical investigation, and was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the first technical journal, Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts, published by the Fogg from 1932 to 1942. Importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists. <a href="Rutherford%20John%20Gettens">Rutherford John Gettens</a> was the first of usch in the US to be permanently employed by an art museum. He worked with <a href="George%20L.%20Stout">George L. Stout</a>, the founder and first editor of Technical Studies. Gettens and Stout co-authored Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia in 1942, reprinted in 1966. This compendium is still cited regularly. Only a few dates and descriptions in Gettens' and Stout's book are now outdated.

George T. Oliver, of <a href="Oliver%20Brothers%20Fine%20Art%20Restoration">Oliver Brothers Art Restoration and Art Conservation-Boston</a>
(Est. 1850 in New York City) invented the vacuum hot table for <a href="lining%20of%20paintings">relining</a> paintings in 1920s; he filed a patent for the table in 1937. Taylor's prototype table, which he designed and constructed, is still in operation. Oliver Brothers is believed to be the first and the oldest continuously operating art restoration company in the United States.

The focus of conservation development then accelerated in Britain and America, and it was in Britain that the first International Conservation Organisations developed. <a href="International%20Institute%20for%20Conservation">The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)</a> was incorporated under British law in 1950 as "a permanent organization to co-ordinate and improve the knowledge, methods, and working standards needed to protect and preserve precious materials of all kinds." The rapid growth of conservation professional organizations, publications, journals, newsletters, both internationally and in localities, has spearheaded the development of the conservation profession, both practically and theoretically. Art historians and theorists such as <a href="Cesare%20Brandi">Cesare Brandi</a> have also played a significant role in developing conservation science theory. In recent years ethical concerns have been at the forefront of developments in conservation. Most significantly has been the idea of <a href="preventive%20conservation">preventive conservation</a>. This concept is based in part on the pioneering work by <a href="Garry%20Thomson">Garry Thomson</a> <a href="CBE">CBE</a>, and his book the Museum Environment, first published in 1978. Thomson was associated with the <a href="National%20Gallery%20%28London%29">National Gallery</a> in London; it was here that he established a set of guidelines or environmental controls for the best conditions in which objects could be stored and displayed within the museum environment. Although his exact guidelines are no longer rigidly followed, they did inspire this field of conservation.

The conservator's work is guided by ethical standards. These take the form of <a href="applied%20ethics">applied ethics</a>. Ethical standards have been established across the world, and national and international ethical guidelines have been written. One such example is:


Conservation OnLine provides resources on ethical issues in conservation, including examples of codes of ethics and guidelines for professional conduct in conservation and allied fields; and charters and treaties pertaining to ethical issues involving the preservation of cultural property.

As well as standards of practice conservators deal with wider ethical concerns, such as the debates as to whether all art is worth preserving.

Many cultural works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as <a href="temperature">temperature</a>, <a href="humidity">humidity</a> and exposure to <a href="light">visible light</a> and <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet radiation</a>. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels. For example, <a href="watercolour%20painting">watercolour paintings</a> usually require shielding from sunlight to prevent fading of <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s.

Collections care is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

A principal aim of a cultural conservator is to reduce the rate of deterioration of an object. Both non-interventive and interventive methodologies may be employed in pursuit of this goal. Interventive conservation refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object. Interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons, including aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for structural integrity, or cultural requirements for intangible continuity. Examples of interventive treatments include the removal of discolored varnish from a painting, the application of wax to a sculpture, and the washing and rebinding of a book. Ethical standards within the field require that the conservator fully justify interventive actions and carry out documentation before, during, and after the treatment.

One of the guiding principles of conservation of cultural heritage has traditionally been the idea of reversibility, that all interventions with the object should be fully reversible and that the object should be able to be returned to the state in which it was prior to the conservator's intervention. Although this concept remains a guiding principle of the profession, it has been widely critiqued within the conservation profession and is now considered by many to be "a fuzzy concept." Another important principle of conservation is that all alterations should be well documented and should be clearly distinguishable from the original object.

An example of a highly publicized interventive conservation effort would be the conservation work conducted on the <a href="restoration%20of%20the%20Sistine%20Chapel%20frescoes">Sistine Chapel</a>.

Conservators routinely use chemical and scientific analysis for the examination and treatment of cultural works. The modern conservation laboratory uses equipment such as <a href="microscope">microscope</a>s, <a href="spectrometer">spectrometer</a>s, and various <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a> regime instruments to better understand objects and their components. The data thus collected helps in deciding the conservation treatments to be provided to the object.

Heritage Preservation, in partnership with the <a href="Institute%20of%20Museum%20and%20Library%20Services">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>, a U.S. federal agency, produced The Heritage Health Index. The results of this work was the report <a href="http%3A//www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/summary.html">A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections</a>, which was published in December 2005 and concluded that immediate action is needed to prevent the loss of 190 million artifacts that are in need of conservation treatment. The report made four recommendations:

In October 2006, the <a href="Department%20for%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport">Department for Culture, Media and Sport</a>, a governmental department, authored a document: "Understanding the Future: Priorities for England's Museums". This document was based on several years of consultation aimed to lay out the government's priorities for museums in the 21st century.

The document listed the following as priorities for the next decade:


The conservation profession response to this report was on the whole less than favourable, the <a href="Institute%20of%20Conservation">Institute of Conservation</a> (ICON) published their response under the title "A Failure of Vision". It had the following to say:

Concluding: 

Further to this the ICON website summary report lists the following specific recommendations:


In November 2008, the UK-based <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a> <a href="Demos%20%28UK%20think%20tank%29">Demos</a> published an influential pamphlet entitled "It's a material world: caring for the public realm", in which they argue for integrating the public directly into efforts to conserve material culture, particularly that which is in the public, their argument, as stated on page 16, demonstrates their belief that society can benefit from conservation as a paradigm as well as a profession:

Training in conservation of cultural heritage for many years took the form of an <a href="apprenticeship">apprenticeship</a>, whereby an apprentice slowly developed the necessary skills to undertake their job. For some specializations within conservation this is still the case. However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation of cultural heritage.

The University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an <a href="intern">intern</a>.

Conservation of cultural heritage is an <a href="interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> field as conservators have backgrounds in the <a href="fine%20arts">fine arts</a>, sciences (including <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="biology">biology</a>, and <a href="materials%20science">materials science</a>), and closely related disciplines, such as <a href="art%20history">art history</a>, <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a>, <a href="studio%20art">studio art</a>, and <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a>. They also have design, fabrication, artistic, and other special skills necessary for the practical application of that knowledge.

Within the various schools that teach conservation of cultural heritage, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself. This is acknowledged by the <a href="American%20Institute%20for%20Conservation">American Institute for Conservation</a> who advise "Specific admission requirements differ and potential candidates are encouraged to contact the programs directly for details on prerequisites, application procedures, and program curriculum".

Societies devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Ancient%20Buildings">Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings</a> in Britain to protect the built heritage, this society continues to be active today.

The built heritage was at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. <a href="Preservation%20Virginia">Preservation Virginia</a>, founded in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.

Today, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field, and within their area of specialization.

These organizations exist to "support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage".

This involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators, allied professionals, and the public.

Anton Chekhov

Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (, ; 29 January 1860 – 15 July 1904) was a Russian <a href="playwright">playwright</a> and short story writer, who is considered to be among the greatest writers of short fiction in history. His career as a playwright produced four classics and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. Along with <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a> and <a href="August%20Strindberg">August Strindberg</a>, Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early <a href="modernism">modernism</a> in the theatre. Chekhov practiced as a <a href="Physician">medical doctor</a> throughout most of his literary career: "Medicine is my lawful wife", he once said, "and literature is my mistress."

Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of "<a href="The%20Seagull">The Seagull</a>" in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by <a href="Konstantin%20Stanislavski">Konstantin Stanislavski</a>'s <a href="Moscow%20Art%20Theatre">Moscow Art Theatre</a>, which subsequently also produced Chekhov's "<a href="Uncle%20Vanya">Uncle Vanya</a>" and premiered his last two plays, "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28play%29">Three Sisters</a>" and "<a href="The%20Cherry%20Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a>". These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences, because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a "theatre of mood" and a "submerged life in the text".

Chekhov had at first written stories only for financial gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story. He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them.

Anton Chekhov was born on the feast day of St. <a href="Anthony%20the%20Great">Anthony the Great</a> (17 January Old Style) 29 January 1860, the third of six surviving children, in <a href="Taganrog%2C%20Russia">Taganrog</a>, a port on the <a href="Sea%20of%20Azov">Sea of Azov</a> in southern <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>. His father, Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov, the son of a former <a href="serfdom">serf</a> and his Ukrainian wife, were from the village Vilkhovatka near <a href="Kobeliaky">Kobeliaky</a> (<a href="Poltava%20Oblast">Poltava Region</a> in modern-day <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>) and ran a grocery store. A director of the parish choir, devout <a href="Orthodox%20Christian">Orthodox Christian</a>, and physically abusive father, Pavel Chekhov has been seen by some historians as the model for his son's many portraits of hypocrisy. Chekhov's mother, Yevgeniya (Morozova), was an excellent storyteller who entertained the children with tales of her travels with her cloth-merchant father all over Russia. "Our talents we got from our father," Chekhov remembered, "but our soul from our mother."
In adulthood, Chekhov criticised his brother <a href="Alexander%20Chekhov">Alexander's</a> treatment of his wife and children by reminding him of Pavel's tyranny: "Let me ask you to recall that it was <a href="despotism">despotism</a> and lying that ruined your mother's youth. Despotism and lying so mutilated our childhood that it's sickening and frightening to think about it. Remember the horror and disgust we felt in those times when Father threw a tantrum at dinner over too much salt in the soup and called Mother a fool."

Chekhov attended the <a href="Greek%20Church%20and%20Greek%20School%20in%20Taganrog">Greek School in Taganrog</a> and the Taganrog "<a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">Gymnasium</a>" (since renamed the <a href="Chekhov%20Gymnasium">Chekhov Gymnasium</a>), where he was kept down for a year at fifteen for failing an examination in Ancient Greek. He sang at the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox</a> monastery in Taganrog and in his father's choirs. In a letter of 1892, he used the word "suffering" to describe his childhood and recalled:

He later became an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>.

In 1876, Chekhov's father was declared bankrupt after overextending his finances building a new house, having been cheated by a contractor called Mironov. To avoid <a href="debtor%27s%20prison">debtor's prison</a> he fled to Moscow, where his two eldest sons, <a href="Alexander%20Chekhov">Alexander</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Chekhov">Nikolay</a>, were attending university. The family lived in poverty in Moscow, Chekhov's mother physically and emotionally broken by the experience. Chekhov was left behind to sell the family's possessions and finish his education.

Chekhov remained in Taganrog for three more years, boarding with a man called Selivanov who, like Lopakhin in "The Cherry Orchard", had bailed out the family for the price of their house. Chekhov had to pay for his own education, which he managed by private tutoring, catching and selling <a href="European%20Goldfinch">goldfinches</a>, and selling short sketches to the newspapers, among other jobs. He sent every <a href="ruble">ruble</a> he could spare to his family in Moscow, along with humorous letters to cheer them up. During this time, he read widely and analytically, including the works of <a href="Miguel%20de%20Cervantes">Cervantes</a>, <a href="Ivan%20Turgenev">Turgenev</a>, <a href="Ivan%20Goncharov">Goncharov</a>, and <a href="Arthur%20Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>, and wrote a full-length comic drama, "Fatherless", which his brother Alexander dismissed as "an inexcusable though innocent fabrication." Chekhov also enjoyed a series of love affairs, one with the wife of a teacher.

In 1879, Chekhov completed his schooling and joined his family in Moscow, having gained admission to the medical school at <a href="I.M.%20Sechenov%20First%20Moscow%20State%20Medical%20University">I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University</a>.

Chekhov now assumed responsibility for the whole family. To support them and to pay his tuition fees, he wrote daily short, humorous sketches and vignettes of contemporary Russian life, many under pseudonyms such as "Antosha Chekhonte" (Антоша Чехонте) and "Man without a Spleen" (Человек без селезенки). His prodigious output gradually earned him a reputation as a <a href="satire">satirical</a> chronicler of Russian street life, and by 1882 he was writing for "Oskolki" ("<a href="Fragments%20%28magazine%29">Fragments</a>"), owned by <a href="Nikolai%20Leykin">Nikolai Leykin</a>, one of the leading publishers of the time. Chekhov's tone at this stage was harsher than that familiar from his mature fiction.

In 1884, Chekhov qualified as a physician, which he considered his principal profession though he made little money from it and treated the poor free of charge.

In 1884 and 1885, Chekhov found himself coughing blood, and in 1886 the attacks worsened, but he would not admit his <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> to his family or his friends. He confessed to Leykin, "I am afraid to submit myself to be sounded by my colleagues." He continued writing for weekly periodicals, earning enough money to move the family into progressively better accommodations.

Early in 1886 he was invited to write for one of the most popular papers in <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>, "<a href="Novoye%20Vremya%20%28newspaper%29">Novoye Vremya</a>" ("New Times"), owned and edited by the millionaire magnate <a href="Alexey%20Suvorin">Alexey Suvorin</a>, who paid a rate per line double Leykin's and allowed Chekhov three times the space. Suvorin was to become a lifelong friend, perhaps Chekhov's closest.

Before long, Chekhov was attracting literary as well as popular attention. The sixty-four-year-old <a href="Dmitry%20Grigorovich">Dmitry Grigorovich</a>, a celebrated Russian writer of the day, wrote to Chekhov after reading his short story "The Huntsman" that "You have "real" talent, a talent that places you in the front rank among writers in the new generation." He went on to advise Chekhov to slow down, write less, and concentrate on literary quality.

Chekhov replied that the letter had struck him "like a thunderbolt" and confessed, "I have written my stories the way reporters write up their notes about fires — mechanically, half-consciously, caring nothing about either the reader or myself."" The admission may have done Chekhov a disservice, since early manuscripts reveal that he often wrote with extreme care, continually revising. Grigorovich's advice nevertheless inspired a more serious, artistic ambition in the twenty-six-year-old. In 1888, with a little string-pulling by Grigorovich, the short story collection "At Dusk" ("V Sumerkakh") won Chekhov the coveted <a href="Pushkin%20Prize">Pushkin Prize</a> "for the best literary production distinguished by high artistic worth."

In 1887, exhausted from overwork and ill health, Chekhov took a trip to <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, which reawakened him to the beauty of the <a href="Pontic-Caspian%20steppe">steppe</a>. On his return, he began the novella-length short story "," which he called "something rather odd and much too original," and which was eventually published in "<a href="Severny%20Vestnik">Severny Vestnik</a>" ("The Northern Herald"). In a narrative that drifts with the thought processes of the characters, Chekhov evokes a <a href="chaise">chaise</a> journey across the steppe through the eyes of a young boy sent to live away from home, and his companions, a priest and a merchant. "The Steppe" has been called a "dictionary of Chekhov's poetics", and it represented a significant advance for Chekhov, exhibiting much of the quality of his mature fiction and winning him publication in a literary journal rather than a newspaper.

In autumn 1887, a theatre manager named Korsh commissioned Chekhov to write a play, the result being "<a href="Ivanov%20%28play%29">Ivanov</a>", written in a fortnight and produced that November. Though Chekhov found the experience "sickening" and painted a comic portrait of the chaotic production in a letter to his brother Alexander, the play was a hit and was praised, to Chekhov's bemusement, as a work of originality. Although Chekhov did not fully realize it at the time, Chekhov's plays, such as "The Seagull" (written in 1895), "Uncle Vanya" (written in 1897), "The Three Sisters" (written in 1900), and "The Cherry Orchard" (written in 1903) served as a revolutionary backbone to what is common sense to the medium of acting to this day: an effort to recreate and express the "realism" of how people truly act and speak with each other and translating it to the stage in order to manifest the human condition as accurately as possible in hopes to make the audience reflect upon their own definition of what it means to be human, warts and all.

This philosophy of approaching the art of acting has stood not only steadfast, but as the cornerstone of acting for much of the 20th century to this day. <a href="Mikhail%20Chekhov%20%28writer%29">Mikhail Chekhov</a> considered "Ivanov" a key moment in his brother's intellectual development and literary career. From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's that has become known as <a href="Chekhov%27s%20gun">Chekhov's gun</a>, a dramatic principle that requires that every element in a narrative be necessary and irreplaceable, and that everything else be removed.
The death of Chekhov's brother Nikolay from tuberculosis in 1889 influenced "A Dreary Story", finished that September, about a man who confronts the end of a life that he realises has been without purpose. Mikhail Chekhov, who recorded his brother's depression and restlessness after Nikolay's death, was researching prisons at the time as part of his law studies, and Anton Chekhov, in a search for purpose in his own life, himself soon became obsessed with the issue of prison reform.

In 1890, Chekhov undertook an arduous journey by train, horse-drawn carriage, and river steamer to the Russian Far East and the "<a href="katorga">katorga</a>", or penal colony, on <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin Island</a>, north of Japan, where he spent three months interviewing thousands of convicts and settlers for a census. The letters Chekhov wrote during the two-and-a-half-month journey to Sakhalin are considered to be among his best. His remarks to his sister about <a href="Tomsk">Tomsk</a> were to become notorious.

The inhabitants of Tomsk later retaliated by erecting a mocking statue of Chekhov.

Chekhov witnessed much on Sakhalin that shocked and angered him, including floggings, embezzlement of supplies, and <a href="sexual%20slavery">forced prostitution</a> of women. He wrote, "There were times I felt that I saw before me the extreme limits of man's degradation." He was particularly moved by the plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example:

Chekhov later concluded that charity was not the answer, but that the government had a duty to finance humane treatment of the convicts. His findings were published in 1893 and 1894 as "Ostrov Sakhalin" ("<a href="Sakhalin%20Island%20%28Chekhov%29">The Island of Sakhalin</a>"), a work of social science, not literature, that is worthy and informative rather than brilliant. Chekhov found literary expression for the "Hell of Sakhalin" in his long short story "," the last section of which is set on Sakhalin, where the murderer Yakov loads coal in the night while longing for home. Chekhov's writing on Sakhalin is the subject of brief comment and analysis in <a href="Haruki%20Murakami">Haruki Murakami</a>'s novel <a href="1Q84">1Q84</a>. It is also the subject of a poem by the Nobel Prize winner <a href="Seamus%20Heaney">Seamus Heaney</a>, "Chekhov on Sakhalin" (collected in the volume "Station Island").

In 1892, Chekhov bought the small country estate of <a href="Melikhovo">Melikhovo</a>, about forty miles south of Moscow, where he lived with his family until 1899. "It's nice to be a lord," he joked to his friend Ivan Leontyev (who wrote humorous pieces under the pseudonym Shcheglov), but he took his responsibilities as a landlord seriously and soon made himself useful to the local peasants. As well as organising relief for victims of the <a href="famine">famine</a> and <a href="cholera">cholera</a> outbreaks of 1892, he went on to build three schools, a fire station, and a clinic, and to donate his medical services to peasants for miles around, despite frequent recurrences of his tuberculosis.

Mikhail Chekhov, a member of the household at Melikhovo, described the extent of his brother's medical commitments:

Chekhov's expenditure on drugs was considerable, but the greatest cost was making journeys of several hours to visit the sick, which reduced his time for writing. However, Chekhov's work as a doctor enriched his writing by bringing him into intimate contact with all sections of Russian society: for example, he witnessed at first hand the peasants' unhealthy and cramped living conditions, which he recalled in his short story "Peasants". Chekhov visited the upper classes as well, recording in his notebook: "Aristocrats? The same ugly bodies and physical uncleanliness, the same toothless old age and disgusting death, as with market-women."

In 1894, Chekhov began writing his play "The Seagull" in a lodge he had built in the orchard at Melikhovo. In the two years since he had moved to the estate, he had refurbished the house, taken up agriculture and horticulture, tended the orchard and the pond, and planted many trees, which, according to Mikhail, he "looked after ... as though they were his children. Like Colonel Vershinin in his "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28play%29">Three Sisters</a>", as he looked at them he dreamed of what they would be like in three or four hundred years."

The first night of "The Seagull", at the <a href="Alexandrinsky%20Theatre">Alexandrinsky Theatre</a> in St. Petersburg on 17 October 1896, was a fiasco, as the play was booed by the audience, stinging Chekhov into renouncing the theatre. But the play so impressed the theatre director <a href="Vladimir%20Nemirovich-Danchenko">Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko</a> that he convinced his colleague <a href="Konstantin%20Stanislavski">Konstantin Stanislavski</a> to direct a new production for the innovative <a href="Moscow%20Art%20Theatre">Moscow Art Theatre</a> in 1898. Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the text, and restored Chekhov's interest in playwriting. The Art Theatre commissioned more plays from Chekhov and the following year staged "Uncle Vanya", which Chekhov had completed in 1896.

In March 1897, Chekhov suffered a major hemorrhage of the lungs while on a visit to Moscow. With great difficulty he was persuaded to enter a clinic, where the doctors diagnosed tuberculosis on the upper part of his lungs and ordered a change in his manner of life.

After his father's death in 1898, Chekhov bought a plot of land on the outskirts of <a href="Yalta">Yalta</a> and built a <a href="White%20Dacha">villa</a>, into which he moved with his mother and sister the following year. Though he planted trees and flowers, kept dogs and tame cranes, and received guests such as <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> and <a href="Maxim%20Gorky">Maxim Gorky</a>, Chekhov was always relieved to leave his "hot <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>" for Moscow or travels abroad. He vowed to move to Taganrog as soon as a water supply was installed there. In Yalta he completed two more plays for the Art Theatre, composing with greater difficulty than in the days when he "wrote serenely, the way I eat pancakes now". He took a year each over "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28play%29">Three Sisters</a>" and "<a href="The%20Cherry%20Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a>".

On 25 May 1901, Chekhov married <a href="Olga%20Knipper">Olga Knipper</a> quietly, owing to his horror of weddings. She was a former protegée and sometime lover of Nemirovich-Danchenko whom he had first met at rehearsals for "The Seagull". Up to that point, Chekhov, known as "Russia's most elusive literary bachelor," had preferred passing liaisons and visits to brothels over commitment. He had once written to Suvorin:

The letter proved prophetic of Chekhov's marital arrangements with Olga: he lived largely at Yalta, she in Moscow, pursuing her acting career. In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and <a href="Donald%20Rayfield">Donald Rayfield</a> has offered evidence, based on the couple's letters, that conception may have occurred when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have rejected that claim. The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence that preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in his plays.

In Yalta, Chekhov wrote one of his most famous stories, "<a href="The%20Lady%20with%20the%20Dog%20%28short%20story%29">The Lady with the Dog</a>" (also translated from the Russian as "Lady with Lapdog"), which depicts what at first seems a casual liaison between a cynical married man and an unhappy married woman who meet while vacationing in <a href="Yalta">Yalta</a>. Neither expects anything lasting from the encounter. Unexpectedly though, they gradually fall deeply in love and end up risking scandal and the security of their family lives. The story masterfully captures their feelings for each other, the inner transformation undergone by the disillusioned male protagonist as a result of falling deeply in love, and their inability to resolve the matter by either letting go of their families or of each other.

By May 1904, Chekhov was terminally ill with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. Mikhail Chekhov recalled that "everyone who saw him secretly thought the end was not far off, but the nearer [he] was to the end, the less he seemed to realise it." On 3 June, he set off with Olga for the German spa town of <a href="Badenweiler">Badenweiler</a> in the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>, from where he wrote outwardly jovial letters to his sister Masha, describing the food and surroundings, and assuring her and his mother that he was getting better. In his last letter, he complained about the way German women dressed.

Chekhov's death has become one of "the great set pieces of literary history," retold, embroidered, and fictionalised many times since, notably in the short story "Errand" by <a href="Raymond%20Carver">Raymond Carver</a>. In 1908, Olga wrote this account of her husband's last moments:

Chekhov's body was transported to Moscow in a refrigerated railway car meant for <a href="oyster">oyster</a>s, a detail that offended <a href="Maxim%20Gorky">Gorky</a>. Some of the thousands of mourners followed the funeral procession of a <a href="Fyodor%20Keller">General Keller</a> by mistake, to the accompaniment of a military band. Chekhov was buried next to his father at the <a href="Novodevichy%20Cemetery">Novodevichy Cemetery</a>.

A few months before he died, Chekhov told the writer <a href="Ivan%20Bunin">Ivan Bunin</a> that he thought people might go on reading his writings for seven years. "Why seven?" asked Bunin. "Well, seven and a half," Chekhov replied. "That's not bad. I've got six years to live."

Chekhov's posthumous reputation greatly exceeded his expectations. The ovations for the play "<a href="The%20Cherry%20Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a>" in the year of his death served to demonstrate the Russian public's acclaim for the writer, which placed him second in literary celebrity only to <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Tolstoy</a>, who outlived him by six years. Tolstoy was an early admirer of Chekhov's short stories and had a series that he deemed "first quality" and "second quality" bound into a book. In the first category were: "Children", "The Chorus Girl", "A Play", "Home", "Misery", "The Runaway", "In Court", "Vanka", "Ladies", "A Malefactor", "The Boys", "Darkness", "Sleepy", "The Helpmate", and "<a href="The%20Darling%20%28Chekhov%29">The Darling</a>""; in the second: "A Transgression", "Sorrow", "The Witch", "Verochka", "In a Strange Land", "The Cook's Wedding", "A Tedious Business", "An Upheaval", "Oh! The Public!", "The Mask", "A Woman's Luck", "Nerves", "The Wedding", "A Defenseless Creature", and "Peasant Wives."

In Chekhov's lifetime, British and Irish critics generally did not find his work pleasing; <a href="E.%20J.%20Dillon">E. J. Dillon</a> thought "the effect on the reader of Chekhov's tales was repulsion at the gallery of human waste represented by his fickle, spineless, drifting people" and <a href="R.%20E.%20C.%20Long">R. E. C. Long</a> said "Chekhov's characters were repugnant, and that Chekhov reveled in stripping the last rags of dignity from the human soul". After his death, Chekhov was reappraised. <a href="Constance%20Garnett">Constance Garnett</a>'s translations won him an English-language readership and the admiration of writers such as <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>, and <a href="Katherine%20Mansfield">Katherine Mansfield</a>, whose story "The Child Who Was Tired" is similar to Chekhov's "Sleepy". The Russian critic <a href="D.%20S.%20Mirsky">D. S. Mirsky</a>, who lived in England, explained Chekhov's popularity in that country by his "unusually complete rejection of what we may call the heroic values." In Russia itself, Chekhov's drama fell out of fashion after the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">revolution</a>, but it was later incorporated into the Soviet canon. The character of Lopakhin, for example, was reinvented as a hero of the new order, rising from a modest background so as eventually to possess the gentry's estates.

One of the first non-Russians to praise Chekhov's plays was <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>, who subtitled his "<a href="Heartbreak%20House">Heartbreak House</a>" "A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes," and pointed out similarities between the predicament of the British landed class and that of their Russian counterparts as depicted by Chekhov: "the same nice people, the same utter futility."

In the United States, Chekhov's reputation began its rise slightly later, partly through the influence of <a href="Stanislavski%27s%20system">Stanislavski's system</a> of acting, with its notion of <a href="subtext">subtext</a>: "Chekhov often expressed his thought not in speeches," wrote Stanislavski, "but in pauses or between the lines or in replies consisting of a single word ... the characters often feel and think things not expressed in the lines they speak." The <a href="Group%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%29">Group Theatre</a>, in particular, developed the subtextual approach to drama, influencing generations of <a href="Theater%20in%20the%20United%20States">American playwrights</a>, screenwriters, and actors, including <a href="Clifford%20Odets">Clifford Odets</a>, <a href="Elia%20Kazan">Elia Kazan</a> and, in particular, <a href="Lee%20Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a>. In turn, Strasberg's <a href="Actors%20Studio">Actors Studio</a> and the <a href="Method%20acting">"Method" acting</a> approach influenced many actors, including <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a> and <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a>, though by then the Chekhov tradition may have been distorted by a preoccupation with realism. In 1981, the playwright <a href="Tennessee%20Williams">Tennessee Williams</a> adapted "The Seagull" as "<a href="The%20Notebook%20of%20Trigorin">The Notebook of Trigorin</a>". One of Anton's nephews, <a href="Michael%20Chekhov">Michael Chekhov</a> would also contribute heavily to modern theatre, particularly through his unique acting methods which developed Stanislavski's ideas further.

Despite Chekhov's reputation as a playwright, <a href="William%20Boyd%20%28writer%29">William Boyd</a> asserts that his short stories represent the greater achievement. <a href="Raymond%20Carver">Raymond Carver</a>, who wrote the short story "Errand" about Chekhov's death, believed that Chekhov was the greatest of all short story writers:

<a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, another writer influenced by Chekhov, was more grudging: "Chekhov wrote about six good stories. But he was an amateur writer." And <a href="Vladimir%20Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a> criticized Chekhov's "medley of dreadful prosaisms, ready-made epithets, repetitions." But he also declared "<a href="The%20Lady%20with%20the%20Dog">The Lady with the Dog</a>" "one of the greatest stories ever written" in its depiction of a problematic relationship, and described Chekhov as writing "the way one person relates to another the most important things in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice."

For the writer <a href="William%20Boyd%20%28writer%29">William Boyd</a>, Chekhov's historical accomplishment was to abandon what <a href="William%20Gerhardie">William Gerhardie</a> called the "event plot" for something more "blurred, interrupted, mauled or otherwise tampered with by life."

Virginia Woolf mused on the unique quality of a Chekhov story in "The Common Reader" (1925):

While a Professor of Comparative Literature at Princeton University, Michael Goldman presented his view on defining the elusive quality of Chekhov's comedies stating: "Having learned that Chekhov is comic ... Chekhov is comic in a very special, paradoxical way. His plays depend, as comedy does, on the vitality of the actors to make pleasurable what would otherwise be painfully awkward -- inappropriate speeches, missed connections, "faux pas", stumbles, childishness -- but as part of a deeper pathos; the stumbles are not pratfalls but an energized, graceful dissolution of purpose."

<a href="Alan%20Twigg">Alan Twigg</a>, the chief editor and publisher of the Canadian book review magazine "<a href="B.C.%20BookWorld">BC Bookworld</a> wrote,
Chekhov has also influenced the work of Japanese playwrights including <a href="Shimizu%20Kunio">Shimizu Kunio</a>, <a href="Y%C5%8Dji%20Sakate">Yōji Sakate</a>, and <a href="Ai%20Nagai">Ai Nagai</a>. Critics have noted similarities in how Chekhov and Shimizu use a mixture of light humor as well as an intense depictions of longing. Sakate adapted several of Chekhov's plays and transformed them in the general style of "<a href="n%C5%8D">nō</a>". Nagai also adapted Chekhov's plays, including <a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28play%29">"Three Sisters"</a>, and transformed his dramatic style into Nagai's style of satirical realism while emphasizing the social issues depicted on the play.

Chekhov's works have been adapted for the screen, including <a href="Sidney%20Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sea%20Gull">Sea Gull</a>" and <a href="Louis%20Malle">Louis Malle</a>'s "<a href="Vanya%20on%2042nd%20Street">Vanya on 42nd Street</a>". Laurence Olivier's last film as director was an adaptation of the Three Sisters (UK 1970). It was released in the U.S. In 1974. His work has also served as inspiration or been referenced in numerous films. In <a href="Andrei%20Tarkovsky">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>'s 1975 film <a href="The%20Mirror%20%281975%20film%29">"The Mirror"</a>, characters discuss his short story "<a href="Ward%20No.%206">Ward No. 6</a>". Woody Allen has been influenced by Chekhov and reference to his works are present in many of his films including Love and Death (1975), Interiors (1978) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1985). Plays by Chekhov are also referenced in <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a>'s 1980 drama film "<a href="The%20Last%20Metro">The Last Metro</a>", which is set in a theater.

Action Against Hunger

Action Against Hunger (or Action Contre La Faim (ACF) in French) is a global <a href="humanitarian%20organization">humanitarian organization</a> which originated in France and is committed to ending world <a href="hunger">hunger</a>. The organization helps <a href="Malnutrition%20in%20children">malnourished children</a> whilst providing communities with access to safe water and sustainable solutions to hunger.

In 2014, Action Against Hunger worked in 49 different countries around the world with more than 6,000 employees and volunteers helping 13.6 million people in need.

Action Against Hunger was established in 1979 by a group of French doctors, scientists, and writers. Nobel Prize-winning physicist <a href="Alfred%20Kastler">Alfred Kastler</a> served as the organization's first chairman.

The group initially provided assistance to <a href="Afghanistan%20refugees">Afghanistan refugees</a> in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, famine-stricken <a href="Ugandan">Ugandan</a> communities, and <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>n refugees in <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>. It expanded to address additional humanitarian concerns in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Balkans and elsewhere during the 1980s and 1990s. Action Against Hunger's Scientific Committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula (<a href="F-100%20%28food%29">F100</a>), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat <a href="acute%20malnutrition">acute malnutrition</a>. As a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%. A few years later, therapeutic milk was repackaged as ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), a peanut-based paste packaged like a power bar. These bars allow for the treatment of malnutrition at home, and do not require any preparation or refrigeration.

The international network currently has headquarters in five countries – <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="United%20States">the United States</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, and <a href="United%20Kingdom">the UK</a>. Its four main areas of work include nutrition, food security, water and sanitation, and advocacy.

Action Against Hunger saves lives by preventing, detecting and treating severe acute malnutrition, particularly in emergency and conflicts situations. The organisation has an integrated approach with various sectors of intervention:

Action Against Hunger partners with leaders from the food and beverage industry to bring attention to global hunger. Each year, several campaigns are ran by the network to raise funds and support the organisation's programs : Restaurants Against Hunger and Love Food Give Food.

In 2017, Action Against Hunger International Network is present in 51 countries:

<a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>, <a href="Cameroon">Cameroun</a>, <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, <a href="Djibouti">Djibouti</a>, <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a>, <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>, <a href="Niger">Niger</a>, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>, <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>, <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>, <a href="South%20Sudan">South Soudan</a>, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="Chad">Chad</a>, <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>

Since 1995 Action Against Hunger developed an international network to have a bigger global impact.

The Network has 5 headquarters in the world: <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>.

Action Against Hunger has also a West Africa Regional Office (WARO) located in Dakar, a Training center in Nairobi and 5 logistic platforms (Lyon, Paris, Barcelona, Dubai, Panama).

This network increases the human and financial capacities and enables a specialization per headquarter.

Apoptosis

Apoptosis (from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> ἀπόπτωσις "falling off") is a process of <a href="programmed%20cell%20death">programmed cell death</a> that occurs in <a href="multicellular%20organism">multicellular organism</a>s. <a href="Biochemistry">Biochemical</a> events lead to characteristic cell changes (<a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>) and death. These changes include <a href="Bleb%20%28cell%20biology%29">blebbing</a>, cell shrinkage, <a href="Karyorrhexis">nuclear fragmentation</a>, <a href="Pyknosis">chromatin condensation</a>, <a href="Apoptotic%20DNA%20fragmentation">chromosomal DNA fragmentation</a>, and global <a href="mRNA">mRNA</a> decay. Between 50 and 70 <a href="1%2C000%2C000%2C000">billion</a> cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult. For an average child between the ages of 8 and 14, approximately 20 to 30 billion cells die a day.

In contrast to <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a>, which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's lifecycle. For example, the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human <a href="embryo">embryo</a> occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that <a href="phagocytic%20cells">phagocytic cells</a> are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to the neighboring cells.

Because apoptosis cannot stop once it has begun, it is a highly regulated process. Apoptosis can be initiated through one of two pathways. In the "intrinsic pathway" the cell kills itself because it senses cell stress, while in the "extrinsic pathway" the cell kills itself because of signals from other cells. Both pathways induce cell death by activating <a href="caspase">caspase</a>s, which are <a href="protease">protease</a>s, or enzymes that degrade proteins. The two pathways both activate initiator caspases, which then activate executioner caspases, which then kill the cell by degrading proteins indiscriminately.

Research on apoptosis has increased substantially since the early 1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes <a href="atrophy">atrophy</a>, whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as <a href="cancer">cancer</a>.
Some factors like <a href="Fas%20receptor">Fas receptor</a>s and <a href="caspase">caspase</a>s promote apoptosis, while some members of the <a href="Bcl-2%20family">Bcl-2 family</a> of proteins inhibit apoptosis.

German scientist <a href="Karl%20Vogt">Karl Vogt</a> was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in 1842. In 1885, anatomist <a href="Walther%20Flemming">Walther Flemming</a> delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, John Foxton Ross Kerr at University of Queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death. Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join Alastair R Currie, as well as <a href="Andrew%20Wyllie">Andrew Wyllie</a>, who was Currie's graduate student, at University of Aberdeen. In 1972, the trio published a seminal article in the <a href="British%20Journal%20of%20Cancer">British Journal of Cancer</a>. Kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis, but in the article, the process of natural cell death was called "apoptosis". Kerr, Wyllie and Currie credited James Cormack, a professor of Greek language at <a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a>, with suggesting the term apoptosis. Kerr received the <a href="Paul%20Ehrlich%20and%20Ludwig%20Darmstaedter%20Prize">Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize</a> on March 14, 2000, for his description of apoptosis. He shared the prize with Boston biologist <a href="H.%20Robert%20Horvitz">H. Robert Horvitz</a>.

For many years, the terms "apoptosis" and "programmed cell death" were not highly cited. What transformed cell death from obscurity to a major field of research were two things: the identification of components of the cell death control and effector mechanisms, and the linkage of abnormalities in cell death to human disease, in particular cancer.

The 2002 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Medicine</a> was awarded to <a href="Sydney%20Brenner">Sydney Brenner</a>, Horvitz and <a href="John%20Sulston">John E. Sulston</a> for their work identifying genes that control apoptosis. The genes were identified by studies in the nematode "<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">C. elegans</a>" and homologues of these genes function in humans to regulate apoptosis.
In Greek, apoptosis translates to the "falling off" of leaves from a tree. Cormack, professor of Greek language, reintroduced the term for medical use as it had a medical meaning for the Greeks over two thousand years before. <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> used the term to mean "the falling off of the bones". <a href="Galen">Galen</a> extended its meaning to "the dropping of the scabs". Cormack was no doubt aware of this usage when he suggested the name. Debate continues over the correct pronunciation, with opinion divided between a pronunciation with the second "p" silent ( ) and the second "p" pronounced (), as in the original Greek. In English, the "p" of the Greek "-pt-" <a href="consonant%20cluster">consonant cluster</a> is typically silent at the beginning of a word (e.g. <a href="Pterodactylus">pterodactyl</a>, <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>), but articulated when used in combining forms preceded by a vowel, as in <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a> or the orders of insects: <a href="Fly">diptera</a>, <a href="lepidoptera">lepidoptera</a>, etc.

In the original Kerr, Wyllie & Currie paper, there is a footnote regarding the pronunciation:

"We are most grateful to Professor James Cormack of the Department of Greek, University of Aberdeen, for suggesting this term. The word "apoptosis" () is used in Greek to describe the "dropping off" or "falling off" of petals from flowers, or leaves from trees. To show the derivation clearly, we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable, the second half of the word being pronounced like "ptosis" (with the "p" silent), which comes from the same root "to fall", and is already used to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid."

The initiation of apoptosis is tightly regulated by activation mechanisms, because once apoptosis has begun, it inevitably leads to the death of the cell. The two best-understood activation mechanisms are the intrinsic pathway (also called the mitochondrial pathway) and the extrinsic pathway. The "intrinsic pathway" is activated by intracellular signals generated when cells are stressed and depends on the release of proteins from the intermembrane space of mitochondria. The "extrinsic pathway" is activated by extracellular ligands binding to cell-surface death receptors, which leads to the formation of the <a href="death-inducing%20signaling%20complex">death-inducing signaling complex</a> (DISC).

A cell initiates intracellular apoptotic signaling in response to a stress, which may bring about cell suicide. The binding of nuclear receptors by <a href="glucocorticoid">glucocorticoid</a>s, heat, radiation, nutrient deprivation, viral infection, <a href="Hypoxia%20%28medical%29">hypoxia</a> and increased intracellular <a href="calcium">calcium</a> concentration,
for example, by damage to the membrane, can all trigger the release of intracellular apoptotic signals by a damaged cell. A number of cellular components, such as <a href="poly%20ADP%20ribose%20polymerase">poly ADP ribose polymerase</a>, may also help regulate apoptosis.

Before the actual process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, apoptotic signals must cause regulatory proteins to initiate the apoptosis pathway. This step allows those signals to cause cell death, or the process to be stopped, should the cell no longer need to die. Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: the targeting of <a href="Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> functionality, or directly transducing the signal via <a href="Signal%20transducing%20adaptor%20protein">adaptor proteins</a> to the apoptotic mechanisms. An extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity, which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease <a href="calpain">calpain</a>.

The <a href="Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> are essential to multicellular life. Without them, a cell ceases to <a href="Cellular%20respiration%23Aerobic%20respiration">respire aerobically</a> and quickly dies. This fact forms the basis for some apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways. They may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores, or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out. They are very closely related to intrinsic pathway, and tumors arise more frequently through intrinsic pathway than the extrinsic pathway because of sensitivity. There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that <a href="nitric%20oxide">nitric oxide</a> is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the <a href="membrane%20potential">membrane potential</a> of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable. Nitric oxide has been implicated in initiating and inhibiting apoptosis through its possible action as a signal molecule of subsequent pathways that activate apoptosis.

Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (second mitochondria-derived activator of <a href="caspase">caspase</a>s) are released into the cell's <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a> following the increase in permeability of the mitochondria membranes. SMAC binds to "<a href="Inhibitor%20of%20apoptosis">proteins that inhibit apoptosis</a>" (IAPs) thereby deactivating them, and preventing the IAPs from arresting the process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed. IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of <a href="cysteine%20protease">cysteine protease</a>s called <a href="caspase">caspase</a>s, which carry out the degradation of the cell. Therefore, the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability.

<a href="Cytochrome%20c">Cytochrome c</a> is also released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel, the <a href="mitochondrial%20apoptosis-induced%20channel">mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel</a> (MAC), in the outer mitochondrial membrane, and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis. Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor – 1 ("<a href="Apaf-1">Apaf-1</a>") and <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>, which then bind to "pro-caspase-9" to create a protein complex known as an <a href="apoptosome">apoptosome</a>. The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of <a href="caspase-9">caspase-9</a>, which in turn activates the effector "caspase-3".

<a href="MAC%2C%20the%20Mitochondrial%20Apoptosis-Induced%20Channel">MAC</a> (not to be confused with the Membrane Attack Complex formed by complement activation, also commonly denoted as MAC), also called "Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization Pore" is regulated by various proteins, such as those encoded by the mammalian <a href="Bcl-2%20family">Bcl-2 family</a> of anti-apoptopic genes, the homologs of the "<a href="CED9%20%28gene%29">ced-9</a>" gene found in "<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">C. elegans</a>". "Bcl-2" proteins are able to promote or inhibit apoptosis by direct action on MAC/MOMPP. Bax and/or Bak form the pore, while Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 inhibit its formation.

Two theories of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals have been suggested: the "TNF-induced" (<a href="tumor%20necrosis%20factor">tumor necrosis factor</a>) model and the "Fas-Fas <a href="ligand">ligand</a>-mediated" model, both involving receptors of the "TNF receptor" (TNFR) family coupled to extrinsic signals.

TNF path

<a href="TNF-alpha">TNF-alpha</a> is a <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a> produced mainly by activated <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s, and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis. Most cells in the human body have two receptors for TNF-alpha: <a href="TNFR1">TNFR1</a> and <a href="TNFR2">TNFR2</a>. The binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR1 has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain (<a href="TRADD">TRADD</a>) and Fas-associated death domain protein (<a href="FADD">FADD</a>). <a href="cIAP1">cIAP1</a>/2 can inhibit TNF-α signaling by binding to TRAF2. FLIP inhibits the activation of caspase-8. Binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a>s involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses. However, signalling through TNFR1 might also induce apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner. The link between TNF-alpha and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of TNF-alpha plays a fundamental role in several human diseases, especially in <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>s.

Fas path

The <a href="fas%20receptor">fas receptor</a> (First apoptosis signal) – (also known as "Apo-1" or "CD95") is a <a href="transmembrane%20protein">transmembrane protein</a> of the TNF family which binds the <a href="FAS%20ligand">Fas ligand</a> (FasL). The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the "death-inducing signaling complex" (DISC), which contains the FADD, caspase-8 and caspase-10. In some types of cells (type I), processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis of the cell. In other types of cells (type II), the "Fas"-DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8.

Common components

Following "TNF-R1" and "Fas" activation in mammalian cells a balance between proapoptotic (<a href="Bcl-2-associated%20X%20protein">BAX</a>, <a href="BH3%20interacting%20domain%20death%20agonist">BID</a>, <a href="Bcl-2%20homologous%20antagonist%20killer">BAK</a>, or <a href="Bcl-2-associated%20death%20promoter">BAD</a>) and anti-apoptotic ("<a href="Bcl-Xl">Bcl-Xl</a>" and "<a href="Bcl-2">Bcl-2</a>") members of the "Bcl-2" family is established. This balance is the proportion of proapoptotic <a href="Protein%20dimer">homodimers</a> that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion. The proapoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC. Control of proapoptotic proteins under normal cell conditions of nonapoptotic cells is incompletely understood, but in general, Bax or Bak are activated by the activation of BH3-only proteins, part of the <a href="Bcl-2">Bcl-2</a> family.

Caspases
<a href="Caspase">Caspase</a>s play the central role in the transduction of ER apoptotic signals. Caspases are proteins that are highly conserved, cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases. There are two types of caspases: initiator caspases, caspase 2,8,9,10,11,12, and effector caspases, caspase 3,6,7. The activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific oligomeric <a href="APAF1">activator protein</a>. Effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through <a href="Proteolysis">proteolytic</a> cleavage. The active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program.

Caspase-independent apoptotic pathway
There also exists a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that is mediated by AIF (<a href="apoptosis-inducing%20factor">apoptosis-inducing factor</a>).

Amphibian frog "<a href="Xenopus%20laevis">Xenopus laevis</a>" serves as an ideal model system for the study of the mechanisms of apoptosis. In fact, iodine and thyroxine also stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins in amphibians metamorphosis, and stimulate the evolution of their nervous system transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous <a href="frog">frog</a>.

Many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis, but these converge on a single mechanism that actually causes the death of the cell. After a cell receives stimulus, it undergoes organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated proteolytic <a href="caspase">caspase</a>s. In addition to the destruction of cellular organelles, <a href="mRNA">mRNA</a> is rapidly and globally degraded by a mechanism that is not yet fully characterized. mRNA decay is triggered very early in apoptosis.

A cell undergoing apoptosis shows a series of characteristic morphological changes. Early alterations include:

Apoptosis progresses quickly and its products are quickly removed, making it difficult to detect or visualize on classical histology sections. During karyorrhexis, <a href="endonuclease">endonuclease</a> activation leaves short DNA fragments, regularly spaced in size. These give a characteristic "laddered" appearance on <a href="agar">agar</a> gel after <a href="electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a>. Tests for <a href="DNA%20laddering">DNA laddering</a> differentiate apoptosis from <a href="Ischemia">ischemic</a> or toxic cell death.

Before the apoptotic cell is disposed of, there is a process of disassembly. There are three recognized steps in apoptotic cell disassembly:

The removal of dead cells by neighboring phagocytic cells has been termed <a href="efferocytosis">efferocytosis</a>.
Dying cells that undergo the final stages of apoptosis display phagocytotic molecules, such as <a href="phosphatidylserine">phosphatidylserine</a>, on their cell surface. Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the inner leaflet surface of the plasma membrane, but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a protein known as <a href="phospholipid%20scramblase">scramblase</a>. These molecules mark the cell for <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a> by cells possessing the appropriate receptors, such as macrophages. The removal of dying cells by phagocytes occurs in an orderly manner without eliciting an <a href="inflammatory%20response">inflammatory response</a>. During apoptosis cellular RNA and DNA are separated from each other and sorted to different apoptotic bodies; separation of RNA is initiated as nucleolar segregation.

Many <a href="gene%20knockout">knock-out</a>s have been made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins. Several caspases, in addition to APAF-1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype. In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704–5364 was removed from the gene. This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence, which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing. TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities. However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels. Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse. This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion. When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain. In addition, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes. APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation. A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.

The caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway, so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results. A caspase 9 knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation. A caspase 8 knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality. However, with the use of cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural tube closure. These mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by CD95, TNFR, etc. but not resistant to apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other stimuli. Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation. A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist.

In order to perform analysis of apoptotic versus necrotic (necroptotic) cells, one can do analysis of morphology by <a href="time-lapse%20microscopy">time-lapse microscopy</a>, <a href="flow%20cytometry">flow fluorocytometry</a>, and <a href="transmission%20electron%20microscopy">transmission electron microscopy</a>. There are also various biochemical techniques for analysis of cell surface markers (phosphatidylserine exposure versus cell permeability by <a href="flow%20cytometry">flow cytometry</a>), cellular markers such as <a href="DNA%20fragmentation">DNA fragmentation</a> (flow cytometry), caspase activation, Bid cleavage, and cytochrome c release (<a href="Western%20blot">Western blot</a>ting). It is important to know how primary and secondary necrotic cells can be distinguished by analysis of <a href="supernatant">supernatant</a> for caspases, HMGB1, and release of cytokeratin 18. However, no distinct surface or biochemical markers of necrotic cell death have been identified yet, and only negative markers are available. These include absence of apoptotic markers (caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation) and differential kinetics of cell death markers (phosphatidylserine exposure and cell membrane permeabilization). A selection of techniques that can be used to distinguish apoptosis from necroptotic cells could be found in these references.

The many different types of apoptotic pathways contain a multitude of different biochemical components, many of them not yet understood. As a pathway is more or less sequential in nature, removing or modifying one component leads to an effect in another. In a living organism, this can have disastrous effects, often in the form of disease or disorder. A discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical, but the concept overlying each one is the same: The normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis. This results in a cell that lives past its "use-by-date" and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny, increasing the likelihood of the cell's becoming cancerous or diseased.

A recently described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called NCI-H460. The "X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein" (<a href="XIAP">XIAP</a>) is <a href="Gene%20expression">overexpressed</a> in cells of the H460 <a href="cell%20line">cell line</a>. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator <a href="cytochrome%20c">cytochrome c</a>, therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of proapoptotic agonists. As a consequence, the balance of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die.

The tumor-suppressor protein <a href="p53">p53</a> accumulates when DNA is damaged due to a chain of biochemical factors. Part of this pathway includes alpha-<a href="interferon">interferon</a> and beta-interferon, which induce transcription of the "p53" gene, resulting in the increase of p53 protein level and enhancement of cancer cell-apoptosis. p53 prevents the cell from replicating by stopping the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> at G1, or interphase, to give the cell time to repair, however it will induce apoptosis if damage is extensive and repair efforts fail. Any disruption to the regulation of the "p53" or interferon genes will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumors.

Inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections. It was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in cellular proliferation, but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death. The most common of these diseases is cancer, the disease of excessive cellular proliferation, which is often characterized by an overexpression of <a href="inhibitor%20of%20apoptosis">IAP</a> family members. As a result, the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction: Cycle-regulating genes (such as p53, ras or c-myc) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells, and further genes (such as bcl-2) also modify their expression in tumors. Some apoptotic factors are vital during mitochondrial respiration e.g. cytochrome C. Pathological inactivation of apoptosis in cancer cells is correlated with frequent respiratory metabolic shifts toward glycolysis (an observation known as the “Warburg hypothesis” ).

Apoptosis in <a href="HeLa">HeLa</a> cells is inhibited by proteins produced by the cell; these inhibitory proteins target retinoblastoma tumor-suppressing proteins. These tumor-suppressing proteins regulate the cell cycle, but are rendered inactive when bound to an inhibitory protein. HPV E6 and E7 are inhibitory proteins expressed by the human papillomavirus, HPV being responsible for the formation of the cervical tumor from which HeLa cells are derived. HPV E6 causes p53, which regulates the cell cycle, to become inactive. HPV E7 binds to retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins and limits its ability to control cell division. These two inhibitory proteins are partially responsible for HeLa cells' immortality by inhibiting apoptosis to occur. CDV (Canine Distemper Virus) is able to induce apoptosis despite the presence of these inhibitory proteins. This is an important <a href="Oncolytic%20virus">oncolytic</a> property of CDV: this virus is capable of killing canine lymphoma cells. Oncoproteins E6 and E7 still leave p53 inactive, but they are not able to avoid the activation of caspases induced from the stress of viral infection. These oncolytic properties provided a promising link between CDV and lymphoma apoptosis, which can lead to development of alternative treatment methods for both canine <a href="lymphoma">lymphoma</a> and human non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Defects in the cell cycle are thought to be responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy or radiation by certain tumor cells, so a virus that can induce apoptosis despite defects in the cell cycle is useful for cancer treatment.

The main method of treatment for death from signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells, depending on whether the disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis. For instance, treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death, and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate apoptosis, one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa, or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-MDM2 complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Many different methods can be used either to stimulate or to inhibit apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway.

Apoptosis is a multi-step, multi-pathway cell-death programme that is inherent in every cell of the body. In cancer, the apoptosis cell-division ratio is altered. Cancer treatment by chemotherapy and irradiation kills target cells primarily by inducing apoptosis.

On the other hand, loss of control of cell death (resulting in excess apoptosis) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic diseases, and tissue damage. It is to note that neurons that rely on mitochondrial respiration undergo apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s (an observation known as the “Inverse Warburg hypothesis” ).Moreover, there is an inverse epidemiological comorbidity between neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The progression of HIV is directly linked to excess, unregulated apoptosis. In a healthy individual, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes is in balance with the cells generated by the bone marrow; however, in HIV-positive patients, this balance is lost due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate CD4+ cells. In the case of HIV, CD4+ lymphocytes die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis, when stimulated.

Treatments aiming to inhibit works to block specific caspases. Finally, the Akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits Bas (a Bcl-2 family member), causing Bas to interact with the 14-3-3 scaffold, resulting in Bcl dissociation and thus cell survival. Akt also activates IKKα, which leads to NF-κB activation and cell survival. Active NF-κB induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. NF-κB has been found to play both an antiapoptotic role and a proapoptotic role depending on the stimuli utilized and the cell type.

The progression of the <a href="human%20immunodeficiency%20virus">human immunodeficiency virus</a> infection into <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> is due primarily to the depletion of <a href="T%20helper%20cell">CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes</a> in a manner that is too rapid for the body's bone marrow to replenish the cells, leading to a compromised immune system. One of the mechanisms by which T-helper cells are depleted is apoptosis, which results from a series of biochemical pathways:

Cells may also die as direct consequences of viral infections. HIV-1 expression induces tubular cell G2/M arrest and apoptosis. The progression from HIV to AIDS is not immediate or even necessarily rapid; HIV's cytotoxic activity toward CD4+ lymphocytes is classified as AIDS once a given patient's CD4+ cell count falls below 200.

Viral induction of apoptosis occurs when one or several cells of a living organism are infected with a <a href="virus">virus</a>, leading to cell death. Cell death in organisms is necessary for the normal development of cells and the cell cycle maturation. It is also important in maintaining the regular functions and activities of cells.

Viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected cells via a range of mechanisms including:
<a href="Canine%20distemper%20virus">Canine distemper virus</a> (CDV) is known to cause apoptosis in central nervous system and lymphoid tissue of infected dogs in vivo and in vitro.
Apoptosis caused by CDV is typically induced via the <a href="death-inducing%20signaling%20complex">extrinsic pathway</a>, which activates <a href="caspases">caspases</a> that disrupt cellular function and eventually leads to the cells death. In normal cells, CDV activates caspase-8 first, which works as the initiator protein followed by the executioner protein caspase-3. However, apoptosis induced by CDV in HeLa cells does not involve the initiator protein caspase-8. HeLa cell apoptosis caused by CDV follows a different mechanism than that in vero cell lines. This change in the caspase cascade suggests CDV induces apoptosis via the <a href="intrinsic%20apoptosis">intrinsic pathway</a>, excluding the need for the initiator caspase-8. The executioner protein is instead activated by the internal stimuli caused by viral infection not a caspase cascade.

The <a href="Oropouche%20virus">Oropouche virus</a> (OROV) is found in the family "<a href="Bunyaviridae">Bunyaviridae</a>". The study of apoptosis brought on by "Bunyaviridae" was initiated in 1996, when it was observed that apoptosis was induced by the La Crosse virus into the kidney cells of baby hamsters and into the brains of baby mice.

OROV is a disease that is transmitted between humans by the biting midge ("<a href="Culicoides%20paraensis">Culicoides paraensis</a>"). It is referred to as a <a href="zoonotic">zoonotic</a> <a href="arbovirus">arbovirus</a> and causes febrile illness, characterized by the onset of a sudden fever known as Oropouche fever.

The Oropouche virus also causes disruption in cultured cells – cells that are cultivated in distinct and specific conditions. An example of this can be seen in <a href="HeLa%20cells">HeLa cells</a>, whereby the cells begin to degenerate shortly after they are infected.

With the use of <a href="gel%20electrophoresis">gel electrophoresis</a>, it can be observed that OROV causes <a href="DNA">DNA</a> fragmentation in HeLa cells. It can be interpreted by counting, measuring, and analyzing the cells of the Sub/G1 cell population. When HeLA cells are infected with OROV, the <a href="cytochrome%20C">cytochrome C</a> is released from the membrane of the mitochondria, into the cytosol of the cells. This type of interaction shows that apoptosis is activated via an intrinsic pathway.

In order for apoptosis to occur within OROV, viral uncoating, viral internalization, along with the replication of cells is necessary. Apoptosis in some viruses is activated by extracellular stimuli. However, studies have demonstrated that the OROV infection causes apoptosis to be activated through intracellular stimuli and involves the mitochondria.

Many viruses encode proteins that can inhibit apoptosis. Several viruses encode viral homologs of Bcl-2. These homologs can inhibit proapoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, which are essential for the activation of apoptosis. Examples of viral Bcl-2 proteins include the <a href="Epstein-Barr%20virus">Epstein-Barr virus</a> BHRF1 protein and the <a href="adenovirus">adenovirus</a> E1B 19K protein. Some viruses express caspase inhibitors that inhibit caspase activity and an example is the CrmA protein of cowpox viruses. Whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of TNF and Fas. For example, the M-T2 protein of myxoma viruses can bind TNF preventing it from binding the TNF receptor and inducing a response. Furthermore, many viruses express p53 inhibitors that can bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional transactivation activity. As a consequence, p53 cannot induce apoptosis, since it cannot induce the expression of proapoptotic proteins. The adenovirus E1B-55K protein and the <a href="hepatitis%20B%20virus">hepatitis B virus</a> HBx protein are examples of viral proteins that can perform such a function.

Viruses can remain intact from apoptosis in particular in the latter stages of infection. They can be exported in the "apoptotic bodies" that pinch off from the surface of the dying cell, and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response. This favours the spread of the virus.

<a href="Programmed%20cell%20death">Programmed cell death</a> in plants has a number of molecular similarities to that of animal apoptosis, but it also has differences, notable ones being the presence of a <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> and the lack of an <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> that removes the pieces of the dead cell. Instead of an immune response, the dying cell synthesizes substances to break itself down and places them in a <a href="vacuole">vacuole</a> that ruptures as the cell dies. Whether this whole process resembles animal apoptosis closely enough to warrant using the name "apoptosis" (as opposed to the more general "programmed cell death") is unclear.

The characterization of the caspases allowed the development of caspase inhibitors, which can be used to determine whether a cellular process involves active caspases. Using these inhibitors it was discovered that cells can die while displaying a morphology similar to apoptosis without caspase activation. Later studies linked this phenomenon to the release of AIF (<a href="apoptosis-inducing%20factor">apoptosis-inducing factor</a>) from the mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus mediated by its NLS (nuclear localization signal). Inside the mitochondria, AIF is anchored to the inner membrane. In order to be released, the protein is cleaved by a calcium-dependent <a href="Calpain">calpain protease</a>.

In 2003, a method was developed for predicting subcellular location of apoptosis proteins.
Subsequent to this, various modes of Chou's <a href="pseudo%20amino%20acid%20composition">pseudo amino acid composition</a> were developed for improving the quality of predicting subcellular localization of apoptosis proteins based on their sequence information alone.

Anal sex

Anal sex or anal intercourse is generally the insertion and <a href="pelvic%20thrusting">thrusting</a> of the <a href="Erection">erect</a> <a href="human%20penis">penis</a> into a person's <a href="Human%20anus">anus</a>, or anus and <a href="rectum">rectum</a>, for sexual pleasure. Other forms of anal sex include <a href="Fingering%20%28sexual%20act%29">fingering</a>, the use of <a href="sex%20toy">sex toy</a>s for anal penetration, <a href="oral%20sex">oral sex</a> performed on the anus (<a href="anilingus">anilingus</a>), and <a href="Pegging%20%28sexual%20practice%29">pegging</a>. Although the term "anal sex" most commonly means penile-anal penetration, sources sometimes use the term "anal intercourse" to refer exclusively to penile-anal penetration, and "anal sex" to refer to any form of anal <a href="Human%20sexual%20activity">sexual activity</a>, especially between pairings as opposed to <a href="anal%20masturbation">anal masturbation</a>.

While anal sex is commonly associated with male <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, research shows that not all <a href="gay">gay</a> males engage in anal sex and that it is not uncommon in <a href="Heterosexuality">heterosexual</a> relationships. Types of anal sex can also be a part of <a href="lesbian%20sexual%20practices">lesbian sexual practices</a>. People may experience pleasure from anal sex by stimulation of the anal <a href="nerve">nerve</a> endings, and <a href="orgasm">orgasm</a> may be achieved through anal penetration – by indirect stimulation of the <a href="prostate">prostate</a> in men, indirect stimulation of the <a href="clitoris">clitoris</a> or an area of the vagina (sometimes termed "the <a href="G-spot">G-spot</a>") in women, and other <a href="sensory%20nerve">sensory nerve</a>s (especially the <a href="pudendal%20nerve">pudendal nerve</a>). However, people may also find anal sex painful, sometimes extremely so, which may be primarily due to psychological factors in some cases.

As with most forms of sexual activity, anal sex participants risk contracting <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20infections">sexually transmitted infections</a> (STIs/STDs). Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum. The anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide lubrication like <a href="Vaginal%20lubrication">the vagina does</a>, so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if a <a href="personal%20lubricant">personal lubricant</a> is not used. Anal sex without protection of a <a href="condom">condom</a> is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity, and therefore health authorities such as the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) recommend <a href="safe%20sex">safe sex</a> practices for anal sex.

Strong views are often expressed about anal sex. It is controversial in various cultures, especially with regard to <a href="religion%20and%20homosexuality">religious prohibitions</a>. This is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among males or teachings about the <a href="Reproduction">procreative</a> purpose of sexual activity. It may be regarded as <a href="taboo">taboo</a> or unnatural, and is a <a href="Crime">criminal offense</a> in some countries, punishable by <a href="Corporal%20punishment">corporal</a> or <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a>; by contrast, people also regard anal sex as a natural and valid form of sexual activity that may be as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions. They may regard it as an enhancing element of their <a href="Sex%20life">sex lives</a> or as their primary form of sexual activity.

The abundance of <a href="Nerve">nerve endings</a> in the anal region and <a href="rectum">rectum</a> can make anal sex pleasurable for men or women. The <a href="Sphincter%20ani%20internus%20muscle">internal</a> and <a href="Sphincter%20ani%20externus%20muscle">external</a> <a href="sphincter">sphincter</a> muscles control the opening and closing of the anus; these muscles, which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings, facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex. The "Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia" states that "the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two-thirds, but is more sensitive to pressure" and that "the rectum is a curved tube about eight or nine inches long and has the capacity, like the anus, to expand".

Research indicates that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other sexual behaviors, but its association with <a href="dominance%20and%20submission">dominance and submission</a>, as well as <a href="taboo">taboo</a>, makes it an appealing <a href="Stimulus%20%28psychology%29">stimulus</a> to people of all <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a>s. In addition to <a href="sexual%20penetration">sexual penetration</a> by the penis, people may use <a href="sex%20toys">sex toys</a> such as <a href="butt%20plug">butt plug</a>s or <a href="anal%20beads">anal beads</a>, engage in <a href="Fingering%20%28sexual%20act%29">fingering</a>, <a href="anilingus">anilingus</a>, <a href="Pegging%20%28sexual%20practice%29">pegging</a>, <a href="anal%20masturbation">anal masturbation</a> or <a href="fisting">fisting</a> for anal sexual activity, and different <a href="sex%20position">sex position</a>s may also be included. Fisting is the least practiced of the activities, partly because it is uncommon that people can relax enough to accommodate an object as big as a fist being inserted into the anus.

In a male <a href="Top%2C%20bottom%20and%20versatile%23Bottom">receptive partner</a>, being anally penetrated can produce a pleasurable sensation due to the inserted penis rubbing or brushing against the <a href="prostate">prostate</a> (also known as the "male G-spot") through the anal wall. This can result in pleasurable sensations and can lead to an <a href="orgasm">orgasm</a> in some cases. Prostate stimulation can produce a "deeper" orgasm, sometimes described by men as more widespread and intense, longer-lasting, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only. The prostate is located next to the rectum and is the larger, more developed male <a href="homology%20%28biology%29">homologue</a> (variation) to the female <a href="Skene%27s%20glands">Skene's glands</a>. However, though the experiences are different, male orgasms by penile stimulation are also centered in the prostate gland. It is also typical for a man to not reach orgasm as a receptive partner solely from anal sex.

General statistics indicate that 70–80% of women require direct <a href="Clitoris">clitoral</a> stimulation to achieve orgasm. The vaginal walls contain significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris and anus, and therefore intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, from vaginal sexual stimulation is less likely to occur than from direct clitoral stimulation in the majority of women. The clitoris is composed of more than the externally visible <a href="Clitoral%20glans">glans</a> (head). With its glans or body as a whole estimated to have around 8,000 <a href="sensory%20nerve">sensory nerve</a> endings, the clitoris surrounds the <a href="vagina">vagina</a> and <a href="urethra">urethra</a>, and may have a similar connection with the anus. The vagina is flanked on each side by the <a href="Crus%20of%20clitoris">clitoral crura</a>, the internal "legs" of the clitoris, which are highly sensitive and become engorged with blood when sexually aroused. In addition to nerve endings present within the anus and rectum, women may find anal stimulation pleasurable due to indirect stimulation of these "legs". Indirect stimulation of the clitoris through anal penetration may also be caused by the shared sensory nerves, especially the <a href="pudendal%20nerve">pudendal nerve</a>, which gives off the <a href="inferior%20anal%20nerves">inferior anal nerves</a> and divides into two terminal branches: the <a href="perineal%20nerve">perineal nerve</a> and the <a href="dorsal%20nerve%20of%20clitoris">dorsal nerve of the clitoris</a>.

The <a href="Ernst%20Gr%C3%A4fenberg">Gräfenberg</a> spot, or <a href="G-spot">G-spot</a>, is a debated area of female anatomy, particularly among doctors and researchers, but it is typically described as being located behind the female pubic bone surrounding the urethra and accessible through the anterior wall of the vagina; it and other areas of the vagina are considered to have tissue and nerves that are related to the clitoris. Besides the shared anatomy of the aforementioned sensory nerves, orgasm by indirect stimulation of the clitoris or G-spot area through anal penetration may be possible because of the close proximity between the vaginal cavity and the rectal cavity. Achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation is rare among women. Direct stimulation of the clitoris, a G-spot area, or both, during anal sex can help some women enjoy the activity and reach orgasm from it.

Stimulation from anal sex can additionally be affected by popular perception or portrayals of the activity, such as <a href="erotica">erotica</a> or <a href="pornography">pornography</a>. In pornography, anal sex is commonly portrayed as a desirable, painless routine that does not require <a href="personal%20lubricant">personal lubricant</a>; this can result in couples performing anal sex without care, and men and women believing that it is unusual for women, as receptive partners, to find discomfort or pain instead of pleasure from the activity. By contrast, each person's sphincter muscles react to penetration differently, the anal sphincters have tissues that are more prone to tearing, and the anus and rectum do not provide lubrication for sexual penetration like <a href="Vaginal%20lubrication">the vagina does</a>. Researchers say adequate application of a personal lubricant, relaxation, and communication between sexual partners are crucial to avoid pain or damage to the anus or rectum. Additionally, ensuring that the anal area is clean and the <a href="Intestine">bowel</a> is empty, for both aesthetics and practicality, may be desired by participants.

The anal sphincters are usually tighter than the <a href="pelvic%20floor">pelvic muscles</a> of the vagina, which can enhance the sexual pleasure for the inserting male during male-to-female anal intercourse because of the pressure applied to the penis. Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more alluring by a female partner or society in general insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.

While some women find being a receptive partner during anal intercourse painful or uncomfortable, or only engage in the act to please a male sexual partner, other women find the activity pleasurable or prefer it to <a href="Sexual%20intercourse">vaginal intercourse</a>.

In a 2010 clinical review article of heterosexual anal sex, the term "anal intercourse" is used to refer specifically to penile-anal penetration, and "anal sex" is used to refer to any form of anal sexual activity. The review suggests that anal sex is exotic among the sexual practices of some heterosexuals and that "for a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex".

Anal intercourse is sometimes used as a substitute for vaginal intercourse during <a href="menstruation">menstruation</a>. The likelihood of <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> occurring during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice anal intercourse as a form of <a href="Birth%20control">contraception</a>, often in the absence of a condom.

Male-to-female anal sex is commonly viewed as a way of preserving female <a href="virginity">virginity</a> because it is non-procreative and does not tear the <a href="hymen">hymen</a>; a person, especially a teenage girl or woman, who engages in anal sex or other sexual activity with no history of having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as not having yet experienced virginity loss. This is sometimes termed "<a href="technical%20virginity">technical virginity</a>." Heterosexuals may view anal sex as "fooling around" or as <a href="foreplay">foreplay</a>; scholar Laura M. Carpenter stated that this view "dates to the late 1600s, with explicit 'rules' appearing around the turn of the twentieth century, as in marriage manuals defining petting as 'literally every caress known to married couples but does not include complete sexual intercourse.'"

Because most research on anal intercourse addresses <a href="men%20who%20have%20sex%20with%20men">men who have sex with men</a>, little data exists on the prevalence of anal intercourse among heterosexual couples. In Kimberly R. McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing <a href="Norm%20%28social%29">norms</a> may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use. The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively. The review added that because "relatively little attention [is] given to anal intercourse and other anal sexual behaviors between heterosexual partners", this means that it is "quite rare" to have research "that specifically differentiates the anus as a sexual organ or addresses anal sexual function or dysfunction as legitimate topics. As a result, we do not know the extent to which anal intercourse differs qualitatively from coitus."

According to a 2010 study from the <a href="National%20Survey%20of%20Sexual%20Health%20and%20Behavior">National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior</a> (NSSHB) that was authored by <a href="Debby%20Herbenick">Debby Herbenick</a> et al., although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days. Women engaged in anal intercourse less commonly than men. Vaginal intercourse was practiced more than insertive anal intercourse among men, but 13% to 15% of men aged 25 to 49 practiced insertive anal intercourse.

With regard to adolescents, limited data also exists. This may be because of the taboo nature of anal sex and that teenagers and caregivers subsequently avoid talking to one another about the topic. It is also common for subject review panels and schools to avoid the subject. A 2000 study found that 22.9% of college students who self-identified as virgins had anal sex. They used condoms during anal sex 20.9% of the time as compared with 42.9% of the time with vaginal intercourse.

Anal sex being more common among heterosexuals today than it was previously has been linked to the increase in consumption of anal pornography among men, especially among those who view it on a regular basis. Seidman et al. argued that "cheap, accessible and, especially, interactive media have enabled many more people to produce as well as consume pornography", and that this modern way of producing pornography, in addition to the buttocks and anus having become more eroticized, has led to a significant interest in or obsession with anal sex among men.

Historically, anal sex has been commonly associated with male homosexuality. However, many gay men and men who have sex with men in general (those who identify as gay, <a href="Bisexuality">bisexual</a>, heterosexual or have not identified their <a href="sexual%20identity">sexual identity</a>) do not engage in anal sex. Among men who have anal sex with other men, the insertive partner may be referred to as the "<a href="Top%2C%20bottom%20and%20versatile%23Top">top</a>" and the one being penetrated may be referred to as the "<a href="Top%2C%20bottom%20and%20versatile%23Bottom">bottom</a>". Those who enjoy either role may be referred to as "<a href="versatile%20%28sex%29">versatile</a>".

Gay men who prefer anal sex may view it as their version of intercourse and a natural expression of intimacy that is capable of providing pleasure. The notion that it might resonate with gay men with the same emotional significance that vaginal sex resonates with heterosexuals has also been considered. Some men who have sex with men, however, believe that being a receptive partner during anal sex questions their <a href="masculinity">masculinity</a>.

Men who have sex with men may also prefer to engage in <a href="frot">frot</a> or other forms of <a href="mutual%20masturbation">mutual masturbation</a> because they find it more pleasurable or more affectionate, to preserve <a href="technical%20virginity">technical virginity</a>, or as <a href="safe%20sex">safe sex</a> alternatives to anal sex, while other frot advocates <a href="Frot%23Comparison%20with%20anal%20sex%20and%20debates">denounce anal sex</a> as degrading to the receptive partner and unnecessarily risky.

Reports regarding the prevalence of anal sex among gay men and other men who have sex with men vary. A survey in "<a href="The%20Advocate">The Advocate</a>" in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner. Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths of gay men have had anal sex at one time or another, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms. A 2012 NSSHB sex survey in the U.S. suggests high lifetime participation in anal sex among gay men: 83.3% report ever taking part in anal sex in the insertive position and 90% in the receptive position, even if only between a third and a quarter self-report very recent engagement in the practice, defined as 30 days or less.

Oral sex and mutual masturbation are more common than anal stimulation among men in sexual relationships with other men. According to Weiten et al., anal intercourse is generally more popular among gay male couples than among heterosexual couples, but "it ranks behind oral sex and mutual masturbation" among both sexual orientations in prevalence. Wellings et al. reported that "the equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike" and that "yet an Internet survey of 180,000 MSM across Europe (EMIS, 2011) showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place".

Women may sexually stimulate a man's anus by fingering the exterior or interior areas of the anus; they may also stimulate the <a href="perineum">perineum</a> (which, for males, is between the base of the <a href="scrotum">scrotum</a> and the anus), <a href="prostate%20massage">massage the prostate</a> or engage in anilingus. Sex toys, such as a <a href="dildo">dildo</a>, may also be used. The practice of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a <a href="strap-on%20dildo">strap-on dildo</a> for sexual activity is called <a href="Pegging%20%28sexual%20practice%29">pegging</a>.

Commonly, heterosexual men reject the idea of being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a <a href="Femininity">feminine</a> act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The "<a href="BMJ">BMJ</a>" stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many heterosexual men would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.

Reece et al. reported in 2010 that receptive anal intercourse is infrequent among men overall, stating that "an estimated 7% of men 14 to 94 years old reported being a receptive partner during anal intercourse".

With regard to <a href="Lesbian%20sexual%20practices">lesbian sexual practice</a>s, anal sex includes fingering, use of a dildo or other sex toys, or anilingus. Some lesbians do not like anal sex, and anilingus is less often practiced among female same-sex couples.

There is less research on anal sexual activity among <a href="women%20who%20have%20sex%20with%20women">women who have sex with women</a> compared to couples of other sexual orientations. In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques they used in their last ten sexual encounters, lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo). While author Tom Boellstorff, when particularly examining anal sex among gay and lesbian individuals in Indonesia, stated that he had not heard of oral-anal contact or anal penetration as recognized forms of lesbian sexuality but assume they take place, author <a href="Felice%20Newman">Felice Newman</a> cites anal sex as a part of lesbian sexual practices. A 2014 study of partnered lesbian women in Canada and the U.S. found that 7% engaged in anal stimulation or penetration at least once a week; about 10% did so monthly and 70% did not at all.

Anal sex can expose its participants to two principal dangers: infections due to the high number of infectious <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and rectum due to their fragility. Unprotected penile-anal penetration, colloquially known as "<a href="Bareback%20%28sex%29">barebacking</a>", carries a higher risk of passing on <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20infections">sexually transmitted infections</a> (STIs/STDs) because the anal sphincter is a delicate, easily torn tissue that can provide an entry for pathogens. The high concentration of <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s around the rectum, together with the risk of tearing and the colon's function to absorb fluid, are what place those who engage in anal sex at high risk of STIs. Use of <a href="condom">condom</a>s, ample lubrication to reduce the risk of tearing, and <a href="safer%20sex">safer sex</a> practices in general, reduce the risk of STI transmission. However, a condom can break or otherwise come off during anal sex, and this is more likely to happen with anal sex than with other sex acts because of the tightness of the anal sphincters during friction.

Unprotected receptive anal sex (with an HIV positive partner) is the sex act most likely to result in <a href="HIV">HIV</a> transmission. Other infections that can be transmitted by unprotected anal sex are <a href="human%20papillomavirus">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a> (which can increase risk of <a href="anal%20cancer">anal cancer</a>); <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>; <a href="amoebiasis">amoebiasis</a>; <a href="Chlamydia%20infection">chlamydia</a>; <a href="cryptosporidiosis">cryptosporidiosis</a>; <a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli infections</a>; <a href="giardiasis">giardiasis</a>; <a href="gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a>; <a href="hepatitis%20A">hepatitis A</a>; <a href="hepatitis%20B">hepatitis B</a>; <a href="hepatitis%20C">hepatitis C</a>; <a href="herpes%20simplex">herpes simplex</a>; <a href="Kaposi%27s%20sarcoma-associated%20herpesvirus">Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus</a> (HHV-8); <a href="lymphogranuloma%20venereum">lymphogranuloma venereum</a>; <a href="Mycoplasma%20hominis">Mycoplasma hominis</a>; <a href="Mycoplasma%20genitalium">Mycoplasma genitalium</a>; <a href="pubic%20lice">pubic lice</a>; <a href="salmonellosis">salmonellosis</a>; <a href="shigella">shigella</a>; <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>; <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>; and <a href="Ureaplasma%20urealyticum">Ureaplasma urealyticum</a>.

As with other sexual practices, people without sound knowledge about the sexual risks involved are susceptible to STIs. Because of <a href="%23Behaviors%20and%20views">the view</a> that anal sex is not "real sex" and therefore does not result in virginity loss, or pregnancy, teenagers and other young people may consider vaginal intercourse riskier than anal intercourse and believe that a STI can only result from vaginal intercourse. It may be because of these views that condom use with anal sex is often reported to be low and inconsistent across all groups in various countries.

Although anal sex alone does not lead to pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity if the penis is near the vagina (such as during <a href="intercrural%20sex">intercrural sex</a> or other <a href="Sex%20position%23Genital-genital%20rubbing">genital-genital rubbing</a>) and its sperm is deposited near the vagina's entrance and travels along the vagina's lubricating fluids; the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.

There are a variety of factors that make male-to-female anal intercourse riskier for a female than for a male. For example, besides the risk of HIV transmission being higher for anal intercourse than for vaginal intercourse, the risk of injury to the woman during anal intercourse is significantly higher than the risk of injury to her during vaginal intercourse because of the durability of the vaginal tissues compared to the anal tissues. Additionally, if a man moves from anal intercourse immediately to vaginal intercourse without a condom or without changing it, infections can arise in the vagina (or <a href="urinary%20tract">urinary tract</a>) due to bacteria present within the anus; these infections can also result from switching between vaginal sex and anal sex by the use of fingers or sex toys.

Pain during receptive anal sex among gay men (or men who have sex with men) is formally known as "anodyspareunia." In one study, 61% of gay or bisexual men said they experienced painful receptive anal sex and that it was the most frequent sexual difficulty they had experienced. By contrast, 24% of gay or bisexual men stated that they always experienced some degree of pain during anal sex, and about 12% of gay men find it too painful to pursue receptive anal sex; it was concluded that the perception of anal sex as painful is as likely to be psychologically or emotionally based as it is to be physically based. Factors predictive of pain during anal sex include inadequate lubrication, feeling tense or anxious, lack of stimulation, as well as lack of social ease with being gay and being <a href="closeted">closeted</a>. Research has found that psychological factors can in fact be the primary contributors to the experience of pain during anal intercourse and that adequate communication between sexual partners can prevent it, countering the notion that pain is always inevitable during anal sex.

Anal sex can exacerbate <a href="hemorrhoid">hemorrhoid</a>s and therefore result in bleeding; in other cases, the formation of a hemorrhoid is attributed to anal sex. If bleeding occurs as a result of anal sex, it may also be because of a tear in the anal or rectal tissues (an <a href="anal%20fissure">anal fissure</a>) or <a href="perforation">perforation</a> (a hole) in the <a href="Large%20intestine">colon</a>, the latter of which being a serious medical issue that should be remedied by immediate medical attention. Because of the rectum's lack of elasticity, the anal <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous membrane</a> being thin, and small <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s being present directly beneath the mucous membrane, tiny tears and bleeding in the rectum usually result from penetrative anal sex, though the bleeding is usually minor and therefore usually not visible. By contrast to other anal sexual behaviors, anal fisting poses a more serious danger of damage due to the deliberate stretching of the anal and rectal tissues; anal fisting injuries include anal sphincter lacerations and rectal and <a href="sigmoid%20colon">sigmoid colon</a> (rectosigmoid) perforation, which might result in death.

Repetitive penetrative anal sex may result in the anal sphincters becoming weakened, which may cause <a href="rectal%20prolapse">rectal prolapse</a> or affect the ability to hold in feces (a condition known as <a href="fecal%20incontinence">fecal incontinence</a>). Rectal prolapse is relatively uncommon, however, especially in men, and its causes are not well understood. <a href="Kegel%20exercise">Kegel exercise</a>s have been used to strengthen the anal sphincters and overall <a href="pelvic%20floor">pelvic floor</a>, and may help prevent or remedy fecal incontinence.

Most cases of anal cancer are related to infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Anal sex alone does not cause anal cancer; the risk of anal cancer through anal sex is attributed to HPV infection, which is often contracted through unprotected anal sex. Anal cancer is relatively rare, and significantly less common than cancer of the colon or rectum (<a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a>); the <a href="American%20Cancer%20Society">American Cancer Society</a> states that it affects approximately 7,060 people (4,430 in women and 2,630 in men) and results in approximately 880 deaths (550 in women and 330 in men) in the United States, and that, though anal cancer has been on the rise for many years, it is mainly diagnosed in adults, "with an average age being in the early 60s" and it "affects women somewhat more often than men." Though anal cancer is serious, treatment for it is "often very effective" and most anal cancer patients can be cured of the disease; the American Cancer Society adds that "receptive anal intercourse also increases the risk of anal cancer in both men and women, particularly in those younger than the age of 30. Because of this, men who have sex with men have a high risk of this cancer."

Different cultures have had different views on anal sex throughout human history, with some cultures more positive about the activity than others. Historically, anal sex has been restricted or condemned, especially with regard to religious beliefs; it has also commonly been used as a form of domination, usually with the active partner (the one who is penetrating) representing masculinity and the passive partner (the one who is being penetrated) representing femininity. A number of cultures have especially recorded the practice of anal sex between males, and anal sex between males has been especially <a href="Social%20stigma">stigmatized</a> or punished. In some societies, if discovered to have engaged in the practice, the individuals involved were put to death, such as by <a href="decapitation">decapitation</a>, burning, or even <a href="mutilation">mutilation</a>.

Anal sex has been more accepted in modern times; it is often considered a natural, pleasurable form of sexual expression. Some people, men in particular, are only interested in anal sex for sexual satisfaction, which has been partly attributed to the buttocks and anus being more eroticized in modern culture, including via pornography. Engaging in anal sex is still, however, punished in some societies. For example, regarding <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Iran">LGBT rights in Iran</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>'s Penal Code states in Article 109 that "both men involved in same-sex penetrative (anal) or non-penetrative sex will be punished" and "Article 110 states that those convicted of engaging in anal sex will be executed and that the manner of execution is at the discretion of the judge".

The term "<a href="Greek%20love">Greek love</a>" has long been used to refer to anal intercourse, and in modern times, "doing it the Greek way" is sometimes used as slang for anal sex. <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greeks</a> accepted romantic or sexual relationships between males as a balanced sex life (having males and women as lovers), and they considered this "normal (as long as one partner was an adult and the other was aged between twelve and fifteen)".

Male-male anal sex was not a universally accepted practice in Ancient Greece; it was the target of jokes in some Athenian comedies. <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>, for instance, mockingly alludes to the practice, claiming, "Most citizens are "europroktoi" (wide-arsed) now." The terms "kinaidos", "europroktoi", and "katapygon" were used by Greek residents to categorize men who chronically practiced passive anal intercourse. While <a href="Pederasty%20in%20ancient%20Greece">pedagogic pederasty</a> was an essential element in the education of male youths, these relationships, at least in <a href="Athens">Athens</a> and <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, were expected to steer clear of penetrative sex of any kind. Greek artwork of sexual interaction between men and boys usually depicted <a href="Groping">fondling</a> or <a href="intercrural%20sex">intercrural sex</a>, which was not condemned for violating or <a href="Feminization%20%28sociology%29">feminizing</a> boys, while male-male anal intercourse was usually depicted between males of the same age-group. Intercrural sex was not considered penetrative and two males engaging in it was considered a "clean" act. Some sources explicitly state that anal sex between men and boys was criticized as shameful and seen as a form of <a href="hubris">hubris</a>. Evidence suggests, however, that the younger partner in pederastic relationships (i.e., the "eromenos") did engage in receptive anal intercourse so long as no one accused him of being 'feminine'.

In later <a href="Greek%20literature%23Roman%20Age">Roman-era Greek poetry</a>, anal sex became a common literary convention, represented as taking place with "eligible" youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults. Seducing those not of proper age (for example, non-adolescent children) into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him; Greek courtesans, or <a href="hetaera">hetaera</a>e, are said to have frequently practiced male-female anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.

A male citizen taking the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse ("paedicatio" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>) was condemned in Rome as an act of "impudicitia" (immodesty or un<a href="chastity">chastity</a>); free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young male slave, known as a "<a href="catamite">catamite</a>" or "puer delicatus". The latter was allowed because anal intercourse was considered equivalent to vaginal intercourse in this way; men were said to "take it like a woman" (muliebria pati, "to undergo womanly things") when they were anally penetrated, but when a man performed anal sex on a woman, she was thought of as playing the boy's role. Likewise, women were believed to only be capable of anal sex or other sex acts with women if they possessed an exceptionally large clitoris or a dildo. The passive partner in any of these cases was always considered a woman or a boy because being the one who penetrates was characterized as the only appropriate way for an adult male citizen to engage in sexual activity, and he was therefore considered unmanly if he was the one who was penetrated; slaves could be considered "non-citizen". Although Roman men often availed themselves of their own slaves or others for anal intercourse, Roman comedies and plays presented Greek settings and characters for explicit acts of anal intercourse, and this may be indicative that the Romans thought of anal sex as something specifically "Greek".

In Japan, records (including detailed <a href="Shunga%20%28art%29">shunga</a>) show that some males engaged in penetrative anal intercourse with males, and evidence suggestive of widespread male-female anal intercourse in a pre-modern culture can be found in the erotic vases, or stirrup-spout pots, made by the <a href="Moche%20%28culture%29">Moche</a> people of Peru; in a survey, of a collection of these pots, it was found that 31 percent of them depicted male-female anal intercourse significantly more than any other sex act. Moche pottery of this type belonged to the world of the dead, which was believed to be a reversal of life. Therefore, the reverse of common practices was often portrayed. The <a href="Larco%20Museum">Larco Museum</a> houses an erotic gallery in which this pottery is showcased.

19th century anthropologist <a href="Richard%20Francis%20Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a> theorized that there is a geographical <a href="Sotadic%20zone">Sotadic zone</a> wherein penetrative intercourse between males is particularly prevalent and accepted; moreover he was one of the first writers to advance the premise that such an orientation is biologically determined.

In many western countries, anal sex has generally been taboo since the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, when <a href="heresy%20in%20Christianity">heretical</a> movements were sometimes attacked by accusations that their members practiced anal sex among themselves. At that time, <a href="Celibacy">celibate</a> members of the Christian clergy were accused of engaging in "<a href="Crime%20against%20nature">sins against nature</a>", including anal sex.

The term "<a href="buggery">buggery</a>" originated in <a href="medieval">medieval</a> Europe as an insult used to describe the rumored same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from a sect originating in <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, where its followers were called "<a href="bogomilism">bogomils</a>"; when they spread out of the country, they were called "buggres" (from the <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> "Bulgars"). Another term for the practice, more archaic, is "pedicate" from the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> "pedicare", with the same meaning.

The Renaissance poet <a href="Pietro%20Aretino">Pietro Aretino</a> advocated anal sex in his "Sonetti Lussuriosi" (Lust Sonnets). While men who engaged in homosexual relationships were generally suspected of engaging in anal sex, many such individuals did not. Among these, in recent times, have been <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gide">André Gide</a>, who found it repulsive; and <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>, who had a horror of disease, and asserted when young that "I'd never do anything – well the disgusting thing they do – because I know I could get something wrong with me".

The <a href="Mishneh%20Torah">Mishneh Torah</a>, a text considered authoritative by <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox Jewish</a> sects, states "since a man’s wife is permitted to him, he may act with her in any manner whatsoever. He may have intercourse with her whenever he so desires and kiss any organ of her body he wishes, and he may have intercourse with her naturally or unnaturally [traditionally, "unnaturally" refers to anal and oral sex], provided that he does not expend semen to no purpose. Nevertheless, it is an attribute of piety that a man should not act in this matter with levity and that he should sanctify himself at the time of intercourse."

Christian texts may sometimes <a href="Euphemism">euphemistically</a> refer to anal sex as the "peccatum contra naturam" (the sin against nature, after <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>) or "Sodomitica luxuria" (sodomitical lusts, in one of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>'s ordinances), or "peccatum illud horribile, inter christianos non nominandum" (that horrible sin that among Christians is not to be named).

"Liwat", or the sin of <a href="Lot%20%28biblical%20person%29">Lot</a>'s people, which has come to be interpreted as referring generally to same-sex sexual activity, is commonly officially prohibited by Islamic sects; there are parts of the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> which talk about smiting on <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>, and this is thought to be a reference to unnatural sex, and so there are <a href="hadith">hadith</a> and Islamic laws which prohibit it. While, concerning Islamic belief, it is objectionable to use the words "al-Liwat" and "luti" to refer to homosexuality because it is <a href="blasphemy">blasphemy</a> toward the prophet of <a href="Allah">Allah</a>, and therefore the terms "sodomy" and "homosexuality" are preferred, same-sex male practitioners of anal sex are called "luti" or "lutiyin" in plural and are seen as criminals in the same way that a thief is a criminal, meaning that they are giving in to a universal temptation.

The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics is <a href="the%20Five%20Precepts">the Five Precepts</a>. These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Precepts is "To refrain from committing <a href="sexual%20misconduct">sexual misconduct</a>". However, "sexual misconduct" (<a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>: "Kāmesu micchācāra", literally "sense gratifications arising from the 5 senses") is subject to interpretation relative to the social norms of the followers. Buddhism, in its fundamental form, does not define what is right and what is wrong in absolute terms for <a href="Laity">lay followers</a>. Therefore, the interpretation of what kinds of sexual activity are acceptable for a <a href="layperson">layman</a> is not a religious matter as far as Buddhism is concerned.

Although Hindu society does not formally acknowledge sexuality between men, it formally acknowledges and gives space to sexuality between men and <a href="third%20gender">third gender</a>s as a variation of male-female sex (meaning a part of heterosexuality, rather than homosexuality, if analyzed in western terms). Hijras, Alis, Kotis, etc. (the various forms of third gender that exist in India today) are all characterized by the gender role of having receptive anal and oral sex with men. However, sexuality between males (as distinct from third genders) has thrived, mostly unspoken and informally, without being seen as different in the way it is seen in the west; young men involved in "such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure".

Aarau

Aarau (, <a href="Swiss%20German">locally</a> [ˈɑːræʊ]) is a <a href="List%20of%20towns%20in%20Switzerland">town</a>, a <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Switzerland">municipality</a>, and the capital of the northern Swiss <a href="Cantons%20of%20Switzerland">canton</a> of <a href="Aargau">Aargau</a>. The <a href="List%20of%20towns%20in%20Switzerland">town</a> is also the capital of the district of <a href="Aarau%20%28district%29">Aarau</a>. It is German-speaking and predominantly <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>. Aarau is situated on the <a href="Swiss%20plateau">Swiss plateau</a>, in the valley of the <a href="Aare">Aare</a>, on the river's right bank, and at the southern foot of the <a href="Jura%20Mountains">Jura Mountains</a>, and is west of <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, and northeast of <a href="Bern">Bern</a>. The municipality borders directly on the <a href="canton%20of%20Solothurn">canton of Solothurn</a> to the west. It is the second-largest town in Aargau after <a href="Wettingen">Wettingen</a>. At the beginning of 2010 <a href="Rohr%2C%20Aargau">Rohr</a> became a suburb of Aarau.

The official language of Aarau is (the Swiss variety of Standard) <a href="Swiss%20Standard%20German">German</a>, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the <a href="Alemannic%20German">Alemannic</a> <a href="Swiss%20German%20%28linguistics%29">Swiss German</a> dialect.

The old city of Aarau is situated on a rocky outcrop at a narrowing of the Aare river valley, at the southern foot of the Jura mountains. Newer districts of the city lie to the south and east of the outcrop, as well as higher up the mountain, and in the valley on both sides of the Aare.
The neighboring municipalities are <a href="K%C3%BCttigen">Küttigen</a> to the north, <a href="Rohr%2C%20Aargau">Rohr</a> and <a href="Buchs%2C%20Aargau">Buchs</a> to the east, <a href="Suhr%2C%20Aargau">Suhr</a> to the south-east, <a href="Unterentfelden">Unterentfelden</a> to the south, and <a href="Eppenberg-W%C3%B6schnau">Eppenberg-Wöschnau</a> and <a href="Erlinsbach%2C%20Aargau">Erlinsbach</a> to the west.
Aarau and the nearby neighboring municipalities have grown together and now form an interconnected agglomeration. The only exception is Unterentfelden whose settlements are divided from Aarau by the extensive forests of Gönhard and Zelgli.
Approximately nine-tenths of the city is south of the Aar, and one tenth is to the north. It has an area, , of . Of this area, 6.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while 34% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 55.2% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (4.5%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes). The lowest elevation, , is found at the banks of the Aar, and the highest elevation, at , is the Hungerberg on the border with Küttigen.

A few artifacts from the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period were found in Aarau. Near the location of the present train station, the ruins of a settlement from the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> (about 1000 BC) have been excavated. The Roman road between Salodurum (<a href="Solothurn">Solothurn</a>) and <a href="Vindonissa">Vindonissa</a> passed through the area, along the route now covered by the Bahnhofstrasse. In 1976 divers in the Aare found part of a seven-meter wide wooden bridge from the late Roman times.

Aarau was founded around AD 1240 by the counts of <a href="House%20of%20Kyburg">Kyburg</a>. Aarau is first mentioned in 1248 as "Arowe". Around 1250 it was mentioned as "Arowa". However the first mention of a city sized settlement was in 1256. The town was ruled from the "Rore" tower, which has been incorporated into the modern city hall.

In 1273 the counts of Kyburg died out. Agnes of Kyburg, who had no male relations, sold the family's lands to King <a href="Rudolf%20I">Rudolf I</a> von <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a>. He granted Aarau its city rights in 1283. In the 14th century the city was expanded in two stages, and a second defensive wall was constructed. A deep ditch separated the city from its "suburb;" its location is today marked by a wide street named "Graben" (meaning Ditch).

In 1415 Bern invaded lower Aargau with the help of Solothurn. Aarau capitulated after a short resistance, and was forced to swear allegiance to the new rulers. In the 16th century, the rights of the lower classes were abolished.
In March 1528 the citizens of Aarau allowed the introduction of Protestantism at the urging of the Bernese. A growth in population during the 16th Century led to taller buildings and denser construction methods. Early forms of industry developed at this time; however, unlike in other cities, no guilds were formed in Aarau.

On 11 August 1712, the <a href="Peace%20of%20Aarau">Peace of Aarau</a> was signed into effect. This granted each <a href="Cantons%20of%20Switzerland">canton</a> the right to choose their own religion thereby ending <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>'s control. Starting in the early 18th century, the textile industry was established in Aarau. German immigration contributed to the city's favorable conditions, in that they introduced the cotton and silk factories. These highly educated immigrants were also responsible for educational reform and the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">enlightened</a>, revolutionary spirit that developed in Aarau.

On 27 December 1797, the last <a href="Tagsatzung">Tagsatzung</a> of the <a href="Old%20Swiss%20Confederacy">Old Swiss Confederacy</a> was held in Aarau. Two weeks later a French envoy continued to foment the revolutionary opinions of the city. The contrast between a high level of education and a low level of political rights was particularly great in Aarau, and the city refused to send troops to defend the Bernese border. By Mid-March 1798 Aarau was occupied by French troops.

On 22 March 1798 Aarau was declared the capital of the <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Helvetic Republic</a>. It is therefore the first capital of a unified Switzerland. Parliament met in the city hall. On 20 September, the capital was moved to <a href="Lucerne">Lucerne</a>.

In 1803, <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a> ordered the fusion of the cantons of Aargau, Baden and Fricktal. Aarau was declared the capital of the new, enlarged canton of Aargau. In 1820 the city wall was torn down, with the exception of the individual towers and gates, and the defensive ditches were filled in.

The wooden bridge, dating from the Middle Ages, across the Aare was destroyed by floods three times in thirty years, and was replaced with a steel suspension bridge in 1851. This was replaced by a concrete bridge in 1952. The city was linked up to the <a href="Swiss%20Central%20Railway">Swiss Central Railway</a> in 1856.

The textile industry in Aarau broke down in about 1850 because of the protectionist tariff policies of neighboring states. Other industries had developed by that time to replace it, including the production of <a href="mathematical%20instrument">mathematical instrument</a>s, shoes and cement. Beginning in 1900, numerous electrical enterprises developed. By the 1960s, more citizens worked in service industries or for the canton-level government than in manufacturing. During the 1980s many of the industries left Aarau completely.

In 1802 the Canton School was established; it was the first non-parochial high school in Switzerland. It developed a good reputation, and was home to Nobel Prize winners <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="Paul%20Karrer">Paul Karrer</a>, and <a href="Werner%20Arber">Werner Arber</a>, as well as several Swiss politicians and authors.

The purchase of a manuscript collection in 1803 laid the foundation for what would become the Cantonal Library, which contains a Bible annotated by <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Huldrych Zwingli</a>, along with the manuscripts and incunabula. More newspapers developed in the city, maintaining the revolutionary atmosphere of Aarau. Beginning in 1820, Aarau has been a refuge for political refugees.

The urban educational and cultural opportunities of Aarau were extended through numerous new institutions. A Theatre and Concert Hall was constructed in 1883, which was renovated and expanded in 1995–96. The Aargau Nature Museum opened in 1922. A former cloth warehouse was converted into a small theatre in 1974, and the alternative culture center KIFF (Culture in the fodder factory) was established in a former animal fodder factory.

The earliest use of the place name was in 1248 (in the form Arowe), and probably referred to the settlement in the area before the founding of the city. It comes, along with the name of the River Aare (which was called Arula, Arola, and Araris in early times), from the German Au, meaning <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>.

The historic old town forms an irregular square, consisting of four parts (called "Stöcke"). To the south lies the <a href="Laurenzenvorstadt">Laurenzenvorstadt</a>, that is, the part of the town formerly outside the city wall. One characteristic of the city is its painted <a href="gable">gable</a>s, for which Aarau is sometimes called the "City of beautiful Gables". The old town, Laurenzenvorstadt, government building, cantonal library, state archive and art museum are all listed as <a href="Swiss%20inventory%20of%20cultural%20property%20of%20national%20and%20regional%20significance">heritage sites of national significance</a>.

The buildings in the old city originate, on the whole, from building projects during the 16th century, when nearly all the Middle Age period buildings were replaced or expanded. The architectural development of the city ended in the 18th century, when the city began to expand beyond its (still existing) wall. Most of the buildings in the "suburb" date from this time.

The "Schlössli" (small Castle), Rore Tower and the upper gate tower have remained nearly unchanged since the 13th century. The "Schlössli" is the oldest building in the city. It was already founded at the time of the establishment of the city shortly after 1200; the exact date is not known. City hall was built around Rore Tower in 1515.
The upper gate tower stands beside the southern gate in the city wall, along the road to Lucerne and Bern. The jail has been housed in it since the Middle Ages. A <a href="Carillon">Carillon</a> was installed in the tower in the middle of the 20th century, the bells for which were provided by the centuries-old bell manufacturers of Aarau.

The town church was built between 1471 and 1478. During the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>, in 1528, its twelve altars and accompanying pictures were destroyed. The "Justice fountain" (Gerechtskeitbrunnen) was built in 1634, and is made of French <a href="limestone">limestone</a>; it includes a statue of Lady Justice made of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, hence the name. It was originally in the street in front of city hall, but was moved to its present location in front of the town church in 1905 due to increased traffic.

, Aarau had an unemployment rate of 2.35%. , there were 48 people employed in the <a href="Primary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">primary economic sector</a> and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 4,181 people are employed in the <a href="Secondary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">secondary sector</a> and there are 164 businesses in this sector. 20,186 people are employed in the <a href="Tertiary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">tertiary sector</a>, with 1,461 businesses in this sector. This is a total of over 24,000 jobs, since Aarau's population is about 16,000 it draws workers from many surrounding communities. there were 8,050 total workers who lived in the municipality. Of these, 4,308 or about 53.5% of the residents worked outside Aarau while 17,419 people commuted into the municipality for work. There were a total of 21,161 jobs (of at least 6 hours per week) in the municipality.

The largest employer in Aarau is the cantonal government, the offices of which are distributed across the entire city at numerous locations. One of the two head offices of the "<a href="Aargauer%20Zeitung">Aargauer Zeitung</a>", Switzerland's fifth largest newspaper, is located in Aarau, as are the Tele M1 television channel studios, and several radio stations.

<a href="Kern%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Kern & Co.</a>, founded in 1819, was an internationally known <a href="Geodesy">geodetic</a> instrument manufacturer based in Aarau. However, it was taken over by Wild Leitz in 1988, and was closed in 1991.

More than half of the workers in Aarau live in the city's suburbs, or farther away in the surrounding area. This leads to a busy rush hour, and regular traffic jams. Statistically, Aarau has the most jobs per capita of any Swiss city.

The small scale of Aarau causes it to continually expand the borders of its growth. The urban center lies in the middle of the "Golden Triangle" between <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, <a href="Bern">Bern</a>, and <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, and Aarau is having increasing difficulty in maintaining the independence of its economic base from the neighboring large cities. The idea of merging Aarau with its neighboring suburbs has been recently discussed in the hope of arresting the slowly progressing losses.

Manufacture include bells, mathematical instruments, electrical goods, cotton textiles, cutlery, chemicals, shoes, and other products. Aarau is famous for the quality of their instruments, cutlery and their bells.

Every Saturday morning there is a vegetable market in the "Graben" at the edge of the Old City. It is supplied with regional products. In the last week of September the MAG (Market of Aarauer Tradesmen) takes place there, with regional companies selling their products. The "Rüeblimärt" is held in the same place on the first Wednesday in November, which is a Carrot fair. The Aarau fair is held at the ice skating rink during the Spring.

<a href="Aarau%20railway%20station">Aarau railway station</a> is a terminus of the <a href="S-Bahn%20Z%C3%BCrich">S-Bahn Zürich</a> on the line <a href="S3%20%28ZVV%29">S3</a>.

The town is also served with public transport provided by <a href="Busbetrieb%20Aarau%20AG">Busbetrieb Aarau AG</a>.

The population of Aarau grew continuously from 1800 until about 1960, when the city reached a peak population of 17,045, more than five times its population in 1800. However, since 1960 the population has fallen by 8%. There are three reasons for this population loss: firstly, since the completion of Telli (a large apartment complex), the city has not had any more considerable land developments. Secondly, the number of people per household has fallen; thus, the existing dwellings do not hold as many people. Thirdly, population growth was absorbed by neighboring municipalities in the regional urban area, and numerous citizens of Aarau moved into the countryside. This trend might have stopped since the turn of the 21st century. Existing industrial developments are being used for new purposes instead of standing empty.

Aarau has a population (as of ) of . , 19.8% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 1%. Most of the population () speaks German (84.5%), with Italian being second most common ( 3.3%) and Serbo-Croatian being third ( 2.9%).

Aargau

The canton of Aargau (German "Kanton" ; sometimes anglicized Argovia; see also <a href="List%20of%20European%20regions%20with%20alternative%20names%23A">other names</a>) is one of the more northerly <a href="cantons%20of%20Switzerland">cantons of Switzerland</a>. It is situated by the lower course of the <a href="Aare">Aare</a>, which is why the canton is called Aar-<a href="Gau%20%28country%20subdivision%29">gau</a> (meaning "Aare province"). It is one of the most densely populated regions of Switzerland.

The area of Aargau and the surrounding areas were controlled by the <a href="Helvetians">Helvetians</a>, a member of the <a href="Celts">Celts</a>, as far back as 200 BC, eventually being occupied by the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a> and then by the 6th century, the <a href="Franks">Franks</a>. The Romans built a major settlement called <a href="Vindonissa">Vindonissa</a>, near the present location of <a href="Brugg">Brugg</a>.

In early medieval times, the Aargau was a disputed border region between the duchies of <a href="Alamannia">Alamannia</a> and <a href="Burgundy%20%28region%29">Burgundy</a>. A line of the von <a href="Wetterau">Wetterau</a> (<a href="Conradines">Conradines</a>) intermittently held the countship of Aargau from 750 until about 1030, when they lost it (having in the meantime taken the name <a href="von">von</a> <a href="Tegerfelden">Tegerfelden</a>). From the extinction in 1254 of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenstaufen">Hohenstaufen</a> dynasty until 1415, the area was ruled by the <a href="Habsburgs">Habsburgs</a>, and many castles from that time still stand (examples include <a href="Habsburg%20Castle">Habsburg</a>, <a href="Schloss%20Lenzburg">Lenzburg</a>, Tegerfelden, Bobikon, Stin and Wildegg). The Habsburgs founded a number of monasteries (with some structures enduring, e.g., in <a href="Wettingen%20Abbey">Wettingen</a> and <a href="Muri%20Abbey">Muri</a>), the closing of which by the government in 1841 was a contributing factor to the outbreak of the Swiss civil war – the "<a href="Sonderbund%20War">Sonderbund War</a>" – in 1847.

When <a href="Frederick%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Frederick IV of Habsburg</a> sided with <a href="Antipope%20John%20XXIII">Antipope John XXIII</a> at the <a href="Council%20of%20Constance">Council of Constance</a>, <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor</a> <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund</a> placed him under the <a href="Imperial%20ban">Imperial ban</a>. In July 1414, the Pope visited <a href="Bern">Bern</a> and received assurances from them, that they would move against the Habsburgs. A few months later the <a href="Swiss%20Confederation">Swiss Confederation</a> denounced the <a href="Treaty%20of%201412">Treaty of 1412</a>. Shortly thereafter in 1415, <a href="Bern">Bern</a> and the rest of the Swiss Confederation used the ban as a pretext to invade the Aargau. The Confederation was able to quickly conquer the towns of Aarau, Lenzburg, Brugg and Zofingen along with most of the Habsburg castles. <a href="Bern">Bern</a> kept the southwest portion (<a href="Zofingen">Zofingen</a>, <a href="Aarburg">Aarburg</a>, <a href="Aarau">Aarau</a>, <a href="Lenzburg">Lenzburg</a>, and <a href="Brugg">Brugg</a>), northward to the confluence of the <a href="Aare%20%28river%29">Aare</a> and <a href="Reuss%20%28river%29">Reuss</a>. The important city of <a href="Baden%2C%20Switzerland">Baden</a> was taken by a united Swiss army and governed by all 8 members of the Confederation. Some districts, named the "<a href="Freie%20%C3%84mter">Freie Ämter</a>" ("free bailiwicks") – <a href="Mellingen">Mellingen</a>, <a href="Muri">Muri</a>, <a href="Villmergen">Villmergen</a>, and <a href="Bremgarten%20%28district%29">Bremgarten</a>, with the <a href="County%20of%20Baden">countship of Baden</a> – were governed as "subject lands" by all or some of the Confederates. Shortly after the conquest of the Aargau by the Swiss, <a href="Frederick%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Frederick</a> humbled himself to the Pope. The Pope reconciled with him and ordered all of the taken lands to be returned. The Swiss refused and years later after no serious attempts at re-acquisition, the Duke officially relinquished rights to the Swiss.

Bern's portion of the Aargau came to be known as the <a href="Unteraargau">Unteraargau</a>, though can also be called the Berner or Bernese Aargau. In 1514 Bern expanded north into the <a href="Canton%20of%20Jura">Jura</a> and so came into possession of several strategically important mountain passes into the Austrian <a href="Fricktal">Fricktal</a>. This land was added to the Unteraargau and was directly ruled from Bern. It was divided into seven rural <a href="bailiwick">bailiwick</a>s and four administrative cities, Aarau, Zofingen, Lenzburg and Brugg. While the Habsburgs were driven out, many of their minor nobles were allowed to keep their lands and offices, though over time they lost power to the Bernese government. The bailiwick administration was based on a very small staff of officials, mostly made up of Bernese citizens, but with a few locals.

When Bern converted during the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> in 1528, the Unteraargau also converted. At the beginning of the 16th century a number of <a href="anabaptist">anabaptist</a>s migrated into the upper Wynen and Rueder valleys from <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>. Despite pressure from the Bernese authorities in the 16th and 17th centuries anabaptism never entirely disappeared from the Unteraargau.

Bern used the Aargau bailiwicks mostly as a source of grain for the rest of the city-state. The administrative cities remained economically only of regional importance. However, in the 17th and 18th centuries Bern encouraged industrial development in Unteraargau and by the late 18th century it was the most industrialized region in the city-state. The high industrialization led to high population growth in the 18th century, for example between 1764 and 1798, the population grew by 35%, far more than in other parts of the canton. In 1870 the proportion of farmers in Aarau, Lenzburg, Kulm, and Zofingen districts was 34–40%, while in the other districts it was 46–57%.

The rest of the <a href="Freie%20%C3%84mter">Freie Ämter</a> were collectively administered as subject territories by the rest of the Confederation. Muri "Amt" was assigned to Zürich, Lucerne, <a href="Canton%20of%20Schwyz">Schwyz</a>, <a href="Unterwalden">Unterwalden</a>, <a href="Canton%20of%20Zug">Zug</a> and <a href="Canton%20of%20Glarus">Glarus</a>, while the "Ämter" of Meienberg, Richensee and <a href="Villmergen">Villmergen</a> were first given to Lucerne alone. The final boundary was set in 1425 by an arbitration tribunal and Lucerne had to give the three "Ämter" to be collectively ruled. The four "Ämter" were then consolidated under a single Confederation <a href="bailiff">bailiff</a> into what was known in the 15th century as the "Waggental" Bailiwick (). In the 16th century, it came to be known as the "Vogtei der Freien Ämter". While the "Freien Ämter" often had independent lower courts, they were forced to accept the Confederation's sovereignty. Finally, in 1532, the canton of Uri became part of the collective administration of the Freien Ämter.

At the time of <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>, the majority of the Ämter converted to the new faith. In 1529, a wave of <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclasm</a> swept through the area and wiped away much of the old religion. After the defeat of Zürich in the second <a href="Battle%20of%20Kappel">Battle of Kappel</a> in 1531, the victorious five Catholic cantons marched their troops into the Freie Ämter and reconverted them to Catholicism.

In the <a href="First%20War%20of%20Villmergen">First War of Villmergen</a>, in 1656, and the <a href="Toggenburg%20War">Toggenburg War</a> (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712, the Freie Ämter became the staging ground for the warring Reformed and Catholic armies. While the peace after the 1656 war did not change the status quo, the fourth Peace of Aarau in 1712 brought about a reorganization of power relations. The victory gave Zürich the opportunity to force the Catholic cantons out of the government in the <a href="county%20of%20Baden">county of Baden</a> and the adjacent area of the Freie Ämter. The Freie Ämter were then divided in two by a line drawn from the gallows in <a href="Fahrwangen">Fahrwangen</a> to the <a href="Oberlunkhofen">Oberlunkhofen</a> church steeple. The northern part, the so-called Unteren Freie Ämter (lower Freie Ämter), which included the districts of Boswil (in part) and Hermetschwil and the Niederamt, were ruled by Zürich, Bern and Glarus. The southern part, the Oberen Freie Ämter (upper Freie Ämter), were ruled by the previous seven cantons but Bern was added to make an eighth.

During the <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Helvetic Republic</a> (1798–1803), the county of Baden, the Freie Ämter and the area known as the <a href="Kelleramt">Kelleramt</a> were combined into the <a href="canton%20of%20Baden">canton of Baden</a>.

The <a href="County%20of%20Baden">County of Baden</a> was a shared <a href="Condominium%20%28international%20law%29">condominium</a> of the entire <a href="Old%20Swiss%20Confederacy">Old Swiss Confederacy</a>. After the Confederacy conquest in 1415, they retained much of the Habsburg legal structure, which caused a number of problems. The local nobility had the right to hold the <a href="High%2C%20middle%20and%20low%20justice">low court</a> in only about one fifth of the territory. There were over 30 different nobles who had the right to hold courts scattered around the surrounding lands. All these overlapping jurisdictions caused numerous conflicts, but gradually the Confederation was able to acquire these rights in the County. The cities of Baden, <a href="Bremgarten%2C%20Aargau">Bremgarten</a> and <a href="Mellingen">Mellingen</a> became the administrative centers and held the high courts. Together with the courts, the three administrative centers had considerable local autonomy, but were ruled by a governor who was appointed by the "Acht Orte" every two years. After the <a href="Swiss%20Reformed%20Church">Protestant</a> victory at the <a href="Toggenburg%20War">Second Battle of Villmergen</a>, the administration of the County changed slightly. Instead of the "Acht Orte" appointing a bailiff together, Zürich and Bern each appointed the governor for 7 out of 16 years while <a href="Canton%20of%20Glarus">Glarus</a> appointed him for the remaining 2 years.

The chaotic legal structure and fragmented land ownership combined with a tradition of dividing the land among all the heirs in an inheritance prevented any large scale reforms. The governor tried in the 18th century to reform and standardize laws and ownership across the County, but with limited success. With an ever-changing administration, the County lacked a coherent long-term economic policy or support for reforms. By the end of the 18th century there were no factories or mills and only a few small <a href="Cottage%20industry%23Cottage%20industry">cottage industries</a> along the border with Zürich. Road construction first became a priority after 1750, when Zürich and Bern began appointing a governor for seven years.

During the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, some of the municipalities converted to the new faith. However, starting in 1531, some of the old parishes were <a href="Counter-Reformation">converted back to the old faith</a>. The governors were appointed from both Catholic and Protestant cantons and since they changed every two years, neither faith gained a majority in the County.

The County was the only federal condominium in the 17th century where Jews were tolerated. In 1774, they were restricted to just two towns, <a href="Endingen%2C%20Switzerland">Endingen</a> and <a href="Lengnau%2C%20Aargau">Lengnau</a>. While the rural upper class tried several times to finally expel the Jews, the financial interests of the authorities prevented this. The Jews were directly subordinate to the governor starting in 1696 when they were forced to buy a protecting and shielding letter every 16 years from the governor.

After the French invasion, on 19 March 1798, the governments of Zürich and Bern agreed to the creation of the short lived <a href="canton%20of%20Baden">canton of Baden</a> in the <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Helvetic Republic</a>. With the <a href="Act%20of%20Mediation">Act of Mediation</a> in 1803, the canton of Baden was dissolved. Portions of the lands of the former County of Baden now became the District of Baden in the newly created canton of Aargau. After World War II, this formerly agrarian region saw striking growth and became the district with the largest and densest population in the canton (110,000 in 1990, 715 persons per km).

The contemporary canton of Aargau was formed in 1803, a canton of the <a href="Swiss%20Confederation%20%28Napoleonic%29">Swiss Confederation</a> as a result of the <a href="Act%20of%20Mediation">Act of Mediation</a>. It was a combination of three short-lived cantons of the <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Helvetic Republic</a>: Aargau (1798–1803), Baden (1798–1803) and Fricktal (1802–1803). Its creation is therefore rooted in the <a href="Switzerland%20in%20the%20Napoleonic%20era">Napoleonic era</a>. In the year 2003, the canton of Aargau celebrated its 200th anniversary.

French forces occupied the Aargau from 10 March to 18 April 1798; thereafter the Bernese portion became the canton of Aargau and the remainder formed the <a href="canton%20of%20Baden">canton of Baden</a>. Aborted plans to merge the two halves came in 1801 and 1802, and they were eventually united under the name Aargau, which was then admitted as a full member of the reconstituted Confederation following the Act of Mediation. Some parts of the canton of Baden at this point were transferred to other cantons: the "Amt" of <a href="Hitzkirch">Hitzkirch</a> to Lucerne, whilst <a href="H%C3%BCttikon">Hüttikon</a>, <a href="Oetwil%20an%20der%20Limmat">Oetwil an der Limmat</a>, <a href="Dietikon">Dietikon</a> and <a href="Schlieren%2C%20Z%C3%BCrich">Schlieren</a> went to Zürich. In return, Lucerne's "Amt" of <a href="Merenschwand">Merenschwand</a> was transferred to Aargau (district of Muri).

The <a href="Fricktal">Fricktal</a>, ceded in 1802 by <a href="Austria">Austria</a> via Napoleonic France to the Helvetic Republic, was briefly a separate canton of the Helvetic Republic (the <a href="canton%20of%20Fricktal">canton of Fricktal</a>) under a "<a href="Statthalter">Statthalter</a>" ('Lieutenant'), but on 19 March 1803 (following the Act of Mediation) was incorporated into the canton of Aargau.

The former cantons of Baden and Fricktal can still be identified with the contemporary <a href="Districts%20of%20Switzerland%23Aargau">districts</a> – the <a href="canton%20of%20Baden">canton of Baden</a> is covered by the districts of Zurzach, Baden, Bremgarten, and Muri (albeit with the gains and losses of 1803 detailed above); the <a href="canton%20of%20Fricktal">canton of Fricktal</a> by the districts of Rheinfelden and Laufenburg (except for <a href="Hottwil">Hottwil</a> which was transferred to that district in 2010).

The chief magistracy of Aargau changed its style repeatedly:

In the 17th century, Jews were banished from Switzerland. However, a few families were permitted to live in two villages, <a href="Endingen%2C%20Switzerland">Endingen</a> and <a href="Lengnau%2C%20Aargau">Lengnau</a>, in Aargau which became the Jewish ghetto in Switzerland. During this period, Jews and Christians were not allowed to live under the same roof, neither were Jews allowed to own land or houses. They were taxed at a much higher rate than others and, in 1712, the Lengnau community was "pillaged." In 1760, they were further restricted regarding marriages and multiplying. This remained the case until the 19th century. In 1799, all special tolls were abolished, and, in 1802, the poll tax was removed. On 5 May 1809, they were declared citizens and given broad rights regarding trade and farming. They were still restricted to Endingen and Lengnau until 7 May 1846, when their right to move and reside freely within the canton of Aargau was granted. On 24 September 1856, the <a href="Swiss%20Federal%20Council">Swiss Federal Council</a> granted them full political rights within Aargau, as well as broad business rights; however the majority Christian population did not abide by these new liberal laws fully. The time of 1860 saw the canton government voting to grant suffrage in all local rights and to give their communities autonomy. Before the law was enacted, it was repealed due to vocal opposition led by the <a href="Ultramontanism">Ultramonte Party</a>. Finally, the federal authorities in July 1863, granted all Jews full rights of citizens. However, they did not receive all of the rights in Endingen and Lengn until a resolution of the <a href="Grand%20Council%20of%20Aargau">Grand Council</a>, on 15 May 1877, granted citizens' rights to the members of the Jewish communities of those places, giving them charters under the names of New Endingen and New Lengnau. The <a href="Swiss%20Jewish%20Kulturverein">Swiss Jewish Kulturverein</a> was instrumental in this fight from its founding in 1862 until it was dissolved 20 years later. During this period of diminished rights, they were not even allowed to bury their dead in Swiss soil and had to bury their dead on an island called "<a href="Juden%C3%A4ule">Judenäule</a>" (Jews' Isle) on the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> near <a href="Waldshut-Tiengen">Waldshut</a>. Beginning in 1603, the deceased Jews of the <a href="Surbtal">Surbtal</a> communities were buried on the river island which was leased by the Jewish community. As the island was repeatedly flooded and devastated, in 1750 the <a href="Surbtal%20Jews">Surbtal Jews</a> asked the "<a href="Tagsatzung">Tagsatzung</a>" to establish the <a href="J%C3%BCdischer%20Friedhof%20Endingen">Endingen cemetery</a> in the vicinity of their communities.

The capital of the canton is <a href="Aarau">Aarau</a>, which is located on its western border, on the <a href="Aare%20%28river%29">Aare</a>. The canton borders <a href="Germany">Germany</a> (<a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>) to the north, the Rhine forming the border. To the west lie the Swiss cantons of <a href="Basel-Landschaft">Basel-Landschaft</a>, <a href="Canton%20of%20Solothurn">Solothurn</a> and <a href="Canton%20of%20Bern">Bern</a>; the <a href="canton%20of%20Lucerne">canton of Lucerne</a> lies south, and <a href="Canton%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> and <a href="Canton%20of%20Zug">Zug</a> to the east. Its total area is . It contains both large rivers, the <a href="Aare%20%28river%29">Aare</a> and the <a href="Reuss%20%28river%29">Reuss</a>.

The canton of Aargau is one of the least mountainous Swiss cantons, forming part of a <a href="Swiss%20Plateau">great table-land</a>, to the north of the <a href="Swiss%20Alps">Alps</a> and the east of the <a href="Jura%20mountains">Jura</a>, above which rise low hills. The surface of the country is beautifully diversified, undulating tracts and well-wooded hills alternating with fertile valleys watered mainly by the Aare and its tributaries. The valleys alternate with pleasant hills, most of which are full of woods. Slightly over one-third of the canton is wooded (), while nearly half is used from farming (). or about 2.4% of the canton is considered unproductive, mostly lakes (notably <a href="Lake%20Hallwil">Lake Hallwil</a>) and streams. With a population density of 450/km (1,200/sq mi), the canton has a relatively high amount of land used for human development, with or about 15% of the canton developed for housing or transportation.

It contains the famous hot sulphur springs of <a href="Baden%2C%20Switzerland">Baden</a> and <a href="Schinznach-Bad">Schinznach-Bad</a>, while at <a href="Rheinfelden">Rheinfelden</a> there are very extensive saline springs. Just below <a href="Brugg">Brugg</a> the <a href="Reuss%20%28river%29">Reuss</a> and the <a href="Limmat">Limmat</a> join the Aar, while around Brugg are the ruined castle of <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a>, the old convent of <a href="K%C3%B6nigsfelden%20Abbey">Königsfelden</a> (with fine painted medieval glass) and the remains of the <a href="ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> settlement of "Vindonissa" (<a href="Windisch">Windisch</a>).

<a href="Fahr%20Monastery">Fahr Monastery</a> forms a small <a href="Enclave%20and%20exclave">exclave</a> of the canton, otherwise surrounded by the <a href="canton%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich">canton of Zürich</a>, and since 2008 is part of the Aargau municipality of <a href="W%C3%BCrenlos">Würenlos</a>.

Aargau is divided into 11 districts:

The most recent change in district boundaries occurred in 2010 when <a href="Hottwil">Hottwil</a> transferred from Brugg to Laufenburg, following its merger with other municipalities, all of which were in Laufenburg.

There are (as of 2014) 213 municipalities in the canton of Aargau. As with most Swiss cantons there has been a trend since the early 2000s for municipalities to merge, though mergers in Aargau have so far been less radical than in other cantons.

The <a href="blazon">blazon</a> of the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> is "Per pale, dexter: sable, a fess wavy argent, charged with two cotises wavy azure; sinister: sky blue, three mullets of five argent."

American Quarter Horse

The American Quarter Horse, or Quarter Horse, is an American <a href="Horse%20breeds">breed</a> of <a href="horse">horse</a> that excels at sprinting short distances. Its name came from its ability to outdistance other horse breeds in races of a quarter mile or less; some have been clocked at speeds up to 55 mph (88.5 km/h). The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today, and the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a> is the largest breed registry in the world, with almost 3 million living American Quarter Horses registered in 2014.

The American Quarter Horse is well known both as a race horse and for its performance in <a href="rodeo">rodeo</a>s, <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a>s and as a working <a href="ranch">ranch</a> horse. The compact body of the American Quarter Horse is well-suited to the intricate and speedy maneuvers required in <a href="reining">reining</a>, <a href="cutting%20%28sport%29">cutting</a>, working cow horse, <a href="barrel%20racing">barrel racing</a>, <a href="calf%20roping">calf roping</a>, and other <a href="western%20riding">western riding</a> events, especially those involving live cattle. The American Quarter Horse is also shown in <a href="English%20riding">English</a> disciplines, <a href="Driving%20%28horse%29">driving</a>, and many other <a href="Equestrianism">equestrian</a> activities.

In the 17th century, colonists on the eastern seaboard of what today is the United States began to cross imported English <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> horses with assorted "native" horses such as the <a href="Chickasaw%20horse">Chickasaw horse</a>, which was a breed developed by Native American people from horses descended from Spain, developed from <a href="Iberian%20horse">Iberian</a>, <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a> and <a href="Barb%20%28horse%29">Barb</a> stock brought to what is now the Southeastern United States by the <a href="Conquistador">Conquistador</a>s.

One of the most famous of these early imports was Janus, a Thoroughbred who was the grandson of the <a href="Godolphin%20Arabian">Godolphin Arabian</a>. He was foaled in 1746, and imported to colonial Virginia in 1756. The influence of Thoroughbreds like Janus contributed genes crucial to the development of the colonial "Quarter Horse". The breed is sometimes referred to as the "Famous American Quarter Running Horse". The resulting horse was small, hardy, and quick, and was used as a work horse during the week and a race horse on the weekends.

As <a href="flat%20racing">flat racing</a> became popular with the colonists, the Quarter Horse gained even more popularity as a sprinter over courses that, by necessity, were shorter than the classic racecourses of England, and were often no more than a straight stretch of road or flat piece of open land. When matched against a Thoroughbred, local sprinters often won. As the Thoroughbred breed became established in America, many colonial Quarter Horses were included in the original American stud books, starting a long association between the Thoroughbred breed and what would later become officially known as the "Quarter Horse", named after the race distance at which it excelled. with some individuals being clocked at up to 55 mph.

In the 19th century, pioneers heading West needed a hardy, willing horse. On the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a>, settlers encountered horses that descended from the Spanish stock <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Cort%C3%A9s">Hernán Cortés</a> and other Conquistadors had introduced into the viceroyalty of <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a>, which today includes the Southwestern United States and Mexico. These horses of the west included herds of <a href="feral">feral</a> animals known as <a href="Mustang%20%28horse%29">Mustangs</a>, as well as horses domesticated by <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a>, including the <a href="Comanche">Comanche</a>, <a href="Shoshoni">Shoshoni</a> and <a href="Nez%20Perce%20%28tribe%29">Nez Perce</a> tribes. As the colonial Quarter Horse was crossed with these western horses, the pioneers found that the new crossbred had innate "cow sense", a natural instinct for working with cattle, making it popular with cattlemen on <a href="ranch">ranch</a>es.

Early <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation sires</a> of Quarter horse type included <a href="Steel%20Dust">Steel Dust</a>, foaled 1843; Shiloh (or Old Shiloh), foaled 1844; Old Cold Deck (1862); Lock's Rondo, one of many "Rondo" horses, foaled in 1880; Old Billy—again, one of many "Billy" horses—foaled circa 1880; <a href="Traveler%20%28horse%29">Traveler</a>, a stallion of unknown breeding, known to have been in Texas by 1889; and <a href="Peter%20McCue%20%28horse%29">Peter McCue</a>, foaled 1895, registered as a <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> but of disputed pedigree.

The main duty of the ranch horse in the American West was working cattle. Even after the invention of the automobile, horses were still irreplaceable for handling livestock on the range. Thus, major Texas cattle <a href="ranch">ranch</a>es, such as the <a href="King%20Ranch">King Ranch</a>, the 6666 (Four Sixes) Ranch, and the <a href="Waggoner%20Ranch">Waggoner Ranch</a> played a significant role in the development of the modern Quarter Horse. The skills needed by cowboys and their horses became the foundation of the <a href="rodeo">rodeo</a>, a contest which began with informal competition between <a href="cowboy">cowboy</a>s and expanded to become a major competitive event throughout the west. To this day, the Quarter Horse dominates the sport both in speed events and in competition that emphasizes the handling of live cattle.

However, sprint races were also popular weekend entertainment and racing became a source of economic gain for breeders as well. As a result, more Thoroughbred blood was added back into the developing American Quarter Horse breed. The American Quarter Horse also benefitted from the addition of <a href="Arabian%20Horse">Arabian</a>, <a href="Morgan%20horse">Morgan</a> and even <a href="Standardbred%20horse">Standardbred</a> bloodlines.

In 1940, the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a> (AQHA) was formed by a group of horsemen and ranchers from the southwestern United States dedicated to preserving the pedigrees of their ranch horses. The horse honored with the first registration number, P-1, was <a href="Wimpy%20P-1">Wimpy</a>, a descendant of the <a href="King%20Ranch">King Ranch</a> foundation sire <a href="Old%20Sorrel%20%28horse%29">Old Sorrel</a>. Other sires alive at the founding of the AQHA were given the earliest registration numbers <a href="Joe%20Reed%20%28horse%29">Joe Reed P-3</a>, Chief P-5, <a href="Oklahoma%20Star">Oklahoma Star P-6</a>, Cowboy P-12, and Waggoner's Rainy Day P-13. The <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> race horse <a href="Three%20Bars%20%28horse%29">Three Bars</a>, alive in the early years of the AQHA, is recognized by the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame</a> as one of the significant foundation sires for the Quarter Horse breed. Other significant Thoroughbred sires seen in early AQHA pedigrees include <a href="Rocket%20Bar">Rocket Bar</a>, <a href="Top%20Deck%20%28horse%29">Top Deck</a> and Depth Charge.

Since the American Quarter Horse formally established itself as a breed, the AQHA stud book has remained open to additional <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> blood via a performance standard. An "Appendix" American Quarter Horse is a first generation cross between a registered Thoroughbred and an American Quarter Horse or a cross between a "numbered" American Quarter Horse and an "appendix" American Quarter Horse. The resulting offspring is registered in the "appendix" of the American Quarter Horse Association's studbook, hence the nickname. Horses listed in the appendix may be entered in competition, but offspring are not initially eligible for full AQHA registration. If the Appendix horse meets certain conformational criteria and is shown or raced successfully in sanctioned AQHA events, the horse can earn its way from the appendix into the permanent studbook, making its offspring eligible for AQHA registration

Since Quarter Horse/Thoroughbred crosses continue to enter the official registry of the American Quarter Horse breed, this creates a continual gene flow from the Thoroughbred breed into the American Quarter Horse breed, which has altered many of the characteristics that typified the breed in the early years of its formation. Some breeders, who argue that the continued infusion of Thoroughbred bloodlines is beginning to compromise the integrity of the breed standard, favor the earlier style of horse and have created several separate organizations to promote and register "Foundation" Quarter Horses.

The American Quarter Horse is best known today as a <a href="horse%20show">show horse</a>, <a href="horse%20racing">race horse</a>, <a href="reining">reining</a> and <a href="cutting%20%28sport%29">cutting</a> horse, <a href="rodeo">rodeo</a> competitor, <a href="ranch">ranch</a> horse, and all-around family horse. Quarter Horses compete well in rodeo events such as <a href="barrel%20racing">barrel racing</a>, <a href="calf%20roping">calf roping</a> and <a href="team%20roping">team roping</a>; and <a href="Gymkhana%20%28Equestrian%29">gymkhana</a> or O-Mok-See. Other stock horse events such as <a href="Cutting%20%28sport%29">cutting</a> and <a href="reining">reining</a> are open to all breeds but also dominated by American Quarter Horse. Large purses allow top competitors to earnover a million dollars in these events. 

The breed is not only well-suited for <a href="western%20riding">western riding</a> and <a href="cattle">cattle</a> work. Many race tracks offer Quarter Horses a wide assortment of pari-mutuel <a href="horse%20racing">horse racing</a> with purses in the millions. Quarter Horses have also been trained to compete in <a href="dressage">dressage</a> and can be good <a href="show%20jumping">jumpers</a>. They are also used for recreational <a href="trail%20riding">trail riding</a> and in <a href="mounted%20police">mounted police</a> units.

The American Quarter Horse has also been exported worldwide. European nations such as Germany and Italy have imported large numbers of Quarter Horses. Next to the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a> (which also encompasses Quarter Horses from Canada), the second largest registry of Quarter Horses is in Brazil, followed by Australia. With the internationalization of the discipline of <a href="reining">reining</a> and its acceptance as one of the official seven events of the <a href="World%20Equestrian%20Games">World Equestrian Games</a>, there is a growing international interest in Quarter Horses. Countries like Japan, Switzerland and <a href="Israel">Israel</a> that did not have traditional stock horse industries have begun to compete with American Quarter Horses in their own nations and internationally. The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today, and the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a> is the largest breed registry in the world, with over 5 million American Quarter Horses registered worldwide.

The modern Quarter Horse has a small, short, refined head with a straight profile, and a strong, well-muscled body, featuring a broad chest and powerful, rounded hindquarters. They usually stand between high, although some <a href="Halter%20%28horse%20show%29">Halter-type</a> and English hunter-type horses may grow as tall as .

There are two main body types: the stock type and the hunter or racing type. The stock horse type is shorter, more compact, stocky and well muscled, yet agile. The racing and hunter type Quarter Horses are somewhat taller and smoother muscled than the stock type, more closely resembling the <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>.

Quarter Horses come in nearly all <a href="Equine%20coat%20color">colors</a>. The most common color is <a href="sorrel%20%28horse%29">sorrel</a>, a brownish red, part of the color group called <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> by most other breed registries. Other recognized colors include <a href="bay%20%28color%29">bay</a>, <a href="black%20%28horse%29">black</a>, <a href="Seal%20brown%20%28horse%29">brown</a>, <a href="buckskin%20%28color%29">buckskin</a>, <a href="palomino">palomino</a>, <a href="gray%20%28horse%29">gray</a>, <a href="dun%20gene">dun</a>, red dun, <a href="grullo">grullo</a> (also occasionally referred to as blue dun), red <a href="roan%20%28horse%29">roan</a>, blue roan, bay roan, <a href="Cream%20gene">perlino</a>, <a href="cremello">cremello</a>, and <a href="white%20%28horse%29">white</a>. In the past, <a href="cropout">spotted color patterns</a> were excluded, but now with the advent of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> testing to verify parentage, the registry accepts all colors as long as both parents are registered.

A stock horse is a horse of a type that is well suited for working with livestock, particularly cattle. <a href="Reining">Reining</a> and <a href="cutting%20%28sport%29">cutting</a> horses are smaller in stature, with quick, agile movements and very powerful hindquarters. <a href="Western%20pleasure">Western pleasure</a> show horses are often slightly taller, with slower movements, smoother gaits, and a somewhat more level topline – though still featuring the powerful hindquarters characteristic of the Quarter Horse. 

Horses shown in-hand in <a href="halter%20%28horse%20show%29">Halter</a> competition are larger yet, with a very heavily muscled appearance, while retaining small heads with wide jowls and refined muzzles. There is controversy amongst owners, breeder and veterinarians regarding the health effects of the extreme muscle mass that is currently fashionable in the specialized halter horse, which typically is and weighs in at over when fitted for halter competition. Not only are there concerns about the weight to frame ratio on the horse's <a href="Horse%20anatomy">skeletal system</a>, but the massive build is also linked to <a href="HYPP">HYPP</a>. (See "Genetic diseases" below))

Quarter Horse <a href="Horse%20racing">race horses</a> are bred to sprint short distances ranging from 220 to 870 yards. Thus, they have long legs and are leaner than their stock type counterparts, but are still characterized by muscular hindquarters and powerful legs. Quarter horses race primarily against other Quarter horses, and their sprinting ability has earned them the nickname, "the world's fastest athlete." The <a href="show%20hunter">show hunter</a> type is slimmer, even more closely resembling a <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>, usually reflecting a higher percentage of appendix breeding. They are shown in hunter/jumper classes at both breed shows and in open <a href="United%20States%20Equestrian%20Federation">USEF</a>-rated <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a> competition.

There are several genetic diseases of concern to Quarter Horse breeders:

Abacá

Abacá ( ; ), binomial name Musa textilis, is a species of <a href="banana">banana</a> native to the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, grown as a commercial crop in the Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica. The plant, also known as Manila hemp, has great economic importance, being harvested for its <a href="fiber">fiber</a>, also called <a href="Manila%20hemp">Manila hemp</a>, extracted from the leaf-stems. The plant grows to , and averages about . The fiber was originally used for making twines and ropes; now most is pulped and used in a variety of specialized paper products including tea bags, filter paper and banknotes. It is classified as a hard fiber, along with <a href="coir">coir</a>, <a href="henequin">henequin</a> and <a href="sisal">sisal</a>.

The abacá plant is stoloniferous, meaning that the plant produces runners or shoots along the ground that then root at each segment. Cutting and transplanting rooted runners is the primary technique for creating new plants, since seed growth is substantially slower. Abacá has a "false trunk" or pseudostem about in diameter. The leaf stalks (<a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a>) are expanded at the base to form <a href="Leaf%20sheath">sheath</a>s that are tightly wrapped together to form the pseudostem. There are from 12 to 25 leaves, dark green on the top and pale green on the underside, sometimes with large brown patches. They are oblong in shape with a deltoid base. They grow in succession. The petioles grow to at least in length. When the plant is mature, the flower stalk grows up inside the pseudostem. The male flower has 5 petals, each about long. The leaf sheaths contain the valuable fiber. After harvesting, the coarse fibers range in length from long. They are composed primarily of <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, <a href="lignin">lignin</a>, and <a href="pectin">pectin</a>.

The fruit, which is inedible and is rarely seen as harvesting occurs before the plant fruits, grows to about in length and in diameter. It has black turbinate seeds that are in diameter.

The abacá plant belongs to the <a href="banana">banana</a> family, <a href="Musaceae">Musaceae</a>; it resembles the closely related wild seeded bananas, "<a href="Musa%20acuminata">Musa acuminata</a>" and "<a href="Musa%20balbisiana">Musa balbisiana</a>". Its scientific name is "Musa textilis". Within the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Musa%20%28genus%29">Musa</a>", it is placed in section "Callimusa" (now including the former section "Australimusa"), members of which have a <a href="diploid">diploid</a> <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a> number of 2n = 20.

Before synthetic textiles came into use, "M. textilis" was a major source of high quality fiber: soft, silky and fine. Ancestors of the modern abaca are thought to have originated from the Eastern Philippines where there are lot of rains (no pronounced dry season), in fact wild type of abaca can still be found in the interior forests of Catanduanes Island which is often not cultivated. Today, Catanduanes has many other modern kinds of abaca which are more competitive. For many years, breeders from various research institutions have made the cultivated varieties of Catanduanes Island even more competitive in local and international markets. This results in the optimum production of the island which had a consistent highest production throughout the archipelago.

Europeans first came into contact with Abaca fibre when <a href="Ferdinand%20Magellan">Magellan</a> made land in the Philippines in 1521, as the natives were cultivating it and utilizing it in bulk for textiles already. By 1897, the Philippines were exporting almost 100,000 tons of abacá, and it was one of the three biggest cash crops, along with tobacco and sugar. In fact, from 1850 through the end of the 19th century, sugar or abacá alternated with each other as the biggest export crop of the Philippines. This 19th century trade was predominantly with the United States and the making of ropes was done mainly in New England, although in time the rope-making was moved back to the Philippines. Excluding the Philippines, abacá was first cultivated on a large scale in <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> in 1925 under the <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Dutch</a>, who had observed its cultivation in the Philippines for <a href="cordage%20%28rope%29">cordage</a> since the nineteenth century, followed up by plantings in <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> in 1929 sponsored by the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>. It also was transplanted into <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. Commercial planting began in 1930 in <a href="British%20North%20Borneo">British North Borneo</a>; with the commencement of World War II, the supply from the Philippines was eliminated by the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a>.

In the early 1900s, a train running from <a href="Danao%2C%20Cebu">Danao</a> to <a href="Argao">Argao</a> would transport Philippine abaca from the plantations to <a href="Cebu%20City">Cebu city</a> for export. The train and tracks were destroyed during the Second world war, however the Abaca plantations continue and are now transported to Cebu by road.

After the war, the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> started production in <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>, <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>, and <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. Today, abacá is produced primarily in the Philippines and Ecuador. The Philippines produces between 85% and 95% of the world's abacá, and the production employs 1.5 million people. Production has declined because of virus diseases.
Due to its strength, it is a sought after product and is the strongest of the natural fibers. It is used by the paper industry for such specialty uses such as <a href="tea%20bags">tea bags</a>, banknotes and decorative papers. It can be used to make handcrafts such as bags, carpets, clothing and furniture. Abacá rope is very durable, flexible and resistant to salt water damage, allowing its use in <a href="hawser">hawser</a>s, ship's lines and <a href="fishing%20net">fishing net</a>s. A rope can require to break. Abacá fiber was once used primarily for rope, but this application is now of minor significance. Lupis is the finest quality of abacá. <a href="Sinamay">Sinamay</a> is woven chiefly from abacá.

The inner fibers are used in the making of hats, including the "Manila hats," hammocks, matting, <a href="cordage%20%28rope%29">cordage</a>, ropes, coarse twines, and types of canvas. It is called <a href="Manila%20hemp">Manila hemp</a> in the market although it is unlike true hemp, and is also known as Cebu hemp and Davao hemp. Abacá cloth is found in museum collections around the world, like the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Textile Museum of Canada.

Philippine indigenous tribes still weave abaca-based textiles like "<a href="t%27nalak">t'nalak</a>", made by the <a href="Tboli%20people">Tiboli</a> tribe of <a href="South%20Cotabato">South Cotabato</a>, and "dagmay", made by the <a href="Bagobo">Bagobo</a> people. 

The plant is normally grown in well-drained <a href="loam">loam</a>y soil, using <a href="rhizomes">rhizomes</a> planted at the start of the rainy season. In addition, new plants can be started by seeds. Growers harvest abacá fields every three to eight months after an initial growth period of 12–25 months. Harvesting is done by removing the leaf-stems after flowering but before fruit appears. The plant loses productivity between 15 and 40 years. The slopes of volcanoes provide a preferred growing environment. Harvesting generally includes several operations involving the leaf sheaths:

When the processing is complete, the bundles of fiber are pale and lustrous with a length of .

In Costa Rica, more modern harvest and drying techniques are being developed to accommodate the very high yields obtained there.

According to the <a href="Philippine%20Fiber%20Industry%20Development%20Authority">Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority</a>, the Philippines provided 87.4% of the world's abaca in 2014, earning the Philippines US$111.33 million. The demand is still greater than the supply. The remainder came from Ecuador (12.5%) and Costa Rica (0.1%). The <a href="Bicol%20region">Bicol region</a> in the Philippines produced 27,885 <a href="metric%20ton">metric ton</a>s of abaca in 2014, the largest of any <a href="Philippine%20region">Philippine region</a>. The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture reported that in 2009-2013, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine abaca producution while overwhelming 92% comes from <a href="Catanduanes">Catanduanes Island</a>. Eastern Visayas, the second largest producer had 24% and the Davao Region, the third largest producer had 11% of the total production. Around 42 percent of the total abaca fiber shipments from the Philippines went to the United Kingdom in 2014, making it the top importer. Germany imported 37.1 percent abaca pulp from the Philippines, importing around 7,755 metric tons (MT). Sales of abaca cordage surged 20 percent in 2014 to a total of 5,093 MT from 4,240 MT, with the United States holding around 68 percent of the market.

Abacá is vulnerable to a number of pathogens, notably <a href="abaca%20bunchy%20top%20virus">abaca bunchy top virus</a> and <a href="abaca%20bract%20mosaic%20virus">abaca bract mosaic virus</a>.

Abaddon

The Hebrew term Abaddon (, ""), and its two Greek equivalents Apollyon (, "Apollyon") as a person/being and <a href="Tartarus">Τάρταρος Tartaros</a> as a place/time, appears in the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> as name of a place, time, or personification/incarnation of destructive nature. In the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, "Abaddon" often appears alongside the place שְׁאוֹל ("<a href="sheol">sheol</a>"), meaning the realm of the dead. In the New Testament <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Revelation">pageRank.Book of Revelation</a>, an angel called Abaddon is described as the king of an army of <a href="locust">locust</a>s; his name is first transcribed in Greek (Revelation 9:11—"whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, The Angel of Death." (Ἀβαδδὼν), and then translated ("which in Greek means the Destroyer" (Ἀπολλύων, "Apollyon")). The Latin <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> and the <a href="Douay%20Rheims%20Bible">Douay Rheims Bible</a> have additional notes (not present in the Greek text), "in Latin Exterminans", "exterminans" being the Latin word for "destroyer".

According to the <a href="Brown%20Driver%20Briggs">Brown Driver Briggs</a> lexicon, the Hebrew "abaddon" (Hebrew: אבדון; "abaddon") is an intensive form of the <a href="Semitic%20root">Semitic root</a> and verb stem "abad" (אָבַד) "perish" (transitive "destroy"), which occurs 184 times in the Hebrew Bible. The <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, an early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, renders "Abaddon" as "ἀπώλεια", while the Greek "Apollyon" comes from "apollumi" (<a href="%3Awikt%3A%E1%BC%80%CF%80%CF%8C%CE%BB%CE%BB%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B9">ἀπόλλυμι</a>), "to destroy". The Greek term "Apollyon" (<a href="%3Awikt%3A%E1%BC%88%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%BB%CF%8D%CF%89%CE%BD">Ἀπολλύων</a>, "the destroyer"), is the <a href="active%20participle">active participle</a> of "apollumi" (<a href="%3Awikt%3A%E1%BC%80%CF%80%CF%8C%CE%BB%CE%BB%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B9">ἀπόλλυμι</a>, "to destroy"), and is not used as a name in classical Greek texts.
The Edinburgh Encyclopedia of 1832 includes another view: "There can be no doubt that the Pythian Apollo is the same as the Ob and Abaddon of the Hebrews, which the Greeks translated literally Apollyon."

The term "abaddon" appears six times in the <a href="Masoretic%20text">Masoretic text</a> of the Hebrew Bible; "abaddon" means destruction or "place of destruction", or the realm of the dead, and is accompanied by <a href="Sheol">Sheol</a>. 

The text of the <a href="Thanksgiving%20Hymns">Thanksgiving Hymns</a>—which was found in the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>—tells of "the Sheol of Abaddon" and of the "torrents of <a href="Belial">Belial</a> [that] burst into Abaddon". The "<a href="Pseudo-Philo">Biblical Antiquities</a>" (misattributed to <a href="Philo">Philo</a>) mentions Abaddon as a place (destruction) rather than an individual. Abaddon is also one of the compartments of <a href="Gehenna">Gehenna</a>. By extension, it can mean an underworld abode of lost souls, or <a href="Gehenna">Gehenna</a>.

In some legends, Abaddon is identified as a realm where the <a href="Damnation">damned</a> lie in fire and snow, one of the places in <a href="Gehenna">Gehenna</a> that <a href="Moses">Moses</a> visited.

The <a href="Scriptures%23Christianity">Christian scriptures</a> contain the first known depiction of "Abaddon" as an individual entity instead of a place.
In <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Revelation">Revelation</a> 9:11, Abaddon is described as "Destroyer", the angel of the <a href="Abyss%20%28religion%29">abyss</a>, and as the king of a plague of locusts resembling horses with crowned human faces, women's hair, lions' teeth, wings, iron breast-plates, and a tail with a scorpion's stinger that torments for five months anyone who does not have the seal of God on their foreheads.

The symbolism of Revelation 9:11 leaves the identity of Abaddon open to interpretation. Protestant commentator <a href="Matthew%20Henry">Matthew Henry</a> (1708) believed Abaddon to be the <a href="Antichrist">Antichrist</a>, whereas the <a href="Jamieson-Fausset-Brown%20Commentary">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Commentary</a> (1871) and <a href="Henry%20H.%20Halley">Henry H. Halley</a> (1922) identified the angel as Satan. <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">Latter-Day Saints</a> believe that the use of "Abaddon" in Revelation 9 refers to the devil.

In contrast, the <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> publication "The Interpreter's Bible" states: "Abaddon, however, is an angel not of Satan but of God, performing his work of destruction at God's bidding", citing the context at Revelation chapter 20, verses 1 through 3.

<a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> as well cite Revelation 20:1-3 where the angel having "the key of the abyss" is actually shown to be a representative of God, one from heaven, and, rather than being "satanic", is the one that binds Satan and hurls him into the abyss; concluding that "Abaddon" is another name for Jesus Christ after his resurrection. 

<a href="Full%20Preterism">Full Preterism</a>
In scripture, the Greek name for Abaddon is Apollian, which happens to be the very name of the 15th Legion of the Roman army that laid siege to Jerusalem for five months and destroyed it in 70 AD. Interestingly, the prophets including Daniel, Jesus and John the Revelator, foretold of this destruction that would occur before that 1st century generation passed away. It was predicted that there would come to be 4 kingdoms: Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome on the earth. The 4th kingdom Rome was represented by Iron and it was a composite beast made up of the previous kingdoms which had been conquered. The Empire of Rome ruled the world in the lifetime of Jesus which is exactly when the prophecy foretold that the kingdom of heaven would destroy the power of that earthly Roman kingdom and it did, but not with physical weapons, but with spiritual ones through the spread of the good news of God's kingdom under Christ in the 1st century. The old Jewish age passed away and the new heavenly kingdom age under Jesus began. Other views often overlook audience relevance and time statements which is crucial in understanding Daniel, The Olivet prophecy and Revelation which are all written about the same last days events in the 1st century.

In the 3rd century <a href="Acts%20of%20Thomas">Acts of Thomas</a>, Abaddon is the name of a demon, or the <a href="devil">devil</a> himself.

Abaddon is given particularly important roles in two sources, a homily entitled "The Enthronement of Abbaton" by pseudo-<a href="Timothy%20of%20Alexandria">Timothy of Alexandria</a>, and the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20%28by%20Bartholomew%29">Apocalypse of Bartholomew</a>. In the homily by Timothy, Abbaton was first named "Muriel", and had been given the task by <a href="God">God</a> of collecting the earth that would be used in the creation of <a href="Adam">Adam</a>. Upon completion of this task, the angel was appointed as a guardian. Everyone, including the angels, demons, and corporeal entities feared him. Abbaton was promised that any who venerated him in life could be saved. Abaddon is also said to have a prominent role in the <a href="Last%20Judgement">Last Judgement</a>, as the one who will take the souls to the <a href="Valley%20of%20Josaphat">Valley of Josaphat</a>. He is described in the Apocalypse of Bartholomew as being present in the <a href="Tomb%20of%20Jesus">Tomb of Jesus</a> at the moment of his <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a>.

Abadeh

Abadeh (, also <a href="Romanize">Romanize</a>d as Ābādeh) is a city in and the capital of <a href="Abadeh%20County">Abadeh County</a>, in <a href="Fars%20Province">Fars Province</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. Abadeh is situated at an elevation of in a fertile plain on the high road between <a href="Isfahan%20%28city%29">Isfahan</a> and <a href="Shiraz%2C%20Iran">Shiraz</a>, from the former and from the latter. At the 2006 census, its population was 52,042, in 14,184 families. As of 2009, the population was estimated to be 59,042.

It is the largest city in the Northern Fars Region (South Central-Iran), which is famed for its carved wood-work, made of the wood of <a href="pear">pear</a> and <a href="box%20tree">box tree</a>s. Sesame oil, castor oil, grain, and various fruits are also produced there. The area is famous for its <a href="Abadeh%20rug">Abadeh rug</a>s.

An interesting fact is that Abadeh is closer, road-distance-wise to 4 provincial capitals of <a href="Isfahan">Isfahan</a> (193 km), <a href="Yasuj">Yasuj</a> (197 km), <a href="Yazd">Yazd</a> (217 km), and <a href="Shahrekord">Shahrekord</a> (237 km) compared to the distance to the provincial capital of its corresponding province, <a href="Shiraz">Shiraz</a> (260 km).

Abadeh historical monuments include Emirate Kolah Farangi, Tymcheh Sarafyan and Khaje tomb, located in the Khoja mountains.
Abadeh crafts can be embroidered in cotton. The town also produces <a href="Abadeh%20rug">Abadeh rug</a>s.

The rugs tend to be based on a cotton warp and have a thin, tightly knotted pile. Most Abadeh rugs are closely cut making them very flat. Although some of the older Abadehs vary in style, many of the new designs are easily recognisable. These new designs, known as Heybatlu consist of a single diamond shaped medallion in the centre with smaller medallions on each corner. The pattern is typically geometrical flowers or animals and the main colours are light reds or burnt orange on top of a dark blue background with strong green details. The corners or borders are generally ivory in colour. Although some Abadeh and Shiraz rugs appear similar Abadeh can normally be differentiated by their higher knot counts as well as the fact that the warp is invariably cotton. The rugs are almost always exclusively medium in size and the KPSI of an average Abadeh is around 90. As always in the rug-world you get what you pay for however in general Abadeh are well made and fairly popular items, particularly in modern interiors or those with a Mediterranean or North African style.

<a href="Road%2065%20%28Iran%29">Expressway 65</a> passes through Abadeh. This situation helps Abadeh to improve its capabilities compared to the neighboring city, <a href="Eqlid">Eqlid</a>. <a href="Road%2078%20%28Iran%29">Road 78</a> makes connections from Abadeh to <a href="Abarkuh">Abarkuh</a>, <a href="Yazd">Yazd</a> <a href="Eqlid">Eqlid</a> and <a href="Yasuj">Yasuj</a>.

Abae

Abae (, "Abai") is an ancient town in the northeastern corner of <a href="Phocis">Phocis</a>, in <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. It was famous in antiquity for its <a href="oracle">oracle</a> of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> <a href="Abaeus">Abaeus</a>, one of those consulted by <a href="Croesus">Croesus</a>, king of <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, and <a href="Mardonius">Mardonius</a>, among others.

It was rich in treasures, but was destroyed by the <a href="Persia">Persia</a>ns in the invasion of <a href="Xerxes%20I%20of%20Persia">Xerxes</a> in 480 BCE, and a second time by the <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>ns and remained in a ruined state.It was rebuilt by <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>.

The oracle was, however, still consulted, e.g. by the <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebans</a> before <a href="Leuctra">Leuctra</a> in 371 BCE. The temple, along with the village of the same name, may have escaped destruction during the <a href="Third%20Sacred%20War">Third Sacred War</a> (355–346 BCE), due to the respect given to the inhabitants; however it was in a very dilapidated state when seen by <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> in the 2nd century CE, though some restoration, as well as the building of a new temple, was undertaken by Emperor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>.

The sanctity of the shrine ensured certain privileges to the people of Abae, and these were confirmed by the Romans. The Persians did not reflect this opinion and would destroy all the temples that they overcame, Abae included. The Greek pledged to not rebuild them as a memorial of the ravages of the Persians.

Among the most exciting recent archaeological discoveries in Greece is the recognition that the sanctuary site near the modern village of <a href="Kalapodi">Kalapodi</a> is not only the site of the oracle of Apollon at Abai but that it was in constant use for cult practices from early <a href="Helladic%20period">Mycenaean</a> times to the Roman period. It is thus the first site where the archaeology confirms the continuity of Mycenaean and Classical Greek religion, which has been inferred from the <a href="List%20of%20Mycenaean%20deities">presence of the names</a> of Classical Greek divinities on <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> texts from <a href="Pylos">Pylos</a> and <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a>.

The fortified site described below, originally identified as Abae by Colonel <a href="William%20Leake">William Leake</a> in the 19th century, is much more likely to be that of the Sanctuary of Artemis at <a href="Hyampolis">Hyampolis</a>.

The <a href="polygon">polygon</a>al walls of the acropolis may still be seen in a fair state of preservation on a circular hill standing about above the little plain of <a href="Exarcho">Exarcho</a>; one gateway remains, and there are also traces of town walls below. The temple site was on a low spur of the hill, below the town. An early terrace wall supports a precinct in which are a <a href="stoa">stoa</a> and some remains of temples; these were excavated by the <a href="British%20School%20at%20Athens">British School at Athens</a> in 1894, but little was found.

Abakan

Abakan (; <a href="Khakas%20language">Khakas</a>: , "Ağban") is the <a href="capital%20city">capital city</a> of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Khakassia">Republic of Khakassia</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, located in the central part of <a href="Minusinsk%20Depression">Minusinsk Depression</a>, at the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of the <a href="Yenisei%20River">Yenisei</a> and <a href="Abakan%20River">Abakan River</a>s. As of the <a href="Russian%20Census%20%282010%29">2010 Census</a>, it had a population of 165,214—a slight increase over 165,197 recorded during the <a href="Russian%20Census%20%282002%29">2002 Census</a> and a further increase from 154,092 recorded during the <a href="Soviet%20Census%20%281989%29">1989 Census</a>.

Abakansky "<a href="ostrog%20%28fortress%29">ostrog</a>" (), also known as Abakansk (), was built at the mouth of the <a href="Abakan%20River">Abakan River</a> in 1675. In the 1780s, the "<a href="village%23Russia">selo</a>" of Ust-Abakanskoye () was established in this area. It was granted town status and given its current name on April 30, 1931.

In 1940, Russian construction workers found ancient ruins during the construction of a highway between Abakan and <a href="Askiz%20%28rural%20locality%29">Askiz</a>. When the site was excavated by Soviet archaeologists in 1941–1945, they realized that they had discovered a building absolutely unique for the area: a large (1500 square meters) Chinese-style, likely <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> era (206 BCE–220 CE) palace. The identity of the high-ranking personage who lived luxuriously in Chinese style, far outside of the borders of the Han Empire, has remained a matter for discussion ever since. Russian archaeologist L.A. Yevtyukhova surmised, based on circumstantial evidence, that the palace may have been the residence of <a href="Li%20Ling">Li Ling</a>, a Chinese general who had been defeated by the <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> in 99 BCE, and defected to them as a result. While this opinion has remained popular, other views have been expressed as well. More recently, for example, it was claimed by A.A. Kovalyov as the residence of Lu Fang (), a Han throne pretender from the <a href="Emperor%20Guangwu%20of%20Han">Guangwu</a> era.

In the late 18th and during the 19th century, Lithuanian participants in the 1794, 1830–1831, and 1863 rebellions against Russian rule were exiled to Abakan. A group of <a href="labor%20camp">camp</a>s was established where prisoners were forced to work in the coal mines. After <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>'s death, Lithuanian exiles from the nearby settlements moved in.

Abakan is the <a href="capital%20city">capital</a> of the republic. Within the <a href="subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Administrative%20divisions">framework of administrative divisions</a>, it is incorporated as the <a href="City%20of%20federal%20subject%20significance">City</a> of Abakan—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the <a href="administrative%20divisions%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Khakassia">districts</a> As a <a href="subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Municipal%20divisions">municipal division</a>, the City of Abakan is incorporated as Abakan Urban Okrug.

The city has a <a href="river%20port">river port</a>, industry enterprises, <a href="Katanov%20State%20University%20of%20Khakasia">Katanov State University of Khakasia</a>, and three theatres. Furthermore, it has a commercial center that produces <a href="footwear">footwear</a>, <a href="foodstuffs">foodstuffs</a>, and <a href="metal%20product">metal product</a>s.

Abakan (together with <a href="Tayshet">Tayshet</a>) was a terminal of the major <a href="Abakan-Taishet%20Railway">Abakan-Taishet Railway</a>. Now it is an important railway junction.

The city is served by the <a href="Abakan%20International%20Airport">Abakan International Airport</a>.

The 100th Air Assault Brigade of the <a href="Russian%20Airborne%20Troops">Russian Airborne Troops</a> was based in the city until circa  1996.

Abakan's sites of interest include Holy Transfiguration Cathedral, "Good Angel of Peace" sculpture, park of topiary art, and many others.

<a href="Bandy">Bandy</a> is the one of the most popular sports in the city. <a href="Sayany-Khakassia">Sayany-Khakassia</a> was playing in the top-tier Super League in the 2012–13 season but was relegated for the 2013–14 season. <a href="Russian%20Government%20Cup">Russian Government Cup</a> was played here in 1988 and in 2012.

Abakan has a borderline <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "Dwb")/<a href="cold%20semi-arid%20climate">cold semi-arid climate</a> (Köppen "BSk"). Temperature differences between seasons are extreme, which is typical for Siberia. Precipitation is concentrated in the summer and is less common because of rain shadow from nearby mountains.

Arc de Triomphe

The Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile (, "<a href="Triumphal%20Arch">Triumphal Arch</a> of the Star") is one of the most famous monuments in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, standing at the western end of the <a href="Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es">Champs-Élysées</a> at the center of <a href="Place%20Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Place Charles de Gaulle</a>, formerly named "Place de l'Étoile" — the "étoile" or "star" of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating avenues. 

The Arc de Triomphe should not be confused with a smaller arch, the <a href="Arc%20de%20Triomphe%20du%20Carrousel">Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel</a>, which stands west of the <a href="Louvre%20Palace">Louvre</a>. The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary</a> and <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the <a href="Arc%20de%20Triomphe%23Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</a> from World War I.

As the central cohesive element of the "<a href="Axe%20historique">Axe historique</a>" (historic axis, a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route running from the courtyard of the Louvre to the <a href="Grande%20Arche">Grande Arche de la Défense</a>), the Arc de Triomphe was designed by <a href="Jean%20Chalgrin">Jean Chalgrin</a> in 1806, and its <a href="Iconography">iconographic</a> program pits <a href="Heroic%20nudity">heroically nude</a> French youths against bearded <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> warriors in <a href="mail%20%28armour%29">chain mail</a>. It set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages.

Inspired by the Roman <a href="Arch%20of%20Titus">Arch of Titus</a>, the Arc de Triomphe has an overall height of , width of , and depth of , while its large vault is high and wide. The smaller transverse vaults are high and wide. Three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919 (marking the end of hostilities in World War I), <a href="Charles%20Godefroy">Charles Godefroy</a> flew his <a href="Nieuport">Nieuport</a> biplane under the arch's primary vault, with the event captured on newsreel.

Paris's Arc de Triomphe was the tallest <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a> until the completion of the <a href="Monumento%20a%20la%20Revoluci%C3%B3n">Monumento a la Revolución</a> in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> in 1938, which is high. The <a href="Arch%20of%20Triumph%20%28Pyongyang%29">Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang</a>, completed in 1982, is modelled on the Arc de Triomphe and is slightly taller at .

The Arc is located on the right bank of the <a href="Seine">Seine</a> at the centre of a dodecagonal configuration of twelve radiating avenues. It was commissioned in 1806 after the victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Austerlitz">Austerlitz</a> by <a href="Napoleon%20I">Emperor Napoleon</a> at the peak of his fortunes. Laying the foundations alone took two years and, in 1810, when Napoleon entered Paris from the west with his bride Archduchess <a href="Marie%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Parma">Marie-Louise</a> of Austria, he had a wooden mock-up of the completed arch constructed. The architect, <a href="Jean%20Chalgrin">Jean Chalgrin</a>, died in 1811 and the work was taken over by <a href="Jean-Nicolas%20Huyot">Jean-Nicolas Huyot</a>. During the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">Bourbon Restoration</a>, construction was halted and it would not be completed until the reign of <a href="Louis%20Philippe%20I">King Louis-Philippe</a>, between 1833 and 1836, by the architects Goust, then Huyot, under the direction of <a href="Louis-%C3%89tienne%20H%C3%A9ricart%20de%20Thury">Héricart de Thury</a>. On 15 December 1840, brought back to France from <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>, Napoleon's remains passed under it on their way to the Emperor's final resting place at the <a href="Invalides">Invalides</a>. Prior to burial in the <a href="Panth%C3%A9on%2C%20Paris">Panthéon</a>, the body of <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> was displayed under the Arc during the night of 22 May 1885.

The sword carried by the "Republic" in the "Marseillaise" relief broke off on the day, it is said, that the <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun">Battle of Verdun</a> began in 1916. The relief was immediately hidden by <a href="tarpaulin">tarpaulin</a>s to conceal the accident and avoid any undesired ominous interpretations.
On 7 August 1919, <a href="Charles%20Godefroy">Charles Godefroy</a> successfully flew his biplane under the Arc. <a href="Jean%20Navarre">Jean Navarre</a> was the pilot who was tasked to make the flight, but he died on 10 July 1919 when he crashed near <a href="Villacoublay">Villacoublay</a> while training for the flight.

Following its construction, the "Arc de Triomphe" became the rallying point of French troops parading after successful military campaigns and for the annual <a href="Bastille%20Day%20Military%20Parade">Bastille Day Military Parade</a>. Famous victory marches around or under the Arc have included the <a href="German%20Empire">Germans</a> in 1871, the French in 1919, the <a href="Occupation%20of%20France%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">Germans</a> in 1940, and the <a href="Liberation%20of%20Paris">French and Allies</a> in 1944 and 1945. A United States <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a> of 1945 shows the "Arc de Triomphe" in the background as victorious American troops march down the Champs-Élysées and U.S. airplanes fly overhead on 29 August 1944. After the interment of the Unknown Soldier, however, all military parades (including the aforementioned post-1919) have avoided marching through the actual arch. The route taken is up to the arch and then around its side, out of respect for the tomb and its symbolism. Both <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a> in 1940 and de Gaulle in 1944 observed this custom.

By the early 1960s, the monument had grown very blackened from coal soot and automobile exhaust, and during 1965–1966 it was cleaned through <a href="bleaching">bleaching</a>.

In the prolongation of the <a href="Avenue%20des%20Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es">Avenue des Champs-Élysées</a>, a new arch, the <a href="Grande%20Arche">Grande Arche de la Défense</a>, was built in 1982, completing the line of monuments that forms Paris's "Axe historique". After the "Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel" and the "Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile", the "Grande Arche" is the third arch built on the same perspective.

In 1995, the <a href="Armed%20Islamic%20Group%20of%20Algeria">Armed Islamic Group of Algeria</a> placed a bomb near the Arc de Triomphe which wounded 17 people as part of a <a href="1995%20Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%20and%20RER%20bombings">campaign of bombings</a>.

The <a href="astylar">astylar</a> design is by <a href="Jean%20Chalgrin">Jean Chalgrin</a> (1739–1811), in the <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassical</a> version of ancient <a href="Roman%20architecture">Roman architecture</a> (see, for example, the triumphal <a href="Arch%20of%20Titus">Arch of Titus</a>). Major <a href="academy">academic</a> sculptors of France are represented in the sculpture of the "Arc de Triomphe": <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Cortot">Jean-Pierre Cortot</a>; <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Rude">François Rude</a>; <a href="Antoine%20%C3%89tex">Antoine Étex</a>; <a href="James%20Pradier">James Pradier</a> and <a href="Philippe%20Joseph%20Henri%20Lemaire">Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire</a>. The main sculptures are not integral <a href="frieze">frieze</a>s but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze <a href="appliqu%C3%A9">appliqué</a>s on <a href="Empire%20%28style%29">Empire furniture</a>. The four sculptural groups at the base of the Arc are "The Triumph of 1810" (Cortot), "Resistance" and "Peace" (both by Antoine Étex) and the most renowned of them all, "Departure of the Volunteers of 1792" commonly called "<a href="La%20Marseillaise">La Marseillaise</a>" (François Rude). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the belt buckle for the honorary rank of <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal of France</a>. Since the fall of Napoleon (1815), the sculpture representing "Peace" is interpreted as commemorating the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281815%29">Peace of 1815</a>.

In the attic above the richly sculptured frieze of soldiers are 30 shields engraved with the names of major French victories in the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic wars</a>. The inside walls of <a href="Names%20inscribed%20under%20the%20Arc%20de%20Triomphe">the monument list the names of 660 people</a>, among which are 558 French generals of the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a>; The names of those generals killed in battle are underlined. Also inscribed, on the shorter sides of the four supporting columns, are the names of the major French victories in the Napoleonic Wars. The battles that took place in the period between the <a href="Hundred%20Days">departure of Napoleon from Elba to his final defeat at Waterloo</a> are not included.

For four years from 1882 to 1886, a monumental sculpture by <a href="Alexandre%20Falgui%C3%A8re">Alexandre Falguière</a> topped the arch. Titled "Le triomphe de la Révolution" ("The Triumph of the Revolution"), it depicted a chariot drawn by horses preparing "to crush Anarchy and Despotism". It remained there only four years before falling in ruins.

Inside the monument, a permanent exhibition conceived by the artist <a href="Maurice%20Benayoun">Maurice Benayoun</a> and the architect Christophe Girault opened in February 2007. The steel and new media installation interrogates the symbolism of the national monument, questioning the balance of its symbolic message during the last two centuries, oscillating between war and peace.

Beneath the Arc is the <a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</a> from <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Interred on <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a> 1920, it has the first <a href="eternal%20flame">eternal flame</a> lit in Western and Eastern Europe since the <a href="Vestal%20Virgin">Vestal Virgin</a>s' fire was extinguished in the fourth century. It burns in memory of the dead who were never identified (now in both world wars).

A ceremony is held at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier every 11 November on the anniversary of the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">armistice</a> signed by the Entente Powers and Germany in 1918. It was originally decided on 12 November 1919 to bury the unknown soldier's remains in the <a href="Panth%C3%A9on%2C%20Paris">Panthéon</a>, but a public letter-writing campaign led to the decision to bury him beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The coffin was put in the chapel on the first floor of the Arc on 10 November 1920, and put in its final resting place on 28 January 1921. The slab on top bears the inscription ("Here lies a French soldier who died for the fatherland 1914–1918").

In 1961, American President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and First Lady <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy</a> paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, accompanied by French President <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>. After the 1963 <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination">assassination of President Kennedy</a>, Mrs Kennedy remembered the eternal flame at the Arc de Triomphe and requested that an eternal flame be placed next to her husband's grave at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> in Virginia. President Charles de Gaulle went to Washington to attend the state funeral, and witnessed Jacqueline Kennedy lighting the eternal flame that had been inspired by her visit to France.







The "Arc de Triomphe" is accessible by the <a href="R%C3%A9seau%20Express%20R%C3%A9gional">RER</a> and <a href="Paris%20M%C3%A9tro">Métro</a>, with exit at the <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle%20-%20%C3%89toile%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%20and%20RER%29">Charles de Gaulle—Étoile station</a>. Because of heavy traffic on the roundabout of which the Arc is the centre, it is recommended that pedestrians use one of two underpasses located at the "Champs Élysées" and the "Avenue de la Grande Armée". A lift will take visitors almost to the top – to the attic, where there is a small museum which contains large models of the Arc and tells its story from the time of its construction. Another 46 steps remain to climb in order to reach the top, the "terrasse", from where one can enjoy a panoramic view of Paris.

Amazonite (sometimes called "Amazon stone") is a green variety of <a href="microcline">microcline</a> <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a>.

The name is taken from that of the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a>, from which certain green stones were formerly obtained, but it is doubtful whether green <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a> occurs in the Amazon area.

Amazonite is a mineral of limited occurrence.

More recently, high-quality crystals have been obtained from <a href="Pikes%20Peak">Pike's Peak</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, where it is found associated with smoky <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, <a href="orthoclase">orthoclase</a>, and <a href="albite">albite</a> in a coarse <a href="granite">granite</a> or <a href="pegmatite">pegmatite</a>. Crystals of amazonite can also be found in Crystal Park, El Paso County, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>. Other locations in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> which yield amazonite include the Morefield Mine in <a href="Amelia%2C%20Virginia">Amelia, Virginia</a>. It is also found in <a href="pegmatite">pegmatite</a> in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> and in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>.

Because of its bright <a href="green">green</a> color when polished, amazonite is sometimes cut and used as a cheap <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a>, although it is easily fractured, and loses its gloss due to its softness.

For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Naturally, many people assumed the color was due to copper because <a href="copper">copper</a> compounds often have blue and green colors. More recent studies suggest that the blue-green color results from small quantities of <a href="lead">lead</a> and water in the feldspar.

He was born in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, where he started his career, but he spent most of it in <a href="Middelburg">Middelburg</a> (1587–1613), where he moved with his family because of the threat of religious persecution. He specialized in painting <a href="still%20life">still life</a>s with flowers, which he signed with the monogram AB (the B in the A). At the age of twenty-one, he joined the city’s <a href="Guild%20of%20Saint%20Luke">Guild of Saint Luke</a> and later became dean. Not long after, Bosschaert had married and established himself as a leading figure in the fashionable floral painting genre. 

He had three sons who all became flower painters; <a href="Ambrosius%20Bosschaert%20II">Ambrosius II</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Bosschaert">Johannes</a> and <a href="Abraham%20Bosschaert">Abraham</a>. His brother-in-law <a href="Balthasar%20van%20der%20Ast">Balthasar van der Ast</a> also lived and worked in his workshop and moved with him on his travels. Bosschaert later worked in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> (1614), <a href="Bergen%20op%20Zoom">Bergen op Zoom</a> (1615–1616), <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a> (1616–1619), and <a href="Breda">Breda</a> (1619). In 1619 when he moved to Utrecht, his brother-in-law van der Ast entered the Utrecht Guild of St. Luke, where the renowned painter <a href="Abraham%20Bloemaert">Abraham Bloemaert</a> had just become dean. The painter <a href="Roelandt%20Savery">Roelandt Savery</a> (1576–1639) entered the St. Luke’s guild in Utrecht at about the same time. Savery had considerable influence on the Bosschaert dynasty. When Bosschaert died in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> while on commission there for a flower piece, Balthasar van der Ast took over running his workshop and pupils.

His bouquets were painted symmetrically and with scientific accuracy in small dimensions and normally on copper. They sometimes included symbolic and religious meanings. At the time of his death, Bosschaert was working on an important commission in the Hague. That piece is now in the collection in Stockholm. Bosschaert became one of the first artists to specialize in still life painting, and he started a tradition of painting detailed flower bouquets, which typically included tulips and roses. Thanks to the booming seventeenth-century Dutch art market, he became highly successful, as the inscription on one of his paintings attests.

His sons and his pupil and brother-in-law, Balthasar van der Ast, were among those to uphold the Bosschaert dynasty which continued until the mid-17th century.

It may not be a coincidence that this trend coincided with a <a href="Tulip%20mania">national obsession with exotic flowers</a> which made flower portraits highly sought after.

Although he was highly in demand, he did not create many pieces because he was also employed as an art dealer.
