Baltic languages

The Baltic languages belong to the <a href="Balto-Slavic%20languages">Balto-Slavic</a> branch of the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> language family. Baltic languages are spoken by the <a href="Balts">Balts</a>, mainly in areas extending east and southeast of the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> in <a href="Northern%20Europe">Northern Europe</a>.

Scholars usually regard them as a single <a href="language%20family">language family</a> divided into two groups: Western Baltic (containing only <a href="extinct%20language">extinct language</a>s), and Eastern Baltic (containing two <a href="living%20language">living language</a>s, <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian</a> and <a href="Latvian%20language">Latvian</a>). The range of the Eastern Baltic linguistic influence once possibly reached as far as the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a>, but this hypothesis has been questioned.

<a href="Old%20Prussian">Old Prussian</a>, a Western Baltic language that became extinct in the 18th century, ranks as the <a href="conservative%20%28language%29">most archaic</a> of the Baltic languages.

Although morphologically related, the Lithuanian, the Latvian, and particularly the Old Prussian vocabularies differ substantially from one another, and as such they are not <a href="mutually%20intelligible">mutually intelligible</a>, mainly due to a substantial number of <a href="false%20friend">false friend</a>s, and foreign words, borrowed from surrounding language families, which are used differently.

The Baltic languages are generally thought to form a single family with two branches, Eastern and Western. However, these two branches are sometimes classified as independent branches of Balto-Slavic.


(† — <a href="extinct%20language">extinct language</a>)

The Baltic-speaking peoples likely encompassed an area in Eastern Europe much larger than their modern range: as in the case of the <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic languages</a> of Western Europe, they were reduced with invasions, exterminations and assimilations. Studies in <a href="comparative%20linguistics">comparative linguistics</a> point to <a href="Genetic%20relationship%20%28linguistics%29">genetic relationship</a> between the languages of the Baltic family and the following extinct languages:
The Baltic classification of Dacian and Thracian has been proposed by the Lithuanian scientist <a href="Jonas%20Basanavi%C4%8Dius">Jonas Basanavičius</a>, who insisted this is the most important work of his life and listed 600 identical words of Balts and <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a>. He also theoretically included <a href="Phrygian%20language">Phrygian</a> in the related group, but this did not found subsequent support, but disapprovement among other authors, such as the linguistic analysis of Ivan Duridanov, which found Phrygian completely lacking parallels in either Thracian or Baltic languages.

The Bulgarian linguist Ivan Duridanov, who improved the most extensive list of toponyms, in his first publication claimed that Thracian is genetically linked to the Baltic languages and in the next one he made the following classification:""The Thracian language formed a close group with the Baltic (resp. Balto-Slavic), the Dacian and the "<a href="Pelasgian">Pelasgian</a>" languages. More distant were its relations with the other Indo-European languages, and especially with Greek, the Italic and Celtic languages, which exhibit only isolated phonetic similarities with Thracian; the Tokharian and the Hittite were also distant. ""
Of about 200 <a href="http%3A//www.lexicons.ru/old/f/thracian/index.html">reconstructed Thracian words</a> by Duridanov most cognates (138) appear in the Baltic languages, mostly in Lithuanian, followed by Germanic (61), Indo-Aryan (41), Greek (36), Bulgarian (23), Latin (10) and Albanian (8). The cognates of the <a href="List%20of%20reconstructed%20Dacian%20words">reconstructed Dacian words</a> in his publication are found mostly in the Baltic languages, followed by Albanian. Parallels have enabled linguists, using the techniques of <a href="comparative%20linguistics">comparative linguistics</a>, to decipher the meanings of several Dacian and Thracian placenames with, they claim, a high degree of probability. Of 74 <a href="Dacian%E2%80%93Baltic%20connection">Dacian placenames</a> attested in primary sources and considered by Duridanov, a total of 62 have Baltic cognates, most of which were rated "certain" by Duridanov. For a big number of 300 <a href="Thracian%20language%23A%20Thracian%20or%20Thraco-Dacian%20branch%20of%20Indo-European">Thracian geographic names</a> most parallels were found between Thracian and Baltic geographic names in the study of Duridanov. According to him the most important impression make the geographic cognates of Baltic and Thracian ""the similarity of these parallels stretching frequently on the main element and the suffix simultaneously, which makes a strong impression"". Some scholars, including Toparov, have found many linguistic similarities between Baltic and ancient <a href="Balkan">Balkan</a> languages pointing to the many close parallels between Dacian and Thracian placenames and those of the Baltic language-zone. A number of possible parallels of the Thracian ethnonym in <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> were not found in any other country, including the former capital <a href="Trakai">Trakai</a> (cf. Lith. Trakai, meaning "Thrcians"), Trakininkai, <a href="Traki%C5%A1kiai">Trakiškiai</a>, Trakiškiemiai, Traksėda and others. Other Slavic authors noted that Dacian and Thracian have much in common with Baltic <a href="onomastics">onomastics</a> and explicitly not in any similar way with Slavic onomastics, including cognates and parallels of lexical isoglosses, which implies a recent common ancestor.

After creating a list of names of rivers and personal names with a high number of parallels, the Romanian linguist Mircea M. Radulescu classified the <a href="Daco-Moesian">Daco-Moesian</a> and Thracian as Baltic languages expanding to the south and also proposed such classification for <a href="Illyrian%20language">Illyrian</a>. The German linguist Schall attributed a South Baltic classification to the Dacian language. The Venezualian-Lithuanian historian Jurate Rosales classifies Dacian and Thracian as Baltic languages. The Czech archaeologist Kristian Turnvvald classified such languages as <a href="Danube">Danubian</a> Baltic.

The American linguist Harvey Mayer refers to both Dacian and Thracian as Baltic languages. Mayer claims that he extracted an unambiguous evidence for regarding Dacian and Thracian as more tied to Lithuanian than to Latvian. In his first publication he claims to have sufficient evidence for classifying them as Baltoidic or at least "Baltic-like," if not exactly, Baltic dialects or languages still maintaining a genetic link within a common language family. In the next and final publication he refers to them as South or East Baltic languages and classifies <a href="Dacians">Dacians</a> and <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a> as "Balts by extension". ""Finally, I label Thracian and Dacian as East Baltic...The fitting of special Dacian and Thracian features (which I identified from Duridanov’s listings) into Baltic isogloss patterns so that I identified Dacian and Thracian as southeast Baltic. South Baltic because, like Old Prussian, they keep unchanged the diphthongs ei, ai, en, an (north Baltic Lithuanian and Latvian show varying percentages of ei, ai to ie, and en, an to ę, ą (to ē, ā) in Lithuanian, to ie, uo in Latvian). East Baltic because the Dacian word žuvete (now in Rumanian spelled juvete) has ž, not z as in west Baltic, and the Thracian word pušis (the Latin-Greek transcription shows pousis which, I believe, reflects -š-.) with zero grade puš- as in Lithuanian pušìs rather than with e-grade *peuš- as in Prussian peusē. Zero grade in this word is east Baltic, e-grade here is west Baltic, while the other word for “pine, evergreen”, preidē (Prussian and Dacian), priede (Latvian), is marginal in Lithuanian matched by no *peus- in Latvian."" In regards to other languages, he claims that <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a> is a descendant of <a href="Illyrian%20language">Illyrian</a> and escaped any heavy Baltic influence of Thracian.

The Baltic languages are of particular interest to linguists because they retain many archaic features, which are believed to have been present in the early stages of the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European language</a>. However, linguists have had a hard time establishing the precise relationship of the Baltic languages to other languages in the Indo-European family. Several of the extinct Baltic languages have a limited or nonexistent written record, their existence being known only from the records of ancient historians and personal or place names. All of the languages in the Baltic group (including the living ones) were first written down relatively late in their probable existence as distinct languages. These two factors combined with others have obscured the history of the Baltic languages, leading to a number of theories regarding their position in the Indo-European family.

The Baltic languages show a close relationship with the Slavic languages, and are grouped with them in a <a href="Balto-Slavic%20languages">Balto-Slavic</a> family by most scholars. This family is considered to have developed from a common ancestor, <a href="Proto-Balto-Slavic">Proto-Balto-Slavic</a>. Later on, several lexical, phonological and morphological dialectisms developed, separating the various Balto-Slavic languages from each other. Although it is generally agreed that the Slavic languages developed from a single more-or-less unified dialect (<a href="Proto-Slavic">Proto-Slavic</a>) that split off from common Balto-Slavic, there is more disagreement about the relationship between the Baltic languages.

The traditional view is that the Balto-Slavic languages split into two branches, Baltic and Slavic, with each branch developing as a single common language (Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic) for some time afterwards. Proto-Baltic is then thought to have split into East Baltic and West Baltic branches. However, more recent scholarship has suggested that there was no unified Proto-Baltic stage, but that Proto-Balto-Slavic split directly into three groups: Slavic, East Baltic and West Baltic. Under this view, the Baltic family is <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a>, and consists of all Balto-Slavic languages that are not Slavic. This would imply that Proto-Baltic, the last common ancestor of all Baltic languages, would be identical to Proto-Balto-Slavic itself, rather than distinct from it. In the 1960s <a href="Vladimir%20Toporov">Vladimir Toporov</a> and <a href="Vyacheslav%20Ivanov%20%28philologist%29">Vyacheslav Ivanov</a> made the following conclusions about the relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages: a) Proto-Slavic language formed from the peripheral-type Baltic dialects; b) Slavic linguistic type formed later from the Baltic languages structural model; c) the Slavic structural model is a result of the Baltic languages structural model transformation. These scholars’ theses do not contradict the Baltic and Slavic languages closeness and from a historical perspective specify the Baltic-Slavic languages evolution.

Finally, there is a minority of scholars who argue that Baltic descended directly from Proto-Indo-European, without an intermediate common Balto-Slavic stage. They argue that the many similarities and shared innovations between Baltic and Slavic are due to several millennia of contact between the groups, rather than shared heritage.

Speakers of modern Baltic languages are generally concentrated within the borders of <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a>, and in emigrant communities in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and the countries within the former borders of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

Historically the languages were spoken over a larger area: west to the mouth of the <a href="Vistula">Vistula</a> river in present-day <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, at least as far east as the <a href="Dniepr">Dniepr</a> river in present-day <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, perhaps even to <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, and perhaps as far south as <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>. Key evidence of Baltic language presence in these regions is found in <a href="hydronym">hydronym</a>s (names of bodies of water) that are characteristically Baltic. The use of hydronyms is generally accepted to determine the extent of a culture's influence, but "not" the date of such influence.

The eventual expansion of the use of <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic languages</a> in the south and east, and <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a> in the west, reduced the geographic distribution of Baltic languages to a fraction of the area that they formerly covered. The Russian geneticist Oleg Balanovsky speculated that there is a predominance of the assimilated pre-Slavic substrate in the genetics of East and West Slavic populations, according to him the common genetic structure which contrasts East Slavs and Balts from other populations may suggest that the pre-Slavic substrate of the <a href="East%20Slavs">East Slavs</a> consists most significantly of Baltic-speakers, which predated the Slavs in the cultures of the <a href="Eurasian%20steppe">Eurasian steppe</a> according to archaeological references he cites.

Though included among the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a> due to its location, the language of <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="Estonian%20language">Estonian</a>, is a <a href="Uralic%20language">Uralic language</a> and is not related to the Baltic languages, which are <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a>.

It is believed that the Baltic languages are among the <a href="conservative%20%28language%29">most archaic</a> of the currently remaining Indo-European languages, despite their late <a href="Attested%20language">attestation</a>.

Although the various Baltic tribes were mentioned by <a href="ancient%20historians">ancient historians</a> as early as 98 B.C., the first attestation of a Baltic language was about 1350, with the creation of the "Elbing Prussian Vocabulary", a German to Prussian translation dictionary. Lithuanian was first attested in a <a href="hymnal">hymnal</a> translation in 1545; the first printed book in Lithuanian, a <a href="Catechism">Catechism</a> by <a href="Martynas%20Ma%C5%BEvydas">Martynas Mažvydas</a> was published in 1547 in <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>, Prussia (now <a href="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a>, Russia). Latvian appeared in a hymnal in 1530 and in a printed Catechism in 1585.

One reason for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples <a href="Northern%20Crusades">resisted Christianization</a> longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence.

With the establishment of a <a href="History%20of%20Germany">German</a> state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct.

During the years of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> (1569–1795), official documents were written in <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, <a href="Ruthenian%20language">Ruthenian</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a>.

After the <a href="Partitions%20of%20Poland">Partitions of Commonwealth</a>, most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, where the native languages or alphabets were sometimes prohibited from being written down or used publicly in a <a href="Russification">Russification</a> effort (see <a href="Lithuanian%20press%20ban">Lithuanian press ban</a> for the ban in force from 1865 to 1904).

Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics is an <a href="interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> field that develops methods and <a href="software%20tool">software tool</a>s for understanding <a href="biology">biological</a> data. As an <a href="interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> field of science, bioinformatics combines <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, <a href="statistics">statistics</a>, <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, and <a href="engineering">engineering</a> to analyze and interpret <a href="biology">biological</a> data. Bioinformatics has been used for "<a href="in%20silico">in silico</a>" analyses of <a href="biological">biological</a> queries using <a href="mathematical">mathematical</a> and statistical techniques.

Bioinformatics is both an <a href="umbrella%20term">umbrella term</a> for the body of biological studies that use <a href="computer%20programming">computer programming</a> as part of their methodology, as well as a reference to specific analysis "pipelines" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of <a href="genomics">genomics</a>. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate <a href="gene">gene</a>s and single <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> polymorphisms (<a href="Single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">SNPs</a>). Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a> and <a href="protein">protein</a> sequences, called <a href="proteomics">proteomics</a>.

Bioinformatics has become an important part of many areas of biology. In experimental <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>, bioinformatics techniques such as <a href="image%20processing">image</a> and <a href="signal%20processing">signal processing</a> allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics and genomics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s. It plays a role in the <a href="text%20mining">text mining</a> of biological literature and the development of biological and gene <a href="Ontology%20%28information%20science%29">ontologies</a> to organize and query biological data. It also plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in the comparison of genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of systems biology. In structural biology, it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA, RNA, proteins as well as biomolecular interactions.

Historically, the term "bioinformatics" did not mean what it means today. <a href="Paulien%20Hogeweg">Paulien Hogeweg</a> and <a href="Ben%20Hesper">Ben Hesper</a> coined it in 1970 to refer to the study of information processes in biotic systems. This definition placed bioinformatics as a field parallel to <a href="biophysics">biophysics</a> (the study of physical processes in biological systems) or <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a> (the study of chemical processes in biological systems).

Computers became essential in molecular biology when <a href="protein%20sequences">protein sequences</a> became available after <a href="Frederick%20Sanger">Frederick Sanger</a> determined the sequence of <a href="insulin">insulin</a> in the early 1950s. Comparing multiple sequences manually turned out to be impractical. A pioneer in the field was <a href="Margaret%20Oakley%20Dayhoff">Margaret Oakley Dayhoff</a>, who has been hailed by <a href="David%20Lipman">David Lipman</a>, director of the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Biotechnology%20Information">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>, as the "mother and father of bioinformatics." Dayhoff compiled one of the first protein sequence databases, initially published as books and pioneered methods of sequence alignment and molecular evolution. Another early contributor to bioinformatics was <a href="Elvin%20A.%20Kabat">Elvin A. Kabat</a>, who pioneered biological sequence analysis in 1970 with his comprehensive volumes of antibody sequences released with Tai Te Wu between 1980 and 1991.

To study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, the biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data. This includes nucleotide and <a href="amino%20acid%20sequence">amino acid sequence</a>s, <a href="protein%20domain">protein domain</a>s, and <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a>s. The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as <a href="computational%20biology">computational biology</a>. Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include:


The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal. Examples include: <a href="pattern%20recognition">pattern recognition</a>, <a href="data%20mining">data mining</a>, <a href="machine%20learning">machine learning</a> algorithms, and <a href="Biological%20Data%20Visualization">visualization</a>. Major research efforts in the field include <a href="sequence%20alignment">sequence alignment</a>, <a href="gene%20finding">gene finding</a>, <a href="genome%20assembly">genome assembly</a>, <a href="drug%20design">drug design</a>, <a href="drug%20discovery">drug discovery</a>, <a href="protein%20structural%20alignment">protein structure alignment</a>, <a href="protein%20structure%20prediction">protein structure prediction</a>, prediction of <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> and <a href="protein%E2%80%93protein%20interactions">protein–protein interactions</a>, <a href="genome-wide%20association%20studies">genome-wide association studies</a>, the modeling of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> and <a href="Cellular%20model">cell division/mitosis.</a>

Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.

Over the past few decades, rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. Bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.

Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and protein sequences, aligning DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.

Bioinformatics is a science field that is similar to but distinct from <a href="biological%20computation">biological computation</a>, while it is often considered synonymous to <a href="computational%20biology">computational biology</a>. Biological computation uses <a href="bioengineering">bioengineering</a> and <a href="biology">biology</a> to build biological <a href="computer">computer</a>s, whereas bioinformatics uses computation to better understand biology. Bioinformatics and computational biology involve the analysis of biological data, particularly DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The field of bioinformatics experienced explosive growth starting in the mid-1990s, driven largely by the <a href="Human%20Genome%20Project">Human Genome Project</a> and by rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology.

Analyzing biological data to produce meaningful information involves writing and running software programs that use <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>s from <a href="graph%20theory">graph theory</a>, <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="soft%20computing">soft computing</a>, <a href="data%20mining">data mining</a>, <a href="image%20processing">image processing</a>, and <a href="computer%20simulation">computer simulation</a>. The algorithms in turn depend on theoretical foundations such as <a href="discrete%20mathematics">discrete mathematics</a>, <a href="control%20theory">control theory</a>, <a href="system%20theory">system theory</a>, <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, and <a href="statistics">statistics</a>.

Since the <a href="Phi%20X%20174">Phage Φ-X174</a> was <a href="sequencing">sequenced</a> in 1977, the <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases. This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode <a href="protein">protein</a>s, RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a <a href="species">species</a> or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species (the use of <a href="molecular%20systematics">molecular systematics</a> to construct <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">phylogenetic tree</a>s). With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. Today, <a href="computer%20program">computer program</a>s such as <a href="BLAST">BLAST</a> are used daily to search sequences from more than 260 000 organisms, containing over 190 billion <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s. These programs can compensate for mutations (exchanged, deleted or inserted bases) in the DNA sequence, to identify sequences that are related, but not identical. A variant of this <a href="sequence%20alignment">sequence alignment</a> is used in the sequencing process itself.

Before sequences can be analyzed they have to be obtained. <a href="DNA%20sequencing">DNA sequencing</a> is still a non-trivial problem as the raw data may be noisy or afflicted by weak signals. <a href="Algorithm">Algorithm</a>s have been developed for <a href="base%20calling">base calling</a> for the various experimental approaches to DNA sequencing.

Most DNA sequencing techniques produce short fragments of sequence that need to be assembled to obtain complete gene or genome sequences. The so-called <a href="shotgun%20sequencing">shotgun sequencing</a> technique (which was used, for example, by <a href="The%20Institute%20for%20Genomic%20Research">The Institute for Genomic Research</a> (TIGR) to sequence the first bacterial genome, "<a href="Haemophilus%20influenzae">Haemophilus influenzae</a>") generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments (ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long, depending on the sequencing technology). The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes. For a genome as large as the <a href="human%20genome">human genome</a>, it may take many days of CPU time on large-memory, multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments, and the resulting assembly usually contains numerous gaps that must be filled in later. Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today, and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research.

In the context of <a href="genomics">genomics</a>, <a href="Genome%20project%23Genome%20annotation">annotation</a> is the process of marking the genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence. This process needs to be automated because most genomes are too large to annotate by hand, not to mention the desire to annotate as many genomes as possible, as the rate of <a href="DNA%20sequencing">sequencing</a> has ceased to pose a bottleneck. Annotation is made possible by the fact that genes have recognisable start and stop regions, although the exact sequence found in these regions can vary between genes.

The first genome annotation software system was designed in 1995 by <a href="Owen%20White">Owen White</a>, who was part of the team at <a href="The%20Institute%20for%20Genomic%20Research">The Institute for Genomic Research</a> that sequenced and analyzed the first genome of a free-living organism to be decoded, the bacterium "<a href="Haemophilus%20influenzae">Haemophilus influenzae</a>". White built a software system to find the genes (fragments of genomic sequence that encode proteins), the transfer RNAs, and to make initial assignments of function to those genes. Most current genome annotation systems work similarly, but the programs available for analysis of genomic DNA, such as the <a href="GeneMark">GeneMark</a> program trained and used to find protein-coding genes in "<a href="Haemophilus%20influenzae">Haemophilus influenzae</a>", are constantly changing and improving.

Following the goals that the Human Genome Project left to achieve after its closure in 2003, a new project developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute in the U.S appeared. The so-called <a href="ENCODE">ENCODE</a> project is a collaborative data collection of the functional elements of the human genome that uses next-generation DNA-sequencing technologies and genomic tiling arrays, technologies able to generate automatically large amounts of data with lower research costs but with the same quality and viability.

<a href="Evolutionary%20biology">Evolutionary biology</a> is the study of the origin and descent of <a href="species">species</a>, as well as their change over time. <a href="Informatics%20%28academic%20field%29">Informatics</a> has assisted evolutionary biologists by enabling researchers to:
Future work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex <a href="Evolutionary%20tree">tree of life</a>.

The area of research within <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> that uses <a href="genetic%20algorithm">genetic algorithm</a>s is sometimes confused with computational evolutionary biology, but the two areas are not necessarily related.

The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between <a href="genes">genes</a> (<a href="Homology%20%28biology%29%23Orthology">orthology</a> analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion.
Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and <a href="endosymbiosis">endosymbiosis</a>, often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectra of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, <a href="heuristics">heuristics</a>, fixed parameter and <a href="approximation%20algorithms">approximation algorithms</a> for problems based on parsimony models to <a href="Markov%20Chain%20Monte%20Carlo">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a> algorithms for <a href="Bayesian%20analysis">Bayesian analysis</a> of problems based on probabilistic models.

Many of these studies are based on the <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homology</a> detection and protein families computation.

Pan genomics is a concept introduced in 2005 by Tettelin and Medini which eventually took root in bioinformatics. Pan genome is the complete gene repertoire of a particular taxonomic group: although initially applied to closely related strains of a species, it can be applied to a larger context like genus, phylum etc. It is divided in two parts- The Core genome: Set of genes common to all the genomes under study (These are often housekeeping genes vital for survival) and The Dispensable/Flexible Genome: Set of genes not present in all but one or some genomes under study.
a bioinformatics tool BPGA can be used to characterize the Pan Genome of bacterial species.

With the advent of next-generation sequencing we are obtaining enough sequence data to map the genes of complex diseases such as <a href="Diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes</a>, <a href="infertility">infertility</a>, <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a> or <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20Disease">Alzheimer's Disease</a>. Genome-wide association studies are a useful approach to pinpoint the mutations responsible for such complex diseases. Through these studies, thousands of DNA variants have been identified that are associated with similar diseases and traits. Furthermore, the possibility for genes to be used at prognosis, diagnosis or treatment is one of the most essential applications. Many studies are discussing both the promising ways to choose the genes to be used and the problems and pitfalls of using genes to predict disease presence or prognosis.

In <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown <a href="point%20mutation">point mutation</a>s in a variety of <a href="gene">gene</a>s in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of <a href="human%20genome">human genome</a> sequences and <a href="germline">germline</a> polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as <a href="oligonucleotide">oligonucleotide</a> microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called <a href="comparative%20genomic%20hybridization">comparative genomic hybridization</a>), and <a href="single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">single-nucleotide polymorphism</a> arrays to detect known "point mutations". These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate <a href="terabyte">terabyte</a>s of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or <a href="noise">noise</a>, and thus <a href="Hidden%20Markov%20model">Hidden Markov model</a> and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real <a href="copy%20number%20variation">copy number</a> changes.

With the breakthroughs that this next-generation sequencing technology is providing to the field of Bioinformatics, cancer genomics could drastically change. These new methods and software allow bioinformaticians to sequence many cancer genomes quickly and affordably. This could create a more flexible process for classifying types of cancer by analysis of cancer driven mutations in the genome. Furthermore, tracking of patients while the disease progresses may be possible in the future with the sequence of cancer samples.

Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of <a href="lesion">lesion</a>s found to be recurrent among many tumors.

The <a href="gene%20expression">expression</a> of many genes can be determined by measuring <a href="Messenger%20RNA">mRNA</a> levels with multiple techniques including <a href="DNA%20microarray">microarrays</a>, <a href="expressed%20sequence%20tag">expressed cDNA sequence tag</a> (EST) sequencing, <a href="serial%20analysis%20of%20gene%20expression">serial analysis of gene expression</a> (SAGE) tag sequencing, <a href="massively%20parallel%20signature%20sequencing">massively parallel signature sequencing</a> (MPSS), <a href="RNA-Seq">RNA-Seq</a>, also known as "Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing" (WTSS), or various applications of multiplexed in-situ hybridization. All of these techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the biological measurement, and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate <a href="signal%20%28information%20theory%29">signal</a> from <a href="noise">noise</a> in high-throughput gene expression studies. Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might compare microarray data from cancerous <a href="epithelial">epithelial</a> cells to data from non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells.

<a href="Protein%20microarray">Protein microarray</a>s and high throughput (HT) <a href="mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> (MS) can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample. Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and HT MS data; the former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple, but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected.

<a href="Regulation%20of%20gene%20expression">Regulation</a> is the complex orchestration of events by which a signal, potentially an extracellular signal such as a <a href="hormone">hormone</a>, eventually leads to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more <a href="protein">protein</a>s. Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process.

For example, gene expression can be regulated by nearby elements in the genome. Promoter analysis involves the identification and study of <a href="sequence%20motif">sequence motif</a>s in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA. <a href="Enhancer%20%28genetics%29">Enhancer</a> elements far away from the promoter can also regulate gene expression, through three-dimensional looping interactions. These interactions can be determined by bioinformatic analysis of <a href="chromosome%20conformation%20capture">chromosome conformation capture</a> experiments.

Expression data can be used to infer gene regulation: one might compare <a href="microarray">microarray</a> data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state. In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a>, along with various stress conditions (heat shock, starvation, etc.). One can then apply <a href="cluster%20analysis">clustering algorithms</a> to that expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed. For example, the upstream regions (promoters) of co-expressed genes can be searched for over-represented <a href="regulatory%20elements">regulatory elements</a>. Examples of clustering algorithms applied in gene clustering are <a href="k-means%20clustering">k-means clustering</a>, <a href="self-organizing%20map">self-organizing map</a>s (SOMs), <a href="hierarchical%20clustering">hierarchical clustering</a>, and <a href="consensus%20clustering">consensus clustering</a> methods.

Several approaches have been developed to analyze the location of organelles, genes, proteins, and other components within cells. This is relevant as the location of these components affects the events within a cell and thus helps us to predict the behavior of biological systems. A <a href="gene%20ontology">gene ontology</a> category, "cellular compartment", has been devised to capture subcellular localization in many <a href="biological%20database">biological database</a>s.

Microscopic pictures allow us to locate both <a href="organelle">organelle</a>s as well as molecules. It may also help us to distinguish between normal and abnormal cells, e.g. in <a href="cancer">cancer</a>.

The localization of proteins helps us to evaluate the role of a protein. For instance, if a protein is found in the <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a> it may be involved in <a href="Regulation%20of%20gene%20expression">gene regulation</a> or <a href="RNA%20splicing">splicing</a>. By contrast, if a protein is found in <a href="Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a>, it may be involved in <a href="Cellular%20respiration">respiration</a> or other <a href="Metabolism">metabolic processes</a>. Protein localization is thus an important component of <a href="protein%20function%20prediction">protein function prediction</a>. There are well developed <a href="protein%20subcellular%20localization%20prediction">protein subcellular localization prediction</a> resources available, including protein subcellualr location databases and prediction tools.

Data from high-throughput <a href="chromosome%20conformation%20capture">chromosome conformation capture</a> experiments, such as <a href="Hi-C%20%28experiment%29">Hi-C (experiment)</a> and <a href="ChIA-PET">ChIA-PET</a>, can provide information on the spatial proximity of DNA loci. Analysis of these experiments can determine the three-dimensional structure and <a href="nuclear%20organization">nuclear organization</a> of chromatin. Bioinformatic challenges in this field include partitioning the genome into domains, such as <a href="Topologically%20Associating%20Domain">Topologically Associating Domain</a>s (TADs), that are organised together in three-dimensional space.

Protein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics. The <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> sequence of a protein, the so-called <a href="primary%20structure">primary structure</a>, can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as the <a href="bovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy">bovine spongiform encephalopathy</a> – a.k.a. <a href="Mad%20Cow%20Disease">Mad Cow Disease</a> – <a href="prion">prion</a>.) Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. Structural information is usually classified as one of "<a href="secondary%20structure">secondary</a>", "<a href="tertiary%20structure">tertiary</a>" and "<a href="quaternary%20structure">quaternary</a>" structure. A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem. Most efforts have so far been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time.

One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of <a href="homology%20%28biology%29">homology</a>. In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene "A", whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene "B," whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share A's function. In the structural branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins. In a technique called homology modeling, this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably.

One example of this is the similar protein homology between hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes (<a href="leghemoglobin">leghemoglobin</a>). Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Though both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes.

Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and "de novo" (from scratch) physics-based modeling.

"Network analysis" seeks to understand the relationships within <a href="biological%20network">biological network</a>s such as <a href="Metabolic%20network">metabolic</a> or <a href="Interactome">protein–protein interaction networks</a>. Although biological networks can be constructed from a single type of molecule or entity (such as genes), network biology often attempts to integrate many different data types, such as proteins, small molecules, gene expression data, and others, which are all connected physically, functionally, or both.

"Systems biology" involves the use of <a href="computer%20simulation">computer simulation</a>s of <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cellular</a> subsystems (such as the <a href="metabolic%20network">networks of metabolites</a> and <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that comprise <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>, <a href="signal%20transduction">signal transduction</a> pathways and <a href="gene%20regulatory%20network">gene regulatory network</a>s) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. <a href="Artificial%20life">Artificial life</a> or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.

Tens of thousands of three-dimensional protein structures have been determined by <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> and <a href="protein%20nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance%20spectroscopy">protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a> (protein NMR) and a central question in structural bioinformatics is whether it is practical to predict possible protein–protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without performing <a href="protein%E2%80%93protein%20interaction">protein–protein interaction</a> experiments. A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the <a href="protein%E2%80%93protein%20docking">protein–protein docking</a> problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field.

Other interactions encountered in the field include Protein–ligand (including drug) and <a href="protein%E2%80%93peptide">protein–peptide</a>. Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>s, termed docking algorithms, for studying <a href="interactome">molecular interactions</a>.

The growth in the number of published literature makes it virtually impossible to read every paper, resulting in disjointed sub-fields of research. Literature analysis aims to employ computational and statistical linguistics to mine this growing library of text resources. For example:

The area of research draws from <a href="statistics">statistics</a> and <a href="computational%20linguistics">computational linguistics</a>.

Computational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content <a href="medical%20imaging">biomedical imagery</a>. Modern image analysis systems augment an observer's ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images, by improving <a href="accuracy">accuracy</a>, <a href="Objectivity%20%28science%29">objectivity</a>, or speed. A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer. Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both <a href="diagnostics">diagnostics</a> and research. Some examples are:

Computational techniques are used to analyse high-throughput, low-measurement single cell data, such as that obtained from <a href="flow%20cytometry">flow cytometry</a>. These methods typically involve finding populations of cells that are relevant to a particular disease state or experimental condition.

Biodiversity informatics deals with the collection and analysis of <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> data, such as <a href="taxonomic%20database">taxonomic database</a>s, or <a href="microbiome">microbiome</a> data. Examples of such analyses include <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetics</a>, <a href="niche%20modelling">niche modelling</a>, <a href="species%20richness">species richness</a> mapping, <a href="DNA%20barcoding">DNA barcoding</a>, or <a href="Speciesism">species</a> identification tools.

Databases are essential for bioinformatics research and applications. Many databases exist, covering various information types: for example, DNA and protein sequences, molecular structures, phenotypes and biodiversity. Databases may contain empirical data (obtained directly from experiments), predicted data (obtained from analysis), or, most commonly, both. They may be specific to a particular organism, pathway or molecule of interest. Alternatively, they can incorporate data compiled from multiple other databases. These databases vary in their format, access mechanism, and whether they are public or not.

Some of the most commonly used databases are listed below. For a more comprehensive list, please check the link at the beginning of the subsection.


<a href="Software">Software</a> tools for bioinformatics range from simple command-line tools, to more complex graphical programs and standalone web-services available from various <a href="List%20of%20bioinformatics%20companies">bioinformatics companies</a> or public institutions.

Many <a href="free%20and%20open-source%20software">free and open-source software</a> tools have existed and continued to grow since the 1980s. The combination of a continued need for new <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>s for the analysis of emerging types of biological readouts, the potential for innovative "<a href="in%20silico">in silico</a>" experiments, and freely available <a href="open%20code">open code</a> bases have helped to create opportunities for all research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics and the range of open-source software available, regardless of their funding arrangements. The open source tools often act as incubators of ideas, or community-supported <a href="Plug-in%20%28computing%29">plug-ins</a> in commercial applications. They may also provide "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" standards and shared object models for assisting with the challenge of bioinformation integration.

The <a href="List%20of%20open-source%20bioinformatics%20software">range of open-source software packages</a> includes titles such as <a href="Bioconductor">Bioconductor</a>, <a href="BioPerl">BioPerl</a>, <a href="Biopython">Biopython</a>, <a href="BioJava">BioJava</a>, <a href="BioJS">BioJS</a>, <a href="BioRuby">BioRuby</a>, <a href="Bioclipse">Bioclipse</a>, <a href="EMBOSS">EMBOSS</a>, <a href=".NET%20Bio">.NET Bio</a>, <a href="Orange%20%28software%29">Orange</a> with its bioinformatics add-on, <a href="Apache%20Taverna">Apache Taverna</a>, <a href="UGENE">UGENE</a> and <a href="GenoCAD">GenoCAD</a>. To maintain this tradition and create further opportunities, the non-profit <a href="Open%20Bioinformatics%20Foundation">Open Bioinformatics Foundation</a> have supported the annual <a href="Bioinformatics%20Open%20Source%20Conference">Bioinformatics Open Source Conference</a> (BOSC) since 2000.

An alternative method to build public bioinformatics databases is to use the MediaWiki engine with the <a href="https%3A//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension%3AWikiOpener">"WikiOpener"</a> extension. This system allows the database to be accessed and updated by all experts in the field.

<a href="SOAP">SOAP</a>- and <a href="REST">REST</a>-based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms, data and computing resources on servers in other parts of the world. The main advantages derive from the fact that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance overheads.

Basic bioinformatics services are classified by the <a href="European%20Bioinformatics%20Institute">EBI</a> into three categories: <a href="Sequence%20alignment%20software">SSS</a> (Sequence Search Services), <a href="Multiple%20sequence%20alignment">MSA</a> (Multiple Sequence Alignment), and <a href="Bioinformatics%23Sequence%20analysis">BSA</a> (Biological Sequence Analysis). The availability of these <a href="Service-orientation">service-oriented</a> bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web-based bioinformatics solutions, and range from a collection of standalone tools with a common data format under a single, standalone or web-based interface, to integrative, distributed and extensible <a href="bioinformatics%20workflow%20management%20systems">bioinformatics workflow management systems</a>.

A <a href="Bioinformatics%20workflow%20management%20systems">Bioinformatics workflow management system</a> is a specialized form of a <a href="workflow%20management%20system">workflow management system</a> designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a workflow, in a Bioinformatics application.

Brian De Palma

Brian Russell De Palma (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter. He is considered part of the <a href="New%20Hollywood">New Hollywood</a> wave of filmmaking.

In a career spanning over 50 years, he is best known for his <a href="suspense">suspense</a>, <a href="psychological%20thriller">psychological thriller</a>, and <a href="crime%20film">crime film</a>s. He directed successful and popular films such as the supernatural horror "<a href="Carrie%20%281976%20film%29">Carrie</a>", the erotic crime thriller "<a href="Dressed%20to%20Kill%20%281980%20film%29">Dressed to Kill</a>", the thriller "<a href="Blow%20Out">Blow Out</a>", the crime dramas "<a href="Scarface%20%281983%20film%29">Scarface</a>", "<a href="The%20Untouchables%20%28film%29">The Untouchables</a>", and "<a href="Carlito%27s%20Way">Carlito's Way</a>", and the action spy film "".

De Palma, who is of Italian ancestry, is the youngest of three boys and was born in <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a> to Vivienne (née Muti) and <a href="Anthony%20DePalma">Anthony Federico De Palma</a>, an <a href="orthopedic">orthopedic</a> surgeon. He was raised in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Pennsylvania and <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, and attended various <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> and <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quaker</a> schools, eventually graduating from <a href="Friends%27%20Central%20School">Friends' Central School</a>. When he was in high school, he built computers. He won a regional science-fair prize for a project titled "An <a href="Analog%20Computer">Analog Computer</a> to Solve Differential Equations".

Enrolled at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia</a> as a physics student, De Palma became enraptured with the filmmaking process after viewing "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>" and "<a href="Vertigo%20%28film%29">Vertigo</a>". De Palma subsequently enrolled at the newly coed <a href="Sarah%20Lawrence%20College">Sarah Lawrence College</a> as a graduate student in their theater department in the early 1960s, becoming one of the first male students among a female population. Once there, influences as various as drama teacher <a href="Wilford%20Leach">Wilford Leach</a>, the <a href="Albert%20and%20David%20Maysles">Maysles brothers</a>, <a href="Michelangelo%20Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>, <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>, <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, and <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> impressed upon De Palma the many styles and themes that would shape his own cinema in the coming decades.

An early association with a young <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a> resulted in "<a href="The%20Wedding%20Party%20%28film%29">The Wedding Party</a>". The film, which was co-directed with Leach and producer Cynthia Munroe, had been shot in 1963 but remained unreleased until 1969, when De Palma's star had risen sufficiently within the <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> filmmaking scene. De Niro was unknown at the time; the credits mistakenly display his name as "Robert ." The film is noteworthy for its invocation of silent film techniques and an insistence on the <a href="jump-cut">jump-cut</a> for effect. De Palma followed this style with various small films for the <a href="NAACP">NAACP</a> and The <a href="U.S.%20Treasury%20Department">Treasury Department</a>.

During the 1960s, De Palma began making a living producing documentary films, notably "The Responsive Eye", a 1966 movie about "<a href="The%20Responsive%20Eye">The Responsive Eye</a>" <a href="op-art">op-art</a> exhibit curated by William Seitz for <a href="MOMA">MOMA</a> in 1965. In an interview with Gelmis from 1969, De Palma described the film as "very good and very successful. It's distributed by Pathe Contemporary and makes lots of money. I shot it in four hours, with synched sound. I had two other guys shooting people's reactions to the paintings, and the paintings themselves."

"<a href="Dionysus%20%28film%29">Dionysus in 69</a>" (1969) was De Palma's other major documentary from this period. The film records <a href="The%20Performance%20Group">The Performance Group</a>'s performance of Euripides' <a href="The%20Bacchae">The Bacchae</a>, starring, amongst others, De Palma regular William Finley. The play is noted for breaking traditional barriers between performers and audience. The film's most striking quality is its extensive use of the <a href="Split%20screen%20%28video%20production%29">split-screen</a>. De Palma recalls that he was "floored" by this performance upon first sight, and in 1973 recounts how he "began to try and figure out a way to capture it on film. I came up with the idea of split-screen, to be able to show the actual audience involvement, to trace the life of the audience and that of the play as they merge in and out of each other."

De Palma's most significant features from this decade are "<a href="Greetings%20%281968%20film%29">Greetings</a>" (1968) and "<a href="Hi%2C%20Mom%21">Hi, Mom!</a>" (1970). Both films star Robert De Niro and espouse a <a href="Leftist">Leftist</a> <a href="revolutionary">revolutionary</a> viewpoint common to their era. "Greetings" was entered into the <a href="19th%20Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">19th Berlin International Film Festival</a>, where it won a <a href="Silver%20Bear">Silver Bear</a> award. His other major film from this period is the slasher comedy "<a href="Murder%20a%20la%20Mod">Murder a la Mod</a>". Each of these films contains experiments in narrative and <a href="intertextuality">intertextuality</a>, reflecting De Palma's stated intention to become the "American <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Godard</a>" while integrating several of the themes which permeated Hitchcock's work.

"Greetings" is about three New Yorkers dealing with the draft. The film is often considered the first to deal explicitly with the draft. The film is noteworthy for its use of various experimental techniques to convey its narrative in ultimately unconventional ways. Footage was sped up, rapid cutting was used to distance the audience from the narrative, and it was difficult to discern with whom the audience must ultimately align. "Greetings" ultimately grossed over $1 million at the box office and cemented De Palma's position as a bankable filmmaker.

After the success of his 1968 breakthrough, De Palma and his producing partner, Charles Hirsch, were given the opportunity by Sigma 3 to make an unofficial sequel of sorts, initially entitled "Son of Greetings", and subsequently released as "Hi, Mom!". While "Greetings" accentuated its varied cast, "Hi, Mom!" focuses on De Niro's character, Jon Rubin, an essential carry-over from the previous film. The film is ultimately significant insofar as it displays the first enunciation of De Palma's style in all its major traits – voyeurism, guilt, and a hyper-consciousness of the medium are all on full display, not just as hallmarks, but built into this formal, material apparatus itself.

These traits come to the fore in "Hi, Mom!"'s "<a href="Be%20Black%2C%20Baby">Be Black, Baby</a>" sequence. This sequence parodies <a href="cin%C3%A9ma%20v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9">cinéma vérité</a>, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of <a href="Brecht">Brecht</a>ian distanciation: "First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In "Hi, Mom!" for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware of what you are watching at the same time that you are emotionally involved with it."

"Be Black, Baby" was filmed in black and white stock on 16 mm, in low-light conditions that stress the crudity of the direct cinema aesthetic. It is precisely from this crudity that the film itself gains a credibility of "realism." In an interview with Michael Bliss, De Palma notes "[Be Black, Baby] was rehearsed for almost three weeks... In fact, it's all scripted. But once the thing starts, they just go with the way it's going. I specifically got a very good documentary camera filmmaker (Robert Elfstrom) to just shoot it like a documentary to follow the action." Furthermore, "I wanted to show in "Hi, Mom!" how you can really involve an audience. You take an absurd premise – "Be Black, Baby" – and totally involve them and really frighten them at the same time. It's very Brechtian. You suck 'em in and annihilate 'em. Then you say, "It's just a movie, right? It's not real." It's just like television. You're sucked in all the time, and you're being lied to in a very documentary-like setting. The "Be Black, Baby" section of "Hi, Mom!" is probably the most important piece of film I've ever done."

In the 1970s, De Palma went to Hollywood where he worked on bigger budget films. In 1970, De Palma left New York for Hollywood at age thirty to make "<a href="Get%20to%20Know%20Your%20Rabbit">Get to Know Your Rabbit</a>", starring Orson Welles and Tommy Smothers. Making the film was a crushing experience for De Palma, as Tommy Smothers did not like many of De Palma's ideas.

After several small, studio and independent released films that included stand-outs "<a href="Sisters%20%281973%20film%29">Sisters</a>", "<a href="Phantom%20of%20the%20Paradise">Phantom of the Paradise</a>", and "<a href="Obsession%20%281976%20film%29">Obsession</a>", a small film based on a novel called "Carrie" was released directed by Brian De Palma. The <a href="psychic">psychic</a> thriller "<a href="Carrie%20%281976%20film%29">Carrie</a>" is seen by some as De Palma's bid for a blockbuster. In fact, the project was small, underfunded by <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a>, and well under the cultural radar during the early months of production, as <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>'s source novel had yet to climb the bestseller list. De Palma gravitated toward the project and changed crucial plot elements based upon his own predilections, not the saleability of the novel. The cast was young and relatively new, though <a href="Sissy%20Spacek">Sissy Spacek</a> and <a href="John%20Travolta">John Travolta</a> had gained attention for previous work in, respectively, film and episodic <a href="situation%20comedy">sitcoms</a>. "Carrie" became a hit, the first genuine box-office success for De Palma. It garnered Spacek and <a href="Piper%20Laurie">Piper Laurie</a> Oscar nominations for their performances. Preproduction for the film had coincided with the casting process for <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a>'s "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>", and many of the actors cast in De Palma's film had been earmarked as contenders for Lucas's movie, and vice versa. The "shock ending" finale is effective even while it upholds horror-film convention, its suspense sequences are buttressed by teen comedy tropes, and its use of <a href="split%20screen%20%28film%29">split-screen</a>, split-diopter and <a href="slow%20motion">slow motion</a> shots tell the story visually rather than through dialogue.

The financial and critical success of "<a href="Carrie%20%281976%20film%29">Carrie</a>" allowed De Palma to pursue more personal material. "<a href="The%20Demolished%20Man">The Demolished Man</a>" was a novel that had fascinated De Palma since the late 1950s and appealed to his background in mathematics and <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> storytelling. Its unconventional unfolding of plot (exemplified in its mathematical layout of dialogue) and its stress on perception have analogs in De Palma's filmmaking. He sought to adapt it on numerous occasions, though the project would carry a substantial price tag, and has yet to appear onscreen (Steven Spielberg's adaptation of <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s "<a href="Minority%20Report%20%28film%29">Minority Report</a>" bears striking similarities to De Palma's visual style and some of the themes of "The Demolished Man"). The result of his experience with adapting "The Demolished Man" was "<a href="The%20Fury%20%281978%20film%29">The Fury</a>", a science fiction psychic thriller that starred <a href="Kirk%20Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>, <a href="Carrie%20Snodgress">Carrie Snodgress</a>, <a href="John%20Cassavetes">John Cassavetes</a> and <a href="Amy%20Irving">Amy Irving</a>. The film was admired by <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>, who featured a clip in his mammoth <a href="Histoire%28s%29%20du%20cin%C3%A9ma">Histoire(s) du cinéma</a>, and <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> who championed both "The Fury" and De Palma. The film boasted a larger budget than "<a href="Carrie%20%281976%20film%29">Carrie</a>", though the consensus view at the time was that De Palma was repeating himself, with diminishing returns. As a film it retains De Palma's considerable visual flair, but points more toward his work in mainstream entertainments such as "<a href="The%20Untouchables%20%281987%20film%29">The Untouchables</a>" and "", the thematic complex thrillers for which he is now better known.

For many film-goers, De Palma's gangster films, most notably "<a href="Scarface%20%281983%20film%29">Scarface</a>" and "<a href="Carlito%27s%20Way">Carlito's Way</a>", pushed the envelope of on-screen violence and depravity, and yet greatly vary from one another in both style and content and also illustrate De Palma's evolution as a film-maker. In essence, the excesses of "Scarface" contrast with the more emotional tragedy of "Carlito's Way". Both films feature Al Pacino in what has become a fruitful working relationship. In 1984, he directed the music video of Bruce Springsteen's song "<a href="Dancing%20in%20the%20Dark%20%28Bruce%20Springsteen%20song%29">Dancing in the Dark</a>". The 1980s were denoted by De Palma's other films "<a href="Dressed%20to%20Kill%20%281980%20film%29">Dressed To Kill</a>", "<a href="Blow%20Out">Blow Out</a>", and "<a href="Body%20Double">Body Double</a>".

Later into the 1990s and 2000s, De Palma did other films. He attempted to do dramas and a few thrillers plus science fiction. Some of these movies ("Mission: Impossible", "Carlito's Way") worked and some others ("Raising Cain", "Mission to Mars") failed at the box office. However, "<a href="The%20Bonfire%20of%20the%20Vanities%20%28film%29">The Bonfire of the Vanities</a>" would be De Palma's biggest box office disaster, losing millions. 

A more political controversy erupted in a later movie from De Palma, "<a href="Redacted%20%28film%29">Redacted</a>" (2007), which had the subject of American involvement in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, including the committing of war atrocities there. It received limited release in the United States and grossed less than $1 million.

In 2012, his film "<a href="Passion%20%282012%20film%29">Passion</a>" was selected to compete for the <a href="Golden%20Lion">Golden Lion</a> at the <a href="69th%20Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">69th Venice International Film Festival</a>. In 2015, he was the subject of a documentary film, "<a href="De%20Palma%20%28film%29">De Palma</a>".

De Palma's films can fall into two categories, his <a href="psychological%20thriller">psychological thriller</a>s ("Sisters", "Body Double", "Obsession", "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out", "Raising Cain") and his mainly commercial films ("Scarface", "The Untouchables", "Carlito's Way", and "Mission: Impossible"). He has often produced "De Palma" films one after the other before going on to direct a different genre, but would always return to his familiar territory. Because of the subject matter and <a href="graphic%20violence">graphic violence</a> of some of De Palma's films, such as "Dressed to Kill", "Scarface" and "Body Double", they are often at the center of controversy with the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">Motion Picture Association of America</a>, <a href="Film%20criticism">film critics</a> and the viewing public.

De Palma is known for quoting and referencing other directors' work throughout his career. <a href="Michelangelo%20Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>'s "<a href="Blowup">Blowup</a>" and <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>'s "<a href="The%20Conversation">The Conversation</a>" plots were used for the basis of "Blow Out". "The Untouchables" finale shoot out in the train station is a clear borrow from the <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a> Steps sequence in <a href="Sergei%20Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>'s "<a href="The%20Battleship%20Potemkin">The Battleship Potemkin</a>". The main plot from "<a href="Rear%20Window">Rear Window</a>" was used for "Body Double", while it also used elements of "<a href="Vertigo%20%28film%29">Vertigo</a>". "Vertigo" was also the basis for "Obsession". "Dressed to Kill" was a note-for-note homage to Hitchcock's "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>", including such moments as the surprise death of the lead actress and the exposition scene by the psychiatrist at the end.

Film critics have often noted De Palma's penchant for unusual camera angles and compositions throughout his career. He often frames characters against the background using a <a href="Dutch%20angle">canted angle shot</a>. <a href="split%20screen%20%28film%29">Split-screen</a> techniques have been used to show two separate events happening simultaneously. To emphasize the dramatic impact of a certain scene De Palma has employed a <a href="Circle">360-degree</a> camera <a href="Panning%20%28camera%29">pan</a>. Slow sweeping, panning and <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a>s are often used throughout his films, often through precisely-choreographed <a href="long%20take">long take</a>s lasting for minutes without cutting. Split focus shots, often referred to as "di-opt", are used by De Palma to emphasize the foreground person/object while simultaneously keeping a background person/object in focus. Slow-motion is frequently used in his films to increase suspense.

De Palma is often cited as a leading member of the <a href="New%20Hollywood">New Hollywood</a> generation of film directors, a distinct pedigree who either emerged from film schools or are overtly cine-literate. His contemporaries include <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, <a href="Paul%20Schrader">Paul Schrader</a>, <a href="John%20Milius">John Milius</a>, <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a>, <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, <a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>, and <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>. His artistry in directing and use of cinematography and suspense in several of his films has often been compared to the work of <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>. Psychologists have been intrigued by De Palma's fascination with pathology, by the aberrant behavior aroused in characters who find themselves manipulated by others.

De Palma has encouraged and fostered the filmmaking careers of directors such as <a href="Mark%20Romanek">Mark Romanek</a> and <a href="Keith%20Gordon">Keith Gordon</a>. During an interview with De Palma, Tarantino said that "<a href="Blow%20Out">Blow Out</a>" is one of his all-time favorite films, and that after watching "<a href="Scarface%20%281983%20film%29">Scarface</a>" he knew how to make his own film. <a href="Terrence%20Malick">Terrence Malick</a> credits seeing De Palma's early films on college campus tours as a validation of <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a>, and subsequently switched his attention from philosophy to filmmaking. Other filmmakers influenced by De Palma include <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>, <a href="Ronny%20Yu">Ronny Yu</a>, <a href="Don%20Mancini">Don Mancini</a>, <a href="Nacho%20Vigalondo">Nacho Vigalondo</a>, and <a href="Jack%20Thomas%20Smith">Jack Thomas Smith</a>.

Critics who frequently admire De Palma's work include <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, among others. Kael wrote in her review of "<a href="Blow%20Out">Blow Out</a>", "At forty, Brian De Palma has more than twenty years of moviemaking behind him, and he has been growing better and better. Each time a new film of his opens, everything he has done before seems to have been preparation for it." In his review of "<a href="Femme%20Fatale%20%282002%20film%29">Femme Fatale</a>", <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote about the director: "De Palma deserves more honor as a director. Consider also these titles: "Sisters", "Blow Out", "The Fury", "Dressed to Kill", "Carrie", "Scarface", "Wise Guys", "Casualties of War", "Carlito's Way", "Mission: Impossible". Yes, there are a few failures along the way ("Snake Eyes", "Mission to Mars", "The Bonfire of the Vanities"), but look at the range here, and reflect that these movies contain treasure for those who admire the craft as well as the story, who sense the glee with which De Palma manipulates images and characters for the simple joy of being good at it. It's not just that he sometimes works in the style of Hitchcock, but that he has the nerve to."

<a href="Julie%20Salamon">Julie Salamon</a> has written that De Palma has been accused of being "a perverse misogynist" by critics. De Palma has responded to accusations of misogyny by saying: "I'm always attacked for having an erotic, sexist approach---chopping up women, putting women in peril. I'm making suspense movies! What else is going to happen to them?"

David Thomson wrote in his entry for De Palma, "There is a self-conscious cunning in De Palma's work, ready to control everything except his own cruelty and indifference."

North American B-25 Mitchell

The North American B-25 Mitchell is an American twin-engine, <a href="medium%20bomber">medium bomber</a> manufactured by <a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American Aviation</a> (NAA).

The design was named in honor of <a href="Billy%20Mitchell">Major General William "Billy" Mitchell</a>, a pioneer of U.S. military aviation. Used by many <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> air forces, the B-25 served in every theater of World War II and after the war ended many remained in service, operating across four decades. Produced in numerous variants, nearly 10,000 Mitchells rolled from NAA factories. These included a few limited models, such as the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>' PBJ-1 <a href="Maritime%20patrol%20aircraft">patrol bomber</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>' F-10 <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> and AT-24 trainers.

The Air Corps issued a circular (Number 38-385) in March 1938 describing the performance they required from the next bombers — a payload of with a range of at more than . Those performance specifications led NAA to submit their NA-40 design. The NA-40 had benefited from the <a href="North%20American%20XB-21">North American XB-21</a> (NA-39) of 1936, which was the company's partly successful design for an earlier medium bomber that had been initially accepted and ordered, but then cancelled. However, the company's experience from the XB-21 contributed to the design and development of the NA-40. The single NA-40 built flew first at the end of January 1939. It went through several modifications to correct problems. These improvements included fitting <a href="Wright%20R-2600">Wright R-2600</a> "Twin Cyclone" <a href="radial%20engine">radial engine</a>s, in March 1939, which solved the lack of power.

In March 1939, North American delivered the substantially redesigned and improved NA-40 (as NA-40B) to the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a> for evaluation. It was in competition with other manufacturers' designs (Douglas 7B, <a href="Stearman%20X-100">Stearman X-100</a>, and the <a href="Martin%20Model%20167F">Martin Model 167F</a>) but failed to win orders. The aircraft was originally intended to be an attack bomber for export to the United Kingdom and France, both of which had a pressing requirement for such aircraft in the early stages of World War II. However, the French had already opted for a revised <a href="Douglas%20Aircraft%20Company">Douglas</a> 7B (as the DB-7). Unfortunately, the NA-40B was destroyed in a <a href="List%20of%20accidents%20and%20incidents%20involving%20military%20aircraft%20%281935%E2%80%931939%29%231939">crash on 11 April 1939</a> while undergoing testing. Although the crash was not considered due to a fault with the aircraft design, the Army ordered the DB-7 as the <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">A-20</a>.

The Air Corps issued a specification for a medium bomber in March 1939: over at NAA used the NA-40B design to develop the NA-62, which competed for the medium bomber contract. There was no YB-25 for prototype service tests. In September 1939, the Air Corps ordered the NA-62 into production as the B-25, along with the other new Air Corps medium bomber, the <a href="Martin%20B-26%20Marauder">Martin B-26 Marauder</a> "off the drawing board".

Early into B-25 production, NAA incorporated a significant redesign to the wing dihedral. The first nine aircraft had a constant-<a href="dihedral%20%28aircraft%29">dihedral</a>, meaning the wing had a consistent, upward angle from the fuselage to the wingtip. This design caused stability problems. "Flattening" the outer wing panels by giving them a slight anhedral angle just outboard of the engine nacelles nullified the problem, and gave the B-25 its <a href="gull%20wing">gull wing</a> configuration. Less noticeable changes during this period included an increase in the size of the tail fins and a decrease in their inward tilt at their tops.

NAA continued design and development in 1940 and 1941. Both the B-25A and B-25B series entered USAAF service. The B-25B was operational in 1942. Combat requirements lead to further developments. Before the year was over, NAA was producing the B-25C and B-25D series at different plants. Also in 1942, the manufacturer began design work on the cannon-armed B-25G series. The NA-100 of 1943 and 1944 was an interim armament development at the Kansas City complex known as the B-25D2. Similar armament upgrades by U.S-based commercial modification centers involved about half of the B-25G series. Further development led to the B-25H, B-25J, and B-25J2. The gunship design concept dates to late 1942 and NAA sent a field technical representative to the SWPA. The factory-produced B-25G entered production during the NA-96 order followed by the redesigned B-25H gunship. The B-25J reverted to the bomber role, but it, too, could be outfitted as a strafer.

NAA manufactured the greatest number of aircraft in World War II, the first time a company had produced trainers, bombers, and fighters simultaneously (the AT-6/SNJ Texan, B-25 Mitchell, and the P-51 Mustang). It produced B-25s at both its Inglewood main plant and an additional 6,608 aircraft at its <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Kansas">Kansas City, Kansas</a> plant at <a href="Fairfax%20Airport">Fairfax Airport</a>.

After the war, the USAF placed a contract for the TB-25L trainer in 1952. This was a modification program by Hayes of <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>. Its primary role was reciprocal engine pilot training.

A development of the B-25 was the <a href="North%20American%20XB-28%20Dragon">North American XB-28</a>, designed as a high-altitude bomber. Two prototypes were built with the second prototype, the XB-28A, evaluated as a photo-reconnaissance platform, but the aircraft did not enter production.

The majority of B-25s in American service were used in <a href="Pacific%20War">the war against Japan in Asia and the Pacific</a>. The Mitchell fought from the Northern Pacific to the South Pacific and the Far East. These areas included the campaigns in the Aleutian Islands, <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, the Solomon Islands, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, China, Burma and the <a href="island%20hopping%20campaign">island hopping campaign</a> in the Central Pacific. The aircraft's potential as a ground-<a href="attack%20aircraft">attack aircraft</a> emerged during the Pacific war. The jungle environment reduced the usefulness of medium-level bombing, and made low-level attack the best tactic. Using similar mast height level tactics and skip bombing, the B-25 proved itself to be a capable anti-shipping weapon and sank many enemy sea vessels of various types. An ever-increasing number of forward firing guns made the B-25 a formidable strafing aircraft for island warfare. The strafer versions were the B-25C1/D1, the B-25J1 and with the NAA strafer nose, the J2 sub-series.

In Burma, the B-25 was often used to attack Japanese communication links, especially bridges in central Burma. It also helped supply the <a href="Battle%20of%20Imphal">besieged troops at Imphal</a> in 1944. The China Air Task Force, the Chinese American Composite Wing, the First Air Commando Group, the 341st Bomb Group, and eventually, the relocated 12th Bomb Group, all operated the B-25 in the <a href="China%20Burma%20India%20Theater">China Burma India Theater</a> (CBI). Many of these missions involved battle field isolation, interdiction and close air support.

Later in the war, as the USAAF acquired bases in other parts of the Pacific, the Mitchell could strike targets in <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>, <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a> and <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, increasing the usefulness of the B-25. It was also used in some of the shortest raids of the Pacific War, striking from <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a> against <a href="Guam">Guam</a> and <a href="Tinian">Tinian</a>. The 41st Bomb Group used it against Japanese-occupied islands that had been bypassed by the main campaign, such as happened in the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a>.

The first B-25s arrived in Egypt and were carrying out independent operations by October 1942. Operations there against Axis airfields and motorized vehicle columns supported the ground actions of the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>. Thereafter, the aircraft took part in the rest of the <a href="North%20Africa%20campaign">campaign in North Africa</a>, the <a href="invasion%20of%20Sicily">invasion of Sicily</a> and the <a href="Italian%20campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">advance up Italy</a>. In the Strait of Messina to the Aegean Sea the B-25 conducted sea sweeps as part of the coastal air forces. In Italy, the B-25 was used in the <a href="ground%20attack">ground attack</a> role, concentrating on attacks against road and rail links in Italy, Austria and the Balkans. The B-25 had a longer range than the <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">Douglas A-20 Havoc</a> and <a href="Douglas%20A-26%20Invader">Douglas A-26 Invader</a>s, allowing it to reach further into occupied Europe. The five bombardment groups – 20 squadrons – of the Ninth and Twelfth Air Forces that used the B-25 in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Theater%20of%20Operations">Mediterranean Theater of Operations</a> were the only U.S. units to employ the B-25 in Europe.

The RAF received nearly 900 Mitchells, using them to replace <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">Douglas Bostons</a>, <a href="Lockheed%20Ventura">Lockheed Ventura</a>s and <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> bombers. The Mitchell entered active RAF service on 22 January 1943. At first, it was used to bomb targets in occupied Europe. After the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">Normandy</a> invasion, the RAF and France used Mitchells in support of the Allies in Europe. Several squadrons moved to forward airbases on the continent. The USAAF did not use the B-25 in combat in the ETO.

The B-25B first gained fame as the bomber used in the 18 April 1942 <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a>, in which 16 B-25Bs led by <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Doolittle">Jimmy Doolittle</a> attacked mainland Japan, four months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The mission gave a much-needed lift in spirits to the Americans, and alarmed the Japanese, who had believed their home islands to be inviolable by enemy forces. Although the amount of actual damage done was relatively minor, it forced the Japanese to divert troops for home defense for the remainder of the war.

The raiders took off from the carrier and successfully bombed Tokyo and four other Japanese cities without loss. Fifteen of the bombers subsequently crash-landed en route to recovery fields in eastern China. These losses were the result of the task force being spotted by a Japanese vessel, forcing the bombers to take off early, fuel exhaustion, stormy nighttime conditions with zero visibility, and lack of electronic homing aids at the recovery bases. Only one B-25 bomber landed intact, in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> where its five-man crew was interned and the aircraft confiscated. Of the 80 aircrew, 69 survived their historic mission and eventually made it back to American lines.

Following a number of additional modifications, including the addition of <a href="Plexiglas">Plexiglas</a> dome for navigational sightings to replace the overhead window for the navigator and heavier nose armament, <a href="De-ice">de-icing</a> and anti-icing equipment, the B-25C entered USAAF operations. Through block 20 the B-25C and B-25D differed only in location of manufacture: C series at <a href="Inglewood%2C%20California">Inglewood, California</a>; D series at <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Kansas">Kansas City, Kansas</a>. After block 20 some NA-96 began the transition to the G series while some NA-87 acquired interim modifications eventually produced as the B-25D2 and ordered as the NA-100. NAA built a total of 3,915 B-25Cs and Ds during World War II.

Although the B-25 was originally designed to bomb from medium altitudes in level flight, it was used frequently in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Southwest Pacific theatre</a> in treetop-level <a href="strafing">strafing</a> and missions with parachute-retarded fragmentation bombs against Japanese airfields in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and the Philippines. These heavily armed Mitchells were field-modified at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Australia, under the direction of Major <a href="Paul%20I.%20%26quot%3BPappy%26quot%3B%20Gunn">Paul I. "Pappy" Gunn</a> and North American tech rep Jack Fox, These "commerce destroyers" were also used on strafing and <a href="skip%20bombing">skip bombing</a> missions against Japanese shipping trying to resupply their armies.

Under the leadership of <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George%20C.%20Kenney">George C. Kenney</a>, Mitchells of the Far East Air Forces and its existing components, the <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth</a> and <a href="Thirteenth%20Air%20Force">Thirteenth Air Force</a>s devastated Japanese targets in the Southwest Pacific Theater during 1944 to 1945. The USAAF played a significant role in pushing the Japanese back to their home islands. The type operated with great effect in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">Central Pacific</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Aleutian%20Islands">Alaska</a>, <a href="North%20African%20campaign">North Africa</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> and <a href="South-East%20Asian%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">China-Burma-India</a> (CBI) theaters.

The USAAF Antisubmarine Command made great use of the B-25 in 1942 and 1943. Some of the earliest B-25 Bomb Groups also flew the Mitchell on coastal patrols after the Pearl Harbor attack, prior to the AAFAC organization. Many of the two dozen or so Antisubmarine Squadrons flew the B-25C, D and G series in the American Theater Antisubmarine campaign, often in the distinctive, white sea search camouflage.

In anti-shipping operations, the USAAF had urgent need for hard-hitting aircraft, and North American responded with the B-25G. In this series the transparent nose and bombardier/navigator position was changed for a shorter, hatched nose with two fixed .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns and a <a href="75%20mm%20Gun%20M2/M3/M6">75 mm (2.95 in) M4 cannon</a>, one of the largest weapons fitted to an aircraft, similar to the British <a href="Ordnance%20QF%206-pounder">57 mm gun</a>-armed <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">Mosquito Mk. XVIII</a> and the German <a href="Henschel%20Hs%20129">Henschel Hs 129</a>B-3, and <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Ju 88P</a> heavy cannon (up to a 75 mm long-barrel "Bordkanone BK 7,5"). The shorter nose placed the cannon breech behind the pilot where it could be manually loaded and serviced by the navigator; his crew station was moved to just behind the pilot. The navigator signalled the pilot when the gun was ready and the pilot fired the weapon using a button on his control wheel.

The Royal Air Force, U.S. Navy and the Soviet VVS each conducted trials with this series but none adopted it. The G series comprised one prototype, five pre-production C conversions, 58 C series modifications and 400 production aircraft for a total of 464 B-25G. In its final version, the G-12, an interim armament modification, eliminated the lower Bendix turret and added a starboard dual gun pack, waist guns and a canopy for the tail gunner to improve the view when firing the single tail gun. In April 1945 the air depots in Hawaii refurbished about two dozen of these and included the eight gun nose and rocket launchers in the upgrade.

The B-25H series continued the development of the gunship concept. NAA Inglewood produced 1000. The H had even more firepower. Most replaced the M4 gun with the lighter <a href="75%20mm%20gun%20%28US%29%23T13E1%20/%20M5">T13E1</a>, designed specifically for the aircraft but 20-odd H-1 block aircraft completed by the <a href="Republic%20Aviation">Republic Aviation</a> modification center at Evansville had the M4 and two machine gun nose armament. The 75 mm (2.95 in) gun fired at a muzzle velocity of . Due to its low rate of fire (about four rounds could be fired in a single <a href="strafing">strafing</a> run), relative ineffectiveness against ground targets, and the substantial recoil, the 75 mm gun was sometimes removed from both G and H models and replaced with two additional .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns as a field modification. In the new FEAF these were re-designated the G1 and H1 series respectively.

The H series normally came from the factory mounting four fixed, forward-firing .50  (12.7 mm) machine guns in the nose; four more fixed guns in forward-firing, individual gun packages; two more in the manned dorsal turret, re-located forward to a position just behind the cockpit; one each in a pair of new waist positions, introduced simultaneously with the forward-relocated dorsal turret; and lastly, a pair of guns in a new tail gunner's position. Company promotional material bragged that the B-25H could "bring to bear 10 machine guns coming and four going, in addition to the 75 mm cannon, eight <a href="unguided%20rocket">rockets</a> and 3,000 lb (1,360 kg) of bombs."

The H had a modified cockpit with single flight controls operated by pilot. The co-pilot's station and controls were deleted, and instead had a smaller seat used by the navigator/cannoneer, The radio operator crew position was aft the bomb bay with access to the waist guns. Factory production total were 405 B-25Gs and 1,000 B-25Hs, with 248 of the latter being used by the Navy as PBJ-1H. Elimination of the co-pilot saved weight, moving the dorsal turret forward counterbalanced in part the waist guns and the manned rear turret.
Following the two gunship series NAA again produced the medium bomber configuration with the B-25J series.. It optimized the mix of the interim NA-100 and the H series having both the bombardier's station and fixed guns of the D and the forward turret and refined armament of the H series. NAA also produced a strafer nose first shipped to air depots as kits, then introduced on the production line in alternating blocks with the bombardier nose. The solid-metal "strafer" nose housed eight centerline Browning M2 .50 calibre machine guns. The remainder of the armament was as in the H-5. NAA also supplied kits to mount eight underwing 5 "high velocity airborne rockets" (HVAR) just outside the propeller arcs. These were mounted on zero length launch rails, four to a wing.

The final, and the most built, series of the Mitchell, the B-25J, looked less like earlier series apart from the well-glazed bombardier's nose of nearly-identical appearance to the earliest B-25 subtypes. Instead, the J followed the overall configuration of the H series from the cockpit aft. It had the forward dorsal turret and other armament and airframe advancements. All J models included four .50 in (12.7 mm) light-barrel Browning AN/M2 guns in a pair of "fuselage package", conformal <a href="gun%20pod">gun pod</a>s each flanking the lower cockpit, each pod containing two <a href="Browning%20M2">Browning M2</a>s. By 1945, however, combat squadrons removed these. The J series restored the co-pilot's seat and dual flight controls. The factory made available kits to the Air Depot system to create the strafer-nose B-25J-2. This configuration carried a total of 18 .50 in (12.7 mm) light-barrel AN/M2 Browning M2 machine guns: eight in the nose, four in the flank-mount conformal gun pod packages, two in the dorsal turret, one each in the pair of waist positions, and a pair in the tail – with 14 of the guns either aimed directly forward, or aimed to fire directly forward for strafing missions. Some aircraft had eight <a href="5-Inch%20Forward%20Firing%20Aircraft%20Rocket">5 in (130 mm) high-velocity aircraft rockets (HVAR)</a>. NAA introduced the J-2 into production in alternating blocks at the J-22. Total J series production was 4,318.

The B-25 was a safe and forgiving aircraft to fly. With one engine out, 60° banking turns into the dead engine were possible, and control could be easily maintained down to 145 mph (230 km/h). The pilot had to remember to maintain engine-out directional control at low speeds after takeoff with rudder; if this maneuver was attempted with ailerons, the aircraft could snap out of control. The tricycle landing gear made for excellent visibility while taxiing. The only significant complaint about the B-25 was the extremely high noise level produced by its engines; as a result, many pilots eventually suffered from varying degrees of <a href="hearing%20loss">hearing loss</a>.

The high noise level was due to design and space restrictions in the engine cowlings which resulted in the exhaust "stacks" protruding directly from the cowling ring and partly covered by a small triangular fairing. This arrangement directed exhaust and noise directly at the pilot and crew compartments.

The Mitchell was an exceptionally sturdy aircraft that could withstand tremendous punishment. One B-25C of the <a href="321st%20Bombardment%20Group">321st Bomb Group</a> was nicknamed "Patches" because its crew chief painted all the aircraft's <a href="flak">flak</a> hole patches with the bright yellow <a href="zinc%20chromate">zinc chromate</a> <a href="Primer%20%28paint%29">primer</a>. By the end of the war, this aircraft had completed over 300 missions, had been belly-landed six times and had over 400 patched holes. The airframe of "Patches" was so distorted from battle damage that straight-and-level flight required 8° of left <a href="aileron">aileron</a> trim and 6° of right rudder, causing the aircraft to "crab" sideways across the sky.

In 1947 legislation created an independent <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> and by that time the B-25 inventory numbered only a few hundred. Some B-25s continued in service into the 1950s in a variety of training, reconnaissance and support roles. The principal use during this period was undergraduate training of multi-engine aircraft pilots slated for reciprocating engine or turboprop cargo, aerial refuelling or reconnaissance aircraft. Others were assigned to units of the <a href="Air%20National%20Guard">Air National Guard</a> in training roles in support of <a href="Northrop%20F-89%20Scorpion">Northrop F-89 Scorpion</a> and <a href="Lockheed%20F-94%20Starfire">Lockheed F-94 Starfire</a> operations. 

In its USAF tenure, many B-25s received the so-called "Hayes modification" and as a result, surviving B-25 often have exhaust system with a semi-collector ring that splits emissions into two different systems. The upper seven cylinders are collected by a ring while the other cylinders remain directed to individual ports.

TB-25J-25-NC Mitchell, "44-30854", the last B-25 in the USAF inventory, assigned at <a href="March%20AFB">March AFB</a>, California as of March 1960, was flown to <a href="Eglin%20AFB">Eglin AFB</a>, Florida, from <a href="Turner%20Air%20Force%20Base">Turner Air Force Base</a>, Georgia, on 21 May 1960, the last flight by a USAF B-25, and presented by Brigadier General A. J. Russell, Commander of <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">SAC</a>'s <a href="822d%20Air%20Division">822d Air Division</a> at Turner AFB, to the Air Proving Ground Center Commander, Brigadier General Robert H. Warren, who in turn presented the bomber to <a href="Valparaiso%2C%20Florida">Valparaiso, Florida</a> Mayor Randall Roberts on behalf of the Niceville-Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce. Four of the original <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Tokyo Raiders</a> were present for the ceremony, Colonel (later Major General) <a href="David%20M.%20Jones">David Jones</a>, Colonel Jack Simms, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Manske, and retired Master Sergeant Edwin W. Horton. It was donated back to the <a href="Air%20Force%20Armament%20Museum">Air Force Armament Museum</a> c. 1974 and marked as Doolittle's "40-2344".

The U.S. Navy designation for the Mitchell was the PBJ-1 and apart from increased use of radar, it was configured like its Army Air Forces counterparts. Under the pre-1962 USN/USMC/USCG aircraft designation system, PBJ-1 stood for Patrol (P) Bomber (B) built by North American Aviation (J), first variant (-1) under the <a href="1922%20United%20States%20Navy%20aircraft%20designation%20system">existing American naval aircraft designation system of the era</a>. The PBJ had its origin in an inter-service agreement of mid-1942 between the Navy and the USAAF exchanging the Boeing Renton plant for the Kansas plant for <a href="B-29%20Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> production. The <a href="Boeing%20XPBB%20Sea%20Ranger">Boeing XPBB Sea Ranger</a> flying boat, competing for B-29 engines, was cancelled in exchange for part of the Kansas City Mitchell production. Other terms included the inter-service transfer of 50 B-25C and 152 B-25D to the Navy. The bombers carried Navy <a href="bureau%20number">bureau number</a>s (BuNos), beginning with BuNo 34998. The first PBJ-1 arrived in February 1943 and nearly all reached Marine Corps squadrons, beginning with Marine Bombing Squadron 413 (VMB-413). Following the AAFAC format, the Marine Mitchells had search <a href="radar">radar</a> in a retractable radome replacing the remotely-operated ventral turret. Later D and J series had nose mounted APS-3 radar; and later still, J and H series mounted radar in the starboard wingtip. The large quantities of B-25H and J series became known as PBJ-1H and PBJ-1J respectively. These aircraft often operated along with earlier PBJ series in Marine squadrons.

The PBJs were operated almost exclusively by the Marine Corps as land-based bombers. To operate them, the <a href="U.S.%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> established a number of Marine bomber squadrons (VMB), beginning with VMB-413, in March 1943 at <a href="MCAS%20Cherry%20Point">MCAS Cherry Point</a>, North Carolina. Eight VMB squadrons were flying PBJs by the end of 1943, forming the initial Marine medium bombardment group. Four more squadrons were in the process of formation in late 1945, but had not yet deployed by the time the war ended.

Operational use of the Marine Corps PBJ-1s began in March 1944. The Marine PBJs operated from the Philippines, Saipan, <a href="Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a> and <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> during the last few months of the Pacific war. Their primary mission was the long range <a href="interdiction">interdiction</a> of enemy shipping trying to run the blockade which was strangling Japan. The weapon of choice during these missions was usually the five-inch HVAR rocket, eight of which could be carried. Some VMB-612 intruder PBJ-1D and J series flew without top turrets to save weight and increase range on night patrols, especially towards the end of the war when air superiority existed.

During the war the Navy tested the cannon-armed G series and conducted carrier trial with an H equipped with arresting gear. After World War II, some PBJs stationed at the Navy's then-rocket laboratory site in <a href="Inyokern%2C%20California">Inyokern, California</a>, site of the present-day <a href="Naval%20Air%20Weapons%20Station%20China%20Lake">Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake</a>, tested various air-to-ground rockets and arrangements. One arrangement was a twin-barrel nose arrangement that could fire 10 spin-stabilized five-inch rockets in one salvo.

The <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) was an early customer for the B-25 via <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a>. The first Mitchells were given the service name Mitchell I by the RAF and were delivered in August 1941, to No. 111 Operational Training Unit based in <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a>. These bombers were used exclusively for training and familiarization and never achieved operational status. The B-25Cs and Ds were designated Mitchell II. Altogether, 167 B-25Cs and 371 B-25Ds were delivered to the RAF. The RAF tested the cannon-armed G series but did not adopt the series nor the follow on H series.

By the end of 1942 the RAF had taken delivery of a total of 93 Mitchell marks I and II. Some served with squadrons of <a href="No.%202%20Group%20RAF">No. 2 Group RAF</a>, the RAF's tactical medium bomber force. The first RAF operation with the Mitchell II took place on 22 January 1943, when six aircraft from <a href="No.%20180%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 180 Squadron RAF</a> attacked oil installations at <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>. After the invasion of Europe (by which point 2 Group was part of <a href="Second%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Second Tactical Air Force</a>), all four Mitchell squadrons moved to bases in France and Belgium (Melsbroek) to support Allied ground forces. The British Mitchell squadrons were joined by <a href="No.%20342%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 342 (Lorraine) Squadron</a> of the <a href="French%20Air%20Force">French Air Force</a> in April 1945.

As part of its move from Bomber Command, <a href="No.%20305%20Polish%20Bomber%20Squadron">No 305 (Polish) Squadron</a> flew Mitchell IIs from September to December 1943 before converting to the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a>. In addition to No. 2 Group, the B-25 was used by various second-line RAF units in the UK and abroad. In the Far East, No. 3 PRU, which consisted of <a href="No.%20681%20Squadron%20RAF">Nos. 681</a> and 684 Squadrons, flew the Mitchell (primarily Mk IIs) on photographic reconnaissance sorties.

The RAF was allocated 316 B-25J which entered service as the Mitchell III. Deliveries took place between August 1944 and August 1945. However, only about 240 of these bombers actually reached Britain, with some being diverted to No. 111 <a href="Operational%20training%20unit">OTU</a> in the Bahamas, some crashing during delivery and some being retained in the United States.

The <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> (RCAF) used the B-25 Mitchell for training during the war. Post-war use saw continued operations with most of 162 Mitchells received. The first B-25s had originally been diverted to Canada from RAF orders. These included one Mitchell I, 42 Mitchell IIs, and 19 Mitchell IIIs. No 13 (P) Squadron was formed unofficially at <a href="Ottawa/Rockcliffe%20Airport">RCAF Rockcliffe</a> in May 1944 and used Mitchell IIs on high-altitude aerial photography sorties. No. 5 OTU (Operational Training Unit) at Boundary Bay, British Columbia and Abbotsford, British Columbia, operated the B-25D Mitchell in the training role together with B-24 Liberators for Heavy Conversion as part of the BCATP. The RCAF retained the Mitchell until October 1963.

No 418 (Auxiliary) Squadron received its first Mitchell IIs in January 1947. It was followed by No 406 (auxiliary), which flew Mitchell IIs and IIIs from April 1947 to June 1958. No 418 Operated a mix of IIs and IIIs until March 1958. No 12 Squadron of Air Transport Command also flew Mitchell IIIs along with other types from September 1956 to November 1960. In 1951, the RCAF received an additional 75 B-25Js from USAF stocks to make up for attrition and to equip various second-line units.

The Australians received Mitchells by the spring of 1944. The joint Australian-Dutch <a href="No.%2018%20%28Netherlands%20East%20Indies%29%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF</a> had more than enough Mitchells for one squadron, so the surplus went to re-equip the RAAF's <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>, replacing their Beauforts.

During World War II, the Mitchell served in fairly large numbers with the Air Force of the Dutch government-in-exile. They participated in combat in the East Indies as well as on the European front. On 30 June 1941, the Netherlands Purchasing Commission, acting on behalf of the Dutch government-in-exile in London, signed a contract with North American Aviation for 162 B-25C aircraft. The bombers were to be delivered to the <a href="Netherlands%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a> to help deter any Japanese aggression into the region.

In February 1942, the <a href="British%20Overseas%20Airways%20Corporation">British Overseas Airways Corporation</a> (BOAC) agreed to ferry 20 Dutch B-25s from Florida to Australia travelling via Africa and India, and an additional ten via the South Pacific route from California. During March, five of the bombers on the Dutch order had reached <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, India and 12 had reached Archerfield in Australia. It was agreed that the B-25s in Australia would be used as the nucleus of a new squadron, designated No. 18. This squadron was staffed jointly by Australian and Dutch aircrews plus a smattering of aircrews from other nations, and operated under Royal Australian Air Force command for the remainder of the war.

The B-25s of No. 18 Squadron were painted with the Dutch national insignia (at this time a rectangular Netherlands flag) and carried NEIAF serials. Discounting the ten "temporary" B-25s delivered to 18 Squadron in early 1942, a total of 150 Mitchells were taken on strength by the NEIAF, 19 in 1942, 16 in 1943, 87 in 1944, and 28 in 1945. They flew bombing raids against Japanese targets in the East Indies. In 1944, the more capable B-25J Mitchell replaced most of the earlier C and D models.

In June 1940, <a href="No.%20320%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 320 Squadron RAF</a> had been formed from personnel formerly serving with the <a href="Netherlands%20Naval%20Aviation%20Service">Royal Dutch Naval Air Service</a> who had escaped to England after the German occupation of the Netherlands. Equipped with various British aircraft, No. 320 Squadron flew anti-submarine patrols, convoy escort missions, and performed air-sea rescue duties. They acquired the Mitchell II in September 1943, performing operations over Europe against gun emplacements, railway yards, bridges, troops and other tactical targets. They moved to Belgium in October 1944, and transitioned to the Mitchell III in 1945. No. 320 Squadron was disbanded in August 1945. Following the war, B-25s were used by Dutch forces during the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>.

The U.S. supplied 862 B-25s (B, D, G, and J types) to the Soviet Union under <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> during World War II via the Alaska–Siberia <a href="ALSIB">ALSIB</a> ferry route.

Other damaged aircraft arrived or crashed in the Far East of Russia, and one Doolittle Raid aircraft landed there short of fuel after attacking Japan. The lone airworthy aircraft to reach the Soviet Union was lost in a hangar fire in the early 50s while undergoing routine maintenance. In general, the B-25 was operated as a ground-support and tactical daylight bomber (as similar Douglas A-20 Havocs were used). It saw action in fights from Stalingrad (with B/D models) to the German surrender during May 1945 (with G/J types).

B-25s that remained in Soviet Air Force service after the war were assigned the <a href="NATO%20reporting%20name">NATO reporting name</a> "Bank".

Well over 100 B-25Cs and Ds were supplied to the Nationalist Chinese during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>. In addition, a total of 131 B-25Js were supplied to China under Lend-Lease.

The four squadrons of the 1st BG (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th) of the 1st Medium Bomber Group were formed during the war. They formerly operated Russian-built <a href="Tupolev%20SB">Tupolev SB</a> bombers, then transferred to the B-25. The 1st BG was under the command of CACW (Chinese-American Composite Wing) while operating B-25s. Following the end of the war in the Pacific, these four bombardment squadrons were established to fight against the Communist insurgency that was rapidly spreading throughout the country. During the <a href="Chinese%20Civil%20War">Chinese Civil War</a>, Chinese Mitchells fought alongside de Havilland Mosquitos.

In December 1948, the Nationalists were forced to retreat to the island of Taiwan, taking many of their Mitchells with them. However, some B-25s were left behind and were pressed into service with the air force of the new People's Republic of China.

During the war, the Força Aérea Brasileira (<a href="Brazilian%20Air%20Force">FAB</a>) received a few B-25s under Lend-Lease. Brazil declared war against the Axis powers in August 1942 and participated in the war against the U-boats in the southern Atlantic. The last Brazilian B-25 was finally declared surplus in 1970.

The Royal Air Force issued at least 21 Mitchell IIIs to No 342 Squadron, which was made up primarily of Free French aircrews. Following the liberation of France, this squadron transferred to the newly formed <a href="French%20Air%20Force">French Air Force</a> ("Armée de l'Air") as GB I/20 Lorraine. The aircraft continued in operation after the war, with some being converted into fast VIP transports. They were struck off charge in June 1947.




Most models of the B-25 were used at some point as training aircraft.




Many B-25s are currently kept in airworthy condition by air museums and collectors.


At 9:40 on Saturday, 28 July 1945, a USAAF B-25D crashed in thick fog into the north side of the <a href="Empire%20State%20Building">Empire State Building</a> between the 79th and 80th floors. Fourteen people died — 11 in the building and the three occupants of the aircraft, including the pilot, Colonel William F. Smith. Betty Lou Oliver, an elevator attendant, survived the impact and the subsequent fall of the elevator cage 75 stories to the basement.

Sir Robert Charlton <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (born 11 October 1937) is an English former <a href="association%20football">football</a> player, regarded as one of the greatest <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a>s of all time, and an essential member of the England team who won the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> in 1966, the year he also won the <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or">Ballon d'Or</a>. He played almost all of his club football at <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, where he became renowned for his attacking instincts and passing abilities from midfield and his ferocious long-range shot. He was also well known for his fitness and stamina. He was cautioned only twice in his career; once against Argentina in the 1966 World Cup, and once in a league match against Chelsea. His elder brother <a href="Jack%20Charlton">Jack</a>, who was also in the World Cup-winning team, is a former <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">defender</a> for <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> and international manager.

Born in <a href="Ashington">Ashington</a>, <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, Charlton made his debut for the Manchester United first-team in 1956, and over the next two seasons gained a regular place in the team, during which time he survived the <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a> of 1958 after being rescued by <a href="Harry%20Gregg">Harry Gregg</a>. After helping United to win <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> in 1965, he won a <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> medal with <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> in 1966 and another Football League title with United the following year. In 1968, he captained the Manchester United team that won the <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Cup</a>, scoring two goals in the final to help his team be the first English side to win the competition. He is United's second all-time leading goal scorer (249), being surpassed by Wayne Rooney, and held the distinction of being England's all-time top goal scorer (49) from May 1968 to September 2015, when again Wayne Rooney surpassed his record. Charlton held the record for most appearances for Manchester United (758), before being surpassed by <a href="Ryan%20Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> in the <a href="2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2008 UEFA Champions League Final</a>.

He was selected for four World Cups (<a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958</a>, <a href="1962%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1962</a>, <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966</a> and <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1970</a>), and helped England to win the competition in <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">1966</a>. At the time of his retirement from the England team in 1970, he was the nation's most capped player, having turned out 106 times at the highest level. This record has since been held by <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a> and <a href="Peter%20Shilton">Peter Shilton</a>.

He left Manchester United to become manager of <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> for the 1973–74 season. He changed to player-manager the following season. He next accepted a post as a director with <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>, then became a member of Manchester United's board of directors in 1984 and remains one as of the 2017–18 season.

Charlton is related to several professional footballers on his mother's side of the family: his uncles were <a href="Jack%20Milburn%20%28footballer%20born%201908%29">Jack Milburn</a> (Leeds United and Bradford City), <a href="George%20Milburn">George Milburn</a> (Leeds United and Chesterfield), <a href="Jim%20Milburn">Jim Milburn</a> (Leeds United and Bradford City) and <a href="Stanley%20Milburn">Stan Milburn</a> (Chesterfield, Leicester City and Rochdale), and legendary Newcastle United and England footballer <a href="Jackie%20Milburn">Jackie Milburn</a>, was his mother's cousin. However, Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie. His elder brother, <a href="Jack%20Charlton">Jack</a>, initially went to work applying to the <a href="police">Police Service</a> before also becoming a professional footballer with Leeds United.

On 9 February 1953, then a Bedlington Grammar School pupil, Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> chief scout <a href="Joe%20Armstrong%20%28football%20scout%29">Joe Armstrong</a>. Charlton went on to play for <a href="English%20Schools%27%20Football%20Association">England Schoolboys</a> and the 15-year-old signed with United on 1 January 1953, along with <a href="Wilf%20McGuinness">Wilf McGuinness</a>, also aged 15. Initially his mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career, so he began an <a href="apprenticeship">apprenticeship</a> as an electrical engineer; however, he went on to turn professional in October 1954.

Charlton became one of the famed <a href="Busby%20Babes">Busby Babes</a>, the collection of talented footballers who emerged through the system at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long-term plan of rebuilding the club after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. He worked his way through the pecking order of teams, scoring regularly for the youth and reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> in October 1956. At the same time, he was doing his <a href="National%20service">National service</a> with the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Ordnance%20Corps">Royal Army Ordnance Corps</a> in <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>, where Busby had advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for Manchester United at the weekend. Also doing his army service in Shrewsbury at the same time was his United team-mate <a href="Duncan%20Edwards">Duncan Edwards</a>.

Charlton played 14 times for United in that first season, scoring twice on his debut and managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions, and including a hat-trick in a 5–1 away win over <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> in the February. United won the <a href="list%20of%20English%20football%20champions">league championship</a> but were denied the 20th century's first "double" when they controversially lost the <a href="1957%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1957 FA Cup Final</a> to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game, which saw United goalkeeper <a href="Ray%20Wood">Ray Wood</a> carried off with a broken <a href="cheek">cheek</a>bone after a clash with Villa centre forward <a href="Peter%20McParland">Peter McParland</a>. Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before substitutes, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was teammate <a href="Jackie%20Blanchflower">Jackie Blanchflower</a> who ended up between the posts.

Charlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully underway, which saw United, as current League champions, become the first English team to compete in the <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Cup</a>. Previously, <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> had scorned the competition, but United made progress, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to holders <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. Their reputation was further enhanced the next season as they reached the quarter finals to play <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a>. In the first leg at home, United won 2–1. The return in <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3–0 ahead, although the hosts came back to earn a 3–3 draw. However, United maintained their <a href="aggregate%20score">aggregate</a> lead to reach the last four and were in jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home, thinking of an important League game against <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a> at the weekend.

The aeroplane which took the United players and staff home from <a href="Zemun">Zemun Airport</a> needed to stop in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> to refuel. This was carried out in worsening weather, and by the time the refuelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re-board the aircraft, the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport. There were two aborted take-offs which led to concern on board, and the passengers were advised by a stewardess to disembark again while a minor technical error was fixed.

The team was back in the airport terminal barely ten minutes when the call to reconvene on the plane came, and a number of passengers began to feel nervous. Charlton and teammate <a href="Dennis%20Viollet">Dennis Viollet</a> swapped places with <a href="Tommy%20Taylor">Tommy Taylor</a> and <a href="David%20Pegg">David Pegg</a>, who had decided they would be safer at the back of the plane.

The plane clipped the fence at the end of the runway on its next take-off attempt and a wing tore through a nearby house, setting it alight. The wing and part of the tail came off and hit a tree and a wooden hut, the plane spinning along the snow until coming to a halt. It had been cut in half.

Charlton, strapped into his seat, had fallen out of the cabin and when United goalkeeper <a href="Harry%20Gregg">Harry Gregg</a> (who had somehow got through a hole in the plane unscathed and begun a one-man rescue mission) found him, he thought he was dead. That said, he grabbed both Charlton and Viollet by their trouser waistbands and dragged them away from the plane in constant fear that it would explode. Gregg returned to the plane to try to help the appallingly injured Busby and Blanchflower, and when he turned around again, he was relieved to see that Charlton and Viollet, both of whom he had presumed to be dead, had got out of their detached seats and were looking into the wreckage.

Charlton suffered cuts to his head and severe <a href="shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a> and was in hospital for a week. Seven of his teammates had perished at the scene, including Taylor and Pegg, with whom he and Viollet had swapped seats prior to the fatal take-off attempt. Club captain <a href="Roger%20Byrne">Roger Byrne</a> was also killed, along with <a href="Mark%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201933%29">Mark Jones</a>, <a href="Liam%20Whelan">Billy Whelan</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Colman">Eddie Colman</a> and <a href="Geoff%20Bent">Geoff Bent</a>. <a href="Duncan%20Edwards">Duncan Edwards</a> died a fortnight later from the injuries he had sustained. In total, the crash claimed 23 lives. Initially, ice on the wings was blamed, but a later inquiry declared that <a href="slush">slush</a> on the runway had made a safe take-off almost impossible.

Of the 44 passengers and crew (including the 17-strong Manchester United squad), 23 people (eight of them Manchester United players) died as a result of their injuries in the crash. Charlton survived with minor injuries. Of the eight other players who survived, two of them were injured so badly that they never played again.

Charlton was the first injured survivor to leave hospital. <a href="Harry%20Gregg">Harry Gregg</a> and <a href="Bill%20Foulkes">Bill Foulkes</a> were not hospitalized since they escaped uninjured. He arrived back in England on 14 February 1958, eight days after the crash. As he convalesced with family in Ashington, he spent some time kicking a ball around with local youths, and a famous photograph of him was taken. He was still only 20 years old, yet now there was an expectation that he would help with the rebuilding of the club as Busby's aides tried to piece together what remained of the season.

Charlton returned to playing in an <a href="FA%20cup">FA cup</a> tie against West Bromwich Albion on 1 March; the game was a draw and United won the replay 1–0. Not unexpectedly, United went out of the European Cup to <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> in the semi-finals to a 5–2 aggregate defeat and fell behind in the League. Yet somehow they reached their second consecutive FA Cup final, and the big day at Wembley coincided with Busby's return to work. However, his words could not inspire a side which was playing on a nation's goodwill and sentiment, and <a href="Nat%20Lofthouse">Nat Lofthouse</a> scored twice to give <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> a 2–0 win.

Further success with Manchester United came at last when they beat <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> 3–1 in the FA Cup final of 1963, with Charlton finally earning a winners' medal in his third final. Busby's post-Munich rebuilding programme continued to progress with two League championships within three seasons, with United taking the title in 1965 and 1967. A successful (though trophyless) season with Manchester United had seen him take the honours of "<a href="Football%20Writers%27%20Association">Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year</a>" and "<a href="Ballon%20d%27Or">European Footballer of the Year</a>" into the competition.

In 1968, Manchester United reached the <a href="1968%20European%20Cup%20Final">European Cup final</a>, ten seasons after Munich. Even though other clubs had taken part in the competition in the intervening decade, the team which got to this final was still the first English side to do so. On a highly emotional night at Wembley, Charlton scored twice in a 4–1 win after extra time against <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> and, as United captain, lifted the trophy.

During the early 1970s, Manchester United were no longer competing among the top teams in <a href="Football%20in%20England">England</a>, and at several stages were battling against relegation. At times, Charlton was not on speaking terms with United's other superstars <a href="George%20Best">George Best</a> and <a href="Denis%20Law">Denis Law</a>, and Best refused to play in Charlton's testimonial match against <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>, saying that "to do so would be hypocritical". Charlton left Manchester United at the end of the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1972–73</a> season, having scored 249 goals and set a club record of 758 appearances, a record which <a href="Ryan%20Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> broke in the <a href="2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2008 UEFA Champions League Final</a>.

His last game was against <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a> on 28 April 1973, and before the game the BBC cameras for "<a href="Match%20of%20the%20Day">Match of the Day</a>" captured the Chelsea chairman handing Charlton a commemorative cigarette case. The match ended in a 1-0 defeat. His final goal came a month earlier, on 31 March, in a 2-0 win at <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>, also in the First Division.

He was the subject of "<a href="This%20Is%20Your%20Life%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">This Is Your Life</a>" in 1969 when he was surprised by <a href="Eamonn%20Andrews">Eamonn Andrews</a> at The Sportsman's Club in central London.

Charlton's emergence as the country's leading young football talent was completed when he was called up to join the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> squad for a <a href="British%20Home%20Championship">British Home Championship</a> game against <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> at <a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a> on 19 April 1958, just over two months after he had survived the Munich air disaster.

Charlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4–0, with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger <a href="Tom%20Finney">Tom Finney</a>. He scored both goals in his second game as England beat <a href="Portugal%20national%20football%20team">Portugal</a> 2–1 in a friendly at Wembley; and overcame obvious nerves on a return to <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> to play his third match against <a href="Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team">Yugoslavia</a>. England lost that game 5–0 and Charlton played poorly.

He was selected for the squad which competed at the <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958 World Cup</a> in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, but did not kick a ball, something at which critics expressed surprise and bewilderment, even allowing for his lacklustre performance in Belgrade.

In 1959 he scored a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> as England demolished the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">US</a> 8–1; and his second England hat-trick came in 1961 in an 8–0 thrashing of <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a>. He also managed to score in every <a href="British%20Home%20Championship">British Home Championship</a> tournament he played in except <a href="1963%20British%20Home%20Championship">1963</a> in an association with the tournament that lasted from 1958 to 1970 and included 16 goals and 10 tournament victories (five shared).

He played in qualifiers for the <a href="1962%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1962 World Cup</a> in <a href="Chile">Chile</a> against <a href="Luxembourg%20national%20football%20team">Luxembourg</a> and Portugal and was named in the squad for the finals themselves. His goal in the 3–1 group win over <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a> was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances, and he was still only 24 years old, but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team, which was eliminated in the quarter final by <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a>, who went on to win the tournament.

By now, England were coached by <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> who had managed to gain sole control of the recruitment and team selection procedure from the <a href="committee">committee</a>-based call-up system which had lasted up to the previous World Cup. Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection – it was well known that decorum on the pitch at club level had been just as big a factor in playing for England as ability and form. Luckily for Charlton, he had all three.
A hat-trick in the 8–1 rout of <a href="Switzerland%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a> in June 1963 took Charlton's England goal tally to 30, equalling the <a href="Progression%20of%20England%20association%20football%20goalscoring%20record">record</a> jointly held by <a href="Tom%20Finney">Tom Finney</a> and <a href="Nat%20Lofthouse">Nat Lofthouse</a> and Charlton's 31st goal against <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a> in October the same year gave him the record alone.

Charlton's role was developing from traditional inside-forward to what today would be termed an attacking midfield player, with Ramsey planning to build the team for the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a> around him. When England beat the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">USA</a> 10-0 in a friendly on 27 May 1964, he scored one goal, his 33rd at senior level for England.

His goals became a little less frequent, and indeed <a href="Jimmy%20Greaves">Jimmy Greaves</a>, playing purely as a striker, would overtake Charlton's England tally in October 1964. Nevertheless, he was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start, he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers.

England drew the opening game of the tournament 0–0 with Uruguay, and Charlton scored the first goal in the 2–0 win over Mexico. This was followed by an identical scoreline against <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>, allowing England to qualify for the quarter finals.

England defeated Argentina 1–0 – the game was the only international match in which Charlton received a caution – and faced Portugal in the semi finals. This turned out to be one of Charlton's most important games for England.

Charlton opened the scoring with a crisp side-footed finish after a run by <a href="Roger%20Hunt">Roger Hunt</a> had forced the Portuguese goalkeeper out of his net; his second was a sweetly struck shot after a run and pull-back from <a href="Geoff%20Hurst">Geoff Hurst</a>. Charlton and Hunt were now England's joint-highest scorers in the tournament with three each, and a final against <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a> beckoned.

The final turned out to be one of Charlton's quieter days; he and a young <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a> effectively marked each other out of the game. England won 4–2 after extra time.

Charlton's next England game was his 75th as England beat <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland</a>; 2 caps later and he had become England's second most-capped player, behind the veteran <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a>, who was approaching his 100th appearance when Charlton was starting out and ended with 105 caps.

Weeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against <a href="Sweden%20national%20football%20team">Sweden</a>, breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by <a href="Jimmy%20Greaves">Jimmy Greaves</a>. He was then in the England team which made it to the semi-finals of the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201968">1968 European Championships</a> where they were knocked out by Yugoslavia in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. During the match Charlton struck a Yugoslav post. England defeated the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team">Soviet Union</a> 2–0 in the third place match.

In 1969, Charlton was appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a> for services to football. More milestones followed as he won his 100th England cap on 21 April 1970 against Northern Ireland, and was made captain by Ramsey for the occasion. Inevitably, he scored. This was his 48th goal for his country – his 49th and final goal would follow a month later in a 4–0 win over <a href="Colombia%20national%20football%20team">Colombia</a> during a warm-up tour for the <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1970 World Cup</a>, designed to get the players adapted to altitude conditions. Charlton's inevitable selection by Ramsey for the tournament made him the first – and still, to date, only – England player to feature in four World Cup squads.

Shortly before the World Cup Charlton was involved in the <a href="Bogot%C3%A1%20Bracelet">Bogotá Bracelet</a> incident in which he and Bobby Moore were accused of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery store. Moore was later arrested and detained for four days before being granted a conditional release, while Charlton was not arrested.

England began the tournament with two victories in the group stages, plus a memorable defeat against Brazil. Charlton played in all three, though was substituted for <a href="Alan%20Ball%2C%20Jr.">Alan Ball</a> in the final game of the group against <a href="Czechoslovakia%20national%20football%20team">Czechoslovakia</a>. Ramsey, confident of victory and progress to the quarter final, wanted Charlton to rest.

England duly reached the last eight where they again faced West Germany. Charlton controlled the midfield and suppressed <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a>'s runs from deep as England coasted to a 2–0 lead. Beckenbauer pulled a goal back for the Germans and Ramsey replaced the ageing and tired Charlton with <a href="Colin%20Bell">Colin Bell</a> who further tested the German keeper <a href="Sepp%20Maier">Maier</a> and also provided a great cross for <a href="Geoff%20Hurst">Geoff Hurst</a> who uncharacteristically squandered the chance. West Germany, who had a habit of coming back from behind, eventually scored twice – a back header from <a href="Uwe%20Seeler">Uwe Seeler</a> made it 2–2. In extra-time, Geoff Hurst had a goal mysteriously ruled out after which <a href="Gerd%20M%C3%BCller">Gerd Müller</a>'s goal won the match 3–2. England were out and, after a record 106 caps and 49 goals, Charlton decided to end his international career at the age of 32. On the flight home from Mexico, he asked Ramsey not to consider him again. His brother Jack, two years his senior but 71 caps his junior, did likewise.

Despite popular opinion the substitution did not change the game as Franz Beckenbauer had scored before Charlton left the field, hence Charlton had failed to cancel out the German. Charlton himself conceded that the substitution did not affect the game in a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary. His <a href="Progression%20of%20England%20association%20football%20caps%20record">caps record</a> lasted until 1973 when <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a> overtook him, and Charlton currently lies seventh in the all-time England appearances list behind Moore, <a href="Wayne%20Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a>, <a href="Ashley%20Cole">Ashley Cole</a>, <a href="Steven%20Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>, <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a> and <a href="Peter%20Shilton">Peter Shilton</a>, whose own England career began in the first game after Charlton's had ended. Charlton's goalscoring record was surpassed by Wayne Rooney on 8 September 2015, when Rooney scored a <a href="penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a> in a 2–0 win over Switzerland in a qualifying match for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202016">UEFA Euro 2016</a>.

Charlton became the manager of <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> in 1973, signing his former United and England team-mate <a href="Nobby%20Stiles">Nobby Stiles</a> as player-coach. His first season ended in relegation and although he began playing again he left Preston early in the 1975–76 season after a disagreement with the board over the transfer of <a href="John%20Bird%20%28footballer%29">John Bird</a> to <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. He was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> that year and began a casual association with <a href="BBC">BBC</a> for punditry on matches, which continued for many years. In early 1976, he scored once in three league appearances for <a href="Waterford%20United%20F.C.">Waterford United</a>.

He joined <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> as a director, and was briefly caretaker manager there in 1983. He then spent some time playing in South Africa. He also built up several businesses in areas such as travel, jewellery and hampers, and ran soccer schools in the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and China. In 1984, he was invited to become member of the <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of directors</a> at Manchester United, partly because of his football knowledge and partly because it was felt that the club needed a "name" on the board after the resignation of <a href="Matt%20Busby">Sir Matt Busby</a>. He remains a director of Manchester United as of 2014 and his continued presence was a factor in placating many fans opposed to the club's takeover by <a href="Malcolm%20Glazer">Malcolm Glazer</a>.

He met his wife, Norma Ball, at an <a href="ice%20rink">ice rink</a> in Manchester in 1959 and they married in 1961. They have two daughters – <a href="Suzanne%20Charlton">Suzanne</a> and Andrea. Suzanne was a weather forecaster for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> during the 1990s. They now have grandchildren, including Suzanne's son Robert, who is named in honour of his grandfather.

In 2007, while publicising his forthcoming autobiography, Charlton revealed that he had a long-running feud with his brother, <a href="Jack%20Charlton">Jack</a>. They have rarely spoken since a falling-out between his wife Norma and his mother Cissie (who died on 25 March 1996 at the age of 83). Charlton did not see his mother after 1992 as a result of the feud.

Jack presented him with his <a href="BBC%20Sports%20Personality%20of%20the%20Year%20Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award</a> on 14 December 2008. He said that he was 'knocked out' as he was presented the award by his brother. He received a standing ovation as he stood waiting for his prize.

Barry Lyndon

Barry Lyndon is a 1975 British-American <a href="Period%20film">period</a> <a href="drama%20film">drama film</a> written, produced, and directed by <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, based on the 1844 novel "<a href="The%20Luck%20of%20Barry%20Lyndon">The Luck of Barry Lyndon</a>" by <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>. It stars <a href="Ryan%20O%27Neal">Ryan O'Neal</a>, <a href="Marisa%20Berenson">Marisa Berenson</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Magee%20%28actor%29">Patrick Magee</a>, and <a href="Hardy%20Kr%C3%BCger">Hardy Krüger</a>. The film recounts the exploits of a fictional 18th-century Irish adventurer. Exteriors were shot on location in Ireland, England and Germany. 

At the 1975 <a href="48th%20Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>, the film won four Oscars in production categories. Although having had a modest commercial success and a mixed reception from critics on release, "Barry Lyndon" is today regarded as one of Kubrick's finest films. In numerous polls, including those of "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" (1999), "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" (2002, 2012), <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time"</a> (2005) and <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, it has been named one of the greatest films ever made.

An <a href="Omniscient%20narrator">omniscient</a> (though possibly <a href="Unreliable%20narrator">unreliable</a>) narrator relates that in 1750s Ireland, the father of Redmond Barry is killed in a <a href="duel">duel</a> over a sale of some horses. The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.

As a despondent young man, Barry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady. Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay. Nora and her family plan to leverage their finances through marriage, while Barry holds Quin in contempt and escalates the situation until a fateful duel beside a river when Barry shoots Quin. In the aftermath, Barry is urged to flee from incoming police and head through the countryside towards <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, but along the way he is robbed of purse, pistol, and horse by <a href="James%20Freney">Captain Feeney</a>, an infamous <a href="highwayman">highwayman</a>.

Dejected, Barry carries on to the next town, where he hears a promotional spiel to join the British Army, offering the chance at fame and glory (and a lifelong pension) in return for good service. Barry enlists. Some time after joining the regiment, Barry encounters Captain Grogan, a warm-hearted family friend. Grogan informs him that Barry did not in fact kill Quin, his dueling pistol having only been loaded with <a href="tow">tow</a>. The duel was staged by Nora's family to be rid of Barry so that their finances would be secured through a lucrative marriage.

Barry’s regiment is sent to Germany to fight in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, where Captain Grogan is fatally wounded by the French in a skirmish at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Minden">Battle of Minden</a>. Fed up with the war, Barry deserts the army, stealing an officer courier's uniform, horse, and identification papers. En route to neutral Holland he encounters the Prussian Captain Potzdorf, who, seeing through his disguise, offers him the choice of being turned back over to the British where he will be shot as a deserter, or enlisting in the <a href="Prussian%20Army">Prussian Army</a>. Barry enlists in his second army and later receives a special commendation from <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a> for saving Potzdorf's life in a battle.

Two years later, after the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by Captain Potzdorf's uncle in the Prussian Ministry of Police to become the servant of the Chevalier de Balibari, an expatriate Irishman and professional gambler. The Prussians suspect he is a spy and send Barry as an undercover agent to verify this. Barry reveals himself to the Chevalier right away and they become confederates at the card table, where Barry and his fine eyesight relay information to his partner. After he and the Chevalier cheat the Prince of Tübingen at the card table, the Prince accuses the Chevalier (without proof) and refuses to pay his debt and demands satisfaction. When Barry relays this to his Prussian handlers, they (still suspecting that the Chevalier is a spy) are wary of allowing another meeting between the Chevalier and the Prince. So, the Prussians arrange for the Chevalier to be expelled from the country. Barry conveys this plan to the Chevalier, who flees in the night. The next morning, Barry, under disguise as the Chevalier, is escorted from Prussian territory by Prussian army officers.

Over the next few years, Barry and the Chevalier travel the spas and parlors of Europe, profiting from their gambling with Barry forcing payment from reluctant debtors with sword duels. Seeing that his life is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. At a gambling table in <a href="Spa%2C%20Belgium">Spa</a>, he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon. He seduces and later marries her after the death of her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon.

In 1773, Barry takes the Countess' last name in marriage and settles in England to enjoy her wealth, still with no money of his own. Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's ten-year-old son by Sir Charles, does not approve of the marriage and quickly comes to despise Barry, calling him a 'common opportunist' who does not truly love his mother. Barry retaliates by subjecting Bullingdon to systematic <a href="physical%20abuse">physical abuse</a>. 

The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife's money on self-indulgent luxuries, while keeping his wife in seclusion.

Some years later, Barry's mother comes to live with him at the Lyndon estate. She warns her son that if Lady Lyndon were to die, all her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon, leaving Barry and his son Bryan penniless. Barry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. To further this goal, he cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover and begins to expend even larger sums of money to ingratiate himself to high society. All this effort is wasted, however, during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon. A now young adult Lord Bullingdon crashes the event where he publicly enumerates the reasons that he detests his stepfather so dearly, declaring it his intent to leave the family estate for as long as Barry remains there and married to his mother. Seething with hatred, Barry savagely assaults Bullingdon until he is pulled off by the guests. This loses Barry all the wealthy and powerful friends he has worked so hard to entreat and he is cast out of polite society. Nevertheless, Bullingdon makes good on his word by leaving the estate and England itself for parts unknown.

In contrast to his mistreatment of his stepson, Barry proves an overindulgent and doting father to Bryan, with whom he spends all his time after Bullingdon's departure. He cannot refuse his son anything, and succumbs to Bryan's insistence on receiving a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday. The spoiled Bryan disobeys his parents' direct instructions that Bryan ride the horse only in the presence of his father, is thrown by the horse, is paralyzed, and dies a few days later from his injuries.

The grief-stricken Barry turns to alcohol, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt, who had been tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. Left in charge of the families' affairs while Barry and Lady Lyndon grieve, Barry's mother dismisses the Reverend, both because the family no longer needs (nor can afford, due to Barry's spending debts) a tutor and for fear that his influence worsens Lady Lyndon's condition. Plunging even deeper into grief, Lady Lyndon later attempts suicide (though she ingests only enough poison to make herself ill). The Reverend and the family's accountant Graham then seek out Lord Bullingdon. Upon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentlemen's club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon. Bullingdon demands <a href="Duel%23Offense%20and%20satisfaction">satisfaction</a> for Barry's public assault, challenging him to a duel.

The duel with pistols is held in a <a href="tithe%20barn">tithe barn</a>. A coin-toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but he nervously misfires his pistol as he prepares to shoot. Barry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously <a href="Delope">fires into the ground</a>, but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not received "satisfaction". In the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg. At a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.

While Barry is recovering, Bullingdon re-takes control of the Lyndon estate. A few days later, Lord Bullingdon sends a very nervous Graham to the inn with a proposition: Lord Bullingdon will grant Barry an <a href="Life%20annuity">annuity</a> of five hundred guineas a year on the condition that he leave England, with payments ending the moment should Barry ever return. Otherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, Barry's creditors and bill collectors will assuredly see that he is jailed. Defeated in mind and body, Barry accepts. 

The narrator states that Barry went first back to Ireland with his mother, then to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler (though without his former success). Barry kept his word and never returned to England or ever saw Lady Lyndon again. The final scene (set in December 1789) shows a middle-aged Lady Lyndon signing Barry's annuity cheque as her son looks on.


Critic Tim Robey suggests that the film "makes you realise that the most undervalued aspect of Kubrick's genius could well be his way with actors." He adds that the <a href="Supporting%20character">supporting cast</a> is a "glittering procession of <a href="Cameo%20appearance">cameo</a>s, not from star names but from vital character players."

The cast featured Leon Vitali as the older Lord Bullingdon, who would then become Kubrick's <a href="personal%20assistant">personal assistant</a>, working as the <a href="casting%20director">casting director</a> on his following films, and supervising film-to-video transfers for Kubrick. Their relationship lasted until Kubrick's death. The film's cinematographer, <a href="John%20Alcott">John Alcott</a>, appears at the men's club in the non-speaking role of the man asleep in a chair near the title character when Lord Bullingdon challenges Barry to a duel. Kubrick's daughter <a href="Vivian%20Kubrick">Vivian</a> also appears (in an uncredited role) as a guest at Bryan's birthday party.

Kubrick stalwarts Patrick Magee (who had played the handicapped writer in "<a href="A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28film%29">A Clockwork Orange</a>") and Philip Stone (who had played Alex's father in the same film, and would go on to play the dead caretaker Grady in "<a href="The%20Shining%20%28film%29">The Shining</a>") are featured as the Chevalier du Balibari and as Graham, respectively.

After "", Kubrick made plans for a film about <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>. During pre-production, however, <a href="Sergei%20Bondarchuk">Sergei Bondarchuk</a> and <a href="Dino%20De%20Laurentiis">Dino De Laurentiis</a>' "<a href="Waterloo%20%281970%20film%29">Waterloo</a>" was released and subsequently failed at the box office. As a result, Kubrick's financiers pulled their funding for the film and he turned his attention to his next film, "<a href="A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28film%29">A Clockwork Orange</a>". Subsequently, Kubrick showed an interest in Thackeray's "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28novel%29">Vanity Fair</a>" but dropped the project when a serialised version for television was produced. He told an interviewer, "At one time, "Vanity Fair" interested me as a possible film but, in the end, I decided the story could not be successfully compressed into the relatively short time-span of a feature film...as soon as I read "Barry Lyndon" I became very excited about it."

Having garnered Oscar nominations for "<a href="Dr.%20Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a>", "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange", Kubrick's reputation in the early 1970s was that of "a perfectionist <a href="auteur">auteur</a> who loomed larger over his movies than any concept or star." His studio—Warner Bros.—was therefore "eager to bankroll" his next project, which Kubrick kept "shrouded in secrecy" from the press partly due to the furor surrounding the controversially violent "A Clockwork Orange" (particularly in the UK) and partly due to his "long-standing <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a> about the <a href="tabloid%20press">tabloid press</a>."

Having felt compelled to set aside his plans for a film about Napoleon Bonaparte, Kubrick set his sights on Thackeray's 1844 "<a href="satire">satirical</a> picaresque about the fortune-hunting of an Irish rogue," "Barry Lyndon", the setting of which allowed Kubrick to take advantage of the copious period research he had done for the now-aborted "Napoleon". At the time, Kubrick merely announced that his next film would star <a href="Ryan%20O%27Neal">Ryan O'Neal</a> (deemed "a seemingly un-Kubricky choice of leading man") and <a href="Marisa%20Berenson">Marisa Berenson</a>, a former "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine cover model, and be shot largely in Ireland. So heightened was the secrecy surrounding the film that "Even Berenson, when Kubrick first approached her, was told only that it was to be an 18th-century costume piece [and] she was instructed to keep out of the sun in the months before production, to achieve the period-specific pallor he required."

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> took 300 days, from spring 1973 through early 1974, with a break for Christmas.

Many of the film's exteriors were shot in Ireland, playing "itself, England, and <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> during the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>." Drawing inspiration from "the <a href="landscape%20painting">landscape</a>s of <a href="Watteau">Watteau</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Gainsborough">Gainsborough</a>," Kubrick and cinematographer Alcott also relied on the "scrupulously researched <a href="art%20director">art direction</a>" of <a href="Ken%20Adam">Ken Adam</a> and <a href="Roy%20Walker%20%28production%20designer%29">Roy Walker</a>. Alcott, Adam and Walker would be among those who would win <a href="Academy%20Award">Oscars</a> for their "amazing work" on the film.

Several of the interior scenes were filmed in <a href="Powerscourt%20House">Powerscourt House</a>, a famous 18th-century mansion in <a href="County%20Wicklow">County Wicklow</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>. The house was destroyed in an accidental fire several months after filming (November 1974), so the film serves as a record of the lost interiors, particularly the "Saloon" which was used for more than one scene. The <a href="Wicklow%20Mountains">Wicklow Mountains</a> are visible, for example, through the window of the saloon during a scene set in Berlin. Other locations included <a href="Kells%20Priory">Kells Priory</a> (the English Redcoat encampment) <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a>, <a href="Castle%20Howard">Castle Howard</a> (exteriors of the Lyndon estate), <a href="Huntington%20Castle%2C%20Clonegal">Huntington Castle, Clonegal</a> (exterior), <a href="Corsham%20Court">Corsham Court</a> (various interiors and the music room scene), <a href="Petworth%20House">Petworth House</a> (chapel, and so on.), <a href="Stourhead">Stourhead</a> (lake and temple), <a href="Longleat">Longleat</a>, and <a href="Wilton%20House">Wilton House</a> (interior and exterior) in England, <a href="Dunrobin%20Castle">Dunrobin Castle</a> (exterior and garden as <a href="Spa%2C%20Belgium">Spa</a>) in Scotland, <a href="Dublin%20Castle">Dublin Castle</a> in Ireland (the chevalier's home), <a href="Ludwigsburg%20Palace">Ludwigsburg Palace</a> near <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> and <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a>'s <a href="New%20Palace%20%28Potsdam%29">Neues Palais</a> at <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a> near <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> (suggesting Berlin's main street <a href="Unter%20den%20Linden">Unter den Linden</a> as construction in Potsdam had just begun in 1763). Some exterior shots were also filmed at <a href="Waterford%20Castle">Waterford Castle</a> (now a luxury hotel and golf course) and <a href="Little%20Island%2C%20Waterford">Little Island, Waterford</a>. <a href="Moorstown%20Castle">Moorstown Castle</a> in <a href="County%20Tipperary">Tipperary</a> also featured. Several scenes were filmed at <a href="Castletown%20House">Castletown House</a> outside <a href="Carrick-on-Suir">Carrick-on-Suir</a>, Co. Tipperary, and at <a href="Youghal">Youghal</a>, Co. Cork.

The film—as with "almost every Kubrick film"—is a "showcase for [a] major innovation in technique." While "2001: A Space Odyssey" had featured "revolutionary effects," and "The Shining" would later feature heavy use of the <a href="Steadicam">Steadicam</a>, "Barry Lyndon" saw a considerable number of sequences shot "without recourse to electric light." <a href="Cinematography">Cinematography</a> was overseen by director of photography <a href="John%20Alcott">John Alcott</a> (who won an Oscar for his work), and is particularly noted for the technical innovations that made some of its most spectacular images possible. To achieve photography without electric lighting "[f]or the many densely furnished interior scenes... meant shooting by <a href="candle">candle</a>light," which is known to be difficult in <a href="photography">still photography</a>, "let alone with moving images."
Kubrick was "determined not to reproduce the set-bound, <a href="stage%20lighting%20instrument">artificially lit</a> look of other <a href="costume%20drama">costume drama</a>s from that time." After "tinker[ing] with different combinations of <a href="Photographic%20lens">lenses</a> and <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a>," the production obtained three super-fast 50mm lenses (<a href="Carl%20Zeiss%20Planar%2050mm%20f/0.7">Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7</a>) developed by <a href="Carl%20Zeiss%20AG">Zeiss</a> for use by <a href="NASA">NASA</a> in the <a href="Apollo%20moon%20landing">Apollo moon landing</a>s, which Kubrick had discovered. These super-fast lenses "with their huge <a href="lens%20aperture">aperture</a> (the film actually features the lowest <a href="f-number">f-stop</a> in film history) and fixed <a href="focal%20length">focal length</a>" were problematic to mount, and were extensively modified into three versions by Cinema Products Corp. for Kubrick so to gain a wider angle of view, with input from optics expert Richard Vetter of <a href="Todd-AO">Todd-AO</a>. The rear element of the lens had to be 2.5mm away from the film plane, requiring special modification to the rotating camera shutter. This allowed Kubrick and Alcott to shoot scenes lit with actual candles to an average lighting volume of only three <a href="candela">candela</a>, "recreating the huddle and glow of a pre-electrical age." In addition, Kubrick had the entire film <a href="Push%20processing">push-developed</a> by one stop.

Although Kubrick's express desire was to avoid electric lighting where possible, most shots were achieved with conventional lenses and lighting, but were lit to deliberately mimic natural light rather than for compositional reasons. In addition to potentially seeming more realistic, these methods also gave a particular period look to the film which has often been likened to 18th-century paintings (which were, of course, depicting a world devoid of electric lighting), in particular owing "a lot to <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>, with whom Thackeray had always been fascinated."
According to critic Tim Robey, the film has a "stately, painterly, often determinedly static quality." For example, to help light some interior scenes, lights were placed outside and aimed through the windows, which were covered in a diffuse material to scatter the light evenly through the room rather than being placed inside for maximum use as most conventional films do. A sign of this method occurs in the scene where Barry duels Lord Bullingdon. Though it appears to be lit entirely with natural light, one can see that the light coming in through the cross-shaped windows in the tithe barn appears blue in color, while the main lighting of the scene coming in from the side is not. This is because the light through the cross-shaped windows is daylight from the sun, which when recorded on the film stock used by Kubrick showed up as blue-tinted compared to the incandescent electric light coming in from the side.

Despite such slight tinting effects, this method of lighting not only gave the look of natural daylight coming in through the windows, but it also protected the historic locations from the damage caused by mounting the lights on walls or ceilings and the heat from the lights. This helped the film "fit... perfectly with Kubrick's <a href="wikt%3Agilded%20cage">gilded-cage</a> aesthetic – the film is consciously a museum piece, its characters pinned to the frame like butterflies."

The film's period setting allowed Kubrick to indulge his penchant for classical music, and the <a href="film%20score">film score</a> uses pieces by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> (an arrangement of the Concerto for violin and oboe in C minor), <a href="Antonio%20Vivaldi">Antonio Vivaldi</a> (Cello Concerto in E-Minor, a transcription of the Cello Sonata in E Minor RV 40), <a href="Giovanni%20Paisiello">Giovanni Paisiello</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>, and <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Franz Schubert</a> (German Dance No. 1 in C major, <a href="Piano%20Trio%20No.%202%20%28Schubert%29">Piano Trio in E-Flat, Opus 100</a> and <a href="Impromptus%20%28Schubert%29%23Four%20Impromptus%2C%20Op.%2090%20%28D.%20899%29">Impromptu No. 1 in C minor</a>), as well as the <a href="Der%20Hohenfriedberger">Hohenfriedberger March</a>. The piece most associated with the film, however, is the main title music: <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>'s stately "<a href="Sarabande">Sarabande</a>" from the <a href="Keyboard%20suite%20in%20D%20minor%20%28HWV%20437%29">Suite in D minor HWV 437</a>. Originally for solo <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, the versions for the main and end titles are performed very <a href="romantic%20music">romantically</a> with orchestral strings, harpsichord, and <a href="timpani">timpani</a>. It is used at various points in the film, in various arrangements, to indicate the implacable working of impersonal fate.

The score also includes <a href="Folk%20music%20of%20Ireland">Irish folk music</a>, including <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20%C3%93%20Riada">Seán Ó Riada</a>'s song "<a href="Women%20of%20Ireland">Women of Ireland</a>", arranged by <a href="Paddy%20Moloney">Paddy Moloney</a> and performed by <a href="The%20Chieftains">The Chieftains</a>. <a href="The%20British%20Grenadiers">The British Grenadiers</a> also features in scenes with Redcoats marching.

The film "was not the commercial success <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> had been hoping for" within the United States, although it fared better in Europe. This mixed reaction saw the film (in the words of one retrospective review) "greeted, on its release, with dutiful admiration – but not love. Critics... rail[ed] against the perceived coldness of Kubrick's style, the film's self-conscious artistry and slow pace. Audiences, on the whole, rather agreed..." This "air of disappointment" factored into Kubrick's decision for his next film – <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>'s "<a href="The%20Shining%20%28film%29">The Shining</a>" – a project that would not only please him artistically, but also be more likely to succeed financially. Still, several other critics, including <a href="Gene%20Siskel">Gene Siskel</a>, praised the film's technical quality and strong narrative, and Siskel himself counted it as one of the five best films of the year.

In recent years, the film has gained a more positive reaction. it holds a 97% "Certified Fresh" rating on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 52 reviews, eight of which are from the site's "top critics." <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> added the film to his 'Great Movies' list on 9 September 2009, writing, "It defies us to care, it asks us to remain only observers of its stately elegance", and it "must be one of the most beautiful films ever made."

Director <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> has named "Barry Lyndon" as his favorite Kubrick film, and it is also one of <a href="Lars%20von%20Trier">Lars von Trier</a>'s favorite films. Quotations from its script have also appeared in such disparate works as <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s "<a href="The%20Duellists">The Duellists</a>", Scorsese's "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Innocence%20%281993%20film%29">The Age of Innocence</a>", and <a href="Wes%20Anderson">Wes Anderson</a>'s "<a href="Rushmore%20%28film%29">Rushmore</a>".

Kubrick was nominated three times, for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>, and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Writing%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a>.

Kubrick won the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Direction">Award for Best Direction</a>. John Alcott won for <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a>. "Barry Lyndon" was also nominated for <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">Best Film</a>, Art Direction, and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Costume%20Design">Costume Design</a>.

Kubrick based his adapted screenplay on <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>'s "<a href="The%20Luck%20of%20Barry%20Lyndon">The Luck of Barry Lyndon</a>" (republished as the novel "Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.)," a <a href="picaresque">picaresque</a> tale written and published in serial form in 1844.

The film departs from the novel in several ways. In Thackeray's writings, events are related in the first person by Barry himself. A comic tone pervades the work, as Barry proves both a raconteur and an <a href="unreliable%20narrator">unreliable narrator</a>. Kubrick's film, by contrast, presents the story objectively. Though the film contains voice-over (by actor <a href="Michael%20Hordern">Michael Hordern</a>), the comments expressed are not Barry's, but those of an omniscient narrator. Kubrick felt that using a first-person narrative would not be useful in a film adaptation:

Kubrick also changed the plot. For example, the novel does not include a final duel. The film begins with a duel where Barry's father is shot dead, and duels recur throughout the film.

Cell (biology)

The cell (from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "cella", meaning "small room") is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known <a href="Life">living</a> <a href="organism">organism</a>s. A cell is the smallest unit of <a href="Life%23Cells">life</a> that can <a href="Cell%20division">replicate</a> independently, and cells are often called the "building blocks of life". The study of cells is called <a href="cell%20biology">cell biology</a>.

Cells consist of <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> enclosed within a <a href="Cell%20membrane">membrane</a>, which contains many <a href="biomolecule">biomolecule</a>s such as <a href="protein">protein</a>s and <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s. Organisms can be classified as <a href="unicellular">unicellular</a> (consisting of a single cell; including <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>) or <a href="multicellular">multicellular</a> (including <a href="plant">plant</a>s and <a href="animal">animal</a>s). While the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species, humans contain more than 10 <a href="10%5E12">trillion</a> (10) cells. Most plant and animal cells are visible only under a <a href="microscope">microscope</a>, with dimensions between 1 and 100 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s.

The cell was discovered by <a href="Robert%20Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> in 1665, who named the biological units for their resemblance to cells inhabited by <a href="Christian%20monasticism">Christian monks</a> in a <a href="monastery">monastery</a>. <a href="Cell%20theory">Cell theory</a>, first developed in 1839 by <a href="Matthias%20Jakob%20Schleiden">Matthias Jakob Schleiden</a> and <a href="Theodor%20Schwann">Theodor Schwann</a>, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, that all cells come from preexisting cells, and that all cells contain the <a href="genetics">hereditary information</a> necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells. Cells emerged on Earth at least 3.5 billion years ago.

Cells are of two types, <a href="eukaryotic">eukaryotic</a>, which contain a <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a>, and <a href="prokaryotic">prokaryotic</a>, which do not. Prokaryotes are <a href="Unicellular%20organism">single-celled organisms</a>, while eukaryotes can be either single-celled or <a href="multicellular%20organism">multicellular</a>.

<a href="Prokaryote">Prokaryotic</a> cells were the first form of <a href="life">life</a> on Earth, characterised by having vital <a href="biological%20process">biological process</a>es including <a href="cell%20signaling">cell signaling</a> and being self-sustaining. They are simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells, and lack membrane-bound organelles such as the <a href="cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a>. Prokaryotes include two of the <a href="Domain%20%28biology%29">domains of life</a>, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="archaea">archaea</a>. The DNA of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single chromosome that is in direct contact with the <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a>. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the <a href="nucleoid">nucleoid</a>. Most <a href="prokaryotes">prokaryotes</a> are the smallest of all organisms ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 µm in diameter.

A prokaryotic cell has three architectural regions:

Plants, animals, fungi, slime moulds, <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>, and algae are all <a href="Eukaryote">eukaryotic</a>. These cells are about fifteen times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as a thousand times greater in volume. The main distinguishing feature of eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes is <a href="Cellular%20compartment">compartmentalization:</a> the presence of membrane-bound <a href="organelle">organelle</a>s (compartments) in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is a <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a>, an organelle that houses the cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means "true kernel (nucleus)". Other differences include:

All cells, whether <a href="prokaryotic">prokaryotic</a> or <a href="eukaryotic">eukaryotic</a>, have a <a href="cell%20membrane">membrane</a> that envelops the cell, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the <a href="Membrane%20potential">electric potential of the cell</a>. Inside the membrane, the <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> takes up most of the cell's volume. All cells (except <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s which lack a cell nucleus and most organelles to accommodate maximum space for <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>) possess <a href="DNA">DNA</a>, the hereditary material of <a href="gene">gene</a>s, and <a href="RNA">RNA</a>, containing the information necessary to <a href="gene%20expression">build</a> various <a href="protein">protein</a>s such as <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of <a href="biomolecule">biomolecule</a>s in cells. This article lists these primary components of the cell, then briefly describes their function.

The <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>, or plasma membrane, is a <a href="biological%20membrane">biological membrane</a> that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell. In animals, the plasma membrane is the outer boundary of the cell, while in plants and prokaryotes it is usually covered by a <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a <a href="lipid%20bilayer">double layer of phospholipids</a>, which are <a href="amphiphilic">amphiphilic</a> (partly <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> and partly <a href="hydrophilic">hydrophilic</a>). Hence, the layer is called a <a href="phospholipid%20bilayer">phospholipid bilayer</a>, or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of <a href="protein">protein</a> molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell. The membrane is said to be 'semi-permeable', in that it can either let a substance (<a href="molecule">molecule</a> or <a href="ion">ion</a>) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain <a href="Receptor%20%28biochemistry%29%23Transmembrane%20receptors">receptor</a> proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as <a href="hormone">hormone</a>s.

The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during <a href="endocytosis">endocytosis</a>, the uptake of external materials by a cell, and <a href="cytokinesis">cytokinesis</a>, the separation of daughter cells after <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a>; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of <a href="microfilament">microfilament</a>s, <a href="intermediate%20filament">intermediate filament</a>s and <a href="microtubule">microtubule</a>s. There are a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis. The subunit protein of microfilaments is a small, monomeric protein called <a href="actin">actin</a>. The subunit of microtubules is a dimeric molecule called <a href="tubulin">tubulin</a>. Intermediate filaments are heteropolymers whose subunits vary among the cell types in different tissues. But some of the subunit protein of intermediate filaments include <a href="vimentin">vimentin</a>, <a href="desmin">desmin</a>, <a href="lamin">lamin</a> (lamins A, B and C), <a href="keratin">keratin</a> (multiple acidic and basic keratins), neurofilament proteins (NF - L, NF - M).

Two different kinds of genetic material exist: <a href="DNA">deoxyribonucleic acid</a> (DNA) and <a href="RNA">ribonucleic acid</a> (RNA). Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is <a href="Genetic%20code">encoded</a> in its DNA sequence. RNA is used for information transport (e.g., <a href="mRNA">mRNA</a>) and <a href="enzyme">enzymatic</a> functions (e.g., <a href="ribosome">ribosomal</a> RNA). <a href="Transfer%20RNA">Transfer RNA</a> (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein <a href="Translation%20%28biology%29">translation</a>.

Prokaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular DNA molecule (the bacterial <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>) in the <a href="nucleoid%20region">nucleoid region</a> of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different, linear molecules called <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> and <a href="chloroplasts">chloroplasts</a> (see <a href="endosymbiotic%20theory">endosymbiotic theory</a>).

A human cell has genetic material contained in the <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a> (the <a href="genome">nuclear genome</a>) and in the mitochondria (the <a href="mitochondrial%20genome">mitochondrial genome</a>). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, including 22 <a href="homologous%20chromosome">homologous chromosome</a> pairs and a pair of <a href="sex%20chromosomes">sex chromosomes</a>. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes, it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs.

Foreign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called <a href="transfection">transfection</a>. This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's <a href="genome">genome</a>, or stable, if it is. Certain <a href="virus">virus</a>es also insert their genetic material into the genome.

Organelles are parts of the cell which are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions, analogous to the <a href="Organ%20%28anatomy%29">organs</a> of the human body (such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function). Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles, but prokaryotic organelles are generally simpler and are not membrane-bound.

There are several types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a> and <a href="golgi%20apparatus">golgi apparatus</a>) are typically solitary, while others (such as <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>, <a href="chloroplasts">chloroplasts</a>, <a href="peroxisomes">peroxisomes</a> and <a href="lysosomes">lysosomes</a>) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a> is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.



Many cells also have structures which exist wholly or partially outside the cell membrane. These structures are notable because they are not protected from the external environment by the <a href="semipermeable%20membrane">semipermeable cell membrane</a>. In order to assemble these structures, their components must be carried across the cell membrane by export processes.

Many types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have a <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>. The cell wall acts to protect the cell mechanically and chemically from its environment, and is an additional layer of protection to the cell membrane. Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of cellulose, fungi cell walls are made up of chitin and bacteria cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan.

A gelatinous <a href="bacterial%20capsule">capsule</a> is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a> as in <a href="pneumococci">pneumococci</a>, <a href="meningococci">meningococci</a> or <a href="polypeptide">polypeptide</a> as "<a href="Bacillus%20anthracis">Bacillus anthracis</a>" or <a href="hyaluronic%20acid">hyaluronic acid</a> as in <a href="streptococci">streptococci</a>.
Capsules are not marked by normal staining protocols and can be detected by <a href="India%20ink%23Uses%20other%20than%20writing">India ink</a> or <a href="methyl%20blue">methyl blue</a>; which allows for higher contrast between the cells for observation.

<a href="Flagella">Flagella</a> are organelles for cellular mobility. The bacterial flagellum stretches from cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. A different type of flagellum is found in archaea and a different type is found in eukaryotes.

A <a href="fimbria%20%28bacteriology%29">fimbria</a> also known as a <a href="pilus">pilus</a> is a short, thin, hair-like filament found on the surface of bacteria. Fimbriae, or pili are formed of a protein called <a href="pilin">pilin</a> (<a href="antigenic">antigenic</a>) and are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell (<a href="cell%20adhesion">cell adhesion</a>). There are special types of specific pili involved in <a href="bacterial%20conjugation">bacterial conjugation</a>.

Between successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: <a href="catabolism">catabolism</a>, in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and <a href="Reducing%20agent">reducing power</a>, and <a href="anabolism">anabolism</a>, in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions.
Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into simpler sugar molecules called <a href="monosaccharides">monosaccharides</a> such as <a href="glucose">glucose</a>. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate (<a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>), a molecule that possesses readily available energy, through two different pathways.

Cell division involves a single cell (called a "mother cell") dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in <a href="multicellular%20organism">multicellular organism</a>s (the growth of <a href="biological%20tissue">tissue</a>) and to procreation (<a href="vegetative%20reproduction">vegetative reproduction</a>) in <a href="unicellular%20organism">unicellular organism</a>s. <a href="Prokaryote">Prokaryotic</a> cells divide by <a href="binary%20fission">binary fission</a>, while <a href="Eukaryote">eukaryotic</a> cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a>, followed by division of the cell, called <a href="cytokinesis">cytokinesis</a>. A <a href="diploid">diploid</a> cell may also undergo <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a> to produce haploid cells, usually four. <a href="Haploid">Haploid</a> cells serve as <a href="gamete">gamete</a>s in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.

<a href="DNA%20replication">DNA replication</a>, or the process of duplicating a cell's genome, always happens when a cell divides through mitosis or binary fission. This occurs during the S phase of the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a>.

In meiosis, the DNA is replicated only once, while the cell divides twice. DNA replication only occurs before <a href="meiosis%20I">meiosis I</a>. DNA replication does not occur when the cells divide the second time, in <a href="meiosis%20II">meiosis II</a>. Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job.

Cells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: <a href="transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a> and <a href="translation%20%28genetics%29">translation</a>.

Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s located in the <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a>, where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to <a href="transfer%20RNA">transfer RNA</a> (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.

Unicellular organisms can move in order to find food or escape predators. Common mechanisms of motion include <a href="flagella">flagella</a> and <a href="cilia">cilia</a>.

In multicellular organisms, cells can move during processes such as wound healing, the immune response and <a href="cancer%20metastasis">cancer metastasis</a>. For example, in wound healing in animals, white blood cells move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins. The process is divided into three steps – protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward. Each step is driven by physical forces generated by unique segments of the cytoskeleton.

Multicellular organisms are <a href="organism">organism</a>s that consist of more than one cell, in contrast to <a href="single-celled%20organism">single-celled organism</a>s.

In complex multicellular organisms, cells specialize into different <a href="cell%20type">cell type</a>s that are adapted to particular functions. In mammals, major cell types include <a href="skin%20cells">skin cells</a>, <a href="muscle%20cells">muscle cells</a>, <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s, <a href="blood%20cell">blood cell</a>s, <a href="fibroblast">fibroblast</a>s, <a href="stem%20cells">stem cells</a>, and others. Cell types differ both in appearance and function, yet are <a href="Genetics">genetically</a> identical. Cells are able to be of the same <a href="genotype">genotype</a> but of different cell type due to the differential <a href="Regulation%20of%20gene%20expression">expression</a> of the <a href="gene">gene</a>s they contain.

Most distinct cell types arise from a single <a href="totipotent">totipotent</a> cell, called a <a href="zygote">zygote</a>, that <a href="Cellular%20differentiation">differentiates</a> into hundreds of different cell types during the course of <a href="Development%20%28biology%29">development</a>. Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell–cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s during <a href="cell%20division">division</a>).

Multicellularity has evolved independently at least 25 times, including in some prokaryotes, like <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, <a href="myxobacteria">myxobacteria</a>, <a href="actinomycetes">actinomycetes</a>, "<a href="Deltaproteobacteria">Magnetoglobus multicellularis</a>" or "<a href="Methanosarcina">Methanosarcina</a>". However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and plants. It evolved repeatedly for plants (<a href="Chloroplastida">Chloroplastida</a>), once or twice for <a href="animal">animal</a>s, once for <a href="brown%20algae">brown algae</a>, and perhaps several times for <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="Mycetozoa">slime molds</a>, and <a href="red%20algae">red algae</a>. Multicellularity may have evolved from <a href="Colony%20%28biology%29">colonies</a> of interdependent organisms, from <a href="cellularization">cellularization</a>, or from organisms in <a href="Symbiosis">symbiotic relationships</a>.

The first evidence of multicellularity is from <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>-like organisms that lived between 3 and 3.5 billion years ago. Other early fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested <a href="Grypania">Grypania</a> spiralis and the fossils of the black shales of the <a href="Palaeoproterozoic">Palaeoproterozoic</a> <a href="Francevillian%20Group%20Fossil">Francevillian Group Fossil</a> B Formation in <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>.

The evolution of multicellularity from unicellular ancestors has been replicated in the laboratory, in <a href="experimental%20evolution">evolution experiments</a> using predation as the <a href="selective%20pressure">selective pressure</a>.

The origin of cells has to do with the <a href="Abiogenesis">origin of life</a>, which began the <a href="timeline%20of%20evolution">history of life</a> on Earth.

There are several theories about the origin of small molecules that led to life on the <a href="early%20Earth">early Earth</a>. They may have been carried to Earth on meteorites (see <a href="Murchison%20meteorite">Murchison meteorite</a>), created at <a href="Hydrothermal%20vent">deep-sea vents</a>, or synthesized by lightning in a reducing atmosphere (see <a href="Miller%E2%80%93Urey%20experiment">Miller–Urey experiment</a>). There is little experimental data defining what the first self-replicating forms were. <a href="RNA">RNA</a> is thought to be the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it is capable of both storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions (see <a href="RNA%20world%20hypothesis">RNA world hypothesis</a>), but some other entity with the potential to self-replicate could have preceded RNA, such as <a href="Abiogenesis%23Clay%20theory">clay</a> or <a href="peptide%20nucleic%20acid">peptide nucleic acid</a>.

Cells emerged at least 3.5 billion years ago. The current belief is that these cells were <a href="heterotroph">heterotroph</a>s. The early cell membranes were probably more simple and permeable than modern ones, with only a single fatty acid chain per lipid. Lipids are known to spontaneously form bilayered <a href="Vesicle%20%28biology%20and%20chemistry%29">vesicles</a> in water, and could have preceded RNA, but the first cell membranes could also have been produced by catalytic RNA, or even have required structural proteins before they could form.

The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic community</a> of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> and the <a href="chloroplasts">chloroplasts</a> are descended from ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing <a href="proteobacteria">proteobacteria</a> and <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, respectively, which were <a href="Endosymbiotic%20theory">endosymbiosed</a> by an ancestral <a href="archaea">archaea</a>n prokaryote.

There is still considerable debate about whether organelles like the <a href="hydrogenosome">hydrogenosome</a> predated the origin of <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>, or vice versa: see the <a href="hydrogen%20hypothesis">hydrogen hypothesis</a> for the origin of eukaryotic cells.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a 1992 American <a href="comedy%20horror">comedy horror</a> film about a <a href="Valley%20girl">Valley girl</a> <a href="Cheerleading">cheerleader</a> named <a href="Buffy%20Summers">Buffy</a> who learns that it is her fate to hunt vampires. The film starred <a href="Kristy%20Swanson">Kristy Swanson</a>, <a href="Donald%20Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>, <a href="Paul%20Reubens">Paul Reubens</a>, <a href="Rutger%20Hauer">Rutger Hauer</a>, <a href="Luke%20Perry">Luke Perry</a>, and <a href="Hilary%20Swank">Hilary Swank</a>. It was a moderate success at the box office, but received mixed reception from critics. The film was taken in a different direction from the one its writer <a href="Joss%20Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> intended, and five years later, he created the darker and acclaimed TV series <a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">of the same name</a>.

High school senior <a href="Buffy%20Summers">Buffy Summers</a> (<a href="Kristy%20Swanson">Kristy Swanson</a>) is introduced as a stereotypical, shallow cheerleader at Hemery High School in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a>. She is a carefree popular girl whose main concerns are shopping and spending time with her rich, snooty friends and her boyfriend, Jeffrey. While at school one day, she is approached by a man who calls himself <a href="Minor%20characters%20of%20Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%23Merrick">Merrick</a> (<a href="Donald%20Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>). He informs her that she is <a href="Slayer%20%28Buffyverse%29">The Slayer</a>, or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a <a href="Watcher%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Watcher</a> whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rebukes his claims, but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail. In addition, Buffy is exhibiting uncanny abilities not known to her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature, indifference to slaying and sharp-tongued remarks.

After several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with Lothos (<a href="Rutger%20Hauer">Rutger Hauer</a>), a local vampire king and his acolyte, Amilyn (<a href="Paul%20Reubens">Paul Reubens</a>). Two young men, <a href="Pike%20%28Buffyverse%20character%29">Oliver Pike</a> (<a href="Luke%20Perry">Luke Perry</a>), and best friend Benny (<a href="David%20Arquette">David Arquette</a>), who resented Buffy and her friends due to differing social circles, are out drinking when they are attacked by Amilyn. Benny is turned but Pike is saved by Merrick. As a vampire, Benny visits Pike and tries to get him to join him. Later, when Pike and his boss are discussing Benny, Pike tells him to run if he sees him. Not only this, but a studious girl from Buffy's class, Cassandra, is abducted one night by Amilyn and sacrificed to Lothos. When her body is found, the news spreads through LA and Hemery High, but her murder is met with indifference from Buffy's clique.

When Pike realizes there is something wrong with Benny and that he is no longer safe, he decides to leave town. His plan is thwarted, however, when he encounters Amilyn and his tribe of vampires. Amilyn hitches a ride on the hood of his van which crashes into a tree just before Amilyn loses an arm. Buffy and Merrick arrive to rescue him and Amilyn flees the fight to talk to Lothos. After this encounter, Buffy and Pike start a friendship, which eventually becomes romantic and Pike becomes Buffy's partner in fighting the undead.

During a basketball game, Buffy finds out that one of the players, and a friend of Jeffrey's, is a vampire. After a quick chase to a parade float storage yard, Buffy finally confronts Lothos, shortly after she and Pike take down his gang. Lothos puts Buffy in a hypnotic trance, which is broken due to Merrick's intervention. Lothos turns on Merrick and stab him with the stake he attempted to use on him. Lothos leaves, saying that Buffy is not ready. As Merrick dies, he tells Buffy to do things her own way rather than live by the rules of others and he says "remember about the music." Because of her new life, responsibilities, and heartbreak, Buffy becomes emotionally shocked and starts dropping her Slayer duties. When she arrives at school, she attempts to explain everything to her friends, but they refuse to understand her as they are more concerned with their upcoming school dance, and Buffy falls out with them as she realizes she is outgrowing their immature, selfish behavior.

At the senior dance, Buffy tries to patch things up with her friends but they turn against her, and she is dismayed to find Jeffrey has dumped her for one of her friends. However, she meets up with Pike and as they start to dance and kiss, Lothos leads the remainder of his minions to the school and attacks the students and the attending faculty. Buffy confronts the vampires outside while Pike fights the vampiric Benny. After overpowering the vampires, she confronts Lothos inside the school and kills Amilyn. Lothos hypnotizes Buffy again and when the dance music stops, she remembers Merrick's words and is ready to defend herself. Lothos ignites her cross but she uses hairspray to create a makeshift flame-thrower and burns him before escaping back into the gym. Buffy sees everybody recover from the attack, but Lothos emerges again getting into a fight with Buffy, who then stakes him.

As all of the survivors leave, Buffy and Pike decide to finish their dance. The film then ends with the two of them leaving the dance on a motorcycle, and a news crew interviewing the students and the principal about the attack during the credits.

Many of the details given in the film differ from the <a href="Buffyverse%20canon">continuity</a> of the later television series. For example, Buffy's age and history are dissimilar; she is a senior in high school in the film, but the series starts with her as a sophomore. However, the film does portray who Buffy in the TV series was before she learned of her destiny as the Slayer: a popular but selfish and air-headed cheerleader. In the film, her parents are wealthy but negligent socialites who care little for her and spend their time at parties and golf tournaments; in the TV show, Buffy has a caring, single mother named <a href="Joyce%20Summers">Joyce</a>. The supernatural abilities of both vampires and the Slayer are depicted differently. The vampires in the film die like humans, while in the TV show they turn to dust, and, unlike the TV show, their faces remain human, albeit pale and fanged, whereas in the series they are able to take on a demonic aspect. In the film, Merrick is hundreds of years old, having lived many lives training many slayers, whereas in the series, watchers are mortal. Merrick's British accent and the manner of his death are also changed when he appears in flash-backs in the series.

Joss Whedon has expressed his disapproval with the movie's interpretation of the script, stating "I finally sat down and had written it and somebody had made it into a movie, and I felt like — well, that's not quite her. It's a start, but it's not quite the girl."

According to the "Official Buffy Watcher's Guide", Whedon wrote the pilot to the TV series as a sequel to his original script, which is why the show makes references to events that did not occur in the film. In 1999, <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a> released a graphic novel adaptation of Whedon's original script under the title "<a href="The%20Origin%20%28Buffy%20comic%29">The Origin</a>". Whedon stated: "The "Origin" comic, though I have issues with it, CAN pretty much be accepted as canonical. They did a cool job of combining the movie script with the series, that was nice, and using the series Merrick and not a certain OTHER thespian who shall remain hated."

Writer Whedon sold the movie to Dolly Parton’s production company Sandollar, in the fall of 1991.

The film debuted at #5 at the North American box office and eventually grossed a modest $16,624,456 against a $7 million production budget.

The film was released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> and Laserdisc in the U.S. in 1992 by <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20Home%20Entertainment">Fox Video</a> and re-released in 1995 under the "Twentieth Century Fox Selections" banner. It was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> in the US in 2001 and on <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> in 2011.

The soundtrack does not include every song played in the film, which also included "<a href="War%20Babies%20%28War%20Babies%20album%29">In the Wind</a>" by <a href="War%20Babies%20%28band%29">War Babies</a> and "Inner Mind" by <a href="Eon%20%28musician%29">Eon</a>.

The film received generally mixed to negative reviews. It holds a rating of 34% on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 38 reviews and a 48 on review aggregator website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, indicating mixed or average reviews.

On May 25, 2009, "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" reported that <a href="Roy%20Lee">Roy Lee</a> and Doug Davison of <a href="Vertigo%20Entertainment">Vertigo Entertainment</a> were working with Fran Rubel Kuzui and Kaz Kuzui on a re-envisioning or relaunch of the "Buffy" film for the big screen. The film would not be a <a href="sequel">sequel</a> or <a href="prequel">prequel</a> to the existing film or television franchise and <a href="Joss%20Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> would have no involvement in the project. None of the characters, cast, or crew from the television series would be featured. Television series executive producer <a href="Marti%20Noxon">Marti Noxon</a> later reflected that this story might have been produced by the studio in order to frighten Whedon into taking the reins of the project. On November 22, 2010, "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" confirmed that Warner Bros. had picked up the movie rights to the remake. The film was set for release sometime in 2012. 20th Century Fox, which usually holds rights to the more successful "Buffy"/"Angel" television franchise, will retain merchandising and some distribution rights.

The idea of the remake caused wrath among fans of the TV series, since Whedon is not involved and the project does not have any connection with the show and will not conform to the <a href="Continuity%20%28fiction%29">continuity</a> maintained with the "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20Season%20Eight">Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight</a>" and "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20Season%20Nine">Season Nine</a>" <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> titles. Not only the fandom, but the main cast members of both the "Buffy" and "<a href="Angel%20%281999%20TV%20series%29">Angel</a>" series expressed disagreement with the report on Twitter and in recent interviews. <a href="Sarah%20Michelle%20Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> said, "I think it's a horrible idea. To try to do a "Buffy" without Joss Whedon... to be incredibly non-eloquent: that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard." Proposed shooting locations included Black Wood and other areas in rural England, due to budgetary constraints and the potential setting being outside of the city, an unusual change for the franchise.

In December 2011, more than a year after the official reboot announcement, the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" site reported that Whit Anderson, the writer picked for the new "Buffy" movie, had her script rejected by the producers behind the project, and that a new writer was being sought. Sources also stated that "If you're going to bring it back, you have to do it right. [Anderson] came in with some great ideas and she had reinvented some of the lore and it was pretty cool but in the end there just wasn't enough on the page."

As of June 2017, there have been no further developments regarding the reboot.

Barter

Barter is a system of exchange where <a href="Good%20%28economics%29">goods</a> or <a href="Service%20%28economics%29">services</a> are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a <a href="medium%20of%20exchange">medium of exchange</a>, such as <a href="money">money</a>. It is distinguishable from <a href="Gift%20economy">gift economies</a> in many ways; one of them is that the <a href="Reciprocity%20%28cultural%20anthropology%29">reciprocal exchange</a> is immediate and not delayed in time. It is usually <a href="wiktionary%3Abilateral">bilateral</a>, but may be <a href="Multilateral_exchange">multilateral</a> (i.e., mediated through a <a href="trade%20exchange">trade exchange</a>) and, in most developed countries, usually only exists parallel to monetary systems to a very limited extent. Barter, as a replacement for money as the method of exchange, is used in times of monetary crisis, such as when the <a href="currency">currency</a> may be either unstable (e.g., <a href="hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> or <a href="Deflation%23Deflationary%20spiral">deflationary spiral</a>) or simply unavailable for conducting commerce.

Economists since <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a>, looking at non-specific archaic societies as examples, have used the inefficiency of barter to explain the emergence of money, the economy, and hence the discipline of economics itself. However, <a href="ethnographic">ethnographic</a> studies have shown no present or past society has used barter without any other medium of exchange or measurement, nor have anthropologists found evidence that money emerged from barter, instead finding that gift-giving (credit extended on a personal basis with an inter-personal balance maintained over the long term) was the most usual means of exchange of goods and services.

Since the 1830s, barter in some western market economies has been aided by exchanges that use alternative currencies based on the <a href="labour%20theory%20of%20value">labour theory of value</a>, and are designed to prevent profit taking by intermediators. Examples include the <a href="Owenite">Owenite</a> socialists, the <a href="Cincinnati%20Time%20Store">Cincinnati Time store</a>, and more recently <a href="Ithaca%20Hours">Ithaca HOURS</a> (<a href="Time%20banking">Time banking</a>) and the <a href="LETS%20system">LETS system</a>.

<a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a>, the father of modern economics, sought to demonstrate that <a href="Market%20%28economics%29">markets</a> (and economies) pre-existed the state, and hence should be free of government regulation. He argued (against conventional wisdom) that money was not the creation of governments. Markets emerged, in his view, out of the division of labour, by which individuals began to specialize in specific crafts and hence had to depend on others for subsistence goods. These goods were first exchanged by barter. Specialization depended on trade, but was hindered by the "double coincidence of wants" which barter requires, i.e., for the exchange to occur, each participant must want what the other has. To complete this hypothetical history, craftsmen would stockpile one particular good, be it salt or metal, that they thought no one would refuse. This is the origin of money according to Smith. Money, as a universally desired medium of exchange, allows each half of the transaction to be separated.

Barter is characterized in Adam Smith's ""<a href="The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations">The Wealth of Nations</a>"" by a disparaging vocabulary: "higgling, haggling, swapping, dickering." It has also been characterized as negative reciprocity, or "selfish profiteering."

Anthropologists have argued, in contrast, "that when something resembling barter "does" occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers." Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalistically explain the origin of money without the state. Since most people engaged in trade knew each other, exchange was fostered through the extension of credit. Marcel Mauss, author of '<a href="The%20Gift%20%28book%29">The Gift</a>', argued that the first economic contracts were to "not" act in one's economic self-interest, and that before money, exchange was fostered through the processes of reciprocity and <a href="redistribution%20%28cultural%20anthropology%29">redistribution</a>, not barter. Everyday exchange relations in such societies are characterized by generalized reciprocity, or a non-calculative familial "communism" where each takes according to their needs, and gives as they have.

Since direct barter does not require payment in money, it can be utilized when money is in short supply, when there is little information about the credit worthiness of trade partners, or when there is a lack of trust between those trading.

Barter is an option to those who cannot afford to store their small supply of wealth in money, especially in <a href="hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> situations where money devalues quickly.

The limitations of barter are often explained in terms of its inefficiencies in facilitating exchange in comparison to money.

It is said that barter is 'inefficient' because:


Other anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between "total" strangers, a form of barter known as "silent trade". Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter ("dumb" here used in its old meaning of "mute"), or depot trade, is a method by which <a href="Merchant">traders</a> who cannot speak each other's <a href="language">language</a> can trade without talking. However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that while barter occurs through "silent trade" (between strangers), it also occurs in commercial markets as well. "Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself."

In his analysis of barter between coastal and inland villages in the <a href="Trobriand%20Islands">Trobriand Islands</a>, Keith Hart highlighted the difference between highly ceremonial gift exchange between community leaders, and the barter that occurs between individual households. The haggling that takes place between strangers is possible because of the larger temporary political order established by the gift exchanges of leaders. From this he concludes that barter is "an atomized interaction predicated upon the presence of society" (i.e. that social order established by gift exchange), and not typical between complete strangers.

As Orlove noted, barter may occur in commercial economies, usually during periods of monetary crisis. During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal medium of exchange or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).

Economic historian Karl Polanyi has argued that where barter is widespread, and cash supplies limited, barter is aided by the use of credit, brokerage, and money as a unit of account (i.e. used to price items). All of these strategies are found in ancient economies including Ptolemaic Egypt. They are also the basis for more recent barter exchange systems.

While one-to-one bartering is practiced between individuals and businesses on an informal basis, organized barter exchanges have developed to conduct third party bartering which helps overcome some of the limitations of barter. A barter exchange operates as a broker and bank in which each participating member has an account that is debited when purchases are made, and credited when sales are made.

Modern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses in a barter earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits – they are not obligated to purchase from those whom they sold to, and vice versa. The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. Commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side, all on the sell side, or a combination of both. Transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15%.

Throughout the 18th century, retailers began to adandon the prevailing system of bartering. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex in Paris, France were among the first in Europe to abandon the bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. The Palais retailers stocked luxury goods that appealed to the wealthy elite and upper middle classes. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, which adopted the trappings of a sophisticated, modern shopping complex and also changed pricing structures. y both the aristocracy and the middle classes. 

The Owenite socialists in Britain and the United States in the 1830s were the first to attempt to organize barter exchanges. Owenism developed a "theory of equitable exchange" as a critique of the exploitative wage relationship between capitalist and labourer, by which all profit accrued to the capitalist. To counteract the uneven playing field between employers and employed, they proposed "schemes of labour notes based on labour time, thus institutionalizing Owen's demand that human labour, not money, be made the standard of value." This alternate currency eliminated price variability between markets, as well as the role of merchants who bought low and sold high. The system arose in a period where paper currency was an innovation. Paper currency was an I.O.U. circulated by a bank (a promise to pay, not a payment in itself). Both merchants and an unstable paper currency created difficulties for direct producers.

An alternate currency, denominated in labour time, would prevent profit taking by middlemen; all goods exchanged would be priced only in terms of the amount of labour that went into them as expressed in the maxim '<a href="Cost%20the%20limit%20of%20price">Cost the limit of price</a>'. It became the basis of exchanges in London, and in America, where the idea was implemented at the <a href="New%20Harmony%2C%20Indiana">New Harmony</a> communal settlement by <a href="Josiah%20Warren">Josiah Warren</a> in 1826, and in his Cincinnati 'Time store' in 1827. Warren ideas were adopted by other Owenites and currency reformers, even though the labour exchanges were relatively short lived.

In England, about 30 to 40 cooperative societies sent their surplus goods to an "exchange bazaar" for direct barter in London, which later adopted a similar labour note. The British Association for Promoting Cooperative Knowledge established an "equitable labour exchange" in 1830. This was expanded as the National Equitable Labour Exchange in 1832 on Grays Inn Road in London. These efforts became the basis of the British cooperative movement of the 1840s. In 1848, the <a href="socialist">socialist</a> and first self-designated <a href="anarchist">anarchist</a> <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> postulated a system of "time chits". In 1875, <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> wrote of "Labor Certificates" ("Arbeitszertifikaten") in his <a href="Critique%20of%20the%20Gotha%20Program">Critique of the Gotha Program</a> of a "certificate from society that [the labourer] has furnished such and such an amount of labour", which can be used to draw "from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same amount of labour."

The first exchange system was the Swiss <a href="WIR%20Bank">WIR Bank</a>. It was founded in 1934 as a result of currency shortages after the stock market crash of 1929. "WIR" is both an abbreviation of Wirtschaftsring and the word for "we" in German, reminding participants that the economic circle is also a community.

In Spain (particularly the <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> region) there is a growing number of exchange markets. These barter markets or swap meets work without money. Participants bring things they do not need and exchange them for the unwanted goods of another participant. Swapping among three parties often helps satisfy tastes when trying to get around the rule that money is not allowed.

Michael Linton originated the term "local exchange trading system" (<a href="LETS">LETS</a>) in 1983 and for a time ran the <a href="Comox%20Valley%2C%20British%20Columbia">Comox Valley</a> LETSystems in <a href="Courtenay%2C%20British%20Columbia">Courtenay, British Columbia</a>. LETS networks use <a href="interest">interest</a>-free <a href="community-based%20economics">local</a> <a href="credit%20%28accounting%29">credit</a> so direct swaps do not need to be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other <a href="local%20currency">local currencies</a>, no <a href="scrip">scrip</a> is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered <a href="mutual%20credit">mutual credit</a> systems.

According to the <a href="International%20Reciprocal%20Trade%20Association">International Reciprocal Trade Association</a>, the industry trade body, more than 450,000 businesses transacted $10 billion globally in 2008 – and officials expect trade volume to grow by 15% in 2009.

It is estimated that over 450,000 businesses in the United States were involved in barter exchange activities in 2010. There are approximately 400 commercial and corporate barter companies serving all parts of the world. There are many opportunities for entrepreneurs to start a barter exchange. Several major cities in the U.S. and Canada do not currently have a local <a href="barter%20exchange">barter exchange</a>. There are two industry groups in the United States, the <a href="http%3A//www.natebarter.com">National Association of Trade Exchanges</a> (NATE) and the International Reciprocal Trade Association (IRTA). Both offer training and promote high ethical standards among their members. Moreover, each has created its own currency through which its member barter companies can trade. NATE's currency is the known as the BANC and IRTA's currency is called Universal Currency (UC).

In Canada, barter continues to thrive. The largest b2b barter exchange is Tradebank, founded in 1987. P2P bartering has seen a renaissance in major Canadian cities through Bunz - built as a network of Facebook groups that went on to become a stand-alone bartering based app in January 2016. Within the first year, Bunz accumulated over 75,000 users in over 200 cities worldwide.

In the United States, the largest barter exchange and corporate trade group is International Monetary Systems, founded in 1985, now with representation in various countries.

In Australia and New Zealand the largest barter exchange is <a href="Bartercard">Bartercard</a>, founded in 1991, with offices in the United Kingdom, United States, Cyprus, UAE and Thailand.

<a href="Corporation">Corporate</a> barter focuses on larger transactions, which is different from a traditional, retail oriented barter exchange. Corporate barter exchanges typically use media and advertising as leverage for their larger transactions. It entails the use of a currency unit called a "trade-credit". The trade-credit must not only be known and guaranteed, but also be valued in an amount the media and advertising could have been purchased for had the "client" bought it themselves (contract to eliminate ambiguity and risk).

Soviet <a href="bilateral%20trade">bilateral trade</a> is occasionally called "barter trade", because although the purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars, the transactions were credited to an international clearing account, avoiding the use of hard cash.

In the United States, <a href="Karl%20Hess">Karl Hess</a> used bartering to make it harder for the <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">IRS</a> to seize his wages and as a form of <a href="tax%20resistance">tax resistance</a>. Hess explained how he turned to barter in an <a href="op-ed">op-ed</a> for "The New York Times" in 1975. However the IRS now requires barter exchanges to be reported as per the <a href="Tax%20Equity%20and%20Fiscal%20Responsibility%20Act%20of%201982">Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982</a>. Barter exchanges are considered taxable revenue by the IRS and must be reported on a 1099-B form. According to the IRS, "The fair market value of goods and services exchanged must be included in the <a href="income">income</a> of both parties."

Other countries, though, do not have the reporting requirement that the U.S. does concerning proceeds from barter transactions, but taxation is handled the same way as a cash transaction. If one barters for a <a href="profit%20%28accounting%29">profit</a>, one pays the appropriate tax; if one generates a loss in the transaction, they have a loss. Bartering for business is also taxed accordingly as business income or business expense. Many barter exchanges require that one register as a business.

She had two older sisters, Yves (1838–1893) and Edma (1839–1921), plus a younger brother, Tiburce, born in 1848. The family moved to Paris in 1852, when Morisot was a child.

It was common practice for daughters of bourgeois families to receive art education, so Berthe and her sisters Yves and Edma were taught privately by Geoffroy-Alphonse Chocarne and . Morisot and her sisters initially started taking lessons so that they could each make a drawing for their father for his birthday. In 1857 Guichard, who ran a school for girls in Rue des Moulins, introduced Berthe and Edma to the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a> gallery where they could learn by looking, and from 1858 they learned by copying paintings. He also introduced them to the works of <a href="Gavarni">Gavarni</a>. Guichard later became the director of <a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Beaux-Arts">École des Beaux Arts</a> where Morisot's father earned his degree.

As art students, Berthe and Edma worked closely together until Edma married Adolphe Pontillon, a naval officer, moved to <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>, had children, and had less time to paint. Letters between the sisters show a loving relationship, underscored by Berthe's regret at the distance between them and Edma's withdrawal from painting. Edma wholeheartedly supported Berthe's continued work and their families always remained close. Edma wrote "“… I am often with you in thought, dear Berthe. I’m in your studio and I like to slip away, if only for a quarter of an hour, to breathe that atmosphere that we shared for many years…”".

Her sister Yves married Theodore Gobillard, a tax inspector, in 1866, and was painted by <a href="Edgar%20Degas">Edgar Degas</a> as "Mrs Theodore Gobillard" (<a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>).

Morisot registered as a <a href="copyist">copyist</a> at the Louvre where she befriended other artists and teachers including <a href="Camille%20Corot">Camille Corot</a>, the pivotal landscape painter of the <a href="Barbizon%20School">Barbizon School</a> who also excelled in figure painting. In 1860, under Corot's influence she took up the <a href="plein%20air">plein air</a> (outdoors) method of working. By 1863 she was studying under , another Barbizon painter. In the winter of 1863–64 she studied sculpture under <a href="Aim%C3%A9%20Millet">Aimé Millet</a>, but none of her sculpture is known to survive.

Morisot's first appearance in the <a href="Salon%20%28Paris%29">Salon de Paris</a> came at the age of twenty-three in 1864, with the acceptance of two <a href="landscape%20art">landscape</a> paintings. She continued to show regularly in the Salon, to generally favorable reviews, until 1873, the year before the first Impressionist exhibition. She exhibited with the Impressionists from 1874 onwards, only missing the exhibition in 1878 when her daughter was born.

Morisot's mature career began in 1872. She found an audience for her work with <a href="Durand-Ruel">Durand-Ruel</a>, the private dealer, who bought twenty-two paintings. In 1877, she was described by the critic for "Le Temps" as the "one real Impressionist in this group." She chose to exhibit under her full maiden name instead of using a pseudonym or her married name. In the 1880 exhibition, many reviews judged Morisot among the best, including "Le Figaro" critic <a href="Albert%20Wolff%20%28journalist%29">Albert Wolff</a>.


In 1868 Morisot became friends with <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Édouard Manet</a> who painted several portraits of her, including a striking study in a black veil while in mourning for her father. Correspondence between them shows warm affection, and Manet gave her an easel as a Christmas present. To her dismay he interfered with one of her Salon submissions whilst he was engaged to transport it, mistaking her self-criticism as an invitation to add corrections. Manet wrote: "The young Morisot girls are charming. It's annoying that they are not men. However, as women, they could serve the cause of painting by each marrying a member of the French Academy and sowing discord in the camp of those dotards." 

Although Manet is regarded as the master and Morisot as the follower, there is evidence that their relationship was reciprocal. Records show Manet's appreciation of her distinctive original style and compositional decisions, some of which he incorporated into his own work. It was Morisot who persuaded Manet to attempt <a href="plein%20air">plein air</a> painting, which she had been practising since having been introduced to it by Corot.

Morisot drew Manet into the circle of painters who became known as the Impressionists. In 1874, she married Manet's brother, Eugène, and they had one daughter, <a href="Julie%20Manet">Julie</a>, who became the subject for many of her mother's paintings. Julie's memoirs, "Growing Up with the Impressionists: The Diary of Julie Manet", were published in 1987.

Morisot’s works are almost always small in scale. She worked in oil paint, watercolors, or pastel, and sketched using various drawing media. Around 1880 she began painting on unprimed canvases—a technique Manet and <a href="Eva%20Gonzal%C3%A8s">Eva Gonzalès</a> also experimented with at the time—and her brushwork became looser. In 1888–89, her brushstrokes transitioned from short, rapid strokes to long, sinuous ones that define form. The outer edges of her paintings were often left unfinished, allowing the canvas to show through and increasing the sense of spontaneity. After 1885, she worked mostly from preliminary drawings before beginning her oil paintings.

Among her contemporary art critics such as Gustave Geoffrey in 1881, Morisot was hailed as "no one represents Impressionism with more refined talent or more authority than Morisot" 

Morisot creates a sense of space and depth through the use of color. Although her color palette was somewhat limited, her fellow impressionists regarded her as a "virtuoso colorist". She typically made expansive use of white, whether used as a pure white or mixed with other colors. In her large painting, "The Cherry Tree", colors are more vivid but are still used to emphasize form.

Morisot painted what she experienced on a daily basis. Her paintings reflect the 19th-century cultural restrictions of her class and gender. She avoided urban and street scenes and seldom painted the nude figure. Like her fellow Impressionist <a href="Mary%20Cassatt">Mary Cassatt</a>, she focused on domestic life and portraits in which she could use family and personal friends as models, including her daughter Julie and sister Edma. Prior to the 1860s, Morisot painted subjects in line with the Barbizon school before turning to scenes of contemporary femininity. Paintings like "The Cradle" (1872), in which she depicted current trends for nursery furniture, reflect her sensitivity to fashion and advertising, both of which would have been apparent to her female audience. Her works also include landscapes, portraits, garden settings and boating scenes. Later in her career Morisot worked with more ambitious themes, such as nudes. Corresponding with Morisot's interest in nude subjects, Morisot also began to focus more on preliminary drawings, completing many drypoints, charcoal, and color pencil drawings.

Morisot was married to <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Manet">Eugène Manet</a>, the brother of her friend and colleague <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Édouard Manet</a>, from 1874 until his death in 1892. In 1878 she gave birth to her only child, <a href="Julie%20Manet">Julie</a>, who posed frequently for her mother and other Impressionist artists, including Renoir and her uncle Édouard.

Morisot died on March 2, 1895, in Paris, of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> contracted while attending to her daughter Julie's similar illness, and thus orphaning her at the age of 16. She was interred in the <a href="Cimeti%C3%A8re%20de%20Passy">Cimetière de Passy</a>.

She was portrayed by actress <a href="Marine%20Delterme">Marine Delterme</a> in a 2012 French biographical TV film directed by <a href="Caroline%20Champetier">Caroline Champetier</a>. The character of Beatrice de Clerval in <a href="Elizabeth%20Kostova">Elizabeth Kostova</a>'s "<a href="The%20Swan%20Thieves">The Swan Thieves</a>" is largerly based on Morisot.

Morisot's work sold comparatively well. She achieved the two highest prices at a <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Drouot">Hôtel Drouot</a> auction in 1875, the "Interior (Young Woman with Mirror)" sold for 480 francs, and her pastel "On the Lawn" sold for 320 francs. Her works averaged 250 francs, the best relative prices at the auction.

In February 2013, Morisot became the highest priced female artist, when "After Lunch" (1881), a portrait of a young redhead in a straw hat and purple dress, sold for $10.9 million at a <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> auction. The painting achieved roughly three times its upper estimate, exceeding the $10.7 million for a sculpture by <a href="Louise%20Bourgeois">Louise Bourgeois</a> in 2012.

This limited selection is based in part on the book "Berthe Morisot" by Charles F. Stuckey, William P. Scott and Susan G. Lindsay, which is in turn drawn from the 1961 catalogue by Marie-Louise Bataille, Rouaart Denis and Georges Wildenstein. There are variations between the dates of execution, first showing and purchase. Titles may vary between sources.

Barnard College

Barnard College is a private <a href="Women%27s%20colleges%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's</a> <a href="Liberal%20arts%20colleges%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal arts college</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Founded in 1889 as a response to <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>'s refusal to admit women into their institution, it is the only women's college in New York City today. It has been affiliated with Columbia University since 1900.

The school was founded by <a href="Annie%20Nathan%20Meyer">Annie Nathan Meyer</a> and named after <a href="Frederick%20Augustus%20Porter%20Barnard">Frederick Barnard</a>, tenth president of Columbia. When Columbia became coeducational in 1983 Barnard elected to remain legally and financially separate but maintained its <a href="Affiliated%20school">affiliated relationship</a> with the university. This includes shared academic programs and other academic privileges, and a combined athletic program. Barnard students also receive Columbia University degrees and graduate at Columbia University graduation. Barnard confers the <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in about 50 areas of study. Students may also pursue elements of their education at the <a href="Juilliard%20School">Juilliard School</a> and <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">The Jewish Theological Seminary</a>.

Barnard's campus is located in the <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> neighborhood of <a href="Morningside%20Heights%2C%20Manhattan">Morningside Heights</a>, stretching along <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a> between <a href="116th%20Street%20%E2%80%93%20Columbia%20University%20%28IRT%20Broadway%20%E2%80%93%20Seventh%20Avenue%20Line%29">116th</a> and <a href="List%20of%20numbered%20streets%20in%20Manhattan">120th</a> Streets. It is directly across from Columbia's campus and near <a href="Morningside%20Heights%2C%20Manhattan%23Description">several other academic institutions</a>. The college is a member of the <a href="Seven%20Sisters%20%28colleges%29">Seven Sisters</a>, an association of seven prominent women's liberal arts colleges.

For its first 229 years <a href="Columbia%20College%2C%20Columbia%20University">Columbia College</a> of <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> admitted only men for undergraduate study. Barnard College was founded in 1889 as a response to Columbia's refusal to admit women into its institution.

The college was named after <a href="Frederick%20Augustus%20Porter%20Barnard">Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard</a>, a <a href="deaf">deaf</a> American educator and mathematician who served as the tenth president of Columbia from 1864 to 1889. He advocated equal educational privileges for men and women, preferably in a coeducational setting, and began proposing in 1879 that Columbia admit women. The board of trustees repeatedly rejected Barnard's suggestion, but in 1883 agreed to create a detailed syllabus of study for women. While they could not attend Columbia classes, those who passed examinations based on the syllabus would receive a degree. The first such woman graduate received her bachelor's degree in 1887. A former student of the program, <a href="Annie%20Nathan%20Meyer">Annie Meyer</a>, and other prominent New York women persuaded the board in 1889 to create a women's college connected to Columbia.

Barnard College's original 1889 home was a rented <a href="brownstone">brownstone</a> at 343 Madison Avenue, where a faculty of six offered instruction to 14 students in the School of Arts, as well as to 22 "specials", who lacked the entrance requirements in Greek and so enrolled in science. When Columbia University announced in 1892 its impending move to Morningside Heights, Barnard built a new campus on 119th-120th Streets with gifts from Mary E. Brinckerhoff, <a href="Elizabeth%20Milbank%20Anderson">Elizabeth Milbank Anderson</a> and Martha Fiske. <a href="Milbank%2C%20Brinckerhoff%2C%20and%20Fiske%20Halls">Milbank, Brinckerhoff, and Fiske Halls</a>, built in 1897–1898, were listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2003.

<a href="Ella%20Weed">Ella Weed</a> supervised the college in its first four years; <a href="Emily%20James%20Smith%20Putnam">Emily James Smith</a> succeeded her as Barnard's first dean. As the college grew it needed additional space, and in 1903 it received the three blocks south of 119th Street from Anderson who had purchased a former portion of the Bloomingdale Asylum site from the New York Hospital. By the mid-20th century Barnard had succeeded in its original goal of providing a top tier education to women. Between 1920 and 1974, only the much larger <a href="Hunter%20College">Hunter College</a> and <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> produced more women graduates who later received doctorate degrees. <a href="Students%27%20Hall">Students' Hall</a>, now known as Barnard Hall, was built in 1916. <a href="Brooks%20and%20Hewitt%20Halls">Brooks and Hewitt Halls</a> were built in 1906–1907 and 1926–1927, respectively. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. <a href="Jessica%20Garretson%20Finch">Jessica Finch</a> is credited with coining the phrase, "current events," while teaching at Barnard College in the 1890s.

Barnard confers the <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in about 50 areas of study. Joint programs for the <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> and other degrees exist with Columbia University, <a href="Juilliard%20School">Juilliard School</a>, and <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">The Jewish Theological Seminary</a>. The six most popular majors at the college are English, psychology, political science, economics, history, and biology.

The liberal arts requirements are called the Nine Ways of Knowing. Students must take one year of one laboratory science, study a single foreign language for four semesters, and complete one 3-credit course in each of the following categories: reason and value, social analysis, historical studies, cultures in comparison, quantitative and deductive reasoning, literature, and visual and performing arts. The use of AP or IB credit to fulfill these requirements is very limited, but Nine Ways of Knowing courses may overlap with major or minor requirements. In addition to the Nine Ways of Knowing, students must complete a first-year seminar, a first-year English course, and one semester of physical education.
The Nine Ways of Knowing was replaced with Foundations in 2016. Students must take the First Year Experience which includes two semesters of seminars, complete Distributional Requirements within many subjects, and six Modes of Thinking courses.
"Foundations is uniquely Barnard. It's a diverse and
forward-looking curriculum that asks our students to think
theoretically, empirically, and technologically, to write
effectively; and to speak persuasively — all while giving them
the freedom to shape their own educational experience."
— Linda A. Bell, Provost

Admissions to Barnard is considered very selective by "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>". It is the most selective women's college in the nation; in 2017, Barnard had the lowest acceptance rate of the five <a href="Seven%20Sisters%20%28colleges%29">Seven Sisters</a> that remain single-sex in admissions.

The class of 2021's admission rate was 14.8% of the 7,716 applicants, the lowest acceptance rate in the institution's history. The early-decision admission rate for the class of 2020 was 47.7%, out of 787 applications. The median SAT Combined was 2080, with median subscores of 700 in Math, in 705 Critical Reading, and 720 in Writing. The Median ACT score was 32. Of the women in the class of 2012, 89.4% ranked in first or second decile at their high school (of the 41.3% ranked by their schools). The average <a href="Grade%20%28education%29">GPA</a> of the class of 2012 was 94.3 on a 100-point scale and 3.88 on a 4.0 scale. In 2015 Barnard announced that it would admit transgender women who "consistently live and identify as women, regardless of the gender assigned to them at birth", and would continue to support and enroll those students who transitioned to males after they had already been admitted.

In the 2014 U.S. News & World Report rankings, Barnard was ranked as the 32nd best liberal arts college in the country. The ranking came under widespread criticism, as it only accounted for institution-specific resources. Greg Brown, chief operating officer at Barnard, said, "I believe that our ranking is lower than it should be, primarily because the methodology simply can't account for the Barnard-Columbia relationship. Because the Columbia relationship doesn't fit neatly into any of the survey categories, it is essentially ignored. Rankings are inherently limited in this way."

In 1998, then president <a href="Judith%20Shapiro">Judith Shapiro</a> compared the ranking service to the "equivalent of "Sport's Illustrated" swimsuit issue." According to Shapiro's letter, "Such a ranking system certainly does more harm than good in terms of educating the public." On June 19, 2007, following a meeting of the <a href="Annapolis%20Group">Annapolis Group</a>, which represents over 100 liberal arts colleges, Barnard announced that it would no longer participate in the U.S. News annual survey, and that they would fashion their own way to collect and report common data.

 While students are allowed to use the libraries at Columbia University, Barnard has always maintained a library of its own. <a href="Lehman%20Hall">Lehman Hall</a> was the site of Barnard's <a href="Wollman%20Library">Wollman Library</a> from its opening in 1959 until 2015. , the Lehman Hall building is being <a href="demolished">demolished</a> to make way for a new library facility. Barnard's Teaching and Learning Center, the planned replacement for the earlier building, is scheduled to open in August 2018.

In 2016, portions of the Barnard Library were relocated to the former LeFrak <a href="Gym">Gym</a>nasium as well as the first two floors of Barnard Hall. 18,000 volumes were also moved to the Milstein rooms in Columbia University's <a href="Butler%20Library">Butler Library</a>. The relocation plans proved to be contentious among faculty at the college, who objected to sending a large portion of the library's holdings off site, as well as a "lack of transparency surrounding the decision-making process", according to "<a href="Library%20Journal">Library Journal</a>".

The LeFrak Center houses study space, librarians' offices, the <a href="zine">zine</a> collection, course reserves, and new books acquired since July 2015. The Barnard Library also houses the Archives and Special Collections, a repository of official and student publications, photographs, letters, alumnae scrapbooks and other material that documents Barnard's history from its founding in 1889 to the present day. Among the collections are the <a href="Ntozake%20Shange">Ntozake Shange</a> papers and various student publications.

Borne of a proposal by longtime <a href="zinester">zinester</a> Jenna Freedman, Barnard collects zines in an effort to document <a href="third-wave%20feminism">third-wave feminism</a> and <a href="Riot%20Grrrl">Riot Grrrl</a> culture. According to Freedman, zine collections such as Barnard's provide a home for the voices of young women otherwise not represented in library collections. The Zine Collection's website states: 

, the library had approximately 4,000 different zines available to library patrons, including zines about <a href="Race%20%28classification%20of%20human%20beings%29">race</a>, gender, <a href="Human%20sexuality">sexuality</a>, <a href="childbirth">childbirth</a>, <a href="mother">mother</a>hood, <a href="politics">politics</a>, and <a href="Intimate%20relationship">relationships</a>. The library keeps a collection of zines for <a href="Library%20circulation">lending</a> and another <a href="archived">archived</a> collection in the Barnard Archives. Both collections are <a href="Library%20catalog">catalogued</a> in "CLIO", the Columbia/Barnard <a href="Online%20public%20access%20catalog">Online public access catalog</a>.

Every Barnard student is part of the <a href="Students%27%20union">Student Government Association</a> (SGA), which elects a representative <a href="Student%20governments%20in%20the%20United%20States">student government</a>. SGA aims to facilitate the expression of opinions on matters that directly affect the Barnard community.

Student groups include <a href="theatre">theatre</a> and vocal music groups, language clubs, <a href="literary%20magazines">literary magazines</a>, a freeform radio station called <a href="WBAR%20%28college%20radio%29">WBAR</a>, a biweekly magazine called the "Barnard Bulletin", community service groups, and others.

Barnard students can also join <a href="Extracurricular%20activity">extracurricular activities</a> or organizations at Columbia University, while Columbia University students are allowed in most, but not all, Barnard organizations. Barnard's McIntosh Activities Council (commonly known as McAC), named after the first President of Barnard, Millicent McIntosh, organizes various community focused events on campus, such as Big Sub and <a href="Midnight%20breakfast">Midnight Breakfast</a>. McAC is made up of five sub-committees which are the Mosaic committee (formerly known as Multicultural), the Wellness committee, the Network committee, the Community committee, and the Action committee. Each committee has a different focus, such as hosting and publicizing identity and cultural events (Mosaic), having health and wellness related events (Wellness), giving students opportunities to be involved with Alumnae and various professionals (Network), planning events that bring the entire student body together (Community), and planning community service events that give back to the surrounding community (Action).

Barnard College officially banned sororities in 1913, but Barnard students continue to participate in Columbia's six National Panhellenic Conference sororities—<a href="Alpha%20Chi%20Omega">Alpha Chi Omega</a>, <a href="Alpha%20Omicron%20Pi">Alpha Omicron Pi</a>, <a href="Delta%20Gamma">Delta Gamma</a>, <a href="Gamma%20Phi%20Beta">Gamma Phi Beta</a>, <a href="Kappa%20Alpha%20Theta">Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, and <a href="Sigma%20Delta%20Tau">Sigma Delta Tau</a>—and the <a href="National%20Pan-Hellenic%20Council">National Pan-Hellenic Council</a> Sororities- <a href="Alpha%20Kappa%20Alpha">Alpha Kappa Alpha</a> (Lambda chapter) and <a href="Delta%20Sigma%20Theta">Delta Sigma Theta</a> (Rho chapter) as well as other sororities in the Multicultural Greek Council. Two <a href="National%20Panhellenic%20Conference">National Panhellenic Conference</a> organizations were founded at Barnard College. The <a href="Alpha%20Omicron%20Pi">Alpha Omicron Pi</a> Fraternity, founded on January 2, 1897, left campus during the 1913 ban but returned to establish its Alpha chapter in 2013. The <a href="Alpha%20Epsilon%20Phi">Alpha Epsilon Phi</a>, founded on October 24, 1909, is no longer on campus. As of 2010, Barnard does not fully recognize the National Panhellenic Conference sororities at Columbia, but it does provide some funding to account for Barnard students living in Columbia housing through these organizations.

Take Back the Night: Each April, Barnard and Columbia students participate in the <a href="Take%20Back%20the%20Night%20%28protest%29">Take Back the Night</a> march and speak-out. This annual event grew out of a 1988 <a href="Seven%20Sisters%20%28colleges%29">Seven Sisters</a> conference. The march has grown from under 200 participants in 1988 to more than 2,500 in 2007.

<a href="Midnight%20breakfast">Midnight Breakfast</a> marks the beginning of finals week. As a highly popular event and long-standing college tradition, Midnight Breakfast is hosted by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council). In addition to providing standard breakfast foods, each year's theme is also incorporated into the menu. Past themes have included "I YUMM the 90s," "<a href="Grease%20%28musical%29">Grease</a>," and "<a href="Take%20Me%20Out%20to%20the%20Ball%20Game">Take Me Out to the Ballgame</a>." The event is a school-wide affair as college deans, trustees and the President, <a href="Debora%20Spar">Debora Spar</a>, serve food to about a thousand students. It takes place the- night before finals begin every semester.

Night Carnival: In the spring of each year, Barnard holds the Night Carnival, in which many of Barnard's student groups set up tables with games and prizes. The event is organized by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council).

The "Barnard Bulletin" in 1976 described the relationship between the college and Columbia University as "intricate and ambiguous". Barnard president <a href="Debora%20Spar">Debora Spar</a> said in 2012 that "the relationship is admittedly a complicated one, a unique one and one that may take a few sentences to explain to the outside community".

Outside sources often describe Barnard as part of Columbia; "The New York Times" in 2013, for example, called Barnard "an undergraduate women's college of Columbia University". The college's front gates state "Barnard College of Columbia University". Barnard describes itself as "both an independently incorporated educational institution and an official college of Columbia University", and advises students to state "Barnard College, Columbia University" or "Barnard College of Columbia University" on résumés. <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> includes Barnard students and alumnae within the Columbia interest group.

Columbia describes Barnard as an affiliated institution that is a faculty of the university or is "in partnership with" it. Both the college and Columbia evaluate Barnard faculty for tenure, and Barnard graduates receive Columbia University diplomas signed by both the Barnard and Columbia presidents.

Although Barnard College serves as a Columbia University Faculty unit, the College holds its own corporate status separate from Columbia University, including an independent administrative structure, board of trustees and endowment. In practice, it shares many institutional resources with Columbia University, including the library and health service systems and the University's recreational center. Degrees conferred to students are conferred by the Board of Trustees from both Barnard College and Columbia University. The Columbia University degree is the only degree given to all Barnard students (Barnard does not grant its own degrees independently). Like <a href="Teachers%20College">Teachers College</a>, Barnard College is defined as an affiliate of Columbia University. Both Barnard and Teachers College graduates are given the rights to attend the Columbia Alumni Association events and are eligible for nomination of the distinguished alumni award. In short, Barnard and Teachers College graduates are considered alumni of Columbia University.

Smith and Columbia president <a href="Seth%20Low">Seth Low</a> worked to open Columbia classes to Barnard students. By 1900 they could attend Columbia classes in philosophy, political science, and several scientific fields. That year Barnard formalized an affiliation with the university which made available to its students the instruction and facilities of Columbia. <a href="Franz%20Boas">Franz Boas</a>, who taught at both Columbia and Barnard in the early 1900s, was among those faculty members who reportedly found Barnard students superior to their male Columbia counterparts. From 1955 Columbia and Barnard students could register for the other school's classes with the permission of the instructor; from 1973 no permission was needed.

Except for Columbia College, by the 1940s other undergraduate and graduate divisions of Columbia University admitted women. Columbia president <a href="William%20J.%20McGill">William J. McGill</a> predicted in 1970 that Barnard College and Columbia College would merge within five years. In 1973 Columbia and Barnard signed a three-year agreement to increase sharing classrooms, facilities, and housing, and cooperation in faculty appointments, which they described as "integration without assimilation"; by the mid-1970s most Columbia dormitories were coed. The university's financial difficulties during the decade increased its desire to merge to end what Columbia described as the "anachronism" of single-sex education, but Barnard resisted doing so because of Columbia's large debt, rejecting in 1975 Columbia dean <a href="Peter%20Pouncey">Peter Pouncey</a>'s proposal to merge Barnard and the three Columbia undergraduate schools. The 1973-1976 chairwoman of the board at Barnard, Eleanor Thomas Elliott, led the resistance to this takeover. The college's marketing emphasized the Columbia relationship, however, the "Bulletin" in 1976 stating that Barnard described it as identical to the one between <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a> and <a href="Radcliffe%20College">Radcliffe College</a> ("who are merged in practically everything but name at this point").

After Barnard rejected subsequent merger proposals from Columbia and a one-year extension to the 1973 agreement expired, in 1977 the two schools began discussing their future relationship. By 1979 the relationship had so deteriorated that Barnard officials stopped attending meetings. Because of an expected decline in enrollment, In 1980 a Columbia committee recommended that Columbia College begin admitting women without Barnard's cooperation. A 1981 committee found that Columbia was no longer competitive with other Ivy League universities without women, and that admitting women would not affect Barnard's applicant pool. That year Columbia president <a href="Michael%20Sovern">Michael Sovern</a> agreed for the two schools to cooperate in admitting women to Columbia, but Barnard faculty's opposition caused president <a href="Ellen%20Futter">Ellen Futter</a> to reject the agreement.

A decade of negotiations for a Columbia-Barnard merger akin to Harvard and Radcliffe had failed. In January 1982, the two schools instead announced that Columbia College would begin admitting women in 1983, and Barnard's control over tenure for its faculty would increase; previously, a committee on which Columbia faculty outnumbered Barnard's three to two controlled the latter's tenure. Applications to Columbia rose 56% that year, making admission more selective, and nine Barnard students transferred to Columbia. Eight students admitted to both Columbia and Barnard chose Barnard, while 78 chose Columbia. Within a few years, however, selectivity rose at both schools as they received more women applicants than expected.

The Columbia-Barnard affiliation continued. Barnard pays Columbia about $5 million a year under the terms of the "interoperate relationship", which the two schools renegotiate every 15 years. Despite the affiliation Barnard is legally and financially separate from Columbia, with an independent faculty and board of trustees. It is responsible for its own separate admissions, health, security, guidance and placement services, and has its own alumnae association. Nonetheless, Barnard students participate in the academic, social, athletic and extracurricular life of the broader University community on a reciprocal basis. The affiliation permits the two schools to share some academic resources; for example, only Barnard has an <a href="urban%20studies">urban studies</a> department, and only Columbia has a <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> department. Most Columbia classes are open to Barnard students and vice versa. Barnard students and faculty are represented in the University Senate, and student organizations such as the "<a href="Columbia%20Daily%20Spectator">Columbia Daily Spectator</a>" are open to all students. Barnard students play on Columbia athletics teams, and Barnard uses Columbia email, telephone and network services.

Barnard athletes compete in the <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> (<a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29">Division I</a>) through the Columbia/Barnard Athletic Consortium, which was established in 1983. Through this arrangement, Barnard is the only <a href="Women%27s%20colleges%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's college</a> offering Division I athletics. There are 15 <a href="College%20athletics">intercollegiate teams</a>, and students also compete at the <a href="Intramural%20sports">intramural</a> and club levels. From 1975–1983, before the establishment of the Columbia/Barnard Athletic Consortium, Barnard students competed as the "Barnard Bears". Prior to 1975, students referred to themselves as the "Barnard honeybears".

Established within the Barnard Student Government Association (SGA), The Seven Sisters Governing Board represents Barnard College as part of the Seven Sisters Coalition, which is a group of representatives from student councils of the historic Seven Sisters colleges. The reps on the coordinating board of Seven Sisters Coalition are rotating every year to hold the annual Seven Sisters Conference in a serious but informal setting. The first Seven Sisters Conference was hosted by SGA student representatives at Barnard College in 2009. In fall 2013, the conference was hosted by <a href="Vassar%20College">Vassar College</a> during the first weekend of November. The major topic focused on inner college collaborations and differences in student government structures among Seven Sisters Colleges. The Seven Sisters Coordinating Board of Barnard brought six Barnard student representatives to attend the Fall Semester conference, which was hosted at Vassar College in the past fall semester. Based on the Coalition Coordinating Board Constitution established in February 2013, Students delegates were initiating projects in the aspects of public relations, alumni outreach and website management to promote the presence and development of the seven sisters culture. Meanwhile, The Barnard delegates engaged in discussions about the various structures of the student governments among the historic seven sisters colleges.

Barnard College has issued a statement affirming its commitment to <a href="Sustainability">environmental sustainability</a>, a major part of which is the goal of reducing its <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions by 30% by 2017. Student EcoReps work as a resource on environmental issues for students in Barnard's residence halls, while the student-run Earth Coalition works on outreach initiatives such as local park clean-ups, tutoring elementary school students in environmental education, and sponsoring environmental forums. Barnard earned a "C-" for its sustainability efforts on the <a href="Campus%20Carbon%20Neutrality%23Sustainable%20Endowments%20Institute%20%26amp%3B%20the%20College%20Sustainability%20Report%20Card">College Sustainability Report Card</a> 2009 published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Its highest marks were in Student Involvement and Food and Recycling, receiving a "B" in both categories.

In the spring of 1960, Columbia University president Grayson Kirk complained to the president of Barnard that Barnard students were wearing inappropriate clothing. The garments in question were pants and Bermuda shorts. The administration forced the student council to institute a dress code. Students would be allowed to wear shorts and pants only at Barnard and only if the shorts were no more than two inches above the knee and the pants were not tight. Barnard women crossing the street to enter the Columbia campus wearing shorts or pants were required to cover themselves with a long coat.

In March 1968, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" ran an article on students who cohabited, identifying one of the persons they interviewed as a student at Barnard College from New Hampshire named "Susan". Barnard officials searched their records for women from New Hampshire and were able to determine that "Susan" was the pseudonym of a student (Linda LeClair) who was living with her boyfriend, a student at Columbia University. She was called before Barnard's student-faculty administration judicial committee, where she faced the possibility of expulsion. A student protest included a petition signed by 300 other Barnard women, admitting that they too had broken the regulations against cohabitating. The judicial committee reached a compromise and the student was allowed to remain in school, but was denied use of the college cafeteria and barred from all social activities. The student briefly became a focus of intense national attention. She eventually dropped out of Barnard.

Barnard College has graduated many prominent leaders in science, religion, politics, the Peace Corps, medicine, law, education, communications, and business; and acclaimed actors, architects, artists, astronauts, engineers, human rights activists, inventors, musicians, philanthropists, and writers. Among these include: <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> Representative of Japan, <a href="Akiko%20Yuge">Akiko Yuge</a> (1975), author <a href="Zora%20Neale%20Hurston">Zora Neale Hurston</a>, author and political activist <a href="Grace%20Lee%20Boggs">Grace Lee Boggs</a> (1935), television host <a href="Ronnie%20Eldridge">Ronnie Eldridge</a> (1952), <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> <a href="Helen%20Gahagan">Helen Gahagan</a> (1924), CEO of <a href="CARE%20%28relief%20agency%29">CARE USA</a> and chair of the <a href="Presidential%20Advisory%20Council%20on%20HIV/AIDS">Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS</a> <a href="Helene%20D.%20Gayle">Helene D.

Order of Saint Benedict

The Order of Saint Benedict (OSB; <a href="Latin">Latin</a>: "Ordo Sancti Benedicti"), also knownin reference to the colour of its members' <a href="Religious%20habit">habit</a>sas the Black Monks, is a <a href="Catholic%20religious%20order">Catholic religious order</a> of independent <a href="Christian%20monasticism">monastic</a> <a href="Cenobium">communities</a> that observe the <a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a>. Each community (<a href="monastery">monastery</a>, <a href="priory">priory</a> or <a href="abbey">abbey</a>) within the order maintains its own <a href="wikt%3Aautonomy">autonomy</a>, while the order itself represents their mutual interests. The terms "Order of Saint Benedict" and "Benedictine Order" are, however, also used to refer to "all" Benedictine communities collectively, sometimes giving the incorrect impression that there exists a <a href="Superior%20general">generalate</a> or <a href="motherhouse">motherhouse</a> with jurisdiction over them.

Internationally, the order is governed by the <a href="Benedictine%20Confederation">Benedictine Confederation</a>, a body, established in 1883 by <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a>'s <a href="Papal%20brief">Brief</a> "Summum semper", whose head is known as the <a href="Abbot">Abbot Primate</a>. Individuals whose communities are members of the order generally add the initials "OSB" after their names.

The monastery at <a href="Subiaco%2C%20Lazio">Subiaco</a> in Italy, established by <a href="Saint%20Benedict%20of%20Nursia">Saint Benedict of Nursia</a> <a href="circa">circa</a> 529, was the first of the dozen monasteries he founded. He later founded the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Monte%20Cassino">Abbey of Monte Cassino</a>. There is no evidence, however, that he intended to found an order and the <a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a> presupposes the autonomy of each community. When Monte Cassino was sacked by the Lombards about the year 580, the monks fled to Rome, and it seems probable that this constituted an important factor in the diffusion of a knowledge of Benedictine monasticism.

It was from the monastery of St. Andrew in Rome that <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine</a>, the prior, and his forty companions set forth in 595 on their mission for the evangelization of England. At various stopping places during the journey, the monks left behind them traditions concerning their rule and form of life, and probably also some copies of the Rule. <a href="L%C3%A9rins%20Abbey">Lérins Abbey</a>, for instance, founded by <a href="Honoratus">Honoratus</a> in 375, probably received its first knowledge of the Benedictine Rule from the visit of St. Augustine and his companions in 596.

<a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a> says that at Ainay, in the sixth century, the monks "followed the rules of Basil, Cassian, Caesarius, and other fathers, taking and using whatever seemed proper to the conditions of time and place", and doubtless the same liberty was taken with the Benedictine Rule when it reached them. In Gaul and Switzerland, it supplemented the much stricter Irish or Celtic Rule introduced by <a href="Columbanus">Columbanus</a> and others. In many monasteries it eventually entirely displaced the earlier codes.
By the ninth century, however, the Benedictine had become the standard form of monastic life throughout the whole of Western Europe, excepting Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, where the Celtic observance still prevailed for another century or two. Largely through the work of <a href="Benedict%20of%20Aniane">Benedict of Aniane</a>, it became the rule of choice for monasteries throughout the Carolingian empire.

Monastic scriptoria flourished from the ninth through the twelfth centuries. Sacred Scripture was always at the heart of every monastic scriptorium. As a general rule those of the monks who possessed skill as writers made this their chief, if not their sole active work. An anonymous writer of the ninth or tenth century speaks of six hours a day as the usual task of a scribe, which would absorb almost all the time available for active work in the day of a medieval monk.

In the Middle Ages monasteries were often founded by the nobility. <a href="Cluny%20Abbey">Cluny Abbey</a> was founded by <a href="William%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Aquitaine">William I, Duke of Aquitaine</a> in 910. The abbey was noted for its strict adherence to the Rule of St. Benedict. The abbot of Cluny was the superior of all the daughter houses, through appointed priors.

One of the earliest reforms of Benedictine practice was that initiated in 980 by <a href="Romuald">Romuald</a>, who founded the <a href="Camaldolese">Camaldolese</a> community.

The English Benedictine Congregation is the oldest of the nineteen Benedictine congregations. Augustine of Canterbury and his monks established the first English Benedictine monastery at Canterbury soon after their arrival in 597. Other foundations quickly followed. Through the influence of <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>, <a href="Benedict%20Biscop">Benedict Biscop</a>, and <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a>, the Benedictine Rule spread with extraordinary rapidity, and in the North it was adopted in most of the monasteries that had been founded by the Celtic missionaries from Iona. Many of the episcopal sees of England were founded and governed by the Benedictines, and no less than nine of the old cathedrals were served by the black monks of the priories attached to them. Monasteries served as hospitals and places of refuge for the weak and homeless. The monks studied the healing properties of plants and minerals to alleviate the sufferings of the sick.

Germany was evangelized by English Benedictines. <a href="Willibrord">Willibrord</a> and <a href="Boniface">Boniface</a> preached there in the seventh and eighth centuries and founded several abbeys.
In the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, all <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries">monasteries were dissolved</a> and their lands confiscated by the Crown, forcing their <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> members to flee into exile on the Continent. During the 19th century they were able to return to England, including to <a href="Selby%20Abbey">Selby Abbey</a> in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, one of the few great monastic churches to survive the Dissolution.
<a href="Minster-in-Thanet">St. Mildred's Priory</a>, on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Thanet">Isle of Thanet</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, was built in 1027 on the site of an abbey founded in 670 by the daughter of the first Christian <a href="King%20of%20Kent">King of Kent</a>. Currently the priory is home to a community of Benedictine nuns. Five of the most notable English abbeys are the Basilica of St Gregory the Great at Downside, commonly known as <a href="Downside%20Abbey">Downside Abbey</a>, The Abbey of St Edmund, King and Martyr commonly known as <a href="Douai%20Abbey">Douai Abbey</a> in Upper Woolhampton, Reading, Berkshire, <a href="Ealing%20Abbey">Ealing Abbey</a> in Ealing, West London, St. Lawrence's in Yorkshire (<a href="Ampleforth%20Abbey">Ampleforth Abbey</a>), and <a href="Worth%20Abbey">Worth Abbey</a>. <a href="Prinknash%20Abbey">Prinknash Abbey</a>, used by Henry VIII as a hunting lodge, was officially returned to the Benedictines four hundred years later, in 1928. During the next few years, so-called Prinknash Park was used as a home until it was returned to the order.

Since the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a>, there has also been a modest flourishing of Benedictine monasticism in the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Church</a> and Protestant Churches. Anglican Benedictine Abbots are invited guests of the Benedictine Abbot Primate in Rome at Abbatial gatherings at Sant'Anselmo. There are an estimated 2,400 celibate Anglican Religious (1,080 men and 1,320 women) in the Anglican Communion as a whole, some of whom have adopted the Rule of St. Benedict.

As of 2015, the English Congregation consists of three abbeys of nuns and ten abbeys of monks. Members of the congregation are found in England, Wales, the United States of America, Peru and Zimbabwe.

The forty-eighth rule of Saint Benedict prescribes extensive and habitual "holy reading" for the brethren. Three primary types of reading were done by the monks during this time. Monks would read privately during their personal time, as well as publicly during services and at meal times. In addition to these three mentioned in the Rule, monks would also read in the infirmary.

However, Benedictine monks were disallowed worldly possessions, thus necessitating the preservation and collection of sacred texts in monastic libraries for communal use. For the sake of convenience, the books in the monastery were housed in a few different places, namely the <a href="sacristy">sacristy</a>, which contained books for the choir and other liturgical books, the <a href="rectory">rectory</a>, which housed books for public reading such as sermons and lives of the saints, and the <a href="library">library</a>, which contained the largest collection of books and was typically in the cloister.

The first record of a monastic library in England is in <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. To assist with <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a>'s <a href="Gregorian%20mission">English mission</a>, Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Gregory the Great</a> gave him nine books which included the Gregorian Bible in two volumes, the Psalter of Augustine, two copies of the <a href="Gospels">Gospels</a>, two <a href="martyrologies">martyrologies</a>, an Exposition of the Gospels and Epistles, and a <a href="Psalter">Psalter</a>. <a href="Theodore%20of%20Tarsus">Theodore of Tarsus</a> brought Greek books to Canterbury more than seventy years later, when he founded a school for the study of Greek.

Monasteries were among the institutions of the Catholic Church swept away during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. Monasteries were again allowed to form in the 19th century under the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">Bourbon Restoration</a>. Later that century, under the <a href="Third%20French%20Republic">Third French Republic</a>, laws were enacted preventing religious teaching. The original intent was to allow secular schools. Thus in 1880 and 1882, Benedictine teaching monks were effectively exiled; this was not completed until 1901.

The first Benedictine to live in the United States was Pierre-Joseph Didier. He came to the United States in 1790 from <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and served in the Ohio and St. Louis areas until his death. The first actual Benedictine monastery founded was <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20Archabbey">Saint Vincent Archabbey</a>, located in <a href="Latrobe%2C%20Pennsylvania">Latrobe</a>, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1832 by <a href="Boniface%20Wimmer">Bonifice Wimmer</a>, a German monk, who sought to serve German immigrants in America. In 1856, Wimmer started to lay the foundations for <a href="Saint%20John%27s%20Abbey%2C%20Collegeville">St. John's Abbey</a> in Minnesota. By his death in 1887, Wimmer had sent Benedictine monks to Kansas, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Illinois, and Colorado.

Wimmer also asked for Benedictine sisters to be sent to America by St. Walburg Convent in <a href="Eichst%C3%A4tt">Eichstätt</a>, Bavaria. In 1852, Sister Benedicta Riepp and two other sisters founded <a href="St.%20Marys%2C%20Pennsylvania">St. Marys, Pennsylvania</a>. Soon they would send sisters to Michigan, New Jersey, and Minnesota.

By 1854, Swiss monks began to arrive and founded <a href="St.%20Meinrad%20Archabbey">St. Meinrad Abbey</a> in Indiana, and they soon spread to Arkansas and Louisiana. They were soon followed by Swiss sisters.

There are now over 100 Benedictine houses across America. Most Benedictine houses are part of one of four large Congregations: American-Cassinese, Swiss-American, St. Scholastica, and St. Benedict. The congregations mostly are made up of monasteries that share the same lineage. For instance the American-Cassinese congregation included the 22 monasteries that descended from Boniface Wimmer.

Today, Benedictine monasticism is fundamentally different from other Western religious orders insofar as its individual communities are not part of a religious order with "Generalates" and "Superiors General". Rather, in modern times, the various autonomous houses have formed themselves loosely into congregations (for example, Cassinese, English, Solesmes, Subiaco, Camaldolese, Sylvestrines) that in turn are represented in the <a href="Benedictine%20Confederation">Benedictine Confederation</a> that came into existence through <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a>'s Apostolic Brief "Summum semper" on 12 July 1883. This organization facilitates dialogue of Benedictine communities with each other and the relationship between Benedictine communities and other <a href="religious%20order">religious order</a>s and the church at large. 

The Rule of Saint Benedict is also used by a number of religious orders that began as reforms of the Benedictine tradition such as the <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a>s and <a href="Trappist">Trappist</a>s although none of these groups are part of the <a href="Benedictine%20Confederation">Benedictine Confederation</a>. 

Although Benedictines traditionally refer to Catholics, there are also some within the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> and occasionally within other Christian denominations as well, for example, within the <a href="Lutheran%20Church">Lutheran Church</a>, that claim adherence to the Rule of Saint Benedict. 

Section 17 in chapter 58 of the <a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a> states the solemn promise candidates for reception into a Benedictine community are required to make: a promise of stability (i.e. to remain in the same community), "conversatio morum" (an idiomatic Latin phrase suggesting "conversion of manners"; see below) and obedience (to the community's superior, seen as holding the place of Christ within it). This solemn commitment tends to be referred to as the "Benedictine vow" and is the Benedictine antecedent and equivalent of the <a href="evangelical%20counsels">evangelical counsels</a> professed by candidates for reception into a <a href="religious%20order">religious order</a>.

Much scholarship over the last fifty years has been dedicated to the translation and interpretation of ""conversatio morum"". The older translation "conversion of life" has generally been replaced with phrases such as "[conversion to] a monastic manner of life", drawing from the Vulgate's use of "conversatio" as a translation of "citizenship" or "homeland" in Philippians 3:20. Some scholars have claimed that the vow formula of the Rule is best translated as "to live in this place as a monk, in obedience to its rule and abbot."

Benedictine <a href="abbot">abbot</a>s and <a href="abbess">abbess</a>es have full jurisdiction of their <a href="abbey">abbey</a> and thus absolute authority over the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20monk">monk</a>s or <a href="nun">nun</a>s who are resident. This authority includes the power to assign duties, to decide which books may or may not be read, to regulate comings and goings, and to punish and to <a href="excommunicate">excommunicate</a>, in the sense of an enforced isolation from the monastic community.

A tight communal timetablethe <a href="horarium">horarium</a>is meant to ensure that the time given by God is not wasted but used in God's service, whether for prayer, work, meals, spiritual reading or sleep.

Although Benedictines do not take a vow of silence, hours of strict silence are set, and at other times silence is maintained as much as is practically possible. Social conversations tend to be limited to communal recreation times. But such details, like the many other details of the daily routine of a Benedictine house that the Rule of St Benedict leaves to the discretion of the superior, are set out in its 'customary'. A ' customary' is the code adopted by a particular Benedictine house, adapting the Rule to local conditions.

In the Roman Catholic Church, according to the norms of the 1983 <a href="Code%20of%20Canon%20Law">Code of Canon Law</a>, a Benedictine abbey is a "<a href="religious%20institute">religious institute</a>" and its members are therefore members of the <a href="consecrated%20life">consecrated life</a>. While Canon Law 588 §1 explains that Benedictine monks are "neither clerical nor lay", they can, however, be ordained. Benedictine <a href="Oblate%20%28religion%29">Oblate</a>s endeavor to embrace the spirit of the Benedictine vow in their own life in the world.

Bayezid I

Bayezid I (; (nicknamed Yıldırım (Ottoman Turkish: یلدیرم), "Lightning, Thunderbolt"); 1360 – 8 March 1403) was the <a href="List%20of%20sultans%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Sultan</a> from 1389 to 1402. He was the son of <a href="Murad%20I">Murad I</a> and <a href="G%C3%BCl%C3%A7i%C3%A7ek%20Hatun">Gülçiçek Hatun</a>. He built one of the largest armies in the known world at the time and unsuccessfully besieged <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. He adopted the title of Sultan-i Rûm, <a href="R%C3%BBm">Rûm</a> being an old Islamic name for the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. He was defeated and captured by <a href="Timur">Timur</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ankara">Battle of Ankara</a> in 1402 and died in captivity in March 1403.

The first major role of Bayezid was as governor of Kütahya, a city that was conquered from the <a href="Germiyanids">Germiyanids</a>. He was an impetuous soldier, earning the nickname Lightning in a battle against the <a href="Karamanids">Karamanids</a>.
Bayezid ascended to the throne following the death of his father Murad I, who was killed by Serbian knight <a href="Milo%C5%A1%20Obili%C4%87">Miloš Obilić</a> during (15 June), or immediately after (16 June), the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kosovo">Battle of Kosovo</a> in 1389, by which Serbia became a vassal of the Ottoman Sultanate. Immediately after obtaining the throne, he had his younger brother strangled to avoid a plot. In 1390, Bayezid took as a wife Princess <a href="Olivera%20Despina">Olivera Despina</a>, the daughter of Prince <a href="Lazar%20of%20Serbia">Lazar of Serbia</a>, who also lost his life in Kosovo. Bayezid recognized <a href="Stefan%20Lazarevi%C4%87">Stefan Lazarević</a>, the son of Lazar, as the new Serbian leader (later despot), with considerable autonomy.

The upper Serbia resisted the Ottomans until general Pashayigit captured the city of Skopje in 1391, converting the city to an important base of operations.

Meanwhile, the sultan began unifying Anatolia under his rule. Forcible expansion into Muslim territories could endanger the Ottoman relationship with the <a href="gazi">gazi</a>s, who were an important source of warriors for this ruling house on the European frontier. So Bayezid began the practice to first secure "fatwa"s, or legal rulings from Islamic scholars, justifying their wars against these Muslim states. However he suspected the loyalty of his Muslim Turkoman followers, for Bayezid relied heavily on his Serbian and Byzantine vassal troops to perform these conquests.

In a single campaign over the summer and fall of 1390, Bayezid conquered the beyliks of <a href="Beylik%20of%20Ayd%C4%B1n">Aydin</a>, <a href="Sarukhanids">Saruhan</a> and <a href="Mente%C5%9Fe%20%28beylik%29">Menteşe</a>. His major rival Sulayman, the emir of <a href="Karaman">Karaman</a>, responded by allying himself with the ruler of <a href="Sivas">Sivas</a>, <a href="Kadi%20Burhan%20al-Din">Kadi Burhan al-Din</a> and the remaining Turkish beyliks. Nevertheless, Bayezid pushed on and in the fall and winter of 1390 overwhelmed the remaining beyliks -- <a href="Hamidids">Hamid</a>, <a href="Beylik%20of%20Teke">Teke</a>, and <a href="Germiyan">Germiyan</a>—as well as taking the cities of <a href="Ak%C5%9Fehir">Akşehir</a> and <a href="Ni%C4%9Fde">Niğde</a>, as well as their capital <a href="Konya">Konya</a> from the Karaman. At this point, Bayezid accepted peace proposals from Karaman (1391), concerned that further advances would antagonize his Turkoman followers and lead them to ally with Kadi Burhan al-Din. Once peace had been made with Karaman, Bayezid moved north against <a href="Kastamonu">Kastamonu</a> which had given refuge to many fleeing from his forces, and conquered both that city as well as <a href="Sinop%2C%20Turkey">Sinop</a>.

From 1389 to 1395 he conquered <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and northern <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. In 1394 Bayezid crossed the River <a href="Danube">Danube</a> to attack <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>, ruled at that time by <a href="Mircea%20I%20of%20Wallachia">Mircea the Elder</a>. The Ottomans were superior in number, but on 10 October 1394 (or 17 May 1395), in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rovine">Battle of Rovine</a>, on forested and swampy terrain, the <a href="Wallachians">Wallachian</a>s won the fierce battle and prevented Bayezid's army from advancing beyond the Danube.

In 1394, Bayezid laid siege to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, the capital of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. <a href="Anadoluhisar%C4%B1">Anadoluhisarı</a> fortress was built between 1393 and 1394 as part of preparations for the Second Ottoman Siege of Constantinople, which took place in 1395. On the urgings of the Byzantine emperor <a href="Manuel%20II%20Palaeologus">Manuel II Palaeologus</a> a new <a href="crusade">crusade</a> was organized to defeat him. This proved unsuccessful: in 1396 the <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> allies, under the leadership of the King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Hungary</a> and future <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> (in 1433) <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund</a>, were defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nicopolis">Battle of Nicopolis</a>. Bayezid built the magnificent <a href="Bursa%20Grand%20Mosque">Ulu Cami</a> in Bursa, to celebrate this victory.

Thus the siege of Constantinople continued, lasting until 1402. The beleaguered Byzantines had their reprieve when Bayezid fought the <a href="Timurid%20dynasty">Timurid Empire</a> in the East. At this time, the empire of Bayezid included <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> (except <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>), <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, and parts of <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> in Europe. In Asia, his domains extended to the <a href="Taurus%20Mountains">Taurus Mountains</a>. His army was considered one of the best in the Islamic world.

In 1397, Bayezid defeated the emir of Karaman in Akçay, killing him and annexing his territory. In 1398, the sultan conquered the Djanik emirate and the territory of Burhan al-Din, violating the accord with Timur. Finally, Bayezid occupied Elbistan and Malatya.

In 1400, the <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>n warlord <a href="Timur">Timur</a> succeeded in rousing the local Turkic <a href="Anatolian%20beyliks">beyliks</a> who had been vassals of the Ottomans to join him in his attack on Bayezid, who was also considered one of the most powerful rulers in the Muslim world during that period. In the fateful <a href="Battle%20of%20Ankara">Battle of Ankara</a>, on 20 July 1402, Bayezid was captured by Timur and the Ottoman army was defeated. Many writers claim that Bayezid was mistreated by the Timurids. However, writers and historians from Timur's own court reported that Bayezid was treated well, and that Timur even mourned his death. One of Bayezid's sons, <a href="Mustafa%20%C3%87elebi">Mustafa Çelebi</a>, was captured with him and held captive in <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a> until 1405.

Four of Bayezid's sons, specifically <a href="S%C3%BCleyman%20%C3%87elebi">Süleyman Çelebi</a>, <a href="%C4%B0sa%20%C3%87elebi">İsa Çelebi</a>, <a href="Mehmed%20%C3%87elebi">Mehmed Çelebi</a>, and <a href="Musa%20%C3%87elebi">Musa Çelebi</a>, however, escaped from the battlefield and later started a civil war for the Ottoman throne known as the <a href="Ottoman%20Interregnum">Ottoman Interregnum</a>. After Mehmed's victory, his coronation as <a href="Mehmed%20I">Mehmed I</a>, and the death of all four but Mehmed, Bayezid's other son <a href="Mustafa%20%C3%87elebi">Mustafa Çelebi</a> emerged from hiding and began two failed rebellions against his brother Mehmed and, after Mehmed's death, his nephew <a href="Murat%20II">Murat II</a>.

A commando battalion in the <a href="Pakistan%20Army">Pakistan Army</a> is named Yaldaram Battalion after him.
<a href="Y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1r%C4%B1m%20Beyaz%C4%B1t%20University">Yildirim Beyazit University</a>, a state university in Turkey, is also named after him.

His mother was <a href="G%C3%BCl%C3%A7i%C3%A7ek%20Hatun">Gülçiçek Hatun</a> who was of ethnic <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> descent.

Bayezid had eight consorts



The defeat of Bayezid became a popular subject for later Western writers, composers, and painters. They embellished the legend that he was taken by Timur to <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a> with a cast of characters to create an oriental fantasy that has maintained its appeal. <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>'s play "<a href="Tamburlaine%20%28play%29">Tamburlaine the Great</a>" was first performed in <a href="London">London</a> in 1587, three years after the formal opening of English-Ottoman trade relations when <a href="William%20Harborne">William Harborne</a> sailed for Constantinople as an agent of the <a href="Levant%20Company">Levant Company</a>.

In 1648, the play "Le Gran Tamerlan et Bejezet" by <a href="Jean%20Magnon">Jean Magnon</a> appeared in London, and in 1725, <a href="Handel">Handel</a>'s "<a href="Tamerlano">Tamerlano</a>" was first performed and published in London; <a href="Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a>'s version of the story, "<a href="Bajazet%20%28opera%29">Bajazet</a>", was written in 1735. Magnon had given Bayezid an intriguing wife and daughter; the Handel and Vivaldi renditions included, as well as Tamerlane and Bayezid and his daughter, a prince of Byzantium and a princess of <a href="Trabzon">Trebizond</a> (<a href="Trabzon">Trabzon</a>) in a passionate love story. A cycle of paintings in <a href="Schloss%20Eggenberg">Schloss Eggenberg</a>, near <a href="Graz">Graz</a> in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, translated the theme to a different medium; this was completed in the 1670s shortly before the Ottoman army attacked the <a href="Habsburgs">Habsburgs</a> in central <a href="Europe">Europe</a>.

Bayezid (spelled Bayazid) is a central character in the <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a> story "Lord of Samarcand."

Bayezid II

Bayezid II (3 December 1447 – 26 May 1512) (<a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish</a>: بايزيد ثانى "Bāyezīd-i sānī", <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>: "II. Bayezid" or "II. Beyazıt") was the eldest son and successor of <a href="Mehmed%20II">Mehmed II</a>, ruling as <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> from 1481 to 1512. During his reign, Bayezid II consolidated the Ottoman Empire and thwarted a <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid</a> rebellion soon before abdicating his throne to his son, <a href="Selim%20I">Selim I</a>. He is most notable for evacuating <a href="Sephardi%20Jews">Sephardi Jews</a> from <a href="Spain">Spain</a> after the proclamation of the <a href="Alhambra%20Decree">Alhambra Decree</a> and resettling them throughout the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.

Bayezid II was the son of <a href="Mehmed%20II">Mehmed II</a> (1432–81) and <a href="G%C3%BClbahar%20Hatun%20%28wife%20of%20Mehmed%20II%29">Emine Gülbahar Hatun</a>.

Bayezid II married <a href="G%C3%BClbahar%20Hatun%20%28wife%20of%20Bayezid%20II%29">Gülbahar Hatun</a>, who was the mother of Bayezid II's successor, <a href="Selim%20I">Selim I</a> and nephew of <a href="Sitti%C5%9Fah%20Hatun">Sitti Mükrime Hatun</a>.

Bayezid II's overriding concern was the quarrel with his brother <a href="Cem%20Sultan">Cem</a>, who claimed the throne and sought military backing from the Mamluks in Egypt. Having been defeated by his brother's armies, Cem sought protection from the <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Knights of St. John</a> in <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>. Eventually, the Knights handed Cem over to <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20VIII">Pope Innocent VIII</a> (1484–1492). The Pope thought of using Cem as a tool to drive the Turks out of Europe, but as the papal crusade failed to come to fruition, Cem was left to languish and die in a Neapolitan prison. Bayezid II paid both the Knights Hospitaller and the pope to keep his brother prisoner.

Bayezid II ascended the Ottoman throne in 1481. Like his father, Bayezid II was a patron of western and eastern culture. Unlike many other Sultans, he worked hard to ensure a smooth running of domestic politics, which earned him the epithet of "the Just". Throughout his reign, Bayezid II engaged in numerous campaigns to conquer the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian</a> possessions in <a href="Morea">Morea</a>, accurately defining this region as the key to future Ottoman naval power in the Eastern <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>. <a href="Ottoman%E2%80%93Venetian%20War%20%281499%E2%80%931503%29">The last of these wars</a> ended in 1501 with Bayezid II in control of the whole Peloponnese. Rebellions in the east, such as that of the <a href="Qizilbash">Qizilbash</a>, plagued much of Bayezid II's reign and were often backed by the <a href="Shah">Shah</a> of <a href="Iran">Persia</a>, <a href="Ismail%20I">Ismail</a>, who was eager to promote <a href="Shi%27a%20Islam">Shi'ism</a> to undermine the authority of the Ottoman state. Ottoman authority in <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> was indeed seriously threatened during this period and at one point Bayezid II's <a href="vizier">vizier</a>, Ali Pasha, was killed in battle against rebels.

In July 1492, the new state of <a href="Spain">Spain</a> expelled its <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> and <a href="Muslims">Muslim</a> populations as part of the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>. Bayezid II sent out the <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a> under the command of admiral <a href="Kemal%20Reis">Kemal Reis</a> to Spain in 1492 in order to evacuate them safely to Ottoman lands. He sent out proclamations throughout the empire that the refugees were to be welcomed. He granted the refugees the permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire and become Ottoman citizens. He ridiculed the conduct of <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> and <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile">Isabella I of Castile</a> in expelling a class of people so useful to their subjects. "You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler," he said to his courtiers, "he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!" Bayezid addressed a <a href="firman%20%28decree%29">firman</a> to all the governors of his European provinces, ordering them not only to refrain from repelling the Spanish refugees, but to give them a friendly and welcome reception. He threatened with death all those who treated the Jews harshly or refused them admission into the empire. <a href="Moses%20Capsali">Moses Capsali</a>, who probably helped to arouse the sultan's friendship for the Jews, was most energetic in his assistance to the exiles. He made a tour of the communities and was instrumental in imposing a tax upon the rich, to ransom the Jewish victims of the persecution.

The Muslims and Jews of <a href="al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a> (Iberia) contributed much to the rising power of the Ottoman Empire by introducing new ideas, methods and craftsmanship. The first <a href="Gutenberg%20press">printing press</a> in Constantinople was established by the Sephardic Jews in 1493. It is reported that under Bayezid's reign, Jews enjoyed a period of cultural flourishing, with the presence of such scholars as the <a href="Talmudist">Talmudist</a> and scientist <a href="Mordecai%20Comtino">Mordecai Comtino</a>; astronomer and poet <a href="Solomon%20ben%20Elijah%20Sharbit">Solomon ben Elijah Sharbiṭ ha-Zahab</a>; <a href="Shabbat">Shabbethai</a> ben Malkiel Cohen, and the liturgical poet Menahem Tamar.

On 14 September 1509, <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> was <a href="1509%20Constantinople%20earthquake">devastated by an earthquake</a>. During Bayezid II's final years, a succession battle developed between his sons <a href="Selim%20I">Selim I</a> and <a href="%C5%9Eehzade%20Ahmet">Ahmet</a>. Ahmet unexpectedly captured Karaman, an Ottoman city, and began marching to Constantinople to exploit his triumph. Fearing for his safety, Selim staged a revolt in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> but was defeated by Bayezid and forced to flee back to the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimean Peninsula</a>. Bayezid II developed fears that Ahmet might in turn kill him to gain the throne, so he refused to allow his son to enter Constantinople.

Selim returned from Crimea and, with support from the <a href="Janissary">Janissaries</a>, forced his father to abdicate the throne on 25 April 1512. Bayezid departed for retirement in his native Demotika, but he died on 26 May 1512 at <a href="B%C3%BCy%C3%BCk%C3%A7ekmece">Büyükçekmece</a> before reaching his destination and only a month after his abdication. He was buried next to the <a href="Bayezid%20Mosque">Bayezid Mosque</a> in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>.

Boxing

Boxing is a <a href="combat%20sport">combat sport</a> in which two people, usually wearing <a href="boxing%20glove">protective gloves</a>, throw <a href="Punch%20%28combat%29">punches</a> at each other for a predetermined set of time in a <a href="boxing%20ring">boxing ring</a>.

<a href="Amateur%20boxing">Amateur boxing</a> is both an <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic</a> and <a href="Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth Games</a> sport and is a common fixture in most international games—it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is supervised by a <a href="referee%20%28boxing%29">referee</a> over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds. The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by <a href="Submission%20%28combat%20sports%29">throwing in a towel</a>, or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' scorecards at the end of the contest. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, the fight is considered a draw (professional boxing). In Olympic boxing, due to the fact that a winner must be declared, in the case of a draw - the judges use technical criteria to choose the most deserving winner of the bout.

While humans have fought in <a href="hand-to-hand%20combat">hand-to-hand combat</a> since before the dawn of history, boxing as an organized <a href="sport">sport</a> may have its origin in the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a> as an <a href="Ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic game</a> in BC 688. Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the <a href="Marquess%20of%20Queensberry%20Rules">Marquess of Queensberry Rules</a>.

The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ian <a href="relief">relief</a> in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BCE Later depictions from the 2nd millennium BC are found in reliefs from the <a href="Mesopotamian">Mesopotamian</a> nations of <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> and <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, and in <a href="Hittites">Hittite</a> art from <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. The earliest evidence for fist fighting with any kind of gloves can be found on <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> <a href="Crete">Crete</a> (c.1650–1400 BCE), and on <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, if we consider the <a href="Giants%20of%20Monte%20Prama">boxing statues</a> of Prama mountains (c. 2000–1000 BC).

In <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a> boxing was a well developed sport and enjoyed consistent popularity. In Olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd <a href="Ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Olympiad</a>, 688 B.C. The boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. There were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue. Weight categories were not used, which meant heavyweights had a tendency to dominate. The style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard, in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. It was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body was common.

Boxing was a popular spectator <a href="sport">sport</a> in <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Rome</a>. In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped <a href="leather">leather</a> thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a <a href="weapon">weapon</a>. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the <a href="cestus">cestus</a> which then led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ('limb piercer'). Fighting events were held at Roman <a href="Amphitheatres">Amphitheatres</a>. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In <a href="AD">AD</a> 393, during the Roman <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a> period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.

Records of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting <a href="sports">sports</a> that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in <a href="ancient%20Rus">ancient Rus</a> called <a href="Russian%20fist%20fighting">Kulachniy Boy</a> or "Fist Fighting".

As the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of <a href="bare-knuckle%20boxing">bare-knuckle boxing</a> sometimes referred to as prizefighting. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the "London Protestant Mercury", and the first English bare-knuckle champion was <a href="James%20Figg">James Figg</a> in 1719. This is also the time when the word "boxing" first came to be used. It should be noted, that this earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when <a href="Christopher%20Monck">Christopher Monck</a>, 2nd <a href="Duke%20of%20Albemarle">Duke of Albemarle</a> (and later <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Jamaica">Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica</a>) engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize.

Early fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. An early article on boxing was published in Nottingham, 1713, by <a href="Parkyns%20baronets">Sir Thomas Parkyns</a>, a successful Wrestler from <a href="Bunny%2C%20Nottinghamshire">Bunny, Nottinghamshire</a>, who had practised the techniques he described. The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, "Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler", described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.

The first boxing rules, called the Broughton's rules, were introduced by champion <a href="Jack%20Broughton">Jack Broughton</a> in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred. Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.
These rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers; they permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to end the round and begin the 30-second count at any time. Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover. However, this was considered "unmanly" and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the Seconds of the Boxers. In modern boxing, there is a three-minute limit to rounds (unlike the downed fighter ends the round rule). Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. Furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, they used different punching technique to preserve their hands, because the head was a common target to hit full out. Almost all period manuals have powerful straight punches with the whole body behind them to the face (including forehead) as the basic blows.

The <a href="London%20Prize%20Ring%20Rules">London Prize Ring Rules</a> introduced measures that remain in effect for professional boxing to this day, such as outlawing butting, gouging, scratching, kicking, hitting a man while down, holding the ropes, and using resin, stones or hard objects in the hands, and biting.

In 1867, the <a href="Marquess%20of%20Queensberry%20rules">Marquess of Queensberry rules</a> were drafted by <a href="John%20Graham%20Chambers">John Chambers</a> for amateur championships held at <a href="Lillie%20Bridge">Lillie Bridge</a> in London for <a href="Lightweight">Lightweight</a>s, <a href="Middleweight">Middleweight</a>s and <a href="Heavyweight">Heavyweight</a>s. The rules were published under the patronage of the <a href="John%20Sholto%20Douglas%2C%209th%20Marquess%20of%20Queensberry">Marquess of Queensberry</a>, whose name has always been associated with them.

There were twelve rules in all, and they specified that fights should be "a fair stand-up boxing match" in a 24-foot-square or similar ring. Rounds were three minutes with one-minute rest intervals between rounds. Each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down, and wrestling was banned.
The introduction of <a href="boxing%20gloves">gloves</a> of "fair-size" also changed the nature of the bouts. An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.
The gloves can be used to block an opponent's blows. As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face.

Through the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy. Outlawed in England and much of the United States, prizefights were often held at gambling venues and broken up by police. Brawling and wrestling tactics continued, and riots at prizefights were common occurrences. Still, throughout this period, there arose some notable bare knuckle champions who developed fairly sophisticated fighting tactics.

The English case of "<a href="R%20v.%20Coney">R v. Coney</a>" in 1882 found that a <a href="Bare-knuckle%20boxing">bare-knuckle</a> fight was an <a href="assault%20occasioning%20actual%20bodily%20harm">assault occasioning actual bodily harm</a>, despite the <a href="consensual%20crime">consent</a> of the participants. This marked the end of widespread public bare-knuckle contests in England.

The first world heavyweight champion under the Queensberry Rules was <a href="James%20J.%20Corbett">"Gentleman Jim" Corbett</a>, who defeated <a href="John%20L.%20Sullivan">John L. Sullivan</a> in 1892 at the Pelican Athletic Club in <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans</a>.

The first instance of film censorship in the United States occurred in 1897 when several states banned the showing of prize fighting films from the state of Nevada, where it was legal at the time.

Throughout the early twentieth century, boxers struggled to achieve legitimacy. They were aided by the influence of promoters like <a href="Tex%20Rickard">Tex Rickard</a> and the popularity of great champions such as John L. Sullivan.

The "<a href="Marquess%20of%20Queensberry%20rules">Marquess of Queensberry rules</a>" have been the general rules governing modern boxing since their publication in 1867.

A boxing match typically consists of a determined number of three-minute rounds, a total of up to 9 to 12 rounds. A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls.

Up to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been "robbed" or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more "seconds" may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signalled end of each round.

A bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to "go the distance". The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out; such bouts are said to have ended "inside the distance". If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue. Some jurisdictions <a href="Mandatory%20eight%20count">require the referee to count to eight</a> regardless of if the fighter gets up before.

Should the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled "knocked out" (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by <a href="knockout">knockout</a> (KO). A "technical knock-out" (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a "three-knockdown rule", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A "standing eight" count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he or she feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he or she is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.

In general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the head or neck (called a "rabbit-punch") or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between).

If a "clinch" – a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause – is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to "punch out" of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue.

Violations of these rules may be ruled "fouls" by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a "no contest" result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed.

Unheard of in the modern era, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a "newspaper decision (NWS)" might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A "no decision" bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a "no decision" bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only. Often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report.

Throughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by money, as the fighters competed for <a href="prize%20money">prize money</a>, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result. The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts. Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an <a href="Automated%20Boxing%20Scoring%20System">Automated Boxing Scoring System</a>, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career.

Amateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> and <a href="Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth Games</a>, and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.

Competitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end just is a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless, the fighters weigh under 165 pounds, thus allowing them to wear 10 ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches – any boxer repeatedly landing low blows <a href="below%20the%20belt">below the belt</a> is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced. Amateur bouts which end this way may be noted as "RSC" (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH).

Professional bouts are usually much longer than amateur bouts, typically ranging from ten to twelve rounds, though four-round fights are common for less experienced fighters or club fighters. There are also some two- and three-round professional bouts, especially in Australia. Through the early 20th century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters like <a href="Jack%20Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a>. Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the 20th century until the <a href="Boxing%20in%20the%201980s">early 1980s</a>, when the <a href="Ray%20Mancini%23Kim%20match">death of boxer Duk Koo Kim</a> eventually prompted the <a href="World%20Boxing%20Council">World Boxing Council</a> and other organizations sanctioning professional boxing to reduce the limit to twelve rounds.

Headgear is not permitted in professional bouts, and boxers are generally allowed to take much more damage before a fight is halted. At any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ <a href="cutman">cutmen</a>, whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.

"Style" is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. No two fighters' styles are alike, as each is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes. Three main styles exist in boxing: outside fighter ("boxer"), brawler (or "slugger"), and Inside fighter ("swarmer"). These styles may be divided into several special subgroups, such as counter puncher, etc. The main philosophy of the styles is, that each style has an advantage over one, but disadvantage over the other one. It follows the <a href="rock-paper-scissors">rock-paper-scissors</a> scenario - boxer beats brawler, brawler beats swarmer, and swarmer beats boxer.

A classic "boxer" or stylist (also known as an "out-fighter") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. Due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. They are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent, methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler. Out-fighters need reach, hand speed, reflexes, and footwork.

Notable out-fighters include <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>, <a href="Larry%20Holmes">Larry Holmes</a>, <a href="Joe%20Calzaghe">Joe Calzaghe</a>, <a href="Wilfredo%20G%C3%B3mez">Wilfredo Gómez</a>, 
<a href="Salvador%20Sanchez">Salvador Sanchez</a>, <a href="Cecilia%20Br%C3%A6khus">Cecilia Brækhus</a>, <a href="Gene%20Tunney">Gene Tunney</a>, <a href="Ezzard%20Charles">Ezzard Charles</a>, <a href="Willie%20Pep">Willie Pep</a>, <a href="Meldrick%20Taylor">Meldrick Taylor</a>, <a href="Ricardo%20Lopez%20%28boxer%29">Ricardo Lopez</a>, <a href="Floyd%20Mayweather%20Jr.">Floyd Mayweather Jr.</a>, <a href="Roy%20Jones%20Jr.">Roy Jones Jr.</a>, <a href="Sugar%20Ray%20Leonard">Sugar Ray Leonard</a>, <a href="Miguel%20Vazquez">Miguel Vazquez</a>, <a href="Sergio%20Gabriel%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Sergio "Maravilla" Martínez</a>, <a href="Vitali%20Klitschko">Vitali Klitschko</a>, <a href="Wladimir%20Klitschko">Wladimir Klitschko</a> and <a href="Guillermo%20Rigondeaux">Guillermo Rigondeaux</a>. This style was also used by fictional boxer <a href="Apollo%20Creed">Apollo Creed</a>.

A boxer-puncher is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter), but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.

Notable boxer-punchers include <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>, <a href="Canelo%20%C3%81lvarez">Canelo Álvarez</a>, <a href="Wladimir%20Klitschko">Wladimir Klitschko</a>, <a href="Vasyl%20Lomachenko">Vasyl Lomachenko</a>, <a href="Lennox%20Lewis">Lennox Lewis</a>, <a href="Joe%20Louis">Joe Louis</a>, <a href="Wilfredo%20G%C3%B3mez">Wilfredo Gómez</a>, <a href="Oscar%20de%20la%20Hoya">Oscar de la Hoya</a>, <a href="Archie%20Moore">Archie Moore</a>, <a href="Miguel%20Cotto">Miguel Cotto</a>, <a href="Nonito%20Donaire">Nonito Donaire</a>, <a href="Sam%20Langford">Sam Langford</a>, <a href="Henry%20Armstrong">Henry Armstrong</a>, <a href="Sugar%20Ray%20Robinson">Sugar Ray Robinson</a>, <a href="Tony%20Zale">Tony Zale</a>, <a href="Carlos%20Monz%C3%B3n">Carlos Monzón</a>, <a href="Alexis%20Arg%C3%BCello">Alexis Argüello</a>, <a href="Erik%20Morales">Erik Morales</a>, <a href="Terry%20Norris">Terry Norris</a>, <a href="Marco%20Antonio%20Barrera">Marco Antonio Barrera</a>, <a href="Naseem%20Hamed">Naseem Hamed</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Hearns">Thomas Hearns</a>.

<a href="Counterpunch%20%28boxing%29">Counter punchers</a> are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.

Notable counter punchers include <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>, <a href="Vitali%20Klitschko">Vitali Klitschko</a>, <a href="Evander%20Holyfield">Evander Holyfield</a>, <a href="Max%20Schmeling">Max Schmeling</a>, <a href="Chris%20Byrd">Chris Byrd</a>, <a href="James%20J%20Corbett">Jim Corbett</a>, <a href="Jack%20Johnson%20%28boxer%29">Jack Johnson</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Hopkins">Bernard Hopkins</a>, <a href="Laszlo%20Papp">Laszlo Papp</a>, <a href="Jerry%20Quarry">Jerry Quarry</a>, <a href="Anselmo%20Moreno">Anselmo Moreno</a>, <a href="James%20Toney">James Toney</a>, <a href="Marvin%20Hagler">Marvin Hagler</a>, <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20M%C3%A1rquez">Juan Manuel Márquez</a>, <a href="Humberto%20Soto">Humberto Soto</a>, <a href="Floyd%20Mayweather%20Jr.">Floyd Mayweather Jr.</a>, <a href="Roger%20Mayweather">Roger Mayweather</a>, <a href="Pernell%20Whitaker">Pernell Whitaker</a>, <a href="Sergio%20Gabriel%20Martinez">Sergio Gabriel Martinez</a> and <a href="Guillermo%20Rigondeaux">Guillermo Rigondeaux</a>. This style of boxing is also used by fictional boxer <a href="Little%20Mac%20%28Punch-Out%21%21%29">Little Mac</a>.

Counter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.

A brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power. Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. However, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as <a href="Wilfredo%20G%C3%B3mez">Wilfredo Gómez</a>, <a href="Prince%20Naseem%20Hamed">Prince Naseem Hamed</a> and <a href="Danny%20Garc%C3%ADa">Danny García</a>.

A brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing). Examples of this style include <a href="George%20Foreman">George Foreman</a>, <a href="Rocky%20Marciano">Rocky Marciano</a>, <a href="Julio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Julio César Chávez</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Duran">Roberto Duran</a>, <a href="Danny%20Garc%C3%ADa">Danny García</a>, <a href="Wilfredo%20G%C3%B3mez">Wilfredo Gómez</a>, <a href="Sonny%20Liston">Sonny Liston</a>, <a href="John%20L%20Sullivan">John L. Sullivan</a>, <a href="Max%20Baer%20%28boxer%29">Max Baer</a>, <a href="Prince%20Naseem%20Hamed">Prince Naseem Hamed</a>, <a href="Ray%20Mancini">Ray Mancini</a>, <a href="David%20Tua">David Tua</a>, <a href="Arturo%20Gatti">Arturo Gatti</a>, <a href="Micky%20Ward">Micky Ward</a>, <a href="Brandon%20R%C3%ADos">Brandon Ríos</a>, <a href="Ruslan%20Provodnikov">Ruslan Provodnikov</a>, <a href="Michael%20Katsidis">Michael Katsidis</a>, <a href="James%20Kirkland%20%28boxer%29">James Kirkland</a>, <a href="Marcos%20Maidana">Marcos Maidana</a>, <a href="Jake%20LaMotta">Jake LaMotta</a>, <a href="Manny%20Pacquiao">Manny Pacquiao</a>, and Ireland's <a href="John%20Duddy">John Duddy</a>. This style of boxing was also used by <a href="fiction">fiction</a>al boxers Rocky Balboa and James "Clubber" Lang. This style was also used by the Street Fighter character Balrog.

Brawlers tend to be more predictable and easy to hit but usually fare well enough against other fighting styles because they train to take punches very well. They often have a higher chance than other fighting styles to score a knockout against their opponents because they focus on landing big, powerful hits, instead of smaller, faster attacks. Oftentimes they place focus on training on their upper body instead of their entire body, to increase power and endurance. They also aim to intimidate their opponents because of their power, stature and ability to take a punch.

In-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called "pressure fighters") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of <a href="Hook%20%28boxing%29">hooks</a> and uppercuts. Mainly <a href="Mexican%20people">Mexican</a>, Irish, <a href="Irish-American">Irish-American</a>, <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20people">Puerto Rican</a>, and <a href="Mexican-American">Mexican-American</a> boxers popularized this style. A successful in-fighter often needs a good "<a href="chin%20%28boxing%29">chin</a>" because swarming usually involves being hit with many <a href="jab">jab</a>s before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting.

The essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. Many short in-fighters utilize their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, this permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts, they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; <a href="Mike%20Tyson">Mike Tyson</a> was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. <a href="Marvin%20Hagler">Marvin Hagler</a> was known for his hard "<a href="chin%20%28boxing%29">chin</a>", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.

Notable in-fighters include <a href="Henry%20Armstrong">Henry Armstrong</a>, <a href="Aaron%20Pryor">Aaron Pryor</a>, <a href="Julio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Julio César Chávez</a>, <a href="Jack%20Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a>, <a href="Miguel%20Cotto">Miguel Cotto</a>, <a href="Joe%20Frazier">Joe Frazier</a>, <a href="Danny%20Garc%C3%ADa">Danny García</a>, <a href="Mike%20Tyson">Mike Tyson</a>, <a href="Manny%20Pacquiao">Manny Pacquiao</a>, <a href="Rocky%20Marciano">Rocky Marciano</a>, <a href="Wayne%20McCullough">Wayne McCullough</a>, <a href="Gerry%20Penalosa">Gerry Penalosa</a>, <a href="Harry%20Greb">Harry Greb</a>, <a href="David%20Tua">David Tua</a>, <a href="Ricky%20Hatton">Ricky Hatton</a> and <a href="Gennady%20Golovkin">Gennady Golovkin</a>.

All fighters have primary skills with which they feel most comfortable, but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge. For example, an out-fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch, or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches.

There is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others. In general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a brawler, and a brawler has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in <a href="rock-paper-scissors">rock-paper-scissors</a>. Naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the cliché amongst boxing fans and writers that "styles make fights."

Brawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. A famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be <a href="George%20Foreman">George Foreman</a>'s knockout victory over <a href="Joe%20Frazier">Joe Frazier</a> in their original bout "The Sunshine Showdown".

Although in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> in their three fights. <a href="Joe%20Louis">Joe Louis</a>, after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ <a href="Rocky%20Marciano">Rocky Marciano</a> would have caused him style problems even in his prime.

The boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.

An example of a style matchup was the historical fight of <a href="Julio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Julio César Chávez</a>, a swarmer or in-fighter, against <a href="Meldrick%20Taylor">Meldrick Taylor</a>, the boxer or out-fighter (see <a href="Julio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Ch%C3%A1vez%20vs.%20Meldrick%20Taylor">Julio César Chávez vs. Meldrick Taylor</a>). The match was nicknamed "Thunder Meets Lightning" as an allusion to punching power of Chávez and blinding speed of Taylor. Chávez was the epitome of the "Mexican" style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Chávez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Chávez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Chávez, which only gave Chávez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Chávez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed to stay away from the Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Chávez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Chávez could knock him out.
With about a minute left in the round, Chávez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Chávez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Chávez back ahead of him. Suddenly Chávez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Chávez' desperate final flurry. Chávez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Chávez with only two seconds to go in the bout.

Since boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent <a href="Boxer%27s%20fracture">damage to bones in the hand</a>. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without <a href="wrist%20wraps">wrist wraps</a> and <a href="boxing%20gloves">boxing gloves</a>. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not utilise them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place.

A <a href="mouthguard">mouthguard</a> is important to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts.

Boxers practice their skills on two basic types of punching bags. A small, tear-drop-shaped "speed bag" is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical "heavy bag" filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also utilize sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. Common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines, <a href="jump%20rope">jump rope</a>, and <a href="medicine%20balls">medicine balls</a>.

Boxing matches typically take place in a <a href="boxing%20ring">boxing ring</a>, a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term "ring" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general.

The modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as <a href="Jack%20Johnson%20%28boxer%29">Jack Johnson</a>.

In a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the "textbook" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents.

Left-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The <a href="southpaw%20stance">southpaw stance</a>, conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.

North American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.

Modern boxers can sometimes be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with their fists in order to remind themselves to keep their hands up (which becomes difficult during long bouts). Boxers are taught to push off with their feet in order to move effectively. Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg. Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg. During lateral motion the leg in the direction of the movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body.

There are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch other than a jab is considered a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following discussion will assume a right-handed boxer.



These different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or "combos." The most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the "one-two combo." This is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully.

A large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a "roundhouse," "haymaker," "overhand," or sucker-punch. Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard.

Wide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in.

Another unconventional punch is the rarely used <a href="bolo%20punch">bolo punch</a>, in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm.

An illegal punch to the back of the head or neck is known as a <a href="rabbit%20punch">rabbit punch</a>.

It should be noted both the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, resulting in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. Generally the analogous opposite is true of the footwork and torso movement.

There are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below.



In boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds for 1 minute and where his trainers stand. Typically, three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the <a href="cutman">cutman</a>. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is doing wrong as well as encouraging him if he is losing. The cutman is a cutaneous <a href="physician">doctor</a> responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts and blood. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts that threaten the boxer's eyes.

In addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase "to throw in the towel", meaning to give up, derives from this practice). This can be seen in the fight between <a href="Diego%20Corrales">Diego Corrales</a> and <a href="Floyd%20Mayweather">Floyd Mayweather</a>. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal.

Knocking a person unconscious or even causing a <a href="concussion">concussion</a> may cause permanent <a href="brain%20damage">brain damage</a>. There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person. Since 1980, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and <a href="Toughman%20Contest">Toughman</a> fighters have died due to ring or training injuries. In 1983, editorials in the "Journal of the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a>" called for a ban on boxing. The editor, Dr. George Lundberg, called boxing an "obscenity" that "should not be sanctioned by any civilized society." Since then, the British, Canadian and Australian Medical Associations have called for bans on boxing.

Supporters of the ban state that boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal. Dr. Bill O'Neill, boxing spokesman for the <a href="British%20Medical%20Association">British Medical Association</a>, has supported the BMA's proposed ban on boxing: "It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, and we feel that we must have a total ban on boxing." Opponents respond that such a position is misguided opinion, stating that amateur boxing is scored solely according to total connecting blows with no award for "injury". They observe that many skilled professional boxers have had rewarding careers without inflicting injury on opponents by accumulating scoring blows and avoiding punches winning rounds scored 10-9 by the <a href="10-point%20must%20system">10-point must system</a>, and they note that there are many other sports where concussions are much more prevalent.

In 2007, one study of amateur boxers showed that protective headgear did not prevent brain damage, and another found that amateur boxers faced a high risk of brain damage. The Gothenburg study analyzed temporary levels of neurofiliment light in cerebral spinal fluid which they conclude is evidence of damage, even though the levels soon subside. More comprehensive studies of neurologiocal function on larger samples performed by Johns Hopkins University and accident rates analyzed by National Safety Council show amateur boxing is a comparatively safe sport.

In 1997, the American Association of Professional Ringside Physicians was established to create medical protocols through research and education to prevent injuries in boxing.

Professional boxing is forbidden in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>. It was banned in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> until 2007 when the ban was lifted but strict restrictions, including four three-minute rounds for fights, were imposed. It was banned in <a href="Albania">Albania</a> from 1965 till the <a href="Fall%20of%20communism%20in%20Albania">fall of Communism in 1991</a>; it is now legal there. Norway legalized professional boxing in December 2014.

The sport of boxing has two internationally recognized boxing halls of fame; the <a href="International%20Boxing%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF)</a> and the World Boxing Hall of Fame (WBHF), with the IBHOF being the more widely recognized boxing hall of fame. In 2013, The Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas opened in <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20NV">Las Vegas, NV</a> founded by Steve Lott, former assistant manager for <a href="Mike%20Tyson">Mike Tyson</a>.

The WBHF was founded by Everett L. Sanders in 1980. Since its inception the WBHOF has never had a permanent location or museum, which has allowed the more recent IBHOF to garner more publicity and prestige. Among the notable names in the WBHF are <a href="Ricardo%20%26quot%3BFinito%26quot%3B%20Lopez">Ricardo "Finito" Lopez</a>, <a href="Gabriel%20%26quot%3BFlash%26quot%3B%20Elorde">Gabriel "Flash" Elorde</a>, <a href="Michael%20Carbajal">Michael Carbajal</a>, <a href="Khaosai%20Galaxy">Khaosai Galaxy</a>, <a href="Henry%20Armstrong">Henry Armstrong</a>, <a href="Jack%20Johnson%20%28boxer%29">Jack Johnson</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Dur%C3%A1n">Roberto Durán</a>, <a href="George%20Foreman">George Foreman</a>, <a href="Ceferino%20Garcia">Ceferino Garcia</a> and <a href="Salvador%20Sanchez">Salvador Sanchez</a>. Boxing's International Hall of Fame was inspired by a tribute an American town held for two local heroes in 1982. The town, <a href="Canastota%2C%20New%20York">Canastota, New York</a>, (which is about east of Syracuse, via the New York State Thruway), honored former world <a href="welterweight">welterweight</a>/<a href="middleweight">middleweight</a> champion <a href="Carmen%20Basilio">Carmen Basilio</a> and his nephew, former world welterweight champion <a href="Billy%20Backus">Billy Backus</a>. The people of Canastota raised money for the tribute which inspired the idea of creating an official, annual hall of fame for notable boxers.

The <a href="International%20Boxing%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Boxing Hall of Fame</a> opened in Canastota in 1989. The first inductees in 1990 included Jack Johnson, <a href="Benny%20Leonard">Benny Leonard</a>, Jack Dempsey, Henry Armstrong, <a href="Sugar%20Ray%20Robinson">Sugar Ray Robinson</a>, <a href="Archie%20Moore">Archie Moore</a>, and Muhammad Ali. Other world-class figures include Salvador Sanchez, <a href="Jose%20Napoles">Jose Napoles</a>, Roberto "Manos de Piedra" Durán, <a href="Ricardo%20Lopez%20%28boxer%29">Ricardo Lopez</a>, <a href="Gabriel%20%26quot%3BFlash%26quot%3B%20Elorde">Gabriel "Flash" Elorde</a>, <a href="Vicente%20Saldivar">Vicente Saldivar</a>, Ismael Laguna, Eusebio Pedroza, Carlos Monzón, Azumah Nelson, <a href="Rocky%20Marciano">Rocky Marciano</a>, Pipino Cuevas and <a href="Ken%20Buchanan">Ken Buchanan</a>. The Hall of Fame's induction ceremony is held every June as part of a four-day event. The fans who come to Canastota for the Induction Weekend are treated to a number of events, including scheduled autograph sessions, boxing exhibitions, a parade featuring past and present inductees, and the induction ceremony itself.

The Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas features the $75 million ESPN Classic Sports fight film and tape library and radio broadcast collection. The collection includes the fights of all the great champions including: <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>, <a href="Mike%20Tyson">Mike Tyson</a>, <a href="George%20Foreman">George Foreman</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Duran">Roberto Duran</a>, <a href="Marvin%20Hagler">Marvin Hagler</a>, <a href="Jack%20Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a>, <a href="Joe%20Louis">Joe Louis</a>, <a href="Joe%20Frazier">Joe Frazier</a>, <a href="Rocky%20Marciano">Rocky Marciano</a> and <a href="Sugar%20Ray%20Robinson">Sugar Ray Robinson</a>. It is this exclusive fight film library that will separate the Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas from the other halls of fame which do not have rights to any video of their sports. The inaugural inductees included <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>, <a href="Henry%20Armstrong">Henry Armstrong</a>, <a href="Tony%20Canzoneri">Tony Canzoneri</a>, <a href="Ezzard%20Charles">Ezzard Charles</a>, <a href="Julio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Julio César Chávez Sr.</a>, <a href="Jack%20Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Duran">Roberto Duran</a>, <a href="Joe%20Louis">Joe Louis</a>, and <a href="Sugar%20Ray%20Robinson">Sugar Ray Robinson</a>




There are various organization and websites, that rank boxers in both weight class and pound-for-pound manner.

Bollywood

Bollywood formally known as Hindi cinema is the Indian <a href="Hindi">Hindi language</a> film industry, based in the city of <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>, India. Bollywood is only a part of the larger cinema of India also known as <a href="Cinema%20of%20India">Indywood</a>, which includes other production centers producing blockbuster films in many other Indian languages.

By revenue, Bollywood is the largest film producer in India, representing 43% of the net box office, while <a href="Telugu%20cinema">Telugu</a> and <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil</a> cinema represent 36%, and the rest of the regional cinema constitutes 21% as of 2014. Bollywood is also one of the largest centers of film production in the world. Furthermore, Bollywood is one of the biggest film industries in the world in terms of the number of people employed and the number of films produced. According to J. Matusitz and P. Payano, in 2011, over 3.5 billion tickets were sold across the globe, which in comparison is 900,000 tickets more than <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>. Bollywood produced 252 films in 2014 out of a total of 1969 films produced in <a href="Indian%20cinema">Indian cinema</a>.

The name "Bollywood" is a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> derived from Bombay (the former name for Mumbai) and <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> (in <a href="California">California</a>), the center of the <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">American film industry</a>. The naming scheme for "Bollywood" was inspired by "Tollywood", the name that was used to refer to the <a href="cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">cinema of West Bengal</a>. Dating back to 1932, "Tollywood" was the earliest <a href="Hollywood-inspired%20names">Hollywood-inspired name</a>, referring to the <a href="Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">Bengali film industry</a> based in <a href="Tollygunge">Tollygunge</a> (in <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a>, <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a>), whose name is reminiscent of "Hollywood" and was the centre of the <a href="cinema%20of%20India">cinema of India</a> at the time. It was this "chance juxtaposition of two pairs of rhyming syllables," Holly and Tolly, that led to the portmanteau name "Tollywood" being coined. The name "Tollywood" went on to be used as a nickname for the Bengali film industry by the popular Calcutta-based "<a href="The%20Statesman">Junior Statesman</a>" youth magazine, establishing a precedent for other film industries to use similar-sounding names, eventually leading to the coining of "Bollywood". "Tollywood" is now also popularly used to refer to the <a href="Telugu%20cinema">Telugu film industry</a> in <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a> and <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>.

The term "Bollywood" itself has origins in the 1970s, when <a href="India">India</a> overtook the United States as the world's largest film producer. Credit for the term has been claimed by several different people, including the lyricist, filmmaker and scholar Amit Khanna, and the journalist Bevinda Collaco. Bollywood does not exist as a physical place. Some deplore the name, arguing that it makes the industry look like a poor cousin to Hollywood.

"<a href="Raja%20Harishchandra">Raja Harishchandra</a>" (1913), by <a href="Dadasaheb%20Phalke">Dadasaheb Phalke</a>, is known as the first silent feature film made in <a href="India">India</a>. By the 1930s, the industry was producing over 200 films per annum. The first Indian sound film, <a href="Ardeshir%20Irani">Ardeshir Irani</a>'s "<a href="Alam%20Ara">Alam Ara</a>" (1931), was a major commercial success. There was clearly a huge market for talkies and musicals; Bollywood and all the regional film industries quickly switched to sound filming.

The 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times: <a href="India">India</a> was buffeted by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">Indian independence movement</a>, and the violence of the <a href="Partition%20of%20India">Partition</a>. Most Bollywood films were unabashedly <a href="escapism">escapist</a>, but there were also a number of filmmakers who tackled tough social issues, or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.

In 1937, Ardeshir Irani, of "Alam Ara" fame, made the first colour film in <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>, "<a href="Kisan%20Kanya">Kisan Kanya</a>". The next year, he made another colour film, a version of "Mother India". However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.

Following <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">India's independence</a>, the period from the late 1940s to the 1960s is regarded by film historians as the "Golden Age" of Hindi cinema. Some of the most critically acclaimed Hindi films of all time were produced during this period. Examples include "<a href="Pyaasa">Pyaasa</a>" (1957) and "<a href="Kaagaz%20Ke%20Phool">Kaagaz Ke Phool</a>" (1959) directed by <a href="Guru%20Dutt">Guru Dutt</a> and written by <a href="Abrar%20Alvi">Abrar Alvi</a>, "<a href="Awaara">Awaara</a>" (1951) and "<a href="Shree%20420">Shree 420</a>" (1955) directed by <a href="Raj%20Kapoor">Raj Kapoor</a> and written by <a href="Khwaja%20Ahmad%20Abbas">Khwaja Ahmad Abbas</a>, and <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a>'s "<a href="Aan">Aan</a>" (1952). These films expressed social themes mainly dealing with working-class urban life in <a href="India">India</a>; "Awaara" presented the city as both a nightmare and a dream, while "Pyaasa" critiqued the unreality of city life. Some of the most famous <a href="epic%20film">epic film</a>s of Hindi cinema were also produced at the time, including <a href="Mehboob%20Khan">Mehboob Khan</a>'s "<a href="Mother%20India">Mother India</a>" (1957), which was nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</a>, and <a href="K.%20Asif">K. Asif</a>'s "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>" (1960). "<a href="Madhumati">Madhumati</a>" (1958), directed by <a href="Bimal%20Roy">Bimal Roy</a> and written by <a href="Ritwik%20Ghatak">Ritwik Ghatak</a>, popularised the theme of <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> in <a href="Reincarnation%20in%20popular%20western%20culture">Western popular culture</a>. "<a href="Gunga%20Jumna">Gunga Jumna</a>" (1961), written and produced by <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a>, was a <a href="crime%20drama">crime drama</a> about two brothers on opposite sides of the law, a theme that later became common in Indian films since the 1970s. Other acclaimed mainstream Hindi filmmakers at the time included <a href="Kamal%20Amrohi">Kamal Amrohi</a> and <a href="Vijay%20Bhatt">Vijay Bhatt</a>.

Successful actors at the time included <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a>, <a href="Raj%20Kapoor">Raj Kapoor</a>, <a href="Dev%20Anand">Dev Anand</a>, and <a href="Guru%20Dutt">Guru Dutt</a>, while successful actresses included <a href="Nargis">Nargis</a>, <a href="Vyjayanthimala">Vyjayanthimala</a>, <a href="Meena%20Kumari">Meena Kumari</a>, <a href="Nutan">Nutan</a>, <a href="Madhubala">Madhubala</a>, <a href="Sadhana%20Shivdasani">Sadhana</a>, <a href="Waheeda%20Rehman">Waheeda Rehman</a> and <a href="Mala%20Sinha">Mala Sinha</a>. The three most popular male Indian actors of the 1950s and 1960s were Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, and Dev Anand, each with their own unique acting style. Kapoor followed the "<a href="The%20Tramp">tramp</a>" style of <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>, Anand modelled himself after the "suave" style of <a href="Hollywood%20movie">Hollywood movie</a> stars like <a href="Gregory%20Peck">Gregory Peck</a> and <a href="Cary%20Grant">Cary Grant</a>, and Kumar pioneered a form of <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a> that was similar to yet predated Hollywood method actors such as <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>. Kumar, who was described as "the ultimate method actor" by <a href="Satyajit%20Ray">Satyajit Ray</a> and is considered one of India's greatest actors, inspired future generations of Indian actors; much like Brando's influence on <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a> and <a href="Al%20Pacino">Al Pacino</a>, Kumar had a similar influence on later Indian actors such as <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, <a href="Naseeruddin%20Shah">Naseeruddin Shah</a>, <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> and <a href="Nawazuddin%20Siddiqui">Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a>.

While commercial Hindi cinema was thriving, the 1950s also saw the emergence of a new <a href="Parallel%20Cinema">Parallel Cinema</a> movement. Though the movement was mainly led by <a href="Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">Bengali cinema</a>, it also began gaining prominence in Hindi cinema. Early examples of Hindi films in this movement include "<a href="Neecha%20Nagar">Neecha Nagar</a>" (1946) directed by <a href="Chetan%20Anand%20%28director%29">Chetan Anand</a> and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, and Bimal Roy's "<a href="Do%20Bigha%20Zamin">Do Bigha Zamin</a>" (1953). Their critical acclaim, as well as the latter's commercial success, paved the way for Indian <a href="Neorealism%20%28art%29">neorealism</a> and the "Indian New Wave". Some of the internationally acclaimed Hindi filmmakers involved in the movement included <a href="Mani%20Kaul">Mani Kaul</a>, <a href="Kumar%20Shahani">Kumar Shahani</a>, <a href="Ketan%20Mehta">Ketan Mehta</a>, <a href="Govind%20Nihalani">Govind Nihalani</a>, <a href="Shyam%20Benegal">Shyam Benegal</a> and <a href="Vijaya%20Mehta">Vijaya Mehta</a>.

Ever since the <a href="Social%20realism">social realist</a> film "Neecha Nagar" won the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Grand Prize</a> at the <a href="1946%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">first Cannes Film Festival</a>, Hindi films were frequently in competition for the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, with some of them winning major prizes at the festival. <a href="Guru%20Dutt">Guru Dutt</a>, while overlooked in his own lifetime, had belatedly generated international recognition much later in the 1980s. Dutt is now regarded as one of the greatest <a href="Asian%20cinema">Asian filmmakers</a> of all time, alongside the more famous Indian Bengali filmmaker <a href="Satyajit%20Ray">Satyajit Ray</a>. The 2002 "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" critics' and directors' poll of greatest filmmakers ranked Dutt at No. 73 on the list. Some of his films are now included among the <a href="Films%20considered%20the%20greatest%20ever">greatest films of all time</a>, with "<a href="Pyaasa">Pyaasa</a>" (1957) being featured in <a href="Time%20magazine%27s%20%26quot%3BAll-TIME%26quot%3B%20100%20best%20movies">Time magazine's "All-TIME" 100 best movies</a> list, and with both "Pyaasa" and "<a href="Kaagaz%20Ke%20Phool">Kaagaz Ke Phool</a>" (1959) tied at No. 160 in the 2002 "Sight & Sound" critics' and directors' poll of all-time greatest films. Several other Hindi films from this era were also ranked in the "Sight & Sound" poll, including <a href="Raj%20Kapoor">Raj Kapoor</a>'s "<a href="Awara%20%281951%20film%29">Awaara</a>" (1951), <a href="Vijay%20Bhatt">Vijay Bhatt</a>'s "<a href="Baiju%20Bawra%20%28film%29">Baiju Bawra</a>" (1952), <a href="Mehboob%20Khan">Mehboob Khan</a>'s "<a href="Mother%20India">Mother India</a>" (1957) and <a href="K.%20Asif">K. Asif</a>'s "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>" (1960) all tied at No. 346 on the list.

The 1970s was when the name "Bollywood" was coined, and when the quintessential conventions of commercial Bollywood films were established. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, romance movies and action films starred actors like <a href="Shammi%20Kapoor">Shammi Kapoor</a>, <a href="Jeetendra">Jeetendra</a>, <a href="Rajesh%20Khanna">Rajesh Khanna</a>, <a href="Dharmendra">Dharmendra</a>, <a href="Sanjeev%20Kumar">Sanjeev Kumar</a> and <a href="Shashi%20Kapoor">Shashi Kapoor</a> and actresses like <a href="Sharmila%20Tagore">Sharmila Tagore</a>, <a href="Mumtaz%20%28actress%29">Mumtaz</a>, <a href="Saira%20Banu">Saira Banu</a> and <a href="Asha%20Parekh">Asha Parekh</a>. In the mid-1970s, romantic confections made way for gritty, violent films about gangsters (see <a href="Indian%20mafia">Indian mafia</a>) and bandits. <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, the star known for his "angry young man" roles, rode the crest of this trend with actors like <a href="Feroz%20Khan%20%28actor%29">Feroz Khan</a>, <a href="Mithun%20Chakraborty">Mithun Chakraborty</a>, <a href="Naseeruddin%20Shah">Naseeruddin Shah</a>, <a href="Jackie%20Shroff">Jackie Shroff</a>, <a href="Sanjay%20Dutt">Sanjay Dutt</a>, <a href="Anil%20Kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a> and <a href="Sunny%20Deol">Sunny Deol</a>, which lasted into the early 1990s. Actresses from this era included <a href="Hema%20Malini">Hema Malini</a>, <a href="Jaya%20Bachchan">Jaya Bachchan</a>, <a href="Rakhee%20Gulzar">Raakhee</a>, <a href="Shabana%20Azmi">Shabana Azmi</a>, <a href="Zeenat%20Aman">Zeenat Aman</a>, <a href="Parveen%20Babi">Parveen Babi</a>, <a href="Rekha">Rekha</a>, <a href="Dimple%20Kapadia">Dimple Kapadia</a>, <a href="Smita%20Patil">Smita Patil</a>, <a href="Jaya%20Prada">Jaya Prada</a> and <a href="Padmini%20Kolhapure">Padmini Kolhapure</a>.

The 1970s saw the emergence of the <a href="masala%20film">masala film</a> genre, which combines elements of multiple genres (<a href="Action%20film">action</a>, <a href="Comedy%20film">comedy</a>, <a href="Romance%20film">romance</a>, <a href="Drama%20film">drama</a>, <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>, <a href="Musical%20film">musical</a>). "<a href="Yaadon%20Ki%20Baarat">Yaadon Ki Baarat</a>" (1973), directed by <a href="Nasir%20Hussain">Nasir Hussain</a> and written by <a href="Salim-Javed">Salim-Javed</a>, has been identified as the first masala film and the "first" quintessentially "Bollywood" film. The screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, consisting of <a href="Salim%20Khan">Salim Khan</a> and <a href="Javed%20Akhtar">Javed Akhtar</a>, went on to write more successful masala films in the 1970s and 1980s. A landmark for the masala film genre was "<a href="Amar%20Akbar%20Anthony">Amar Akbar Anthony</a>" (1977), directed by <a href="Manmohan%20Desai">Manmohan Desai</a> and written by <a href="Kader%20Khan">Kader Khan</a>. Manmohan Desai went on to successfully exploit the genre in the 1970s and 1980s. The "<a href="Curry%20Western">Curry Western</a>" trend that began with "<a href="Sholay">Sholay</a>" (1975), written by Salim-Javed, also falls under the masala film genre. During the 1970s, commercial Bollywood films drew from several foreign influences, including <a href="New%20Hollywood">New Hollywood</a>, <a href="Hong%20Kong%20martial%20arts%20cinema">Hong Kong martial arts cinema</a>, and Italian <a href="exploitation%20film">exploitation film</a>s. Masala films launched Amitabh Bachchan into the biggest Bollywood movie star of the 1970s and 1980s.

Some Hindi filmmakers such as <a href="Shyam%20Benegal">Shyam Benegal</a> continued to produce realistic <a href="Parallel%20Cinema">Parallel Cinema</a> throughout the 1970s, alongside <a href="Mani%20Kaul">Mani Kaul</a>, <a href="Kumar%20Shahani">Kumar Shahani</a>, <a href="Ketan%20Mehta">Ketan Mehta</a>, <a href="Govind%20Nihalani">Govind Nihalani</a> and <a href="Vijaya%20Mehta">Vijaya Mehta</a>. However, the 'art film' bent of the Film Finance Corporation came under criticism during a Committee on Public Undertakings investigation in 1976, which accused the body of not doing enough to encourage commercial cinema. The 1970s thus saw the rise of commercial cinema in the form of enduring films such as "<a href="Sholay">Sholay</a>" (1975), which consolidated <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>'s position as a lead actor. The devotional classic "<a href="Jai%20Santoshi%20Ma">Jai Santoshi Ma</a>" was also released in 1975. Another important film from 1975 was "<a href="Deewar%20%281975%20film%29">Deewar</a>", directed by <a href="Yash%20Chopra">Yash Chopra</a> and written by <a href="Salim-Javed">Salim-Javed</a>. A <a href="crime%20film">crime film</a> pitting "a policeman against his brother, a gang leader based on real-life smuggler <a href="Haji%20Mastan">Haji Mastan</a>", portrayed by <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>; it was described as being "absolutely key to Indian cinema" by <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>. "Deewar" was also inspired by the 1961 <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a> film "<a href="Gunga%20Jumna">Gunga Jumna</a>". The most internationally acclaimed Hindi film of the 1980s was <a href="Mira%20Nair">Mira Nair</a>'s "<a href="Salaam%20Bombay%21">Salaam Bombay!</a>" (1988), which won the <a href="Camera%20d%27Or">Camera d'Or</a> at the <a href="1988%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1988 Cannes Film Festival</a> and was nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</a>.

The period of Hindi cinema from the 1990s onwards is referred to as "New Bollywood" cinema. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the pendulum swung back toward family-centric romantic musicals with the success of such films as "<a href="Qayamat%20Se%20Qayamat%20Tak">Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak</a>" (1988), "<a href="Maine%20Pyar%20Kiya">Maine Pyar Kiya</a>" (1989), "<a href="Chandni%20%281989%20film%29">Chandni</a>" (1989), "<a href="Hum%20Aapke%20Hain%20Kaun">Hum Aapke Hain Kaun</a>" (1994), "<a href="Dilwale%20Dulhania%20Le%20Jayenge">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</a>" (1995), "<a href="Raja%20Hindustani">Raja Hindustani</a>" (1996), "<a href="Dil%20To%20Pagal%20Hai">Dil To Pagal Hai</a>" (1997), "<a href="Pyaar%20To%20Hona%20Hi%20Tha">Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha</a>" (1998) and "<a href="Kuch%20Kuch%20Hota%20Hai">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>" (1998). A new generation of popular actors emerged such as <a href="Aamir%20Khan">Aamir Khan</a>, <a href="Ajay%20Devgan">Ajay Devgan</a>, <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>, <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a> and <a href="Shahrukh%20Khan">Shahrukh Khan</a> and actresses such as <a href="Madhuri%20Dixit">Madhuri Dixit</a>, <a href="Sridevi">Sridevi</a>, <a href="Juhi%20Chawla">Juhi Chawla</a>, <a href="Meenakshi%20Seshadri">Meenakshi Seshadri</a>, <a href="Kajol">Kajol</a> and <a href="Karisma%20Kapoor">Karisma Kapoor</a>. In that point of time, action films and comedy films were also successful, with actors like <a href="Govinda%20%28actor%29">Govinda</a>, <a href="Sunny%20Deol">Sunny Deol</a>, <a href="Sunil%20Shetty">Sunil Shetty</a>, Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgan with Akshay Kumar gaining popularity for <a href="Stunt%20performer">performing</a> dangerous <a href="stunt">stunt</a>s in <a href="action%20film">action film</a>s in his well-known <a href="Khiladi%20%28film%20series%29">Khiladi (film series)</a> and other action films. Actresses during this time included <a href="Raveena%20Tandon">Raveena Tandon</a>, <a href="Twinkle%20Khanna">Twinkle Khanna</a>, <a href="Sonali%20Bendre">Sonali Bendre</a>, <a href="Sushmita%20Sen">Sushmita Sen</a>, <a href="Mahima%20Chaudhry">Mahima Chaudhary</a> and <a href="Shilpa%20Shetty">Shilpa Shetty</a>. Furthermore, this decade marked the entry of new performers in <a href="Art%20film">arthouse</a> and independent films, some of which succeeded commercially, the most influential example being "<a href="Satya%20%28film%29">Satya</a>" (1998), directed by <a href="Ram%20Gopal%20Varma">Ram Gopal Varma</a> and written by <a href="Anurag%20Kashyap">Anurag Kashyap</a>. The critical and commercial success of "Satya" led to the emergence of a distinct genre known as "<a href="Mumbai%20noir">Mumbai noir</a>", urban films reflecting social problems in the city of <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. This led to a resurgence of <a href="Parallel%20Cinema">Parallel Cinema</a> by the end of the decade. These films often featured actors like <a href="Nana%20Patekar">Nana Patekar</a> and <a href="Manoj%20Bajpai">Manoj Bajpai</a>, and actresses like <a href="Manisha%20Koirala">Manisha Koirala</a>, <a href="Tabu%20%28actress%29">Tabu</a>, <a href="Pooja%20Bhatt">Pooja Bhatt</a> and <a href="Urmila%20Matondkar">Urmila Matondkar</a>, whose performances were usually critically acclaimed.

Since the 1990s, the three biggest Bollywood movie stars have been the "<a href="Khans%20of%20Bollywood">Three Khans</a>": <a href="Aamir%20Khan">Aamir Khan</a>, <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a>, and <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a>. Combined, they have starred in most of the top ten <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Bollywood%20films">highest-grossing Bollywood films</a>. The three Khans have had successful careers since the late 1980s, and have dominated the Indian box office since the 1990s, across three decades. Shah Rukh Khan was the most successful Indian actor for most of the 1990s and 2000s, while Aamir Khan has been the most successful Indian actor since the late 2000s.

The 2000s saw a growth in Bollywood's recognition across the world due to a growing and prospering <a href="Non-resident%20Indian%20and%20person%20of%20Indian%20origin">NRI community</a>. A fast growth in the Indian economy and a demand for quality entertainment in this era, led the nation's film-making to new heights in terms of production values, cinematography and innovative story lines as well as technical advances in areas such as special effects and animation. Some of the largest production houses, among them <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a> and <a href="Dharma%20Productions">Dharma Productions</a> were the producers of new modern films. Some popular films of the decade were "<a href="Kaho%20Naa...%20Pyaar%20Hai">Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai</a>" (2000), "" (2001), "<a href="Lagaan">Lagaan</a>" (2001), "<a href="Koi...%20Mil%20Gaya">Koi... Mil Gaya</a>" (2003), "<a href="Munna%20Bhai%20M.B.B.S.">Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.</a>" (2003), "<a href="Rang%20De%20Basanti">Rang De Basanti</a>" (2006), "<a href="Lage%20Raho%20Munna%20Bhai">Lage Raho Munna Bhai</a>" (2006), "<a href="Dhoom%202">Dhoom 2</a>" (2006), "<a href="Krrish">Krrish</a>" (2006) and "<a href="Jab%20We%20Met">Jab We Met</a>" (2007) among others. This decade also saw the rise of popular actors and movie stars like <a href="Hrithik%20Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a>, <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a>, <a href="Vivek%20Oberoi">Vivek Oberoi</a>, <a href="Shahid%20Kapoor">Shahid Kapoor</a> and <a href="John%20Abraham%20%28actor%29">John Abraham</a>, as well as actresses like <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a>, <a href="Rani%20Mukerji">Rani Mukerji</a>, <a href="Preity%20Zinta">Preity Zinta</a>, <a href="Ameesha%20Patel">Ameesha Patel</a>, <a href="Lara%20Dutta">Lara Dutta</a>, <a href="Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</a>, <a href="Kareena%20Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a>, <a href="Priyanka%20Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> and <a href="Katrina%20Kaif">Katrina Kaif</a>.

In the 2010s, the industry saw the trend of established movie stars like <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a>, <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> and <a href="Shahrukh%20Khan">Shahrukh Khan</a> making big-budget masala entertainers like "<a href="Dabangg">Dabangg</a>" (2010), "<a href="Ek%20Tha%20Tiger">Ek Tha Tiger</a>" (2012), "<a href="Rowdy%20Rathore">Rowdy Rathore</a>" (2012), "<a href="Chennai%20Express">Chennai Express</a>" (2013), "<a href="Kick%20%282014%20film%29">Kick</a>" (2014) and "<a href="Happy%20New%20Year%20%282014%20film%29">Happy New Year</a>" (2014) opposite much younger actresses. These films were often not the subject of critical acclaim, but were nonetheless major commercial successes. While most stars from the 2000s continued their successful careers into the next decade, the 2010s also saw the rise of a new generation of popular actors like <a href="Ranbir%20Kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor</a>, <a href="Ranveer%20Singh">Ranveer Singh</a>, <a href="Varun%20Dhawan">Varun Dhawan</a>, <a href="Sidharth%20Malhotra">Sidharth Malhotra</a>, <a href="Sushant%20Singh%20Rajput">Sushant Singh Rajput</a>, <a href="Arjun%20Kapoor">Arjun Kapoor</a>, <a href="Aditya%20Roy%20Kapur">Aditya Roy Kapur</a> and <a href="Tiger%20Shroff">Tiger Shroff</a>, as well as actresses like <a href="Vidya%20Balan">Vidya Balan</a>, <a href="Kangana%20Ranaut">Kangana Ranaut</a>, <a href="Deepika%20Padukone">Deepika Padukone</a>, <a href="Sonam%20Kapoor">Sonam Kapoor</a>, <a href="Anushka%20Sharma">Anushka Sharma</a>, <a href="Sonakshi%20Sinha">Sonakshi Sinha</a>, <a href="Jacqueline%20Fernandez">Jacqueline Fernandez</a>, <a href="Shraddha%20Kapoor">Shraddha Kapoor</a> and <a href="Alia%20Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a>, with Balan and Ranaut gaining wide recognition for successful female-centric films such as "<a href="The%20Dirty%20Picture">The Dirty Picture</a>" (2011), "<a href="Kahaani">Kahaani</a>" (2012) and "<a href="Queen%20%282014%20film%29">Queen</a>" (2014), "<a href="Tanu%20Weds%20Manu%20Returns">Tanu Weds Manu Returns</a>" (2015). While <a href="Kareena%20Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a> and <a href="Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</a> are few of the working actresses from the 2000's who completed successful 15 years in the industry.

Gokulsing and Dissanayake identify six major influences that have shaped the conventions of Indian popular cinema:

Perhaps the biggest influence of Bollywood has been on nationalism in <a href="India">India</a> itself, where along with rest of Indian cinema, it has become part and parcel of the 'Indian story'. In the words of the economist and Bollywood biographer <a href="Meghnad%20Desai%2C%20Baron%20Desai">Lord Meghnad Desai</a>,
Cinema actually has been the most vibrant medium for telling <a href="India">India</a> its own story, the story of its struggle for independence, its constant struggle to achieve national integration and to emerge as a global presence.
In the 2000s, Bollywood began influencing <a href="musical%20film">musical film</a>s in the Western world, and played a particularly instrumental role in the revival of the American musical film genre. <a href="Baz%20Luhrmann">Baz Luhrmann</a> stated that his musical film "<a href="Moulin%20Rouge%21">Moulin Rouge!</a>" (2001) was directly inspired by Bollywood musicals. The film incorporated an Indian-themed play based on the ancient <a href="Sanskrit%20drama">Sanskrit drama</a> "<a href="M%E1%B9%9Bcchakatika">Mṛcchakatika</a>" and a Bollywood-style dance sequence with a song from the film "<a href="China%20Gate%20%281998%20film%29">China Gate</a>". The critical and financial success of "Moulin Rouge!" renewed interest in the then-moribund Western musical genre, and subsequently films such as "<a href="Chicago%20%282002%20film%29">Chicago</a>, <a href="The%20Producers%20%282005%20film%29">The Producers</a>, <a href="Rent%20%28film%29">Rent</a>", "<a href="Dreamgirls%20%28film%29">Dreamgirls</a>", "<a href="Hairspray%20%282007%20film%29">Hairspray</a>", "", "<a href="Across%20the%20Universe%20%28film%29">Across the Universe</a>", "<a href="The%20Phantom%20of%20the%20Opera%20%282004%20film%29">The Phantom of the Opera</a>", "<a href="Enchanted%20%282007%20film%29">Enchanted</a>" and "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21%20%28film%29">Mamma Mia!</a>" were produced, fuelling a renaissance of the genre.

<a href="A.%20R.%20Rahman">A. R. Rahman</a>, an Indian film composer, wrote the music for <a href="Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>'s "<a href="Bombay%20Dreams">Bombay Dreams</a>", and a musical version of "<a href="Hum%20Aapke%20Hain%20Koun">Hum Aapke Hain Koun</a>" has played in London's West End. The Bollywood musical "<a href="Lagaan">Lagaan</a>" (2001) was nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</a>, and two other Bollywood films "<a href="Devdas%20%282002%20Hindi%20film%29">Devdas</a>" (2002) and "<a href="Rang%20De%20Basanti">Rang De Basanti</a>" (2006) were nominated for the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Not%20in%20the%20English%20Language">BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language</a>. <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>'s "<a href="Slumdog%20Millionaire">Slumdog Millionaire</a>" (2008), which has won four <a href="66th%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards">Golden Globes</a> and <a href="81st%20Academy%20Awards%20nominees%20and%20winners">eight Academy Awards</a>, was also directly inspired by Bollywood films, and is considered to be a "homage to Hindi commercial cinema". The theme of <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> was also popularised in <a href="Reincarnation%20in%20popular%20western%20culture">Western popular culture</a> through Bollywood films, with "<a href="Madhumati">Madhumati</a>" (1958) inspiring the Hollywood film "<a href="The%20Reincarnation%20of%20Peter%20Proud">The Reincarnation of Peter Proud</a>" (1975), which in turn inspired the Bollywood film "<a href="Karz%20%28film%29">Karz</a>" (1980), which in turn influenced another Hollywood film "<a href="Chances%20Are%20%28film%29">Chances Are</a>" (1989). The 1975 film "<a href="Chhoti%20Si%20Baat">Chhoti Si Baat</a>" is believed to have inspired "<a href="Hitch%20%28film%29">Hitch</a>" (2005), which in turn inspired the Bollywood film "<a href="Partner%20%282007%20film%29">Partner</a>" (2007).

The influence of Bollywood "<a href="filmi">filmi</a>" music can also be seen in <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> elsewhere in the world. In 1978, <a href="Electropop">technopop</a> pioneers <a href="Haruomi%20Hosono">Haruomi Hosono</a> and <a href="Ryuichi%20Sakamoto">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> of the <a href="Yellow%20Magic%20Orchestra">Yellow Magic Orchestra</a> produced an <a href="Electronic%20music">electronic</a> album "Cochin Moon" based on an <a href="Experimental%20music">experimental</a> <a href="Fusion%20%28music%29">fusion</a> between electronic music and Bollywood-inspired Indian music. <a href="Devo">Devo</a>'s 1988 hit song "Disco Dancer" was inspired by the song "I am a Disco Dancer" from the Bollywood film "<a href="Disco%20Dancer">Disco Dancer</a>" (1982). The 2002 song "<a href="Addictive%20%28song%29">Addictive</a>", sung by <a href="Truth%20Hurts">Truth Hurts</a> and produced by <a href="DJ%20Quik">DJ Quik</a> and <a href="Dr.%20Dre">Dr. Dre</a>, was lifted from <a href="Lata%20Mangeshkar">Lata Mangeshkar</a>'s "Thoda Resham Lagta Hai" from "Jyoti" (1981). <a href="The%20Black%20Eyed%20Peas">The Black Eyed Peas</a>' <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> winning 2005 song "<a href="Don%27t%20Phunk%20with%20My%20Heart">Don't Phunk with My Heart</a>" was inspired by two 1970s <a href="Bollywood%20songs">Bollywood songs</a>: "Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana" from "<a href="Don%20%281978%20film%29">Don</a>" (1978) and "Ae Nujawan Hai Sub" from "<a href="Apradh">Apradh</a>" (1972). Both songs were originally composed by <a href="Kalyanji%20Anandji">Kalyanji Anandji</a>, sung by <a href="Asha%20Bhosle">Asha Bhosle</a>, and featured the dancer <a href="Helen%20%28actress%29">Helen</a>. Also in 2005, the <a href="Kronos%20Quartet">Kronos Quartet</a> re-recorded several <a href="R.%20D.%20Burman">R. D. Burman</a> compositions, with <a href="Asha%20Bhosle">Asha Bhosle</a> as the singer, into an album "<a href="You%27ve%20Stolen%20My%20Heart%20%28album%29">You've Stolen My Heart: Songs from R.D. Burman's Bollywood</a>", which was nominated for "Best Contemporary World Music Album" at the 2006 Grammy Awards. "Filmi" music composed by <a href="A.%20R.%20Rahman">A. R. Rahman</a> (who would later win two <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> for the <a href="Slumdog%20Millionaire%20%28soundtrack%29">"Slumdog Millionaire" soundtrack</a>) has frequently been sampled by musicians elsewhere in the world, including the Singaporean artist <a href="Kelly%20Poon">Kelly Poon</a>, the <a href="Music%20of%20Uzbekistan">Uzbek artist</a> Iroda Dilroz, the French rap group <a href="La%20Caution">La Caution</a>, the American artist <a href="Ciara">Ciara</a>, and the German band <a href="L%C3%B6wenherz">Löwenherz</a>, among others. Many <a href="Asian%20Underground">Asian Underground</a> artists, particularly those among the <a href="Non-resident%20Indian%20and%20person%20of%20Indian%20origin">overseas Indian diaspora</a>, have also been inspired by Bollywood music.

Bollywood films are mostly <a href="Musical%20film">musicals</a> and are expected to contain catchy music in the form of song-and-dance numbers woven into the script. A film's success often depends on the quality of such musical numbers. Indeed, a film's music is often released before the movie and helps increase the audience.

Indian audiences expect full value for their money, with a good entertainer generally referred to as "<a href="paisa">paisa</a>" "vasool", (literally, "money's worth"). Songs and dances, love triangles, comedy and dare-devil thrills are all mixed up in a three-hour extravaganza with an intermission. They are called "<a href="Masala%20film">Masala film</a>s", after the Hindi word for a spice mixture. Like "masalas", these movies are a mixture of many things such as action, comedy, romance and so on. Most films have heroes who are able to fight off villains all by themselves.

Bollywood plots have tended to be <a href="melodramatic">melodramatic</a>. They frequently employ formulaic ingredients such as star-crossed lovers and angry parents, love triangles, family ties, sacrifice, corrupt politicians, kidnappers, conniving villains, <a href="Hooker%20with%20a%20heart%20of%20gold">courtesans with hearts of gold</a>, long-lost relatives and siblings separated by fate, dramatic reversals of fortune, and convenient coincidences.

There have always been Indian films with more artistic aims and more sophisticated stories, both inside and outside the Bollywood tradition (see <a href="Parallel%20Cinema">Parallel Cinema</a>). They often lost out at the box office to movies with more mass appeal. Bollywood conventions are changing, however. A large Indian diaspora in English-speaking countries, and increased <a href="Western%20culture">Western</a> influence at home, have nudged Bollywood films closer to Hollywood models.

Film critic Lata Khubchandani writes, "our earliest films ... had liberal doses of sex and kissing scenes in them. Strangely, it was after Independence the censor board came into being and so did all the strictures." Plots now tend to feature Westernised urbanites dating and dancing in clubs rather than centring on pre-arranged marriages. Though these changes can widely be seen in contemporary Bollywood, traditional conservative ways of Indian culture continue to exist in <a href="India">India</a> outside the industry and an element of resistance by some to western-based influences. Despite this, Bollywood continues to play a major role in <a href="fashion%20in%20India">fashion in India</a>. Some studies into fashion in <a href="India">India</a> have revealed that some people are unaware that the changing nature of fashion in Bollywood films are often influenced by globalisation; many consider the clothes worn by Bollywood actors as authentically Indian.

Bollywood employs people from all parts of <a href="India">India</a>. It attracts thousands of aspiring actors and actresses, all hoping for a break in the industry. Models and beauty contestants, television actors, theatre actors and even common people come to Mumbai with the hope and dream of becoming a star. Just as in <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>, very few succeed. Since many Bollywood films are shot abroad, many foreign extras are employed too.

Very few non-Indian actors are able to make a mark in Bollywood, though many have tried from time to time. There have been some exceptions, of which one recent example is the hit film "<a href="Rang%20De%20Basanti">Rang De Basanti</a>", where the lead actress is <a href="Alice%20Patten">Alice Patten</a>, an Englishwoman. "<a href="Kisna">Kisna</a>", "<a href="Lagaan">Lagaan</a>", and "" also featured foreign actors. Of late, <a href="Emma%20Brown%20Garett">Emma Brown Garett</a>, an Australian born actress, has starred in a few Indian films.

Bollywood can be very clannish, and the relatives of film-industry insiders have an edge in getting coveted roles in films or being part of a film's crew. However, industry connections are no guarantee of a long career: competition is fierce and if film industry scions do not succeed at the box office, their careers will falter. Some of the biggest stars, such as <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a>, <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, <a href="Rajesh%20Khanna">Rajesh Khanna</a>, <a href="Dharmendra">Dharmendra</a>, <a href="Madhuri%20Dixit">Madhuri Dixit</a>, <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> and <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> have succeeded despite a lack of any show business connections. For film clans, see <a href="List%20of%20Hindi%20film%20clans">List of Hindi film clans</a>.

Sound in Bollywood films was once rarely recorded on location (otherwise known as sync sound). Therefore, the sound was usually created (or re-created) entirely in the studio, with the actors reciting their lines as their images appear on-screen in the studio in the process known as "looping in the sound" or <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">ADR</a>—with the <a href="Voice%20Foley">foley</a> and sound effects added later. This created several problems, since the sound in these films usually occurs a frame or two earlier or later than the mouth movements or gestures. The actors had to act twice: once on-location, once in the studio—and the emotional level on set is often very difficult to re-create. Commercial Indian films, not just the Hindi-language variety, are known for their lack of ambient sound, so there is a silence underlying everything instead of the background sound and noises usually employed in films to create aurally perceivable depth and environment.

The ubiquity of ADR in Bollywood cinema became prevalent in the early 1960s with the arrival of the <a href="Arri">Arriflex 3</a> camera, which required a blimp (cover) to shield the sound of the camera, for which it was notorious, from on-location filming. Commercial Indian filmmakers, known for their speed, never bothered to blimp the camera, and its excessive noise required that everything had to be re-created in the studio. Eventually, this became the standard for Indian films.

The trend was bucked in 2001, after a 30-year hiatus of synchronised sound, with the film "<a href="Lagaan">Lagaan</a>", in which the sound was done on the location. This opened up a heated debate on the use and economic feasibility of on-location sound, and several Bollywood films have employed on-location sound since then.

In 1955 the Bollywood group Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) created a rule that did not allow women to obtain memberships as makeup artists. However, in 2014 the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20India">Supreme Court of India</a> ruled that this rule was in violation of the Indian constitutional guarantees granted under Article 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(g) (freedom to carry out any profession) and Article 21 (right to liberty). The judges of the Supreme Court of India stated that the ban on women makeup artist members had no "rationale nexus" to the cause sought to be achieved and was "unacceptable, impermissible and inconsistent" with the constitutional rights guaranteed to the citizens. The Court also found illegal the rule which mandated that for any artist, female or male, to work in the industry, they must have domicile status of five years in the state where they intend to work. In 2015 it was announced that Charu Khurana had become the first woman to be registered by the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association.

Bollywood film music is called <a href="filmi">filmi</a> music (from Hindi, meaning "of films"). Songs from Bollywood movies are generally pre-recorded by professional playback singers, with the actors then <a href="lip%20sync">lip sync</a>hing the words to the song on-screen, often while dancing. While most actors, especially today, are excellent dancers, few are also singers. One notable exception was <a href="Kishore%20Kumar">Kishore Kumar</a>, who starred in several major films in the 1950s while also having a stellar career as a playback singer. <a href="Kundan%20Lal%20Saigal">K. L. Saigal</a>, Suraiyya, and <a href="Noor%20Jehan">Noor Jehan</a> were also known as both singers and actors. Some actors in the last thirty years have sung one or more songs themselves; for a list, see <a href="Singing%20actors%20and%20actresses%20in%20Indian%20cinema">Singing actors and actresses in Indian cinema</a>.

Songs are what make and break the movie; they determine if it is going to be a flop or a hit: "Few films without successful musical tracks, and even fewer without any songs and dances, succeed" With the increase of globalization, there has also been a change in the type of music that Bollywood films entail; the lyrics of the songs have increasingly been a mix of Hindi and English languages, as opposed to the strict Hindi prior to Globalization. Also, with the inspiration of global trends, such as Salsa, Pop and Hip Hop, there has been a modification of the type of music heard in Bollywood films.

Playback singers are prominently featured in the opening credits and have their own <a href="Fan%20%28aficionado%29">fans</a> who will go to an otherwise lackluster movie just to hear their favourites. Going by the quality as well as the quantity of the songs they rendered, most notable singers of Bollywood are <a href="Lata%20Mangeshkar">Lata Mangeshkar</a>, <a href="Asha%20Bhosle">Asha Bhosle</a>, <a href="Geeta%20Dutt">Geeta Dutt</a>, <a href="Shamshad%20Begum">Shamshad Begum</a>, <a href="Kavita%20Krishnamurthy">Kavita Krishnamurthy</a>, <a href="Sadhana%20Sargam">Sadhana Sargam</a> and <a href="Alka%20Yagnik">Alka Yagnik</a> among female playback singers; and K. L. Saigal, Talat Mahmood, <a href="Mukesh%20%28singer%29">Mukesh</a>, <a href="Mohammed%20Rafi">Mohammed Rafi</a>, <a href="Manna%20Dey">Manna Dey</a>, <a href="Hemant%20Kumar">Hemant Kumar</a>, <a href="Kishore%20Kumar">Kishore Kumar</a>, <a href="Kumar%20Sanu">Kumar Sanu</a>, <a href="Udit%20Narayan">Udit Narayan</a> and <a href="Sonu%20Nigam">Sonu Nigam</a> among male playback singers. Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi are often considered arguably the finest of the singers that have lent their voice to Bollywood songs, followed by Lata Mangeshkar, who, through the course of a career spanning over six decades, has recorded thousands of songs for Indian movies. The composers of film music, known as music directors, are also well-known. Their songs can make or break a film and usually do. <a href="Remix">Remix</a>ing of film songs with modern beats and rhythms is a common occurrence today, and producers may even release remixed versions of some of their films' songs along with the films' regular soundtrack albums.

The dancing in Bollywood films, especially older ones, is primarily modelled on Indian dance: classical dance styles, dances of historic northern Indian courtesans (<a href="tawaif">tawaif</a>), or <a href="folk%20dance">folk dance</a>s. In modern films, Indian dance elements often blend with Western dance styles (as seen on MTV or in Broadway musicals), though it is usual to see Western pop "and" pure classical dance numbers side by side in the same film. The hero or heroine will often perform with a troupe of supporting dancers. Many song-and-dance routines in Indian films feature unrealistically instantaneous shifts of location or changes of costume between verses of a song. If the hero and heroine dance and sing a duet, it is often staged in beautiful natural surroundings or architecturally grand settings. This staging is referred to as a "picturisation".

Songs typically comment on the action taking place in the movie, in several ways. Sometimes, a song is worked into the plot, so that a character has a reason to sing. Other times, a song is an externalisation of a character's thoughts, or presages an event that has not occurred yet in the plot of the movie. In this case, the event is often two characters falling in love. The songs are also often referred to as a "dream sequence", and anything can happen that would not normally happen in the real world.

Previously song and dance scenes often used to be shot in <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, but due to political unrest in Kashmir since the end of the 1980s, those scenes have since then often been shot in Western Europe, particularly in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a href="Austria">Austria</a>.

Renowned contemporary Bollywood dancers include <a href="Madhuri%20Dixit">Madhuri Dixit</a>, <a href="Hrithik%20Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a>, <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai%20Bachchan">Aishwarya Rai Bachchan</a>, <a href="Sridevi">Sridevi</a>, <a href="Meenakshi%20Seshadri">Meenakshi Seshadri</a>, <a href="Malaika%20Arora%20Khan">Malaika Arora Khan</a>, <a href="Shahid%20Kapoor">Shahid Kapoor</a> and <a href="Tiger%20Shroff">Tiger Shroff</a>. Older Bollywood dancers are people such as <a href="Helen%20%28actress%29">Helen</a>, known for her cabaret numbers, <a href="Madhubala">Madhubala</a>, <a href="Vyjanthimala">Vyjanthimala</a>, <a href="Padmini%20%28actress%29">Padmini</a>, <a href="Hema%20Malini">Hema Malini</a>, <a href="Mumtaz">Mumtaz</a>, <a href="Cuckoo%20Moray">Cuckoo Moray</a>, <a href="Parveen%20Babi">Parveen Babi</a><a href="Waheeda%20Rehman">, Waheeda Rahman</a>, <a href="Meena%20Kumari">Meena Kumari</a>, and <a href="Shammi%20Kapoor">Shammi Kapoor</a>.

For the last few decades Bollywood producers have been releasing the film's soundtrack, as tapes or CDs, before the main movie release, hoping that the music will pull audiences into the cinema later. Often the soundtrack is more popular than the movie. In the last few years some producers have also been releasing music videos, usually featuring a song from the film. However, some promotional videos feature a song which is not included in the movie.

The film script or lines of dialogue (called "dialogues" in Indian English) and the song lyrics are often written by different people.

Dialogues are usually written in an unadorned Hindi that would be understood by the largest possible audience. Some movies, however, have used <a href="Hindi%20dialects">regional dialects</a> to evoke a village setting, or old-fashioned, courtly, formal <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> in <a href="Medieval%20India">medieval era</a> <a href="historical%20films">historical films</a>. Jyotika Virdi, in her book "The cinematic imagiNation" , wrote about the presence of Urdu in Hindi films: "Urdu is often used in film titles, screenplay, lyrics, the language of love, war, and martyrdom." However, she further discussed its decline over the years: "The extent of Urdu used in commercial Hindi cinema has not been stable ... the decline of Urdu is mirrored in Hindi films ... It is true that many Urdu words have survived and have become part of Hindi cinema's popular vocabulary. But that is as far as it goes." Contemporary mainstream movies also make great use of English. According to "Bollywood Audiences Editorial", "English has begun to challenge the ideological work done by Urdu." Some movie scripts are first written in <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>. Characters may shift from one language to the other to express a certain atmosphere (for example, English in a business setting and Hindi in an informal one).

Cinematic language, whether in dialogues or lyrics, is often melodramatic and invokes God, family, mother, duty, and self-sacrifice liberally. Song lyrics are often about love. Bollywood song lyrics, especially in the old movies, frequently use the poetic vocabulary of court Urdu, with many Persian loanwords. Another source for love lyrics is the long <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> tradition of poetry about the amours of <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a>, <a href="Radha">Radha</a>, and the <a href="gopi">gopi</a>s, as referenced in films such as "<a href="Jhanak%20Jhanak%20Payal%20Baje">Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje</a>" and "<a href="Lagaan">Lagaan</a>".

Music directors often prefer working with certain lyricists, to the point that the lyricist and composer are seen as a team. This phenomenon is compared to the pairings of American composers and songwriters that created old-time Broadway musicals.

Bollywood films are multi-million dollar productions, with the most expensive productions costing up to 1 billion <a href="Indian%20rupee">rupees</a> (roughly USD 20 million). The latest Science fiction movie "<a href="Ra.One">Ra.One</a>" was made at an immense budget of 1.35 billion (roughly USD 27 million), making it the most expensive movie ever produced in Bollywood. <a href="Set%20%28drama%29">Sets</a>, costumes, special effects, and <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a> were less than world-class up until the mid-to-late 1990s, although with some notable exceptions. As Western films and television gain wider distribution in India itself, there is an increasing pressure for Bollywood films to attain the same production levels, particularly in areas such as action and special effects. Recent Bollywood films have employed international technicians to improve in these areas, such as "<a href="Krrish">Krrish</a>" (2006) which has action choreographed by Hong Kong based <a href="Tony%20Ching%20Siu-Tung">Tony Ching</a>. The increasing accessibility to professional action and special effects, coupled with rising film budgets, has seen an explosion in the action and sci-fi genres.

Sequences shot overseas have proved a real box office draw, so Mumbai film crews are increasingly filming in Australia, Canada, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, the United Kingdom, the United States, <a href="continental%20Europe">continental Europe</a> and elsewhere. Nowadays, Indian producers are winning more and more funding for big-budget films shot within India as well, such as "<a href="Lagaan">Lagaan</a>", "<a href="Devdas%20%282002%20Hindi%20film%29">Devdas</a>" and other recent films.

Funding for Bollywood films often comes from private distributors and a few large <a href="Movie%20studio">studios</a>. Indian banks and financial institutions were forbidden from lending money to movie studios. However, this ban has now been lifted. As finances are not regulated, some funding also comes from illegitimate sources, such as the <a href="Mumbai%20underworld">Mumbai underworld</a>. The Mumbai underworld has been known to be involved in the production of several films, and are notorious for patronising several prominent film personalities. On occasion, they have been known to use money and muscle power to get their way in cinematic deals. In January 2000, Mumbai mafia hitmen shot <a href="Rakesh%20Roshan">Rakesh Roshan</a>, a film director and father of star <a href="Hrithik%20Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a>. In 2001, the <a href="Central%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Central Bureau of Investigation</a> seized all prints of the movie "<a href="Chori%20Chori%20Chupke%20Chupke">Chori Chori Chupke Chupke</a>" after the movie was found to be funded by members of the <a href="Mumbai%20underworld">Mumbai underworld</a>.

Another problem facing Bollywood is widespread <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a> of its films. Often, bootleg <a href="DVD%23DVD%20Video">DVD</a> copies of movies are available before the prints are officially released in cinemas. Manufacturing of bootleg DVD, VCD, and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is a well established 'small scale industry' in parts of South Asia and <a href="South%20East%20Asia">South East Asia</a>. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) estimates that the Bollywood industry loses $100 million annually in loss of revenue from unlicensed home videos and DVDs. Besides catering to the homegrown market, demand for these copies is large amongst some sections of the <a href="Non-resident%20Indian%20and%20person%20of%20Indian%20origin">Indian diaspora</a>, too. (In fact, bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies, since the Government of Pakistan has banned their sale, distribution and telecast). Films are frequently broadcast without compensation by countless small cable TV companies in India and other parts of South Asia. Small convenience stores run by members of the Indian diaspora in the US and the UK regularly stock tapes and DVDs of dubious provenance, while consumer copying adds to the problem. The availability of illegal copies of movies on the Internet also contributes to the industry's losses.

Satellite TV, television and imported foreign films are making huge inroads into the domestic Indian entertainment market. In the past, most Bollywood films could make money; now fewer tend to do so. However, most Bollywood producers make money, recouping their investments from many sources of revenue, including selling ancillary rights. There are also increasing returns from theatres in Western countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, where Bollywood is slowly getting noticed. As more Indians migrate to these countries, they form a growing market for upscale Indian films.

For a comparison of Hollywood and Bollywood financial figures, see chart. It shows tickets sold in 2002 and total revenue estimates. Bollywood sold 3.6 billion tickets and had total revenues (theatre tickets, DVDs, television and so on.) of US$1.3 billion, whereas Hollywood films sold 2.6 billion tickets and generated total revenues (again from all formats) of US$51 billion.

Many Indian artists used to make a living by hand-painting movie billboards and posters (The well-known artist <a href="M%20F%20Husain">M.F. Hussain</a> used to paint film posters early in his career). This was because human labour was found to be cheaper than printing and distributing publicity material. Now, a majority of the huge and ubiquitous billboards in India's major cities are created with computer-printed vinyl. The old hand-painted posters, once regarded as ephemera, are becoming increasingly collectible as <a href="folk%20art">folk art</a>.

Releasing the film music, or music videos, before the actual release of the film can also be considered a form of advertising. A popular tune is believed to help pull audiences into the theatres.

Bollywood publicists have begun to use the Internet as a venue for advertising. Most of the better-funded film releases now have their own websites, where browsers can view trailers, stills, and information about the story, cast, and crew.

Bollywood is also used to advertise other products. <a href="Product%20placement">Product placement</a>, as used in Hollywood, is widely practised in Bollywood.

Bollywood movie stars appear in print and television advertisements for other products, such as watches or soap (see <a href="Celebrity%20endorsement">Celebrity endorsement</a>). Advertisers say that a star endorsement boosts sales.

With the increasing prominence of international setting such as Switzerland, London, Paris, New York, Singapore and so on, it does not entail that the people and cultures residing in these exotic settings are represented. Contrary to these spaces and geographies being filmed as they are, they are actually Indianized by adding Bollywood actors and Hindi speaking extras to them. While immersing in Bollywood films, viewers get to see their local experiences duplicated in different locations around the world.

Rao states that "Media representation can depict India's shifting relation with the world economy, but must retain its 'Indianness' in moments of dynamic hybridity", where "Indianness" refers to the cultural identity and political affiliation. With Bollywood's popularity among diasporic audiences, "Indianness" poses a problem, but at the same time, it gives back to its homeland audience, a sense of uniqueness from other immigrant groups.

The <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a> ceremony is one of the most prominent film events given for Hindi films in India. The Indian screen magazine "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" started the first Filmfare Awards in 1954, and awards were given to the best films of 1953. The ceremony was referred to as the "Clare Awards" after the magazine's editor. Modelled after the poll-based merit format of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>, individuals may submit their votes in separate categories. A dual voting system was developed in 1956. The Filmfare awards are frequently accused of bias towards commercial success rather than artistic merit.

The <a href="National%20Film%20Awards%20%28India%29">National Film Awards</a> were introduced in 1954. Since 1973, the Indian government has sponsored the National Film Awards, awarded by the government run <a href="Directorate%20of%20Film%20Festivals">Directorate of Film Festivals</a> (DFF). The DFF screens not only Bollywood films, but films from all the other regional movie industries and independent/art films. These awards are handed out at an annual ceremony presided over by the President of India. Under this system, in contrast to the National Film Awards, which are decided by a panel appointed by Indian Government, the Filmfare Awards are voted for by both the public and a committee of experts.

Notable private awards ceremonies for Hindi films, held within India are:

Notable private awards ceremonies for Hindi films, held overseas are:

Most of these award ceremonies are lavishly staged spectacles, featuring singing, dancing, and numerous celebrities.


Besides being popular among the India diaspora, such far off locations as Nigeria to Egypt to Senegal and to Russia generations of non-Indian fans have grown up with Bollywood during the years, bearing witness to the cross-cultural appeal of Indian movies. Indian cinema's early contacts with other regions became visible with its films making early inroads into the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, and <a href="China">China</a>.

Over the last years of the 20th century and beyond, Bollywood progressed in its popularity as it entered the consciousness of Western audiences and producers, with Western actors now actively seeking roles in Bollywood movies.

Historically, Hindi films have been distributed to some parts of Africa, largely by Lebanese businessmen. "<a href="Mother%20India">Mother India</a>" (1957), for example, continued to be played in <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> decades after its release. Indian movies have also gained ground so as to alter the style of <a href="Hausa%20people">Hausa</a> fashions, songs have also been copied by Hausa singers and stories have influenced the writings of Nigerian novelists. Stickers of Indian films and stars decorate taxis and buses in Northern Nigeria, while posters of Indian films adorn the walls of tailor shops and mechanics' garages in the country. Unlike in Europe and North America where Indian films largely cater to the expatriate Indian market yearning to keep in touch with their homeland, in West Africa, as in many other parts of the world, such movies rose in popularity despite the lack of a significant Indian audience, where movies are about an alien culture, based on a religion wholly different, and, for the most part, a language that is unintelligible to the viewers. One such explanation for this lies in the similarities between the two cultures. Other similarities include wearing turbans; the presence of animals in markets; porters carrying large bundles, chewing sugar cane; youths riding <a href="Bajaj%20Auto">Bajaj</a> motor scooters; wedding celebrations, and so forth. With the strict Muslim culture, Indian movies were said to show "respect" toward women, where <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood movies</a> were seen to have "no shame". In Indian movies women were modestly dressed, men and women rarely kiss, and there is no <a href="nudity">nudity</a>, thus Indian movies are said to "have culture" that Hollywood films lack. The latter choice was a failure because "they don't base themselves on the problems of the people," where the former is based socialist values and on the reality of developing countries emerging from years of colonialism. Indian movies also allowed for a new youth culture to follow without such ideological baggage as "becoming western." The first ever movie to be shot in Mauritius was <a href="Souten">Souten</a> starring <a href="Rajesh%20Khanna">Rajesh Khanna</a> in 1983.

Several Bollywood personalities have avenued to the continent for both shooting movies and off-camera projects. The film "<a href="Padmashree%20Laloo%20Prasad%20Yadav">Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav</a>" (2005) was one of many movies shot in South Africa. "<a href="Dil%20Jo%20Bhi%20Kahey">Dil Jo Bhi Kahey</a>" (2005) was shot almost entirely in <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, which has a large ethnically Indian population.

Ominously, however, the popularity of old Bollywood versus a new, changing Bollywood seems to be diminishing the popularity on the continent. The changing style of Bollywood has begun to question such an acceptance. The new era features more sexually explicit and violent films. Nigerian viewers, for example, commented that older films of the 1950s and 1960s had culture to the newer, more westernised picturisations. The old days of India avidly "advocating decolonization ... and India's policy was wholly influenced by his missionary zeal to end racial domination and discrimination in the African territories" were replaced by newer realities. The emergence of <a href="Nollywood">Nollywood</a>, Africa's local movie industry has also contributed to the declining popularity of Bollywood films. A greater <a href="globalization">globalised</a> world worked in tandem with the sexualisation of Indian films so as to become more like American films, thus negating the preferred values of an old Bollywood and diminishing Indian <a href="soft%20power">soft power</a>.

Additionally, classic Bollywood actors like <a href="Kishore%20Kumar">Kishore Kumar</a> and <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a> have historically enjoyed popularity in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>. In <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, Bollywood movies are shown alongside Hollywood productions in <a href="Piazza">Piazza</a> theatres, such as the Cinema Ethiopia in <a href="Addis%20Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>. In the other countries of <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, Bollywood films are also broadcast, though local aesthetics tend much more toward expressive or <a href="Auteur%20theory">auteur cinema</a> than commercial fare.

Bollywood films are widely watched in other South Asian countries, including <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.

Many Pakistanis watch Bollywood films, as they understand Hindi (due to its linguistic similarity to <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>). Pakistan banned the legal import of Bollywood movies in 1965. However, trade in unlicensed DVDs and illegal cable broadcasts ensured the continued popularity of Bollywood releases in Pakistan. Exceptions were made for a few films, such as the 2006 colorised re-release of the classic "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>" or the 2006 film "<a href="Taj%20Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>". Early in 2008, the Pakistani government eased the ban and allowed the import of even more movies; 16 were screened in 2008. Continued easing followed in 2009 and 2010. The new policy is opposed by nationalists and representatives of Pakistan's small film industry but is embraced by cinema owners, who are making profits after years of low receipts.
Bollywood movies are so much popular in <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> that, Bollywood movies earn more than Nepali movies. Actors like <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a>, <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> and <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> are most popular in Nepal and their movies sees the audience full pack all over the Cinema halls and also are so popular in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> due to the country's proximity to the Indian subcontinent and cultural perspectives present in the movies. A number of Bollywood movies were filmed inside Afghanistan while some dealt with the country, including "<a href="Dharmatma">Dharmatma</a>", "<a href="Kabul%20Express">Kabul Express</a>", "<a href="Khuda%20Gawah">Khuda Gawah</a>" and "<a href="Escape%20From%20Taliban">Escape From Taliban</a>".

Bollywood films are widely appreciated in East Asian countries such as China, Japan, and <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>. Some Hindi movies had success in the China and South Korea, Japan in the 1940s and 1950s and are popular till today. The most popular Hindi films in that country were "<a href="Dr.%20Kotnis%20Ki%20Amar%20Kahani">Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani</a>" (1946), "<a href="Awara%20%281951%20film%29">Awaara</a>" (1951) and "<a href="Do%20Bigha%20Zamin">Do Bigha Zamin</a>" (1953). <a href="Raj%20Kapoor">Raj Kapoor</a> was a famous movie star in China, and the song "Awara Hoon" ("I am a Tramp") was popular in the country. Since then, Hindi films significantly declined in popularity in China, until the <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a> nominated "<a href="Lagaan">Lagaan</a>" (2001) became the first Indian film to have a nationwide release there in decades. The <a href="Cinema%20of%20China">Chinese</a> filmmaker <a href="He%20Ping">He Ping</a> was impressed by "Lagaan", especially its soundtrack, and thus hired the film's music composer <a href="A.%20R.%20Rahman">A. R. Rahman</a> to score the soundtrack for his film "<a href="Warriors%20of%20Heaven%20and%20Earth">Warriors of Heaven and Earth</a>" (2003). Several older Hindi films have a cult following in Japan, particularly the films directed by <a href="Guru%20Dutt">Guru Dutt</a>. Bollywood films are also popular in Southeast Asia (particularly in <a href="Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia">Maritime Southeast Asia</a>)

<a href="Aamir%20Khan">Aamir Khan</a> has been credited with opening up the <a href="China">Chinese</a> market for Indian films. When "<a href="3%20Idiots">3 Idiots</a>" (2009) released in China, the country was only the 15th largest film market, partly due to China's widespread pirate <a href="DVD">DVD</a> distribution at the time. However, it was the pirate market that introduced "3 Idiots" to most Chinese audiences, becoming a <a href="cult%20hit">cult hit</a> in the country. It became China's 12th favourite film of all time, according to ratings on Chinese film review site <a href="Douban">Douban</a>, with only one domestic Chinese film ("<a href="Farewell%20My%20Concubine%20%28film%29">Farewell My Concubine</a>") ranked higher. Aamir Khan gained a large growing Chinese fanbase as a result. By 2013, China grew to become the world's second largest film market (after the United States), paving the way for Aamir Khan's Chinese box office success, with "<a href="Dhoom%203">Dhoom 3</a>" (2013), "<a href="PK%20%28film%29">PK</a>" (2014), and "<a href="Dangal%20%28film%29">Dangal</a>" (2016), which became the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films%20in%20China">16th highest-grossing film in China</a> and the fifth highest-grossing non-<a href="English%20language">English language</a> film worldwide.

Hindi films have been popular in <a href="Arab%20world">Arab countries</a>, including Palestine, Jordan, Egypt and the <a href="Arab%20states%20of%20the%20Persian%20Gulf">Gulf countries</a>.
Imported Indian films are usually subtitled in Arabic upon the film's release. Since the early 2000s, Bollywood has progressed in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. Special channels dedicated to Indian films have been displayed on cable television. There are channels such as <a href="MBC%20Bollywood">MBC Bollywood</a> and <a href="Zee%20Aflam">Zee Aflam</a>, which show Hindi movies and serials. In Egypt, Bollywood movies used to be massively popular in the 1970's and 1980's. In 1987 however, Bollywood films were restricted to only a handful of films by the Egyptian Government. Bollywood movies are regularly screened in Dubai cinemas because of the high demand. Recently in Turkey, Bollywood has been gaining popularity as <a href="Barfi%21">Barfi!</a> was the first Hindi film to have a wide theatrical release. Bollywood also has viewership in Central Asia (particularly in <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>).

The awareness of Hindi cinema is substantial in the United Kingdom, where they frequently enter the UK top ten. Many films, such as "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham</a>" (2001) have been set in London. Bollywood is also appreciated in France, Germany, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and the <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n countries. Various Bollywood movies are dubbed in German and shown on the German television channel <a href="RTL%20II">RTL II</a> on a regular basis.

Bollywood films are particularly popular in the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Bollywood films have been <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dubbed</a> into Russian, and shown in prominent theatres such as <a href="Mosfilm">Mosfilm</a> and <a href="Lenfilm">Lenfilm</a>.

Indian films were <a href="List%20of%20Soviet%20films%20of%20the%20year%20by%20ticket%20sales">popular in the Soviet Union</a>, more so than <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood films</a> and occasionally even domestic <a href="Soviet%20films">Soviet films</a>. From 1954 to 1991, 206 Indian films (175 of which were Bollywood films) were imported in the Soviet Union, drawing higher average audience figures than domestic Soviet productions, with 50 Indian films drawing more than 20 million viewers (compared to 41 Hollywood films), with some such as "<a href="Awaara">Awaara</a>" (1951) and "<a href="Disco%20Dancer">Disco Dancer</a>" (1982) drawing more than 60 million viewers, establishing Indian actors like <a href="Raj%20Kapoor">Raj Kapoor</a>, <a href="Nargis">Nargis</a>, <a href="Rishi%20Kapoor">Rishi Kapoor</a> and <a href="Mithun%20Chakraborty">Mithun Chakraborty</a> as household names in the country.

Ashok Sharma, Indian Ambassador to <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>, who has served three times in the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a> region during his diplomatic career said:
The film "<a href="Mera%20Naam%20Joker">Mera Naam Joker</a>" (1970), sought to cater to such an appeal and the popularity of <a href="Raj%20Kapoor">Raj Kapoor</a> in Russia, when it recruited Russian actress <a href="Kseniya%20Ryabinkina">Kseniya Ryabinkina</a> for the movie. In the contemporary era, "" (2005) was shot entirely in Russia. After the collapse of the Soviet film distribution system, Hollywood occupied the void created in the Russian film market. This made things difficult for Bollywood as it was losing market share to Hollywood. However, Russian newspapers report that there is a renewed interest in Bollywood among young Russians.

Bollywood has experienced a marked growth in revenue in Canada and the United States, particularly popular amongst the <a href="desi">South Asian communities</a> in large cities, such as <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Chicago, and New York City. <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a>, one of India's largest production houses and distributors, reported in September 2005 that Bollywood films in the United States earn around $100 million a year through theatre screenings, video sales and the sale of movie soundtracks. In other words, films from India do more business in the United States than films from any other non-English speaking country. Numerous films in the mid-1990s and onwards have been largely, or entirely, shot in New York, Los Angeles, Vancouver and Toronto. Bollywood's immersion in the traditional Hollywood domain was further tied with such films as "<a href="The%20Guru%20%282002%20film%29">The Guru</a>" (2002) and "" (2007) trying to popularise the Bollywood-theme for Hollywood.

Bollywood is not as successful in the Oceanic countries and Pacific Islands such as <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. However, it ranks second to <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> in countries such as <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, with its large Indian minority, Australia and New Zealand.

Australia is one of the countries where there is a large South Asian Diaspora. Bollywood is popular amongst non-Asians in the country as well. Since 1997 the country has provided a backdrop for an increasing number of Bollywood films. Indian filmmakers have been attracted to Australia's diverse locations and landscapes, and initially used it as the setting for song-and-dance sequences, which demonstrated the contrast between the values. However, nowadays, Australian locations are becoming more important to the plot of Bollywood films. Hindi films shot in Australia usually incorporate aspects of Australian lifestyle. The <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Film</a> "<a href="Salaam%20Namaste">Salaam Namaste</a>" (2005) became the first Indian film to be shot entirely in Australia and was the most successful Bollywood film of 2005 in the country. This was followed by "<a href="Heyy%20Babyy">Heyy Babyy</a>" (2007) "<a href="Chak%20De%21%20India">Chak De! India</a>" (2007) and "<a href="Singh%20Is%20Kinng">Singh Is Kinng</a>" (2008) which turned out to be box office successes. Following the release of "Salaam Namaste", on a visit to India the then prime minister <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a> also sought, having seen the film, to have more Indian movies shooting in the country to boost tourism, where the Bollywood and cricket nexus, was further tightened with <a href="Steve%20Waugh">Steve Waugh</a>'s appointment as tourism ambassador to India. Australian actress <a href="Tania%20Zaetta">Tania Zaetta</a>, who co-starred in "Salaam Namaste", among other Bollywood films, expressed her keenness to expand her career in Bollywood.

Bollywood movies are not influential in many countries of South America, though Bollywood culture and dance is recognised. However, due to significant South Asian diasporic communities in <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a> and <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, Hindi-language movies are popular. In 2006, "<a href="Dhoom%202">Dhoom 2</a>" became the first Bollywood film to be shot in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, Brazil.

In January 2012, it was announced that UTV Motion Pictures would be releasing movies in <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, starting with "<a href="Guzaarish%20%282010%20film%29">Guzaarish</a>".

Constrained by rushed production schedules and small budgets, some Bollywood writers and musicians have been known to resort to <a href="plagiarism">plagiarism</a>. Ideas, plot lines, tunes or riffs have been copied from other Indian film industries or foreign films (including <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> and other <a href="Asian%20cinema">Asian films</a>) without acknowledgement of the original source. This has led to criticism towards the film industry.

Before the 1990s, this could be done with impunity. <a href="Copyright">Copyright</a> enforcement was lax in India and few actors or directors ever saw an official contract. The Hindi film industry was not widely known to non-Indian audiences (excluding the Soviet states), who would not even be aware that their material was being copied. Audiences may also not have been aware of the plagiarism since many audiences in India were unfamiliar with foreign films and music. While copyright enforcement in India is still somewhat lenient, Bollywood and other film industries are much more aware of each other now and Indian audiences are more familiar with foreign movies and music. Organisations like the India EU Film Initiative seek to foster a community between film makers and industry professional between India and the EU.

One of the common justifications of plagiarism in Bollywood in the media is that producers often play a safer option by remaking popular Hollywood films in an Indian context. Screenwriters generally produce original scripts, but due to financial uncertainty and insecurity over the success of a film many were rejected. Screenwriters themselves have been criticised for lack of creativity which happened due to tight schedules and restricted funds in the industry to employ better screenwriters. Certain filmmakers see plagiarism in Bollywood as an integral part of globalisation where American and western cultures are firmly embedding themselves into Indian culture, which is manifested, amongst other mediums, in Bollywood films. <a href="Vikram%20Bhatt">Vikram Bhatt</a>, director of films such as "<a href="Raaz%20%282002%20film%29">Raaz</a>" which stars <a href="Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</a>, a remake of "<a href="What%20Lies%20Beneath">What Lies Beneath</a>", and "<a href="Kasoor">Kasoor</a>", a remake of "<a href="Jagged%20Edge%20%28film%29">Jagged Edge</a>", has spoken about the strong influence of American culture and desire to produce box office hits based along the same lines in Bollywood. He said, "Financially, I would be more secure knowing that a particular piece of work has already done well at the box office. Copying is endemic everywhere in India. Our TV shows are adaptations of American programmes. We want their films, their cars, their planes, their <a href="Diet%20Coke">Diet Coke</a>s and also their attitude. The American way of life is creeping into our culture." <a href="Mahesh%20Bhatt">Mahesh Bhatt</a> has said, "If you hide the source, you're a genius. There's no such thing as originality in the creative sphere".

There have been very few cases of film copyright violations taken to court because of serious delays in the legal process, and due to the long time they take to decide a case. There have been some notable cases of conflict though. The makers of "<a href="Partner%20%282007%20film%29">Partner</a>" (2007) and "<a href="Zinda%20%28film%29">Zinda</a>" (2005) have been targeted by the owners and distributors of the original films, "<a href="Hitch%20%28film%29">Hitch</a>" and "<a href="Oldboy%20%282003%20film%29">Oldboy</a>". American Studio <a href="Twentieth%20Century%20Fox">Twentieth Century Fox</a> brought the Mumbai-based B.R. Films to court over its forthcoming "Banda Yeh Bindaas Hai", allegedly an illegal remake of its 1992 film "<a href="My%20Cousin%20Vinny">My Cousin Vinny</a>". B.R. Films eventually settled out of court by paying the studio at a cost of about $200,000, paving the way for the film's release. Some on the other hand do comply with copyright law, with Orion Pictures in 2008 securing the rights to remake the Hollywood film "<a href="Wedding%20Crashers">Wedding Crashers</a>".

Bowls

Bowls or lawn bowls is a <a href="sport">sport</a> in which the objective is to roll biased balls so that they stop close to a smaller ball called a "jack" or "kitty". It is played on a <a href="bowling%20green">bowling green</a> which may be flat (for "flat-green bowls") or convex or uneven (for "<a href="crown%20green%20bowls">crown green bowls</a>"). It is normally played outdoors (although there are many indoor venues) and the outdoor surface is either natural grass, <a href="artificial%20turf">artificial turf</a>, or <a href="cotula">cotula</a> (in New Zealand).

It has been traced certainly to the 13th century, and conjecturally to the 12th. <a href="William%20Fitzstephen">William Fitzstephen</a> (d. about 1190), in his biography of <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, gives a graphic sketch of the <a href="London">London</a> of his day and, writing of the summer amusements of the young men, says that on holidays they were "exercised in Leaping, Shooting, Wrestling, Casting of Stones [in jactu lapidum], and Throwing of Javelins fitted with Loops for the Purpose, which they strive to fling before the Mark; they also use Bucklers, like fighting Men." It is commonly supposed that by jactus lapidum, Fitzstephen meant the game of bowls, but though it is possible that round stones may sometimes have been employed in an early variety of the game - and there is a record of iron bowls being used, though at a much later date, on festive occasions at Nairn, - nevertheless the inference seems unwarranted. The jactus lapidum of which he speaks may have been more akin to <a href="shotput">shotput</a>. It is beyond dispute, however, that the game, at any rate in a rudimentary form, was played in the 13th century. A manuscript of that period in the royal library, <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a> (No. 20, E iv.), contains a drawing representing two players aiming at a small cone instead of an earthenware ball or jack. The world's oldest surviving bowling green is the <a href="Southampton%20Old%20Bowling%20Green">Southampton Old Bowling Green</a>, which was first used in 1299.

Another manuscript of the same century has a crude but spirited picture which brings us into close touch with the existing game. Three figures are introduced and a jack. The first player's bowl has come to rest just in front of the jack; the second has delivered his bowl and is following after it with one of those eccentric contortions still not unusual on modern greens, the first player meanwhile making a repressive gesture with his hand, as if to urge the bowl to stop short of his own; the third player is depicted as in the act of delivering his bowl. A 14th-century manuscript, pageRank.Book of Prayers, in the <a href="Francis%20Douce">Francis Douce</a> collection in the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> contains a drawing in which two persons are shown, but they bowl to no mark. Strutt (Sports and Pastimes) suggests that the first player's bowl may have been regarded by the second player as a species of jack; but in that case it is not clear what was the first player's target. In these three earliest illustrations of the pastime it is worth noting that each player has one bowl only, and that the attitude in delivering it was as various five or six hundred years ago as it is today. In the third he stands almost upright; in the first he kneels; in the second he stoops, halfway between the upright and the kneeling position.

The game eventually came under the ban of king and parliament, both fearing it might jeopardise the practice of archery, then so important in battle. Statutes forbidding it and other sports were enacted in the reigns of <a href="Edward%20III">Edward III</a>, <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II</a> and other monarchs. Even when, on the invention of gunpowder and firearms, the bow had fallen into disuse as a weapon of war, the prohibition was continued. The discredit attaching to bowling alleys, first established in London in 1455, probably encouraged subsequent repressive legislation, for many of the alleys were connected with taverns frequented by the dissolute and gamesters. The word "bowls" occurs for the first time in the statute of 1511 in which <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> confirmed previous enactments against unlawful games. By a further act of 1541—which was not repealed until 1845—artificers, labourers, apprentices, servants and the like were forbidden to play bowls at any time except <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, and then only in their master's house and presence. It was further enjoined that any one playing bowls outside his own garden or orchard was liable to a penalty of 6s. 8d.(6 shillings and 8 pence), while those possessed of lands of the yearly value of £100 might obtain licences to play on their own private greens.

In 1864 William Wallace Mitchell (1803–1884), a Glasgow Cotton Merchant, published his "Manual of Bowls Playing" following his work as the secretary formed in 1849 by Scottish bowling clubs which became the basis of the rules of the modern game.
Young Mitchell was only 11 when he played on Kilmarnock Bowling green, the oldest club in Scotland, instituted in 1740.
The patenting of the first lawn mower in 1830, in Britain, is strongly believed to have been the catalyst, worldwide, for the preparation of modern-style greens, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc. This is turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn bowls, most football codes, lawn tennis and others.

National Bowling Associations were established in the late 1800s. In the then Victorian Colony (now State of Victoria in Australia), the (Royal) <a href="Victorian%20Bowling%20Association">Victorian Bowling Association</a> was formed in 1880 and The Scottish Bowling Association was established in 1892, although there had been a failed attempt in 1848 by 200 Scottish clubs.

Today the sport is played in over 40 countries with more than 50 member national authorities.
The home of the modern game is still Scotland with the World Bowls centre in Edinburgh at Caledonia House,1 Redheughs Rigg, South Gyle, Edinburgh, EH12 9DQ.

Lawn bowls is usually played on a large, rectangular, precisely levelled and manicured <a href="Lawn">grass</a> or synthetic surface known as a <a href="bowling%20green">bowling green</a> which is divided into parallel playing strips called <a href="bowling%20green">rink</a>s. In the simplest competition, singles, one of the two opponents flips a coin to see who wins the "mat" and begins a segment of the competition (in bowling parlance, an "end"), by placing the mat and rolling the jack to the other end of the green to serve as a target. Once it has come to rest, the jack is aligned to the centre of the rink and the players take turns to roll their bowls from the mat towards the jack and thereby build up the "head".

A bowl may curve outside the rink boundary on its path, but must come to rest within the rink boundary to remain in play. Bowls falling into the ditch are dead and removed from play, except in the event when one has "touched" the jack on its way. "Touchers" are marked with chalk and remain alive in play even though they are in the ditch. Similarly if the jack is knocked into the ditch it is still alive unless it is out of bounds to the side resulting in a "dead" end which is replayed, though according to international rules the jack is "respotted" to the centre of the rink and the end is continued. After each competitor has delivered all of their bowls (four each in singles and pairs, three each in triples, and two bowls each in fours), the distance of the closest bowls to the jack is determined (the jack may have been displaced) and points, called "shots", are awarded for each bowl which a competitor has closer than the opponent's nearest to the jack. For instance, if a competitor has bowled two bowls closer to the jack than their opponent's nearest, they are awarded two shots. The exercise is then repeated for the next end, a game of bowls typically being of twenty-one ends.

Lawn bowls is played on grass and variations from green to green are common. Greens come in all shapes and sizes, fast, slow, big crown, small crown and so on.

Scoring systems vary from competition to competition. Games can be decided when:

Games to a specified number of ends may also be drawn. The draw may stand, or the opponents may be required to play an extra end to decide the winner. These provisions are always published beforehand in the event's Conditions of Play.

In the Laws of the Sport of Bowls
the winner in a singles game is the first player to score 21 shots. In all other disciplines (pairs, triples, fours) the winner is the team who has scored the most shots after 21/25 ends of play. Often local tournaments will play shorter games (often 10 or 12 ends). Some competitions use a "set" scoring system, with the first to seven points awarded a set in a best-or-three or best-of-five set match. As well as singles competition, there can be two (pairs), three (triples) and four-player (fours) teams. In these, teams bowl alternately, with each player within a team bowling all their bowls, then handing over to the next player. The team captain or "skip" always plays last and is instrumental in directing his team's shots and tactics. The current method of scoring in the professional tour (<a href="World%20Bowls%20Tour">World Bowls Tour</a>) is sets. Each set consists of nine ends and the player with the most shots at the end of a set wins the set. If the score is tied the set is halved. If a player wins two sets, or gets a win and a tie, that player wins the game. If each player wins a set, or both sets end tied, there is a 3-end tiebreaker to determine a winner.

Bowls are designed to travel a curved path because of a weight <a href="bias">bias</a> which was originally produced by inserting weights in one side of the bowl. This is no longer permitted by the rules and bias is now produced entirely by the shape of the bowl. A bowler determines the bias direction of the bowl in his hand by a dimple or symbol on one side. Regulations determine the minimum bias allowed, and the range of diameters (11.6 to 13.1 cm), but within these rules bowlers can and do choose bowls to suit their own preference. They were originally made from <a href="lignum%20vitae">lignum vitae</a>, a dense wood giving rise to the term "woods" for bowls, but are now more typically made of a hard plastic composite material.

Bowls were once only available coloured black or brown but they are now available in a variety of colours. They have unique symbol markings engraved on them for identification. Since many bowls look the same, coloured, adhesive stickers or labels are also used to mark the bowls of each team in bowls matches. Some local associations agree on specific colours for stickers for each of the clubs in their area. Provincial or <a href="national%20colours">national colours</a> are often assigned in national and international competitions. These stickers are used by <a href="officials">officials</a> to distinguish teams.

Bowls have symbols unique to the set of four for identification. The side of the bowl with a larger symbol within a circle indicates the side away from the bias. That side with a smaller symbol within a smaller circle is the bias side toward which the bowl will turn. It is not uncommon for players to deliver a "wrong bias" shot from time to time and see their carefully aimed bowl crossing neighbouring rinks rather than heading towards their jack.

When bowling there are several types of delivery. "Draw" shots are those where the bowl is rolled to a specific location without causing too much disturbance of bowls already in the head. For a right-handed bowler, "forehand draw" or "finger peg" is initially aimed to the right of the jack, and curves in to the left. The same bowler can deliver a "backhand draw" or "thumb peg" by turning the bowl over in his hand and curving it the opposite way, from left to right. In both cases, the bowl is rolled as close to the jack as possible, unless tactics demand otherwise. A "drive" or "fire" or "strike" involves bowling with force with the aim of knocking either the jack or a specific bowl out of play - and with the drive's speed, there is virtually no noticeable (or, at least, much less) curve on the shot. An "upshot" or "yard on" shot involves delivering the bowl with an extra degree of weight (often referred to as "controlled" weight or "rambler"), enough to displace the jack or disturb other bowls in the head without killing the end. A "block" shot is one that is intentionally placed short to defend from a drive or to stop an oppositions draw shot. The challenge in all these shots is to be able to adjust line and length accordingly, the faster the delivery, the narrower the line or "green".

Particularly in team competition there can be a large number of bowls on the green towards the conclusion of the end, and this gives rise to complex tactics. Teams "holding shot" with the closest bowl will often make their subsequent shots not with the goal of placing the bowl near the jack, but in positions to make it difficult for opponents to get their bowls into the head, or to places where the jack might be deflected to if the opponent attempts to disturb the head.

There are many different ways to set up the game. <a href="Crown%20green%20bowls">Crown Green Bowling</a> utilises the entire green. A player can send the jack anywhere on the green in this game and the green itself is more akin to a golf green, with lots of undulation. It is only played with two bowls each, the Jack also has a bias and is only slightly smaller than the Bowls. The game is played usually to 21-up in Singles and Doubles format with some competitions playing to 31-up. The Panel (Professional Crown Green Bowls) is played at the Red Lion, <a href="Westhoughton">Westhoughton</a> daily and is played to 41-up with greenside betting throughout play.

Singles, triples and fours and Australian pairs are some ways the game can be played. In singles, two people play against each other and the first to reach 21, 25 or 31 shots (as decided by the controlling body) is the winner. In one variation of singles play, each player uses two bowls only and the game is played over 21 ends. A player concedes the game before the 21st end if the score difference is such that it is impossible to draw equal or win within the 21 ends. If the score is equal after 21 ends, an extra end is played to decide the winner. An additional scoring method is set play. This comprises two sets over nine ends. Should a player win a set each, they then play a further 3 ends that will decide the winner.

Pairs allows both people on a team to play Skip and Lead. The lead throws two bowls, the skip delivers two, then the lead delivers his remaining two, the skip then delivers his remaining two bowls. Each end, the leads and skips switch positions. This is played over 21 ends or sets play. Triples is with three players while Fours is with four players in each team and is played over 21 ends.

Another pairs variation is 242 pairs (also known as Australian Pairs). In the first end of the game the A players lead off with 2 bowls each, then the B players play 4 bowls each, before the A players complete the end with their final 2 bowls. The A players act as lead and skip in the same end. In the second end the roles are reversed with the A players being in the middle. This alternating pattern continues through the game which is typically over 15 ends.

<a href="Short%20Mat%20Bowls">Short Mat Bowls</a> is an all-year sport unaffected by weather conditions and it does not require a permanent location as the rink mats can be rolled up and stowed away. This makes it particularly appropriate for small communities as it can be played in village halls, schools, sports and social clubs, hotels and so on. where space is restricted and is also required for other purposes: it is even played on North Sea oil rigs where space is really at a premium.

Bowls are played by the blind and paraplegic. Blind bowlers are extremely skilful. A string is run out down the centre of the lane & wherever the jack lands it is moved across to the string and the length is called out by a sighted marker, when the woods are sent the distance from the jack is called out, in yards, feet and inches-the position in relation to the jack is given using the clock, 12.00 is behind the jack..

In the province of <a href="West-Flanders">West-Flanders</a> (and surrounding regions), tra bowls is the most popular variation of bowls. As opposed to playing it on a flat or uneven terrain, the terrain is made smooth but hollow (tra just means "hollow road" in Flemish). The hollow road causes the path to be curving even more.

The balls are biased in the same way as the lawn bowls balls but with a diameter of about 20 cm, a thickness of 12 cm and a weight of about 2 kg, they are a bit bigger than usual bowls. The target is an unmovable feather or metal plate on the ground, instead of a small ball. The length of the tra is about 18 m.

The scoring is also different, as a point is awarded for every shot that brings the ball closer to the target than any opponent's ball. This causes pure blocking strategies to be less effective.

In 1972, the West-Flemish tra bowls federation was founded to uniform the local differing rules and to organise a match calendar. Meanwhile, they also organise championships and tournaments.

Barcelonnette

Barcelonnette (; ) is a <a href="Communes%20of%20France">commune</a> of <a href="France">France</a> and a <a href="Subprefectures%20in%20France">subprefecture</a> in the <a href="Departments%20of%20France">department</a> of <a href="Alpes-de-Haute-Provence">Alpes-de-Haute-Provence</a>, in the <a href="Provence-Alpes-C%C3%B4te%20d%27Azur">Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur</a> region. It is located in the southern <a href="French%20Alps">French Alps</a>, at the crossroads between <a href="Provence">Provence</a>, <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a> and the <a href="Dauphin%C3%A9">Dauphiné</a>, and is the largest town in the <a href="Ubaye%20Valley">Ubaye Valley</a>. The town's inhabitants are known as "Barcelonnettes".

Barcelonnette was founded and named in 1231, by <a href="Ramon%20Berenguer%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Provence">Ramon Berenguer IV</a>, <a href="Rulers%20of%20Provence">Count of Provence</a>. While the town's name is generally seen as a diminutive form of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, <a href="Albert%20Dauzat">Albert Dauzat</a> and <a href="Charles%20Rostaing">Charles Rostaing</a> point out an earlier attestation of the name "Barcilona" in Barcelonnette in around 1200, and suggest that it is derived instead from two earlier stems signifying a mountain, *"bar" and *"cin" (the latter of which is also seen in the name of <a href="Mont%20Cenis">Mont Cenis</a>).

In the <a href="Vivaro-Alpine">Vivaro-Alpine</a> dialect of <a href="Occitan%20language">Occitan</a>, the town is known as "Barcilona de Provença" or more rarely "Barciloneta" according to the <a href="Occitan%20language%23Writing%20system">classical norm</a>; under the <a href="Occitan%20language%23Writing%20system">Mistralian norm</a> it is called "Barcilouna de Prouvença" or "Barcilouneto". In "Valéian" (the dialect of Occitan spoken in the Ubaye Valley), it is called "Barcilouna de Prouvença" or "Barcilounéta". "Barcino Nova" is the town's <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> name meaning "new Barcelona"; "Barcino" was the Roman name for Barcelona in Catalonia from its foundation by Emperor <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> in 10 BC, and it was only changed to "Barcelona" in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>.

The inhabitants of the town are called "Barcelonnettes", or "Vilandroises" in Valéian.

The Barcelonnette region was populated by <a href="Ligures">Ligures</a> from the 1st millennium BC onwards, and the arrival of the <a href="Celts">Celts</a> several centuries later led to the formation of a mixed Celto-Ligurian people, the <a href="Vesubians">Vesubians</a>. <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> described the Vesubians as belligerent but nonetheless civilised and mercantile, and <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> praised their bravery. The work "History of the Gauls" also places the Vesubians in the Ubaye Valley.

Following the <a href="History%20of%20Provence%23The%20Roman%20Conquest%20of%20Provence">Roman conquest of Provence</a>, Barcelonnette was included in a small province with modern <a href="Embrun%2C%20Hautes-Alpes">Embrun</a> as its capital and governed by Albanus Bassalus. This was integrated soon afterwards into <a href="Gallia%20Narbonensis">Gallia Narbonensis</a>. In 36 AD, Emperor <a href="Nero">Nero</a> transferred Barcelonnette to the province of the <a href="Cottian%20Alps">Cottian Alps</a>. The town was known as "Rigomagensium" under the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> and was the capital of a civitas (a provincial subdivision), though no Roman money has yet been found in the canton of Barcelonnette.

The town of Barcelonnette was founded in 1231 by <a href="Ramon%20Berenguer%20IV%20of%20Provence">Ramon Berenguer IV</a>, <a href="Rulers%20of%20Provence">Count of Provence</a>. According to Charles Rostaing, this act of formal "foundation", according certain privileges to the town, was a means of regenerating the destroyed town of "Barcilona". The town was afforded a "consulat" (giving it the power to administer and defend itself) in 1240.

Control of the area in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> swung between the <a href="Counts%20of%20Savoy">Counts of Savoy</a> and <a href="Rulers%20of%20Provence">of Provence</a>. In 1388, after Count <a href="Louis%20II%20of%20Anjou">Louis II</a> of Provence had left to conquer <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, the Count of Savoy <a href="Amadeus%20VIII%20of%20Savoy">Amadeus VIII</a> took control of Barcelonnette; however, it returned to Provençal control in 1390, with the d'Audiffret family as its lords. On the death of Louis II in 1417 it reverted to Savoy, and, although Count <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20of%20Anjou">René</a> again retook the area for Provence in 1471, it had returned to Savoyard dominance by the start of the 16th century, by which point the County of Provence had become united with the Kingdom of France due to the death of Count <a href="Charles%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anjou">Charles V</a> in 1481.

During <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a>'s invasion of Provence in 1536, <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a> sent the <a href="Count%20of%20F%C3%BCrstenberg">Count of Fürstenberg</a>'s 6000 "<a href="Landsknechte">Landsknechte</a>" to ravage the area in a <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> policy. Barcelonnette and the Ubaye Valley remained under French sovereignty until the second <a href="Treaty%20of%20Cateau-Cambr%C3%A9sis">Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis</a> on 3 April 1559.

In 1588 the troops of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Bonne%2C%20Duke%20of%20Lesdigui%C3%A8res">François, Duke of Lesdiguières</a> entered the town and set fire to the church and convent during their campaign against the Duke of Savoy. In 1600, after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Vervins">Treaty of Vervins</a>, conflict returned between <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV of France</a> and Savoy, and Lesdiguières retook Barcelonnette until the conclusion of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lyon%20%281601%29">Treaty of Lyon</a> on 17 January the following year. In 1628, during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Mantuan%20Succession">War of the Mantuan Succession</a>, Barcelonnette and the other towns of the Ubaye Valley were pillaged and burned by Jacques du Blé d'Uxelles and his troops, as they passed through towards Italy to the <a href="Duke%20of%20Mantua">Duke of Mantua</a>'s aid. The town was retaken by the Duke of Savoy in 1630; and in 1691 it was captured by the troops of the Marquis de Vins during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Augsburg">War of the League of Augsburg</a>.

Between 1614 and 1713, Barcelonnette was the seat of one of the four prefectures under the jurisdiction of the Senate of Nice. At this time, the community of Barcelonnette successfully purchased the "<a href="seigneurie">seigneurie</a>" of the town as it was put to auction by the Duke of Savoy; it thereby gained its own justicial powers. In 1646, a college was founded in Barcelonnette.

A "significant" part of the town's inhabitants had, by the 16th century, converted to <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, and were repressed during the <a href="French%20Wars%20of%20Religion">French Wars of Religion</a>.

The "<a href="viguerie">viguerie</a>" of Barcelonnette (also comprising <a href="Saint-Martin-d%27Entraunes">Saint-Martin</a> and <a href="Entraunes">Entraunes</a>) was reattached to France in 1713 as part of a territorial exchange with the Duchy of Savoy during the <a href="Treaties%20of%20Utrecht">Treaties of Utrecht</a>. The town remained the site of a "viguerie" until the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. A decree of the council of state on 25 December 1714 reunited Barcelonnete with the general government of Provence.

Barcelonnette was one of few settlements in Haute-Provence to acquire a <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a> before the Revolution, in fact having two:

In March 1789, riots took place as a result of a crisis in wheat production. In July, the <a href="Great%20Fear">Great Fear</a> of aristocratic reprisal against the ongoing <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> struck France, arriving in the Barcelonnette area on 31 July 1789 (when the news of the <a href="storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">storming of the Bastille</a> first reached the town) before spreading towards <a href="Digne">Digne</a>.

This agitation continued in the Ubaye Valley; a new revolt broke out on 14 June, and famine was declared in April 1792. The patriotic society of the commune was one of the first 21 created in <a href="Alpes-de-Haute-Provence">Alpes-de-Haute-Provence</a>, in spring 1792, by the envoys of the departmental administration. Around a third of the male population attended at the club. Another episode of political violence occurred in August 1792.

Barcelonnette was the seat of the District of Barcelonnette from 1790 to 1800.

In December 1851, the town was home to a movement of republican resistance towards <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>'s <a href="French%20coup%20of%201851">coup</a>. Though only a minority of the population, the movement rebelled on Sunday 7 December, the day after the news of the coup arrived. Town officials and gendarmes were disarmed and placed in the <a href="maison%20d%27arr%C3%AAt">maison d'arrêt</a>. A committee of public health was created on 8 December; on 9 December the inhabitants of <a href="Jausiers">Jausiers</a> and its surroundings formed a colony under the direction of general councillor Brès, and Mayor Signoret of <a href="Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye">Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye</a>. This was stopped, however, on 10 December before it could reach Barcelonnette, as the priest of the subprefecture had intervened. On 11 December, several officials escaped and found refuge in <a href="Maddalena%20Pass">L'Argentière</a> in Piedmont. The arrival of troops on 16 December put a final end to the republican resistance without bloodshed, and 57 insurgents were tried; 38 were condemned to deportation (though several were pardoned in April).

Between 1850 and 1950, Barcelonnette was the source of a wave of <a href="French%20immigration%20to%20Mexico">emigration to Mexico</a>. Among these emigrants was Jean Baptiste Ebrard, founder of the <a href="Liverpool%20%28store%29">Liverpool</a> department store chain in Mexico; <a href="Marcelo%20Ebrard">Marcelo Ebrard</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20government%20of%20the%20Mexican%20Federal%20District">head of government of Mexico City</a> from 2006 to 2012, is also descended from them. On the edges of Barcelonnette and Jausiers there are several houses and villas of colonial style (known as "maisons mexicaines"), constructed by emigrants to Mexico who returned to France between 1870 and 1930. A plaque in the town commemorates the deaths of ten Mexican citizens who returned to Barcelonnette to fight in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, 26 Jews were arrested in Barcelonnette before being deported. The 89th "compagnie de travailleurs étrangers" (Company of Foreign Workers), consisting of foreigners judged as undesirable by the <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">Third Republic</a> and the <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy regime</a> and committed to forced labour, was established in Barcelonnette.

The 11th Battalion of "<a href="Chasseurs%20alpins">Chasseurs alpins</a>" was garrisoned at Barcelonnette between 1948 and 1990.

Barcelonnette is situated in the wide and fertile <a href="Ubaye%20Valley">Ubaye Valley</a>, of which it is the largest town. It lies at an elevation of 1132 m (3717 ft) on the right bank of the <a href="Ubaye">Ubaye</a> River, and is surrounded by mountains which reach peaks of over 3000 m; the tallest of these is the Needle of Chambeyron at 3412 m. Barcelonnette is situated 210 km from <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, 91 km from <a href="Nice">Nice</a> and 68 km from <a href="Gap%2C%20Hautes-Alpes">Gap</a>.

As a result of its relief and geographic situation, the Ubaye Valley has an "abundance of plant and animal species". The fauna is largely constituted of golden eagles, marmots, <a href="Alpine%20ibex">ibex</a> and vultures, and the flora includes a large proportion of <a href="larches">larches</a>, <a href="Artemisia%20%28genus%29">génépis</a> and <a href="Asphodelus%20ramosus">white asphodels</a>.

The <a href="Ubaye%20Valley">Ubaye Valley</a> has an <a href="alpine%20climate">alpine climate</a> and winters are harsh as a result of the altitude, but there are only light winds as a result of the relief. There are on average almost 300 days of sun and 700 mm of rain per year.

None of the 200 communes of the department is entirely free of seismic risk; the <a href="canton%20of%20Barcelonnette">canton of Barcelonnette</a> is placed in zone 1b (low risk) by the determinist classification of 1991 based on seismic history, and zone 4 (average risk) according to the probabilistic EC8 classification of 2011. The commune is also vulnerable to avalanches, forest fires, floods, and landslides. Barcelonnette is also exposed to the possibility of a technological hazard in that road transport of dangerous materials is allowed to pass through on the RD900.

The town has been subject to several orders of natural disaster: floods and mudslides in 1994 and 2008, and landslides in 1996 and 1999. The strongest recorded earthquakes in the region occurred on 5 April 1959, with its epicentre at <a href="Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye">Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye</a> and a recorded intensity of 6.5 at Barcelonnette, and on 17 February 1947, with its epicentre at <a href="Prazzo">Prazzo</a> over the Italian border.


The subprefecture has been situated since 1978 in a "maison mexicaine", the Villa l'Ubayette, constructed between 1901 and 1903.

In 1471, the community of Barcelonnette (including several surrounding parishes) comprised 421 fires (households). In 1765, it had 6674 inhabitants, but emigration, particularly to Mexico, slowed the town's growth in the period before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. According to the census of 2007, Barcelonnette has a population of 2766 (municipal population) or 2939 (total) across a total of 16.42 km. The town is characterised by low population density. Between 1990 and 1999 the town's annual mean population growth was -0.6%, though between 1999 and 2007 this increased to an average of -0.1%.

The city is mainly a tourist and resort centre, serving many <a href="ski">ski</a> lodges. The <a href="Pra-Loup">Pra-Loup</a> resort is 7 km from Barcelonnette; Le Sauze is 5 km away. It and the Ubaye Valley are served by the <a href="Barcelonnette%20%E2%80%93%20Saint-Pons%20Airfield">Barcelonnette – Saint-Pons Airfield</a>. Notably, Barcelonnette is the only subprefecture of France not served by rail transport; the Ubaye line which would have linked <a href="Chorges">Chorges</a> to Barcelonnette was never completed as a result of the First World War and the construction of the <a href="Lac%20de%20Serre-Pon%C3%A7on">Serre-Ponçon Dam</a> between 1955 and 1961.

An "<a href="Normal%20school">école normale</a>" (an institute for training primary school teachers) was founded in Barcelonnette in 1833, and remained there until 1888 when it was transferred to Digne. The "<a href="lyc%C3%A9e">lycée</a> André-Honnorat de Barcelonnette", originally the "collège Saint-Maurice" and renamed after the politician <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Honnorat">André Honnorat</a> in 1919, is located in the town; <a href="Pierre-Gilles%20de%20Gennes">Pierre-Gilles de Gennes</a> and <a href="Carole%20Merle">Carole Merle</a> both studied there. Currently, three schools exist in Barcelonnette: a public nursery school, a public elementary school, and a private school (under a contract by which the teachers are paid by the national education system).

In 2010 the "lycée André-Honnorat" opened a boarding school aimed at gifted students of poorer social backgrounds, in order to give them better conditions in which to study. It is located in the "Quartier Craplet", formerly the garrison of the 11th Battalion of "<a href="Chasseurs%20Alpins">Chasseurs Alpins</a>" and then the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a>'s "Centre d'instruction et d'entraînement au combat en montagne" (CIECM).

Barcelonnette is twinned with:
It is also the site of a Mexican <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29%23Honorary%20consul">honorary consulate</a>.

Bahá'í Faith

The Bahá'í Faith ( ') is a religion teaching the essential worth of all religions, and the unity and equality of all people. Established by <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Bahá'u'lláh</a> in 1863, it initially grew in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and now has between 5 and 7 million adherents, known as Bahá'ís, spread out into most of the world's countries and territories, with the highest concentration in Iran.
The religion was born in <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, where it has faced ongoing persecutions since its inception. It grew from the mid-<a href="19th%20century">19th century</a> <a href="B%C3%A1bism">Bábí religion</a>, whose founder, taught that God would soon send a <a href="prophet">prophet</a> in the manner of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> or <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>. In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bahá'u'lláh announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Akka</a> in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> province of <a href="Ottoman%20Syria">Syria</a>, in what is now <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son <a href="%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">`Abdu'l-Bahá</a> (1844-1921), and later his great-grandson <a href="Shoghi%20Effendi">Shoghi Effendi</a> (1897-1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national <a href="Spiritual%20Assembly">Spiritual Assemblies</a> that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the <a href="Universal%20House%20of%20Justice">Universal House of Justice</a>, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, which sits in <a href="Haifa%2C%20Israel">Haifa, Israel</a> near the <a href="Shrine%20of%20the%20B%C3%A1b">shrine of Báb</a>.

Bahá'í teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths: <a href="God%20in%20the%20Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">God</a> is considered single and all-powerful. However, Bahá'u'lláh taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through <a href="Manifestations%20of%20God">Manifestations of God</a> who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>, <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>, and <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> being the most recent in the period before the <a href="B%C3%A1b">Báb</a> and Bahá'u'lláh. As such, Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%20and%20the%20unity%20of%20humanity">unity of all people</a>, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bahá'í teachings is the goal of a <a href="New%20world%20order%20%28Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%29">unified world order</a> that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.

Letters written by Bahá'u'lláh to various individuals, including some heads of state, have been collected and canonized into a body of <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20literature">Bahá'í scripture</a> that includes works by his son <a href="%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">`Abdu'l-Bahá</a>, and also <a href="B%C3%A1b">the Báb</a>, who is regarded as Bahá'u'lláh's forerunner. Prominent among Bahá'í literature are the "<a href="Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas">Kitáb-i-Aqdas</a>", "<a href="Kit%C3%A1b-i-%C3%8Dq%C3%A1n">Kitáb-i-Íqán</a>", "<a href="Some%20Answered%20Questions">Some Answered Questions</a>", and "<a href="The%20Dawn-Breakers">The Dawn-Breakers</a>".

In English-language use, the word "Bahá'í " is used either as an adjective to refer to the Bahá'í Faith or as a term for a follower of Bahá'u'lláh. The word is not a noun meaning the religion as a whole. It is derived from the Arabic "<a href="Greatest%20Name">Bahá'</a>" (), meaning "glory" or "splendor", although the word "Bahá'í " is actually derived from its use as a loan word in Persian, in particular the "'i" suffix is Persian rather than Arabic. The term "Bahaism" (or "Baha'ism") is still used, mainly in a pejorative sense.

The Bahá'í writings describe a single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe. The <a href="existence%20of%20God">existence of God</a> and the <a href="universe">universe</a> is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end. Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed <a href="Manifestations%20of%20God">Manifestations of God</a>.

Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God is often referred to by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on <a href="monotheism">monotheism</a>; such doctrines as the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as <a href="Prayer%20in%20the%20Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">prayer</a>, <a href="Introspection">reflection</a>, and being of service to others.
Bahá'í notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of <a href="dispensationalism">dispensations</a>, where each "manifestation" brings a somewhat broader and more advanced <a href="revelation">revelation</a> that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.

Bahá'í beliefs are sometimes described as <a href="Syncretism">syncretic</a> combinations of earlier religious beliefs. Bahá'ís, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20literature">scriptures</a>, <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20teachings">teachings</a>, <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20laws">laws</a>, and <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20history">history</a>. While the religion was initially seen as a sect of Islam, most religious specialists now see it as an independent religion, with its religious background in <a href="Shi%27a%20Islam">Shi'a Islam</a> being seen as analogous to the Jewish context in which Christianity was established. Muslim institutions and clergy, both <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> and <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a>, consider Bahá'ís to be deserters or <a href="Apostasy%20in%20Islam">apostates from Islam</a>, which has led to Bahá'ís being <a href="Persecution%20of%20Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%ADs">persecuted</a>. Bahá'ís describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions in its relative age and in the appropriateness of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to the modern context. Bahá'u'lláh is believed to have fulfilled the <a href="Eschatology">messianic expectations</a> of these precursor faiths.

The Bahá'í writings state that human beings have a "rational <a href="Soul%20%28spirit%29">soul</a>", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's station and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God through his <a href="Manifestation%20of%20God">messengers</a>, and to conform to their teachings. Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bahá'í writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bahá'í belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.

The Bahá'í writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity. The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.

<a href="Shoghi%20Effendi">Shoghi Effendi</a>, the <a href="Guardian%20%28Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%29">Guardian</a> of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the "<a href="Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas">Kitáb-i-Aqdas</a>" constitute the bedrock of the Bahá'í Faith:

The following principles are frequently listed as a quick summary of the Bahá'í teachings. They are derived from transcripts of speeches given by <a href="%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">`Abdu'l-Bahá</a> during his tour of Europe and North America in 1912. The list is not authoritative and a variety of such lists circulate.

With specific regard to the pursuit of world peace, Bahá'u'lláh prescribed a world-embracing <a href="collective%20security">collective security</a> arrangement for the establishment of a temporary era of peace referred to in the Baha'i teachings as the Lesser Peace. For the establishment of a lasting peace (The Most Great Peace) and the purging of the 'overwhelming Corruptions' it is necessary that all the people of the world universally unite under a universal Faith.

The Bahá'í teachings speak of both a "Greater Covenant", being universal and endless, and a "Lesser Covenant", being unique to each religious dispensation. The Lesser Covenant is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion. At this time Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh's revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Bahá'í writings being firm in the covenant is considered a virtue to work toward. The Greater Covenant is viewed as a more enduring agreement between God and humanity, where a Manifestation of God is expected to come to humanity about every thousand years, at times of turmoil and uncertainty.
With unity as an essential teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20administration">administration</a> they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. Schisms have occurred over the succession of authority, but any <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20divisions">Bahá'í divisions</a> have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following. The followers of such divisions are regarded as <a href="Covenant-breaker">Covenant-breaker</a>s and shunned, essentially <a href="Excommunication">excommunicated</a>.

The "canonical texts" are the writings of the <a href="B%C3%A1b">Báb</a>, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the <a href="Universal%20House%20of%20Justice">Universal House of Justice</a>, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. The writings of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the writings of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, and those of the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts. Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the "Most Holy pageRank.Book", which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society, the <a href="Kit%C3%A1b-i-%C3%8Dq%C3%A1n">Kitáb-i-Íqán</a>, literally the "pageRank.Book of Certitude", which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief, the <a href="Gems%20of%20Divine%20Mysteries">Gems of Divine Mysteries</a>, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the <a href="Seven%20Valleys">Seven Valleys</a> and <a href="the%20Four%20Valleys">the Four Valleys</a> which are mystical treatises.

Although the Bahá'í teachings have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical. The "Seven Valleys" is considered Bahá'u'lláh's "greatest mystical composition." It was written to a follower of <a href="Sufism">Sufism</a>, in the style of <a href="Attar%20Neyshapuri">`Attar</a>, The <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> Muslim poet, and sets forth the stages of the soul's journey towards God. It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Bahá'u'lláh to the West. The "<a href="Hidden%20Words">Hidden Words</a>" is another book written by Bahá'u'lláh during the same period, containing 153 short passages in which Bahá'u'lláh claims to have taken the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and written them in brief form.

The Bahá'í Faith formed from the Persian religion of the Báb, a merchant who began preaching a new interpretation of Shia Islam in 1844. The Báb's claim to divine revelation was rejected by the generality of Islamic clergy in Iran, ending in his public execution by authorities in 1850. The Báb taught that God would soon send a new messenger, and Bahá'ís consider Bahá'u'lláh to be that person. Although they are distinct movements, the Báb is so interwoven into Bahá'í theology and history that Bahá'ís celebrate his birth, death, and declaration as <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Holy%20Days">holy days</a>, consider him one of their three central figures (along with Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá), and a historical account of the Bábí movement ("<a href="The%20Dawn-Breakers">The Dawn-Breakers</a>") is considered one of three books that every Bahá'í should "master" and read "over and over again". 

The Bahá'í community was mostly confined to the <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Persian</a> and <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> empires until after the death of Bahá'u'lláh in 1892, at which time he had followers in 13 countries of Asia and Africa. Under the leadership of his son, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense persecution. After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to a administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.

On the evening of 22 May 1844, Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad of Shiraz proclaimed that he was "the Báb" ( "the Gate"), referring to his later claim to the station of <a href="Mahdi">Mahdi</a>, the Twelfth Imam of Shi`a Islam. His followers were therefore known as <a href="B%C3%A1bism">Bábís</a>. As the Báb's teachings spread, which the Islamic clergy saw as a threat, his followers came under increased persecution and torture. The conflicts escalated in several places to military sieges by the <a href="List%20of%20kings%20of%20Persia">Shah</a>'s army. The Báb himself was imprisoned and eventually executed in 1850.

Bahá'ís see the Báb as the forerunner of the Bahá'í Faith, because the Báb's writings introduced the concept of "<a href="He%20whom%20God%20shall%20make%20manifest">He whom God shall make manifest</a>", a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bahá'ís, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, claimed to be in 1863. The Báb's tomb, located in <a href="Haifa">Haifa, Israel</a>, is an important place of <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> for Bahá'ís. The remains of the Báb were brought secretly from <a href="Iran">Iran</a> to the Holy Land and eventually interred in the tomb built for them in a spot specifically designated by Bahá'u'lláh. The main written works translated into English of the Báb's are collected in <a href="Selections%20from%20the%20Writings%20of%20the%20B%C3%A1b">Selections from the Writings of the Báb</a> out of the estimated 135 works.

Mírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí was one of the early followers of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh. Bábís faced a period of persecution that peaked in 1852-53 after a few individuals made a failed attempt to assassinate the <a href="Naser%20al-Din%20Shah%20Qajar">Shah</a>. Although they acted alone, the government responded with <a href="collective%20punishment">collective punishment</a>, killing many Bábís. Bahá'u'lláh was put in prison. He claimed that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the <a href="S%C3%ADy%C3%A1h-Ch%C3%A1l">Síyáh-Chál</a> in <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb when he received a visit from the <a href="Maid%20of%20Heaven">Maid of Heaven</a>.

Shortly thereafter he was expelled from Tehran to <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, in the Ottoman Empire; then to Constantinople (now <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>); and then to Adrianople (now <a href="Edirne">Edirne</a>). In 1863, at the time of his banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh declared his claim to a divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and <a href="Subh-i-Azal">Subh-i-Azal</a>, the appointed leader of the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Bahá'u'lláh gained the allegiance of most of the Bábís, who came to be known as Bahá'ís. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a Messenger of God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including <a href="Pope%20Pius%20IX">Pope Pius IX</a>, <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>, and <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>.

Bahá'u'lláh was banished by Sultan <a href="Abd%C3%BCl%C3%A2ziz">Abdülâziz</a> a final time in 1868 to the Ottoman penal colony of <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">`Akká</a>, in present-day <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akká, while still officially a prisoner of that city. He died there in 1892. Bahá'ís regard his resting place at <a href="Mansion%20of%20Bahj%C3%AD">Bahjí</a> as the <a href="Qiblih">Qiblih</a> to which they turn in prayer each day.

`Abbás Effendi was Bahá'u'lláh's eldest son, known by the title of `Abdu'l-Bahá (Servant of Bahá). His father left a <a href="Tablets%20of%20Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h%23Kit%C3%A1b-i-%60Ahd%20%28Book%20of%20the%20Covenant%29">Will</a> that appointed `Abdu'l-Bahá as the leader of the Bahá'í community, and designated him as the "Centre of the Covenant", "Head of the Faith", and the sole authoritative interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings. `Abdu'l-Bahá had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment, which continued until `Abdu'l-Bahá's own release as a result of the <a href="Young%20Turk%20Revolution">Young Turk Revolution</a> in 1908. Following his release he led a life of travelling, speaking, teaching, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Bahá'í Faith.

There are over 27,000 extant documents by `Abdu'l-Bahá, mostly letters, of which only a fraction have been translated into English. Among the more well known are "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20Divine%20Civilization">The Secret of Divine Civilization</a>", the "<a href="Tablet%20to%20Dr.%20Forel">Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel</a>", and "<a href="Some%20Answered%20Questions">Some Answered Questions</a>". Additionally notes taken of a number of his talks were published in various volumes like "<a href="Paris%20Talks">Paris Talks</a>" during his <a href="%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1%27s%20journeys%20to%20the%20West">journeys to the West</a>.

Bahá'u'lláh's "Kitáb-i-Aqdas" and "The <a href="Will%20and%20Testament%20of%20%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá</a>" are foundational documents of the Bahá'í administrative order. Bahá'u'lláh established the elected Universal House of Justice, and `Abdu'l-Bahá established the appointed hereditary Guardianship and clarified the relationship between the two institutions. In his Will, `Abdu'l-Bahá appointed his eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as the first Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, serving as head of the religion until his death, for 36 years.

Shoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20texts">Bahá'í texts</a>; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bahá'í community; developed the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20World%20Centre">Bahá'í World Centre</a>; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the religion, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice. He died in 1957 under conditions that did not allow for a successor to be appointed.

At local, regional, and national levels, Bahá'ís elect members to nine-person <a href="Spiritual%20Assembly">Spiritual Assemblies</a>, which run the affairs of the religion. There are also <a href="Institution%20of%20the%20Counsellors">appointed individuals</a> working at various levels, including locally and internationally, which perform the function of propagating the teachings and protecting the community. The latter do not serve as clergy, which the Bahá'í Faith does not have. The Universal House of Justice, first elected in 1963, remains the successor and supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, and its 9 members are elected every five years by the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies. Any male Bahá'í, 21 years or older, is eligible to be elected to the Universal House of Justice; all other positions are open to male and female Bahá'ís.

In 1937, Shoghi Effendi launched a seven-year plan for the Bahá'ís of North America, followed by another in 1946. In 1953, he launched the first international plan, the <a href="Ten%20Year%20Crusade">Ten Year World Crusade</a>. This plan included extremely ambitious goals for the expansion of Bahá'í communities and institutions, the translation of <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20texts">Bahá'í texts</a> into several new languages, and the sending of <a href="Pioneering%20%28Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%29">Bahá'í pioneers</a> into previously unreached nations. He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then launched a nine-year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bahá'í community.

Annually, on 21 April, the Universal House of Justice sends a ‘<a href="Ridv%C3%A1n">Ridván</a>’ message to the worldwide Bahá’í community, which generally gives an update on the progress made concerning the current plan, and provides further guidance for the year to come. The Bahá'ís around the world are currently being encouraged to focus on capacity building through children's classes, youth groups, devotional gatherings, and a systematic study of the religion known as <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20study%20circle">study circles</a>. Further focuses are involvement in social action and participation in the prevalent discourses of society. The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá.

A Bahá'í published document reported 4.74 million Bahá'ís in 1986 growing at a rate of 4.4%. Bahá'í sources since 1991 usually estimate the worldwide Bahá'í population to be above 5 million. The "World Christian Encyclopedia" estimated 7.1 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries, and 7.3 million in 2010 with the same source. They further state: "The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha’i was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region." This source's only systematic flaw was to consistently have a higher estimate of Christians than other cross-national data sets.

From its origins in the Persian and Ottoman Empires, by the early 20th century there were a number of converts in <a href="South%20Asia">South</a> and <a href="South%20East%20Asia">South East Asia</a>, Europe, and North America. During the 1950s and 1960s, vast travel teaching efforts brought the religion to almost every country and territory of the world. By the 1990s, Bahá'ís were developing programs for systematic consolidation on a large scale, and the early 21st century saw large influxes of new adherents around the world. The Bahá'í Faith is currently the largest religious minority in Iran, Panama, Belize, and South Carolina; the second largest international religion in Bolivia, Zambia, and Papua New Guinea; and the third largest international religion in Chad and Kenya.

According to "<a href="World%20Almanac">The World Almanac and pageRank.Book of Facts 2004</a>":

The Bahá'í Faith is a medium-sized religion and was listed in "The Britannica pageRank.Book of the Year" (1992–present) as the second most widespread of the world's independent religions in terms of the number of countries represented. According to "Britannica", the Bahá'í Faith (as of 2010) is established in 221 countries and territories and has an estimated seven million adherents worldwide. Additionally, Bahá'ís have self-organized in most of the nations of the world.

The Bahá'í religion was ranked by the Foreign Policy magazine as the world's second <a href="fastest%20growing%20religion">fastest growing religion</a> by percentage (1.7%) in 2007.

The following are a few examples from Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on personal conduct that are required or encouraged of his followers.

The following are a few examples from Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on personal conduct that are prohibited or discouraged.

While some of the laws from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are applicable at the present time, others are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society, such as the punishments for arson or murder. The laws, when not in direct conflict with the civil laws of the country of residence, are binding on every Bahá'í, and the observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual.

The purpose of marriage in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity between a man and a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a "fortress for well-being and salvation" and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of <a href="society">human society</a>. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required <a href="chastity">chastity</a> outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. <a href="Interracial%20marriage">Interracial marriage</a> is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.

Bahá'ís intending to marry are asked to obtain a thorough understanding of the other's character before deciding to marry. Although parents should not <a href="Arranged%20marriage">choose partners for their children</a>, once two individuals decide to marry, they must receive the consent of all living biological parents, whether they are Bahá'í or not. The Bahá'í marriage ceremony is simple; the only compulsory part of the wedding is the reading of the wedding vows prescribed by Bahá'u'lláh which both the groom and the bride read, in the presence of two witnesses. The vows are "We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God."

Bahá'u'lláh prohibited a <a href="Mendicancy">mendicant</a> and <a href="Asceticism">ascetic</a> lifestyle. <a href="Monasticism">Monasticism</a> is forbidden, and Bahá'ís are taught to practice spirituality while engaging in useful work. The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bahá'u'lláh's writings, where he states that work done in the spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.

Most Bahá'í meetings occur in individuals' homes, local Bahá'í centers, or rented facilities. Worldwide, there are currently seven Bahá'í Houses of Worship, with an eighth near completion in Chile, and a further seven planned as of April 2012. Bahá'í writings refer to an institution called a "Mashriqu'l-Adhkár" (Dawning-place of the Mention of God), which is to form the center of a complex of institutions including a hospital, university, and so on. The first ever Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in <a href="Ashgabat">`Ishqábád, Turkmenistan</a>, has been the most complete House of Worship.

The Bahá'í calendar is based upon the calendar established by the <a href="B%C3%A1b">Báb</a>. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five <a href="Ayy%C3%A1m-i-H%C3%A1">intercalary days</a>, to make a full <a href="Tropical%20year">solar year</a>. The Bahá'í New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Naw-R%C3%BAz">Naw Rúz</a>, and occurs on the <a href="vernal%20equinox">vernal equinox</a>, near 21 March, at the end of the month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a <a href="Nineteen%20Day%20Feast">Feast</a> for worship, consultation and socializing.

Each of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Bahá’ (Splendour), ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Jamál (Beauty). The Bahá'í week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God. Bahá'ís observe 11 <a href="Ascension%20of%20Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Holy Days</a> throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.

The symbols of the religion are derived from the Arabic word Bahá’ ( "splendor" or "glory"), with a <a href="Abjad%20numerals">numerical value</a> of 9, which is why the most common symbol is the <a href="nine-pointed%20star">nine-pointed star</a>. The ringstone symbol and calligraphy of the Greatest Name are also often encountered. The former consists of two five-pointed stars interspersed with a stylized Bahá’ whose shape is meant to recall the three onenesses, while the latter is a calligraphic rendering of the phrase Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá ( "O Glory of the Most Glorious!").The five-pointed star is the symbol of the Bahá'í Faith. In the Bahá'í Faith, the star is known as the Haykal (), and it was initiated and established by the <a href="B%C3%A1b">Báb</a>. The Báb and Bahá'u'lláh wrote various works in the form of a <a href="pentagram">pentagram</a>.

Since its inception the Bahá'í Faith has had involvement in <a href="socio-economic%20development">socio-economic development</a> beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.

The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

Bahá'u'lláh wrote of the need for <a href="world%20government">world government</a> in this age of humanity's collective life. Because of this emphasis the international Bahá'í community has chosen to support efforts of improving <a href="international%20relations">international relations</a> through organizations such as the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> and the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, with some reservations about the present structure and constitution of the UN. The <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20International%20Community">Bahá'í International Community</a> is an agency under the direction of the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, and has consultative status with the following organizations:

The Bahá'í International Community has offices at the United Nations in New York and <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> and representations to United Nations regional commissions and other offices in <a href="Addis%20Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>, Rome, <a href="Santiago%2C%20Chile">Santiago</a>, and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. In recent years an Office of the Environment and an Office for the Advancement of Women were established as part of its United Nations Office. The Bahá'í Faith has also undertaken joint development programs with various other United Nations agencies. In the 2000 <a href="Millennium%20Development%20Goals">Millennium Forum</a> of the United Nations a Bahá'í was invited as the only non-governmental speaker during the summit.

Bahá'ís continue to be persecuted in Islamic countries, as Islamic leaders do not recognize the Bahá'í Faith as an independent religion, but rather as <a href="apostasy%20from%20Islam">apostasy from Islam</a>. The most severe persecutions have occurred in <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20Iran">Iran</a>, where over 200 Bahá'ís were executed between 1978 and 1998, and in <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20Egypt">Egypt</a>. The rights of Bahá'ís have been restricted to greater or lesser extents in numerous other countries, including <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, and several countries in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>.

The marginalization of the Iranian Bahá'ís by current governments is rooted in historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions. Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression aimed at individual Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and its institutions were initiated. In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed. Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girls' schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 1940s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and Bahá'í texts were censored.

During the reign of <a href="Mohammad%20Reza%20Pahlavi">Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</a>, to divert attention from economic difficulties in Iran and from a growing nationalist movement, a campaign of persecution against the Bahá'ís was instituted. An approved and coordinated anti-Bahá'í campaign (to incite public passion against the Bahá'ís) started in 1955 and it included the spreading of anti-Bahá'í propaganda on national radio stations and in official newspapers. In the late 1970s the Shah's regime consistently lost legitimacy due to criticism that it was pro-Western. As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread which alleged that some of the Shah's advisors were Bahá'ís. Bahá'ís were portrayed as economic threats, and as supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility against the Bahá'ís increased.

Since the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">Islamic Revolution</a> of 1979 Iranian Bahá'ís have regularly had their homes ransacked or have been banned from attending university or from holding government jobs, and several hundred have received prison sentences for their religious beliefs, most recently for participating in study circles. Bahá'í cemeteries have been desecrated and property has been seized and occasionally demolished, including the House of Mírzá Buzurg, Bahá'u'lláh's father. The House of the Báb in <a href="Shiraz%2C%20Iran">Shiraz</a>, one of three sites to which Bahá'ís perform pilgrimage, has been destroyed twice.

According to a US panel, attacks on Bahá'ís in Iran increased under <a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>'s presidency. The <a href="United%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights">United Nations Commission on Human Rights</a> revealed an October 2005 confidential letter from Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Iran ordering its members to identify Bahá'ís and to monitor their activities. Due to these actions, the <a href="Special%20Rapporteur%20%28UN%29">Special Rapporteur</a> of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated on 20 March 2006, that she "also expresses concern that the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Bahá'í faith, in violation of international standards. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating.

On 14 May 2008, members of an informal body known as the "Friends" that oversaw the needs of the Bahá'í community in Iran were arrested and taken to <a href="Evin%20prison">Evin prison</a>. The Friends court case has been postponed several times, but was finally underway on 12 January 2010. Other observers were not allowed in the court. Even the defence lawyers, who for two years have had minimal access to the defendants, had difficulty entering the courtroom. The chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said that it seems that the government has already predetermined the outcome of the case and is violating international human rights law. Further sessions were held on 7 February 2010, 12 April 2010 and 12 June 2010. On 11 August 2010 it became known that the court sentence was 20 years imprisonment for each of the seven prisoners which was later reduced to ten years. After the sentence, they were transferred to <a href="Gohardasht%20prison">Gohardasht prison</a>. In March 2011 the sentences were reinstated to the original 20 years. On 3 January 2010, Iranian authorities detained ten more members of the Baha'i minority, reportedly including Leva Khanjani, granddaughter of Jamaloddin Khanjani, one of seven Baha'i leaders jailed since 2008 and in February, they arrested his son, Niki Khanjani.

The Iranian government claims that the Bahá'í Faith is not a religion, but is instead a political organization, and hence refuses to recognize it as a minority religion. However, the government has never produced convincing evidence supporting its characterization of the Bahá'í community. Also, the government's statements that Bahá'ís who recanted their religion would have their rights restored, attest to the fact that Bahá'ís are persecuted solely for their religious affiliation. The Iranian government also accuses the Bahá'í Faith of being associated with <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a> because the Bahá'í World Centre is located in Haifa, Israel. These accusations against the Bahá'ís have no basis in historical fact, and the accusations are used by the Iranian government to use the Bahá'ís as "scapegoats". In fact it was the Iranian leader Naser al-Din Shah Qajar who banished Bahá'u'lláh from <a href="Persia">Persia</a> to the Ottoman Empire and Bahá'u'lláh was later exiled by the Ottoman Sultan, at the behest of the Persian Shah, to territories further away from Iran and finally to <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a> in Syria, which only a century later was incorporated into the state of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>.

Bahá'í institutions and community activities have been illegal under Egyptian law since 1960. All Bahá'í community properties, including Bahá'í centers, libraries, and cemeteries, have been confiscated by the government and <a href="fatwa">fatwa</a>s have been issued charging Bahá'ís with <a href="apostasy">apostasy</a>.

The <a href="Egyptian%20identification%20card%20controversy">Egyptian identification card controversy</a> began in the 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of <a href="identity%20documents">identity documents</a>, which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bahá'ís were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle. Without documents, they could not be employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships. Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list a dash in place of one of the three recognized religions. The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís under the new decree on 8 August 2009.

Burgundians

The Burgundians (; ; ; ) were a large <a href="East%20Germanic">East Germanic</a> or <a href="Vandal">Vandal</a> tribe, or group of tribes, who lived in the area of modern Poland in the time of the Roman Empire.

In the late Roman period, as the empire came under pressure from many such "barbarian" peoples, a powerful group of Burgundians and other Vandalic tribes moved westwards towards the Roman frontiers along the <a href="Rhine">Rhine Valley</a>, making them neighbors of the Franks who formed their kingdoms to the north, and the Suebic <a href="Alemanni">Alemanni</a> who were settling to their south, also near the Rhine. They established themselves in <a href="Worms">Worms</a>, but with Roman cooperation their descendants eventually established the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Burgundians">Kingdom of the Burgundians</a> much further south, and within the empire, in the western Alps region where modern Switzerland, France and Italy meet. This later became a component of the Frankish empire. The name of this Kingdom survives in the regional appellation, <a href="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>, which is a region in modern France, representing only a part of that kingdom.

Another part of the Burgundians stayed in their previous homeland in the Oder-Vistula basin and formed a contingent in <a href="Attila">Attila</a>'s <a href="Huns%23Unified_Empire_under_Attila">Hunnic</a> army by 451.

Before clear documentary evidence begins, the Burgundians may have originally emigrated from mainland <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> to the Baltic island of <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a>, and from there to the <a href="Vistula">Vistula</a> basin, in the middle of modern Poland.

The <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> Burgundians is commonly used in English to refer to the "Burgundi" ("Burgundionei", "Burgundiones" or "Burgunds") who settled in <a href="Sapaudia">Sapaudia</a> (Savoy), in the western Alps, during the 5th Century. The original <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Burgundians">Kingdom of the Burgundians</a> barely intersected the modern "Bourgogne" and more closely matched the boundaries of the <a href="Arpitan">Arpitan</a> or Romand (Franco-Provencal) language area, centred on the "<a href="Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes">Rôno-Arpes</a>" (Rhône-Alpes) region of France, <a href="Romandy">Romandy</a> in west Switzerland and " <a href="Aosta%20Valley">Val d'Outa</a>" (Val d'Aosta), in north west Italy.

In modern usage, however, "Burgundians" can sometimes refer to later inhabitants of the geographical "<a href="Bourgogne">Bourgogne</a>" or "Borgogne" (Burgundy), named after the old kingdom, but not corresponding to the original boundaries of it. Between the 6th and 20th centuries, the boundaries and political connections of "Burgundy" have changed frequently. In modern times the only area still referred to as <a href="Burgundy%20%28region%29">Burgundy</a> is in France, which derives its name from the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Burgundy">Duchy of Burgundy</a>. But in the context of the middle ages the term Burgundian (or similar spellings) can refer even to the powerful political entity the Dukes controlled which included not only Burgundy itself but had actually expanded to have a strong association with areas now in modern Belgium. The parts of the old Kingdom not within the French controlled Duchy tended to come under different names, except for the <a href="County%20of%20Burgundy">County of Burgundy</a>.

The Burgundians had a tradition of <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n origin which finds support in place-name evidence and archaeological evidence (Stjerna) and many consider their tradition to be correct (e.g. Musset, p. 62). The Burgundians are believed to have then emigrated to the Baltic island of <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> ("the island of the Burgundians" in <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a>). However, by about 250 CE, the population of Bornholm had largely disappeared from the island. Most cemeteries ceased to be used, and those that were still used had few burials (Stjerna, in Nerman 1925:176). In "<a href="%C3%9Eorsteins%20saga%20V%C3%ADkingssonar">Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar</a>" ("The Saga of Thorstein, Viking's Son"), the Veseti settled in an island or holm, which was called Borgund's holm, i.e. Bornholm. <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>'s translation of "<a href="Paulus%20Orosius">Orosius</a>" uses the name "Burgenda land" to refer to a territory next to the land of <a href="Suiones">Sweons</a> ("Swedes"). The poet and early mythologist <a href="Viktor%20Rydberg">Viktor Rydberg</a> (1828–1895), ("Our Fathers' Godsaga") asserted from an early medieval source, "<a href="Sigismund%20of%20Burgundy">Vita Sigismundi</a>", that they themselves retained oral traditions about their Scandinavian origin.

Early Roman sources, such as <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> and <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, knew little concerning the Germanic peoples east of the Elbe river, or on the Baltic Sea. Pliny (IV.28) however mentions them among the <a href="Vandals">Vandalic</a> or <a href="Eastern%20Germanic">Eastern Germanic</a> Germani peoples, including also the <a href="Goths">Goths</a>. <a href="Claudius%20Ptolemy">Claudius Ptolemy</a> lists them as living between the Suevus (probably the <a href="Oder%20river">Oder</a>) and Vistula rivers, north of the <a href="Lugii">Lugii</a>, and south of the coast dwelling tribes. Around the mid 2nd century AD, there was a significant migration by Germanic tribes of Scandinavian origin (<a href="Rugii">Rugii</a>, Goths, <a href="Gepids">Gepidae</a>, Vandals, Burgundians, and others) towards the south-east, creating turmoil along the entire Roman frontier. These migrations culminated in the <a href="Marcomannic%20Wars">Marcomannic Wars</a>, which resulted in widespread destruction and the first invasion of <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in the Roman Empire period. <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a> reports that during the 3rd century, the Burgundians living in the Vistula basin were almost annihilated by <a href="Fastida">Fastida</a>, king of the Gepids, whose kingdom was at the mouth of the Vistula.

In the late 3rd century, the Burgundians appear on the east bank of the Rhine, confronting Roman Gaul. <a href="Zosimus">Zosimus</a> (1.68) reports them being defeated by the emperor <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius%20Probus">Probus</a> in 278 in Gaul. At this time, they were led by a Vandal king. A few years later, <a href="Claudius%20Mamertinus">Claudius Mamertinus</a> mentions them along with the <a href="Alamanni">Alamanni</a>, a <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>c people. These two peoples had moved into the <a href="Agri%20Decumates">Agri Decumates</a> on the eastern side of the Rhine, an area today referred to still as <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>, at times attacking Roman Gaul together and sometimes fighting each other. He also mentions that the Goths had previously defeated the Burgundians.

<a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a>, on the other hand, claimed that the Burgundians were descended from Romans. The Roman sources do not speak of any specific migration from Poland by the Burgundians (although other Vandalic peoples are more clearly mentioned as having moved west in this period), and so there have historically been some doubts about the link between the eastern and western Burgundians.

In 369/370, the Emperor <a href="Valentinian%20I">Valentinian I</a> enlisted the aid of the Burgundians in his war against the Alemanni.

Approximately four decades later, the Burgundians appear again. Following <a href="Stilicho">Stilicho</a>'s withdrawal of troops to fight <a href="Alaric%20I">Alaric I</a> the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoth</a> in AD 406-408, the northern tribes crossed the Rhine and entered the Empire in the "<a href="V%C3%B6lkerwanderung">Völkerwanderung</a>", or Germanic migrations. Among them were the <a href="Alans">Alans</a>, <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, the <a href="Suevi">Suevi</a>, and possibly some Burgundians. Some Burgundians migrated westwards and settled as "<a href="foederati">foederati</a>" in the Roman province of <a href="Germania%20Secunda">Germania Secunda</a> along the <a href="Middle%20Rhine">Middle Rhine</a>. Other Burgundians stayed in their previous homeland in Oder-Vistula interfluvial and formed a contingent in <a href="Attila">Attila</a>'s <a href="Huns%23Unified_Empire_under_Attila">Hunnic</a> army by 451.

In 411, the Burgundian king <a href="Gunther">Gundahar</a> (or "Gundicar") set up a puppet emperor, <a href="Jovinus">Jovinus</a>, in cooperation with <a href="Goar">Goar</a>, king of the <a href="Alans">Alans</a>. With the authority of the <a href="Gallo-Roman%20culture">Gallic emperor</a> that he controlled, Gundahar settled on the left (Roman) bank of the Rhine, between the river <a href="Lauter%20%28Rhine%29">Lauter</a> and the <a href="Nahe%20%28river%29">Nahe</a>, seizing <a href="Worms%2C%20Germany">Worms</a>, <a href="Speyer">Speyer</a>, and <a href="Strassburg">Strassburg</a>. Apparently as part of a truce, the Emperor <a href="Honorius%20%28emperor%29">Honorius</a> later officially "granted" them the land, (Prosper, a. 386) with its capital at the old Celtic Roman settlement of Borbetomagus (present <a href="Worms%2C%20Germany">Worms</a>).

Despite their new status as "foederati", Burgundian raids into Roman Upper <a href="Gallia%20Belgica">Gallia Belgica</a> became intolerable and were ruthlessly brought to an end in 436, when the Roman general <a href="Flavius%20A%C3%ABtius">Aëtius</a> called in <a href="Hun">Hun</a> mercenaries, who overwhelmed the Rhineland kingdom in 437. Gundahar was killed in the fighting, reportedly along with the majority of the Burgundian tribe. (Prosper; "Chronica Gallica 452"; Hydatius; and Sidonius Apollinaris)

The destruction of Worms and the Burgundian kingdom by the Huns became the subject of heroic legends that were afterwards incorporated in the "<a href="Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a>"—on which <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a> based his <a href="Ring%20Cycle">Ring Cycle</a>—where King Gunther (Gundahar) and Queen <a href="Br%C3%BCnnehilde">Brünhild</a> hold their court at Worms, and <a href="Sigurd">Siegfried</a> comes to woo Kriemhild. (In Old Norse sources the names are "Gunnar", "Brynhild", and "Gudrún" as normally rendered in English.) In fact, the "Etzel" of the "Nibelungenlied" is based on <a href="Attila%20the%20Hun">Attila the Hun</a>.

For reasons not cited in the sources, the Burgundians were granted "foederati" status a second time, and in 443 were resettled by <a href="Flavius%20A%C3%ABtius">Aëtius</a> in the region of "Sapaudia". ("Chronica Gallica 452") Though the precise geography is uncertain, "Sapaudia" corresponds to the modern-day <a href="Savoy">Savoy</a>, and the Burgundians probably lived near "Lugdunum", known today as <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>. (Wood 1994, Gregory II, 9) A new king <a href="Gundioc">Gundioc</a> or "Gunderic", presumed to be Gundahar's son, appears to have reigned following his father's death. (Drew, p. 1) The historian Pline tells us that Gonderic reigned the areas of Saône, Dauphiny, Savoie and a part of Provence. He set up <a href="Vienne%2C%20Is%C3%A8re">Vienne</a> as the capital of the kingdom of Burgundy. In all, eight Burgundian kings of the house of Gundahar ruled until the kingdom was overrun by the Franks in 534.

As allies of Rome in its last decades, the Burgundians fought alongside Aëtius and a confederation of Visigoths and others in the battle against <a href="Attila%20the%20Hun">Attila</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ch%C3%A2lons">Battle of Châlons</a> (also called "The Battle of the Catalaunian Fields") in 451. The alliance between Burgundians and Visigoths seems to have been strong, as Gundioc and his brother Chilperic I accompanied <a href="Theodoric%20II">Theodoric II</a> to Spain to fight the Sueves in 455. (Jordanes, "Getica", 231)

Also in 455, an ambiguous reference "infidoque tibi Burdundio ductu" (<a href="Sidonius%20Apollinaris">Sidonius Apollinaris</a> in "Panegyr. Avit". 442.) implicates an unnamed treacherous Burgundian leader in the murder of the emperor <a href="Petronius%20Maximus">Petronius Maximus</a> in the chaos preceding the sack of Rome by the <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>. The Patrician <a href="Ricimer">Ricimer</a> is also blamed; this event marks the first indication of the link between the Burgundians and Ricimer, who was probably Gundioc's brother-in-law and <a href="Gundobad">Gundobad</a>'s uncle, (John Malalas, 374)

In 456, the Burgundians, apparently confident in their growing power, negotiated a territorial expansion and power sharing arrangement with the local Roman senators. (Marius of Avenches)

In 457, Ricimer overthrew another emperor, <a href="Avitus">Avitus</a>, raising <a href="Majorian">Majorian</a> to the throne. This new emperor proved unhelpful to Ricimer and the Burgundians. The year after his ascension, Majorian stripped the Burgundians of the lands they had acquired two years earlier. After showing further signs of independence, he was murdered by Ricimer in 461.

Ten years later, in 472, Ricimer–who was by now the son-in-law of the Western Emperor <a href="Anthemius">Anthemius</a>–was plotting with Gundobad to kill his father-in-law; Gundobad beheaded the emperor (apparently personally). ("Chronica Gallica 511"; John of Antioch, fr. 209; Jordanes, "Getica", 239) Ricimer then appointed <a href="Olybrius">Olybrius</a>; both died, surprisingly of natural causes, within a few months. Gundobad seems then to have succeeded his uncle as Patrician and king-maker, and raised <a href="Glycerius">Glycerius</a> to the throne. (Marius of Avenches; John of Antioch, fr. 209)

In 474, Burgundian influence over the empire seems to have ended. Glycerius was deposed in favor of <a href="Julius%20Nepos">Julius Nepos</a>, and Gundobad returned to Burgundy, presumably at the death of his father Gundioc. At this time or shortly afterwards, the Burgundian kingdom was divided between Gundobad and his brothers, Godigisel, Chilperic II, and Gundomar I. (Gregory, II, 28)

According to <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>, the years following Gundobad's return to Burgundy saw a bloody consolidation of power. Gregory states that Gundobad murdered his brother Chilperic, drowning his wife and exiling their daughters (one of whom was to become the wife of <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis</a> the <a href="Franks">Frank</a>, and was reputedly responsible for his conversion). This is contested by, e.g., Bury, who points out problems in much of Gregory's chronology for the events.

C.500, when Gundobad and Clovis were at war, Gundobad appears to have been betrayed by his brother Godegisel, who joined the Franks; together Godegisel's and Clovis' forces "crushed the army of Gundobad". (Marius a. 500; Gregory, II, 32) Gundobad was temporarily holed up in Avignon, but was able to re-muster his army and sacked Vienne, where Godegisel and many of his followers were put to death. From this point, Gundobad appears to have been the sole king of Burgundy. (e.g., Gregory, II, 33) This would imply that his brother Gundomar was already dead, though there are no specific mentions of the event in the sources.

Either Gundobad and Clovis reconciled their differences, or Gundobad was forced into some sort of vassalage by Clovis' earlier victory, as the Burgundian king appears to have assisted the Franks in 507 in their victory over <a href="Alaric%20II">Alaric II</a> the Visigoth.

During the upheaval, sometime between 483-501, Gundobad began to set forth the "Lex Gundobada" (see below), issuing roughly the first half, which drew upon the "Lex Visigothorum". (Drew, p. 1) Following his consolidation of power, between 501 and his death in 516, Gundobad issued the second half of his law, which was more originally Burgundian.

The Burgundians were extending their power over southeastern <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>; that is, northern Italy, western Switzerland, and southeastern France. In 493, <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis</a>, king of the Franks, married the Burgundian princess <a href="Clotilde">Clotilda</a> (daughter of Chilperic), who converted him to the Catholic faith.

At first allied with <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis'</a> <a href="Franks">Franks</a> against the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> in the early 6th century, the Burgundians were eventually conquered at <a href="Battle%20of%20Autun%20%28532%29">Autun</a> by the Franks in 532 after a first attempt in the <a href="Battle%20of%20V%C3%A9zeronce">Battle of Vézeronce</a>. The Burgundian kingdom was made part of the <a href="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> kingdoms, and the Burgundians themselves were by and large absorbed as well.
The 5th century <a href="Gallo-Roman">Gallo-Roman</a> <a href="poet">poet</a> and <a href="landowner">landowner</a> <a href="Sidonius%20Apollinaris">Sidonius</a>, who at one point lived with the Burgundians, described them as a long-haired people of immense physical size:

The Burgundian language belonged to the <a href="East%20Germanic%20languages">East Germanic language group</a>. It appears to have become extinct during the late sixth century.

Little is known of the language. Some proper names of Burgundians are recorded, and some words used in the area in modern times are thought to be derived from the ancient Burgundian language, but it is often difficult to distinguish these from Germanic words of other origin, and in any case the modern form of the words is rarely suitable to infer much about the form in the old language.

Somewhere in the east the Burgundians had converted to the <a href="Arianism">Arian</a> form of Christianity from their native <a href="Germanic%20polytheism">Germanic polytheism</a>. Their Arianism proved a source of suspicion and distrust between the Burgundians and the Catholic Western Roman Empire. Divisions were evidently healed or healing circa AD 500, however, as <a href="Gundobad">Gundobad</a>, one of the last Burgundian kings, maintained a close personal friendship with <a href="Avitus%20of%20Vienne">Avitus</a>, the <a href="bishop%20of%20Vienne">bishop of Vienne</a>. Moreover, Gundobad's son and successor, <a href="Sigismund%20of%20Burgundy">Sigismund</a>, was himself a Catholic, and there is evidence that many of the Burgundian people had converted by this time as well, including several female members of the ruling family.

The Burgundians left three <a href="legal%20code">legal code</a>s, among the earliest from any of the Germanic tribes.

The <a href="Lex%20Gundobada">Liber Constitutionum sive Lex Gundobada</a> ("The pageRank.Book of Constitutions or Law of Gundobad"), also known as the "Lex Burgundionum", or more simply the "Lex Gundobada" or the "Liber", was issued in several parts between 483 and 516, principally by Gundobad, but also by his son, Sigismund. (Drew, p. 6–7) It was a record of Burgundian customary law and is typical of the many Germanic law codes from this period. In particular, the "Liber" borrowed from the "<a href="Lex%20Visigothorum">Lex Visigothorum</a>" (Drew, p. 6) and influenced the later "<a href="Lex%20Ribuaria">Lex Ribuaria</a>". (Rivers, p. 9) The "Liber" is one of the primary sources for contemporary Burgundian life, as well as the history of its kings.

Like many of the Germanic tribes, the Burgundians' legal traditions allowed the application of separate laws for separate ethnicities. Thus, in addition to the "Lex Gundobada", Gundobad also issued (or codified) a set of laws for Roman subjects of the Burgundian kingdom, the "<a href="Lex%20Romana%20Burgundionum">Lex Romana Burgundionum</a>" ("The Roman Law of the Burgundians").

In addition to the above codes, Gundobad's son Sigismund later published the "Prima Constitutio".

Dots and Boxes

Dots and Boxes is a <a href="pencil%20and%20paper%20game">pencil-and-paper game</a> for two players (sometimes more). It was first published in the 19th century by <a href="%C3%89douard%20Lucas">Édouard Lucas</a>, who called it la pipopipette. It has gone by many other names, including the game of dots, boxes, dot to dot grid, and pigs in a pen.
Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two "unjoined" adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1×1 box earns one point and takes another turn. (A point is typically recorded by placing a mark that identifies the player in the box, such as an initial). The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player with the most points. The board may be of any size. When short on time, a 2×2 board (a square of 9 dots) is good for beginners. A 5×5 is good for experts.

The diagram on the right shows a game being played on the 2×2 board. The second player (B) plays the mirror image of the first player's move, hoping to divide the board into two pieces and tie the game. But the first player (A) makes a "sacrifice" at move 7 and B accepts the sacrifice, getting one box. However, B must now add another line, and connects the center dot to the center-right dot, causing the remaining boxes to be joined together in a "chain" (shown at the end of move 8). With A's next move, player A gets them all and wins 3–1.

For most novice players, the game begins with a phase of more-or-less randomly connecting dots, where the only strategy is to avoid adding the third side to any box. This continues until all the remaining (potential) boxes are joined together into "chains" – groups of one or more adjacent boxes in which any move gives all the boxes in the chain to the opponent. At this point, players typically take all available boxes, then "open" the smallest available chain to their opponent. For example, a novice player faced with a situation like position 1 in the diagram on the right, in which some boxes can be captured, may take all the boxes in the chain, resulting in position 2. But, with their last move, they have to open the next, larger chain, and the novice loses the game.

A more "experienced" player faced with position 1 will instead play the "double-cross strategy", taking all but 2 of the boxes in the chain and leaving position 3. The opponent will take these two boxes and then be forced to open the next chain. By achieving position 3, player A wins. The same double-cross strategy applies no matter how many long chains there are: a player using this strategy will take all but two boxes in each chain and take all the boxes in the last chain. If the chains are long enough, then this player will win.

The next level of strategic complexity, between "experts" who would both use the double-cross strategy (if they were allowed to), is a battle for "control": An expert player tries to force their opponent "to open the first long chain", because the player who first opens a long chain usually loses. Against a player who doesn't understand the concept of a sacrifice, the expert simply has to make the correct number of sacrifices to encourage the opponent to hand him the first chain long enough to ensure a win. "If" the other player also sacrifices, the expert has to additionally manipulate the number of available sacrifices through earlier play.

In <a href="combinatorial%20game%20theory">combinatorial game theory</a>, dots and boxes is an <a href="impartial%20game">impartial game</a> and many positions can be analyzed using <a href="Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy%20theorem">Sprague–Grundy theory</a>. However, Dots and Boxes lacks the <a href="normal%20play%20convention">normal play convention</a> of most impartial games (where the last player to move wins), which complicates the analysis considerably.

Dots and Boxes need not be played on a rectangular grid – it can be played on a triangular grid or a hexagonal grid. There is also a variant in <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> where it is played in a <a href="Chakana">Chakana</a> or Inca Cross grid, which adds more complications to the game.

Dots and Boxes has a <a href="dual%20graph">dual graph</a> form called "Strings-and-Coins". This game is played on a network of coins (vertices) joined by strings (edges). Players take turns cutting a string. When a cut leaves a coin with no strings, the player "pockets" the coin and takes another turn. The winner is the player who pockets the most coins. Strings-and-Coins can be played on an arbitrary <a href="graph%20%28discrete%20mathematics%29">graph</a>.

A variant played in Poland allows a player to claim a region of several squares as soon as its boundary is completed. In the Netherlands, it is called "kamertje verhuren" ("Rent-a-Room") and the outer border already has lines. In analyses of Dots and Boxes, starting with outer lines is called a "Swedish board" while the standard version is called an "American board". An intermediate version with the outer left and bottom sides starting with lines is called an "Icelandic board".

Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)

Big Brother is a fictional character and symbol in <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s novel "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>". He is ostensibly the leader (most likely a symbolic <a href="figurehead">figurehead</a>) of <a href="Oceania%20%281984%29">Oceania</a>, a <a href="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> state wherein the ruling Party wields total power "for its own sake" over the inhabitants.

In the society that Orwell describes, every citizen is under constant <a href="surveillance">surveillance</a> by the authorities, mainly by <a href="telescreen">telescreen</a>s (with the exception of the <a href="Proles">Proles</a>). The people are constantly reminded of this by the slogan "Big Brother is watching you": a maxim which is ubiquitously on display. In modern culture the term "Big Brother" has entered the <a href="lexicon">lexicon</a> as a synonym for abuse of government power, particularly in respect to <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a>, often specifically related to <a href="mass%20surveillance">mass surveillance</a>.

In the essay section of his novel "<a href="1985%20%28Anthony%20Burgess%20novel%29">1985</a>", <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> states that Orwell got the idea for the name of Big Brother from <a href="advertising%20billboards">advertising billboards</a> for educational <a href="correspondence%20course">correspondence course</a>s from a company called "Bennett's", current during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The original posters showed <a href="J.%20M.%20Bennett">J. M. Bennett</a> himself: a kindly-looking old man offering guidance and support to would-be students with the phrase "Let me be your father" attached. According to Burgess, after Bennett's death, his son took over the company, and the posters were replaced with pictures of the son (who looked imposing and stern in contrast to his father's kindly demeanor) with the text "Let me be your big brother."

Additional speculation from Douglas Kellner of <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a> argued that Big Brother represents <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>.
Another theory is that the inspiration for Big Brother was Brendan Bracken, the Minister of Information until 1945. Orwell worked under Bracken on the BBC's Indian Service. Bracken was customarily referred to by MOI employees by his initials, B.B., the same initials as the character Big Brother. Orwell also resented the wartime censorship and need to manipulate information which he felt came from the highest levels of the MOI and from Bracken's office in particular.

In the novel, it is never made clear whether Big Brother is or had been a real person, or is a <a href="National%20personification">fictional personification</a> of <a href="Ingsoc">the Party</a>, similar to <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a> and <a href="Uncle%20Sam">Uncle Sam</a>. Big Brother is described as appearing on posters and telescreens as a handsome man in his mid-40s.

In Party propaganda, Big Brother is presented as one of the founders of the Party, along with <a href="Emmanuel%20Goldstein">Goldstein</a>. At one point, Winston Smith, the protagonist of Orwell's novel, tries "to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London . . ."

In the book "<a href="The%20Theory%20and%20Practice%20of%20Oligarchical%20Collectivism">The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism</a>", read by Winston Smith and purportedly written by Goldstein, Big Brother is referred to as infallible and all-powerful. No-one has ever seen him and there is a reasonable certainty that he will never die. He is simply "the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world", since the emotions of love, fear and reverence are more easily focused on an individual (if only a face on the hoardings and a voice on the telescreens), than an organisation. When Winston Smith is later arrested, <a href="O%27Brien%20%28Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%29">O'Brien</a> repeats that Big Brother will never die. When Smith asks if Big Brother exists, O'Brien describes him as "the embodiment of the Party" and says that he will exist as long as the Party exists. When Winston asks "Does Big Brother exist the same way I do?" (meaning is Big Brother an actual human being), O'Brien replies "You do not exist" (meaning that Smith is now an <a href="unperson">unperson</a>; an example of <a href="doublethink">doublethink</a>).

A spontaneous ritual of devotion to Big Brother ("BB") is illustrated at the end of the "<a href="Two%20Minutes%20Hate">Two Minutes Hate</a>":

Though Oceania's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Truth">Ministry of Truth</a>, <a href="Ministry%20of%20Plenty">Ministry of Plenty</a>, and <a href="Ministry%20of%20Peace">Ministry of Peace</a> each have names with meanings deliberately opposite to their real purpose, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Love">Ministry of Love</a> is perhaps the most straightforward: "rehabilitated thought criminals" leave the Ministry as loyal subjects who have been <a href="brainwashing">brainwashed</a> into adoring (loving) Big Brother, hence its name.

Since the publication of "Nineteen Eighty-Four" the phrase "Big Brother" has come into common use to describe any prying or overly-controlling authority figure, and attempts by government to increase surveillance.

Big Brother and other <a href="Orwellian">Orwellian</a> imagery are often referenced in the type of joke known as the <a href="Russian%20reversal">Russian reversal</a>.

The magazine "pageRank.Book" ranked Big Brother No. 59 on its 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 list. "<a href="Wizard%20%28magazine%29">Wizard</a>" magazine rated him the 75th greatest villain of all time.

The worldwide reality television show "<a href="Big%20Brother%20%28TV%20series%29">Big Brother</a>" is based on the novel's concept of people being under constant <a href="surveillance">surveillance</a>. In 2000, after the <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28U.S.%29">U.S. version</a> of the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> program "Big Brother" premiered, the Estate of George Orwell sued CBS and its production company "Orwell Productions, Inc." in federal court in Chicago for copyright and trademark infringement. The case was "Estate of Orwell v. CBS", 00-c-5034 (ND Ill). On the eve of trial, the case settled worldwide to the parties' "mutual satisfaction"; the amount that CBS paid to the Orwell Estate was not disclosed. CBS had not asked the Estate for permission. Under current laws the novel will remain under <a href="copyright">copyright</a> protection until 2020 in the European Union and until 2044 in the United States.

The iconic image of Big Brother (played by David Graham) played a key role in <a href="Apple%20Computers">Apple</a>'s <a href="1984%20%28advertisement%29">1984 television commercial</a> introducing the <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a>. The Orwell Estate viewed the Apple commercial as a copyright infringement, and sent a cease-and-desist letter to Apple and its advertising agency. The commercial was never televised again, though the date mentioned in the ad (January 24) was but two days later, making it unlikely that it would have been re-aired. Subsequent (now posthumous) ads featuring Steve Jobs (for a variety of products including audio books) have mimicked the format and appearance of that original ad campaign, with the appearance of Steve Jobs nearly identical to that of Big Brother. In 2008, the Simpsons animated television series spoofed the Apple Big Brother commercial in an episode entitled "<a href="MyPods%20and%20Boomsticks">Mypods and Boomsticks</a>."

The December 2002 issue of "<a href="Gear%20%28magazine%29">Gear</a>" magazine featured a story about technologies and trends that could violate personal privacy moving society closer to a "Big Brother" state and utilised a recreation of the movie poster from the film version of "1984" created by Dallmeierart.com.

Computer company <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> patented in 2011 a product distribution system with a camera or capture device that monitors the viewers that consume the product, allowing the provider to take "remedial action" if the actual viewers do not match the distribution license. The <a href="Kinect">system</a> has been compared with "1984"'s telescreen surveillance system.

A series of laws intended to implement the EU <a href="Data%20Retention%20Directive">Data Retention Directive</a> in <a href="Romania">Romania</a> were nicknamed "the Big Brother laws" by Romanian media and civil society, as they would have led to blanket storage of citizens' telecommunications data for 6 months. All of these laws were struck down as unconstitutional by the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Romania">Constitutional Court of Romania</a>, and the Directive itself was ultimately invalidated by the <a href="Court%20of%20Justice%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</a>.

<doc id="4266" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4266" title="Binary search algorithm">
Binary search algorithm

In <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a <a href="search%20algorithm">search algorithm</a> that finds the position of a target value within a <a href="sorted%20array">sorted array</a>. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

Binary search runs in at worst <a href="Time%20complexity%23Logarithmic%20time">logarithmic time</a>, making comparisons, where is the number of elements in the array, the is <a href="Big%20O%20notation">Big O notation</a>, and is the <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>. Binary search takes constant () space, meaning that the space taken by the algorithm is the same for any number of elements in the array. Although specialized <a href="data%20structures">data structures</a> designed for fast searching—such as <a href="hash%20tables">hash tables</a>—can be searched more efficiently, binary search applies to a wider range of problems.

Although the idea is simple, implementing binary search correctly requires attention to some subtleties about its exit conditions and midpoint calculation.

There are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, <a href="fractional%20cascading">fractional cascading</a> speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays, efficiently solving a series of search problems in <a href="computational%20geometry">computational geometry</a> and numerous other fields. <a href="Exponential%20search">Exponential search</a> extends binary search to unbounded lists. The <a href="binary%20search%20tree">binary search tree</a> and <a href="B-tree">B-tree</a> <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a>s are based on binary search.

Binary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing the middle element of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the array, respectively, eliminating the other half from consideration.

Given an array "A" of "n" elements with values or <a href="Record%20%28computer%20science%29">records</a> "A", "A", ..., "A", sorted such that "A" ≤ "A" ≤ ... ≤ "A", and target value "T", the following <a href="subroutine">subroutine</a> uses binary search to find the index of "T" in "A".

This iterative procedure keeps track of the search boundaries with two variables. Some implementations may check whether the middle element is equal to the target at the end of the procedure. This results in a faster comparison loop, but requires one more iteration on average.

The above procedure only performs "exact" matches, finding the position of a target value. However, due to the ordered nature of sorted arrays, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and <a href="Nearest%20neighbor%20search">nearest neighbor</a>. <a href="Range%20query%20%28data%20structures%29">Range queries</a> seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.

The performance of binary search can be analyzed by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle element of the array; the middle element of the lower half is left of the root and the middle element of the upper half is right of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, the left or right subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.

The worst case is formula_1 iterations of the comparison loop, where the formula_2 notation denotes the <a href="floor%20function">floor function</a> that rounds its argument to the next-smallest integer and formula_3 is the <a href="binary%20logarithm">binary logarithm</a>. The worst case is reached when the search reaches the deepest level of the tree, equivalent to a binary search that has reduced to one element and, in each iteration, always eliminates the smaller subarray out of the two if they are not of equal size.

On average, assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, the procedure will most likely find the target value the second-deepest level of the tree. This is equivalent to a binary search that completes one iteration before the worst case, reached after formula_4 iterations. However, the tree may be unbalanced, with the deepest level partially filled, and equivalently, the array may not be divided perfectly by the search in some iterations, half of the time resulting in the smaller subarray being eliminated. The actual number of average iterations is slightly higher, at formula_5 iterations. In the best case, where target value is the middle element of the array, its position is returned after one iteration. In terms of iterations, no search algorithm that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst-case performance than binary search.

Each iteration of the binary search procedure defined above makes one or two comparisons, checking if the middle element is equal to the target in each iteration. Again assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, each iteration makes 1.5 comparisons on average. A variation of the algorithm checks whether the middle element is equal to the target at the end of the search, eliminating on average half a comparison from each iteration. This slightly cuts the time taken per iteration on most computers, while guaranteeing that the search takes the maximum number of iterations, on average adding one iteration to the search. Because the comparison loop is performed only formula_1 times in the worst case, for all but enormous formula_7, the slight increase in comparison loop efficiency does not compensate for the extra iteration. gives a value of formula_8 (more than 73 quintillion) elements for this variation to be faster.
<a href="%23Fractional%20cascading">Fractional cascading</a> can be used to speed up searches of the same value in multiple arrays. Where formula_9 is the number of arrays, searching each array for the target value takes formula_10 time; fractional cascading reduces this to formula_11.

Sorted arrays with binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval, taking formula_12 time for each such operation, and complicating memory use. Other data structures support much more efficient insertion and deletion, and also fast exact matching. However, binary search applies to a wide range of search problems, usually solving them in formula_13 time regardless of the type or structure of the values themselves.

For implementing <a href="associative%20arrays">associative arrays</a>, <a href="hash%20table">hash table</a>s, a data structure that maps keys to <a href="record%20%28computer%20science%29">records</a> using a <a href="hash%20function">hash function</a>, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records; most implementations require only <a href="Amortized%20analysis">amortized</a> constant time on average. However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, as the only information given on a failed search is that the target is not present in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. In addition, all operations possible on a sorted array can be performed—such as finding the smallest and largest key and performing range searches.

A <a href="binary%20search%20tree">binary search tree</a> is a <a href="binary%20tree">binary tree</a> data structure that works based on the principle of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary search trees. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.

However, binary search is usually more efficient for searching as binary search trees will most likely be imperfectly balanced, resulting in slightly worse performance than binary search. This applies even to <a href="balanced%20binary%20search%20tree">balanced binary search tree</a>s, binary search trees that balance their own nodes—as they rarely produce "optimally"-balanced trees—but to a lesser extent. Although unlikely, the tree may be severely imbalanced with few internal nodes with two children, resulting in the average and worst-case search time approaching formula_7 comparisons. Binary search trees take more space than sorted arrays.

Binary search trees lend themselves to fast searching in external memory stored in hard disks, as binary search trees can effectively be structured in filesystems. The <a href="B-tree">B-tree</a> generalizes this method of tree organization; B-trees are frequently used to organize long-term storage such as <a href="database">database</a>s and <a href="filesystem">filesystem</a>s.

<a href="Linear%20search">Linear search</a> is a simple search algorithm that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short. If the array must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting the array also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.

The <a href="Judy%20array">Judy array</a> uses a combination of approaches to provide a highly efficient solution.

A related problem to search is <a href="Set%20%28abstract%20data%20type%29">set membership</a>. Any algorithm that does lookup, like binary search, can also be used for set membership. There are other algorithms that are more specifically suited for set membership. A <a href="bit%20array">bit array</a> is the simplest, useful when the range of keys is limited; it is very fast, requiring only formula_15 time. The Judy1 type of <a href="Judy%20array">Judy array</a> handles 64-bit keys efficiently.

For approximate results, <a href="Bloom%20filter">Bloom filter</a>s, another probabilistic data structure based on hashing, store a <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> of keys by encoding the keys using a <a href="bit%20array">bit array</a> and multiple hash functions. Bloom filters are much more space-efficient than bitarrays in most cases and not much slower: with formula_9 hash functions, membership queries require only formula_17 time. However, Bloom filters suffer from <a href="False%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives">false positives</a>.

There exist data structures that may improve on binary search in some cases for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as <a href="van%20Emde%20Boas%20tree">van Emde Boas tree</a>s, <a href="fusion%20tree">fusion tree</a>s, <a href="trie">trie</a>s, and <a href="bit%20array">bit array</a>s. However, while these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys, such data structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute.

Uniform binary search stores, instead of the lower and upper bounds, the index of the middle element and the change in the middle element from the current iteration to the next iteration. Each step reduces the change by about half. For example, if the array to be searched was , the middle element would be . Uniform binary search works on the basis that the difference between the index of middle element of the array and the left and right subarrays is the same. In this case, the middle element of the left subarray () is and the middle element of the right subarray () is . Uniform binary search would store the value of as both indices differ from by this same amount. To reduce the search space, the algorithm either adds or subtracts this change from the middle element. The main advantage of uniform binary search is that the procedure can store a table of the differences between indices for each iteration of the procedure, which may improve the algorithm's performance on some systems.

Fibonacci search is a method similar to binary search that successively shortens the <a href="Interval%20%28mathematics%29">interval</a> in which the maximum of a <a href="Unimodality%23Unimodal%20function">unimodal function</a> lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the maximum length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a <a href="Fibonacci%20number">Fibonacci number</a> such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.

Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. It starts by finding the first element with an index that is both a power of two and greater than the target value. Afterwards, it sets that index as the upper bound, and switches to binary search. A search takes formula_18 iterations of the exponential search and at most formula_19 iterations of the binary search, where formula_20 is the position of the target value. Exponential search works on bounded lists, but becomes an improvement over binary search only if the target value lies near beginning of the array.

Instead of calculating the midpoint, interpolation search estimates the position of the target value, taking into account the lowest and highest elements in the array as well as length of the array. This is only possible if the array elements are numbers. It works on the basis that the midpoint is not the best guess in many cases. For example, if the target value is close to the highest element in the array, it is likely to be located near the end of the array. When the distribution of the array elements is uniform or near uniform, it makes formula_21 comparisons.

In practice, interpolation search is slower than binary search for small arrays, as interpolation search requires extra computation. Although its time complexity grows more slowly than binary search, this only compensates for the extra computation for large arrays.

Fractional cascading is a technique that speeds up binary searches for the same element for both exact and approximate matching in "catalogs" (arrays of sorted elements) associated with <a href="Vertex%20%28graph%20theory%29">vertices</a> in <a href="Graph%20theory">graphs</a>. Searching each catalog separately requires formula_10 time, where formula_9 is the number of catalogs. Fractional cascading reduces this to formula_11 by storing specific information in each catalog about other catalogs.

Fractional cascading was originally developed to efficiently solve various <a href="computational%20geometry">computational geometry</a> problems, but it also has been applied elsewhere, in domains such as <a href="data%20mining">data mining</a> and <a href="Internet%20Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> routing.

Noisy binary search algorithms solve the case where the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array. For each pair of elements, there is a certain probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the <a href="Ulam%27s%20game">Rényi-Ulam game</a>, which <a href="Alfr%C3%A9d%20R%C3%A9nyi">Alfréd Rényi</a> introduced in 1961.

In 1946, <a href="John%20Mauchly">John Mauchly</a> made the first mention of binary search as part of the <a href="Moore%20School%20Lectures">Moore School Lectures</a>, the first ever set of lectures regarding any computer-related topic. Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when <a href="Derrick%20Henry%20Lehmer">Derrick Henry Lehmer</a> published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an <a href="ALGOL%2060">ALGOL 60</a> implementation of binary search that placed the <a href="%23Equality%20test%20at%20end%20of%20program">comparison for equality at the end</a>, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The <a href="%23Uniform%20binary%20search">uniform binary search</a> was presented to <a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> in 1971 by A. K. Chandra of <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> and published in Knuth's <a href="The%20Art%20of%20Computer%20Programming">The Art of Computer Programming</a>. In 1986, <a href="Bernard%20Chazelle">Bernard Chazelle</a> and <a href="Leonidas%20J.%20Guibas">Leonidas J. Guibas</a> introduced <a href="fractional%20cascading">fractional cascading</a> as a method to solve numerous search problems in <a href="computational%20geometry">computational geometry</a>.

Although the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky ... — <a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>

When <a href="Jon%20Bentley%20%28computer%20scientist%29">Jon Bentley</a> assigned binary search as a problem in a course for professional programmers, he found that ninety percent failed to provide a correct solution after several hours of working on it, and another study published in 1988 shows that accurate code for it is only found in five out of twenty textbooks. Furthermore, Bentley's own implementation of binary search, published in his 1986 book "Programming Pearls", contained an overflow error that remained undetected for over twenty years. The <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java programming language</a> library implementation of binary search had the same overflow bug for more than nine years.

In a practical implementation, the variables used to represent the indices will often be of fixed size, and this can result in an <a href="integer%20overflow">arithmetic overflow</a> for very large arrays. If the midpoint of the span is calculated as ("L" + "R") / 2, then the value of "L" + "R" may exceed the range of integers of the data type used to store the midpoint, even if "L" and "R" are within the range. If "L" and "R" are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint as "L" + ("R" − "L") / 2.

If the target value is greater than the greatest value in the array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of "L", the value of "L" will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar problem will occur if the target value is smaller than the least value in the array and the first index of the array is the smallest representable value of "R". In particular, this means that "R" must not be an unsigned type if the array starts with index 0.

An infinite loop may occur if the exit conditions for the loop are not defined correctly. Once "L" exceeds "R", the search has failed and must convey the failure of the search.

Belle and Sebastian

Belle and Sebastian are a Scottish band formed in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> in January 1996. Led by <a href="Stuart%20Murdoch%20%28musician%29">Stuart Murdoch</a>, the band has released 9 albums to date. Much of their work had been released on <a href="Jeepster%20Records">Jeepster Records</a>, but they are now signed to <a href="Rough%20Trade%20Records">Rough Trade Records</a> in the United Kingdom and <a href="Matador%20Records">Matador Records</a> in the United States. Though often praised by critics, Belle and Sebastian have enjoyed only limited commercial success.

Belle and Sebastian were formed in Glasgow, Scotland in 1996 by <a href="Stuart%20Murdoch%20%28musician%29">Stuart Murdoch</a> and <a href="Stuart%20David">Stuart David</a>. Together, with <a href="Stow%20College">Stow College</a> music professor <a href="Alan%20Rankine">Alan Rankine</a>, they recorded some demos, which were picked up by the college's Music Business course that produces and releases one single each year on the college's label, <a href="Electric%20Honey%20%28label%29">Electric Honey</a>. As the band had a number of songs already and the label was extremely impressed with the demos, Belle and Sebastian were allowed to record a full-length album, which was titled "<a href="Tigermilk">Tigermilk</a>". Murdoch once described the band as a "product of botched capitalism". The band took their name from <a href="Belle%20and%20Sebastian%20%28French%20TV%20series%29">the television adaptation of</a> the French novel "<a href="Belle%20et%20S%C3%A9bastien">Belle et Sébastien</a>".

"Tigermilk" was recorded in three days and originally only one thousand copies were pressed in <a href="Gramophone%20record">vinyl</a>. These original copies now sell for up to £400. The warm reception the album received inspired Murdoch and David to turn the band into a full-time project, recruiting <a href="Stevie%20Jackson">Stevie Jackson</a> (guitar and vocals), <a href="Isobel%20Campbell">Isobel Campbell</a> (cello/vocals), <a href="Chris%20Geddes">Chris Geddes</a> (keys) and <a href="Richard%20Colburn">Richard Colburn</a> (drums) to fill out the group.

After the success of the debut album, Belle and Sebastian were signed to <a href="Jeepster%20Records">Jeepster Records</a> in August 1996 and "<a href="If%20You%27re%20Feeling%20Sinister">If You're Feeling Sinister</a>", their second album, was released on 18 November. The album was named by "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" as one of the 100 greatest albums between 1985 and 2005, and is widely considered the band's masterpiece. Just before the recording of "Sinister", <a href="Sarah%20Martin%20%28musician%29">Sarah Martin</a> (violin/vocals) joined the band. Following this a series of EPs were released in 1997. The first of these was "<a href="Dog%20on%20Wheels">Dog on Wheels</a>", which contained four demo tracks recorded before the real formation of the band. In fact, the only long-term band members to play on the songs were Murdoch, David, and <a href="Mick%20Cooke">Mick Cooke</a>, who played trumpet on the EP but would not officially join the band until a few years later. It charted at No. 59 in the UK singles chart.

The "<a href="Lazy%20Line%20Painter%20Jane">Lazy Line Painter Jane</a>" EP followed in July. The track was recorded in the church where Murdoch lived and features vocals from <a href="Monica%20Queen">Monica Queen</a>. The EP narrowly missed out on the UK top 40, peaking at No. 41. The last of the 1997 EPs was October's "<a href="3..%206..%209%20Seconds%20of%20Light">3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light</a>". The EP was made Single of the Week in both the "<a href="NME">NME</a>" and "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" and reached No. 32 in the charts, thus becoming the band's first top 40 single.

The band released their third LP, "<a href="The%20Boy%20with%20the%20Arab%20Strap">The Boy with the Arab Strap</a>" in 1998, and it reached No. 12 in the UK charts. "Arab Strap" garnered positive reviews from "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" and the "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>," among others; however, the album has its detractors, including "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>", who gave the album a particularly poor review, calling it a "parody" of their earlier work (Pitchfork has since removed the review from their website). During the recording of the album, long-time studio trumpet-player Mick Cooke was asked to join the band as a full member. The "<a href="This%20Is%20Just%20a%20Modern%20Rock%20Song">This Is Just a Modern Rock Song</a>" EP followed later that year.

In 1999 the band was awarded with Best Newcomer (for their third album) at the <a href="BRIT%20Awards">BRIT Awards</a>, upsetting better-known acts such as <a href="Steps%20%28band%29">Steps</a> and <a href="5ive">5ive</a>. That same year, the band hosted their own festival, the <a href="Bowlie%20Weekender">Bowlie Weekender</a>. "<a href="Tigermilk">Tigermilk</a>" was also given a full release by <a href="Jeepster%20Records">Jeepster</a> before the band started work on their next LP. The result was "<a href="Fold%20Your%20Hands%20Child%2C%20You%20Walk%20Like%20a%20Peasant">Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant</a>", which became the band's first top 10 album in the UK. A stand-alone single, "<a href="Legal%20Man">Legal Man</a>", reached No. 15 and gave them their first appearance on <a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>.

As the band's popularity and recognition was growing worldwide, their music began appearing in films and on television. The 2000 film "<a href="High%20Fidelity%20%28film%29">High Fidelity</a>" mentions the band and features a clip from the song "<a href="Seymour%20Stein">Seymour Stein</a>" from "The Boy with the Arab Strap". Also, the title track from "Arab Strap" was played over the end credits of the UK television series "<a href="Teachers%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Teachers</a>," and the lyric "Colour my life with the chaos of trouble" from the song was quoted by one of the characters in the 2009 film "<a href="%28500%29%20Days%20of%20Summer">(500) Days of Summer</a>".

<a href="Stuart%20David">Stuart David</a> soon left the band to concentrate on his side project, <a href="Looper%20%28band%29">Looper</a>, and his book writing, which included his "The Idle Thoughts of a Daydreamer". He was replaced by <a href="Bobby%20Kildea">Bobby Kildea</a> of <a href="V-Twin%20%28band%29">V-Twin</a>. The "<a href="Jonathan%20David">Jonathan David</a>" single, sung by Stevie Jackson, was released in June 2001 and was followed by "<a href="I%27m%20Waking%20Up%20to%20Us">I'm Waking Up to Us</a>" in November. "I'm Waking Up to Us" saw the band use an outside producer (<a href="Mike%20Hurst%20%28producer%29">Mike Hurst</a>) for the first time. Most of 2002 was spent touring and recording a soundtrack album, "<a href="Storytelling%20%28Belle%20and%20Sebastian%20album%29">Storytelling</a>" (for "<a href="Storytelling%20%28film%29">Storytelling</a>" by <a href="Todd%20Solondz">Todd Solondz</a>). Campbell left the band in the spring of 2002, in the middle of the band's North American tour to pursue a solo career, first as The Gentle Waves, and later under her own name. She later collaborated with singer <a href="Mark%20Lanegan">Mark Lanegan</a> on three albums.

The band left Jeepster in 2002, signing a four-album deal with <a href="Rough%20Trade%20Records">Rough Trade Records</a>. Their first album for Rough Trade, "<a href="Dear%20Catastrophe%20Waitress">Dear Catastrophe Waitress</a>", was released in 2003, and was produced by <a href="Trevor%20Horn">Trevor Horn</a>. The album showed a markedly more "produced" sound compared to their first four LPs, as the band was making a concerted effort to produce more "radio-friendly" music. The album was warmly received and is credited with restoring the band's "indie cred". The album also marked the return of Murdoch as the group's primary songwriter, following the poorly received "Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant" and "Storytelling", both of which were more collaborative than the band's early work. A documentary DVD, "<a href="Fans%20Only">Fans Only</a>", was released by Jeepster in October 2003, featuring promotional videos, live clips and unreleased footage. A single from the album, "<a href="Step%20into%20My%20Office%2C%20Baby">Step into My Office, Baby</a>" followed in November 2003; it would be their first single taken from an album.

The <a href="Thin%20Lizzy">Thin Lizzy</a>-inspired "<a href="I%27m%20a%20Cuckoo">I'm a Cuckoo</a>" was the second single from the album. It achieved their highest chart position yet, reaching No. 14 in the UK. The "<a href="Books%20%28EP%29">Books</a>" EP followed, a double A-side single led by "Wrapped Up in Books" from "Dear Catastrophe Waitress" and the new "Your Cover's Blown". This EP became the band's third top 20 UK release, and the band was nominated for both the <a href="Mercury%20Music%20Prize">Mercury Music Prize</a> and an <a href="Ivor%20Novello%20Award">Ivor Novello Award</a>. In January 2005, B&S was voted Scotland's greatest band in a poll by <a href="The%20List%20%28magazine%29">The List</a>, beating <a href="Simple%20Minds">Simple Minds</a>, <a href="Idlewild%20%28band%29">Idlewild</a>, <a href="Travis%20%28band%29">Travis</a>, <a href="Franz%20Ferdinand%20%28band%29">Franz Ferdinand</a>, and <a href="The%20Proclaimers">The Proclaimers</a>, among others.

In April 2005, members of the band visited <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and the <a href="Palestinian%20territories">Palestinian territories</a> with the UK charity <a href="War%20on%20Want">War on Want</a>; the group subsequently recorded a song inspired by the trip titled "The Eighth Station of the Cross Kebab House", which would first appear on the digital-download version of the charity album and would later have a physical release as a B-side on 2006's "<a href="Funny%20Little%20Frog">Funny Little Frog</a>" single. "<a href="Push%20Barman%20to%20Open%20Old%20Wounds">Push Barman to Open Old Wounds</a>", a compilation of the Jeepster singles and EPs, was released in May 2005 while the band were recording their seventh album in California. The result of the sessions was "<a href="The%20Life%20Pursuit">The Life Pursuit</a>", produced by <a href="Tony%20Hoffer">Tony Hoffer</a>. The album, originally intended to be a double album, became the band's highest-charting album upon its release in February 2006, peaking at No. 8 in the UK and No. 65 on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. "Funny Little Frog", which preceded it, also proved to be their highest-charting single, debuting at No. 13.

On 6 July 2006, the band played a historic show with the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Philharmonic">Los Angeles Philharmonic</a> at the <a href="Hollywood%20Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a>. The opening act at the 18,000 seat sell-out concert was <a href="The%20Shins">The Shins</a>. The members of the band see this as a landmark event, with Stevie Jackson saying, "This is the biggest thrill of my entire life". In October 2006, members of the band helped put together a CD collection of new songs for children titled "<a href="Colours%20Are%20Brighter">Colours Are Brighter</a>", with the involvement of major bands such as <a href="Franz%20Ferdinand%20%28band%29">Franz Ferdinand</a> and <a href="The%20Flaming%20Lips">The Flaming Lips</a>.

On 18 November 2008 the band released "<a href="The%20BBC%20Sessions%20%28Belle%20and%20Sebastian%20album%29">The BBC Sessions</a>", which features songs from the period of 1996–2001 (including the last recordings featuring Isobel Campbell before she left the band), along with a second disc featuring a recording of a live performance in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> from Christmas 2001.

On 17 July 2010, the band performed their first UK gig in almost four years to a crowd of around 30,000 at <a href="Latitude%20Festival">Latitude Festival</a> in Henham Park, Southwold. They performed two new songs, "I Didn't See It Coming" and "I'm Not Living in the Real World".

Their eighth studio album, released in the UK and internationally on 25 September 2010, was titled "<a href="Belle%20and%20Sebastian%20Write%20About%20Love">Belle and Sebastian Write About Love</a>". The first single from the album, as well as the record's title track "<a href="Write%20About%20Love%20%28song%29">Write About Love</a>", was released in the US on 7 September 2010. "Write About Love" entered the UK albums chart in its first week of release, peaking at No. 8 as of 19 October 2010. <a href="Norah%20Jones">Norah Jones</a> is featured on the track "Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John".

In December 2010 Belle and Sebastian curated the sequel to the "Bowlie Weekender" in the form of "Bowlie 2" presented by <a href="All%20Tomorrow%27s%20Parties%20%28music%20festival%29">All Tomorrow's Parties</a>.

In 2013, <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork TV</a> released an hour-long documentary in February, directed by RJ Bentler which focused on the band's 1996 album <a href="If%20You%27re%20Feeling%20Sinister">If You're Feeling Sinister</a>, as well as the formation and early releases of the band. The documentary featured interviews with every member that was present on the album, as well as several archival photos and videos from the band's early days. The band compiled a second compilation album "<a href="The%20Third%20Eye%20Centre">The Third Eye Centre</a>" which included the b-sides and rarities released after "Push Barman to Open Old Wounds", from the albums "Dear Catastrophe Waitress", "The Life Pursuit", and "Write About Love". In an interview at the end of 2013, Mick Cooke confirmed he had left the band on good terms.

The band received an 'Outstanding Contribution To Music Award' at the <a href="NME%20Awards">NME Awards</a> 2014.

In 2014, the band returned to the studio, recording in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> for their ninth studio album, along with announcing tour dates for various festivals and concerts across the world during 2014.

<doc id="4279" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4279" title="Broadcast domain">
Broadcast domain

A broadcast domain is a logical division of a <a href="computer%20network">computer network</a>, in which all <a href="node%20%28networking%29">node</a>s can reach each other by <a href="broadcasting%20%28computing%29">broadcast</a> at the <a href="data%20link%20layer">data link layer</a>. A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments.

In terms of current popular technologies: Any computer connected to the same <a href="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> <a href="repeater">repeater</a> or <a href="network%20switch">switch</a> is a member of the same broadcast domain. Further, any computer connected to the same set of inter-connected switches/repeaters is a member of the same broadcast domain. <a href="Router%20%28computing%29">Router</a>s and other <a href="Network%20layer">higher-layer</a> devices form boundaries between broadcast domains.

This is as compared to a <a href="collision%20domain">collision domain</a>, which would be all nodes on the same set of inter-connected repeaters, divided by switches and learning bridges. Collision domains are generally smaller than, and contained within, broadcast domains.

While some <a href="Data%20Link%20Layer">layer two network</a> devices are able to divide the collision domains, broadcast domains are only divided by layer 3 network devices such as routers or layer 3 switches. Separating <a href="virtual%20LAN">VLANs</a> divides broadcast domains as well.

The distinction between broadcast and collision domains comes about because simple <a href="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> and similar systems use a shared <a href="transmission%20system">transmission system</a>. In simple Ethernet (without switches or <a href="network%20bridge">bridges</a>), <a href="Frame%20%28networking%29">data frames</a> are transmitted to all other nodes on a network. Each receiving node checks the destination address of each frame, and simply ignores any frame not addressed to its own <a href="MAC%20address">MAC address</a> or the <a href="broadcast%20address">broadcast address</a>.

Switches act as buffers, receiving and analyzing the frames from each connected network segment. Frames destined for nodes connected to the originating segment are not forwarded by the switch. Frames destined for a specific node on a different segment are sent only to that segment. Only broadcast frames are forwarded to all other segments. This reduces unnecessary traffic and collisions.

In such a switched network, transmitted frames may not be received by all other reachable nodes. Nominally, only broadcast frames will be received by all other nodes. Collisions are localized to the network segment they occur on. Thus, the broadcast domain is the entire inter-connected <a href="Data%20Link%20Layer">layer two network</a>, and the segments connected to each switch/bridge port are each a collision domain.

Not all network systems or media feature broadcast/collision domains. For example, <a href="Point-to-Point%20Protocol">PPP links</a>.

With a sufficiently sophisticated switch, it is possible to create a network in which the normal notion of a broadcast domain is strictly controlled. One implementation of this concept is termed a "<a href="private%20VLAN">private VLAN</a>". Another implementation is possible with <a href="Linux">Linux</a> and <a href="iptables">iptables</a>. One helpful analogy is that by creating multiple VLANs, the number of broadcast domains increases, but the size of each broadcast domain decreases. This is because a <a href="virtual%20LAN">virtual LAN</a> (or VLAN) is technically a broadcast domain.

This is achieved by designating one or more "<a href="server%20%28computing%29">server</a>" or "provider" nodes, either by MAC address or switch port. Broadcast frames are allowed to originate from these sources, and are sent to all other nodes. Broadcast frames from all other sources are directed only to the server/provider nodes. Traffic from other sources not destined to the server/provider nodes ("<a href="peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a>" traffic) is blocked.

The result is a network based on a nominally shared transmission system; like Ethernet, but in which "<a href="client%20%28computing%29">client</a>" nodes cannot communicate with each other, only with the server/provider. A common application is <a href="Internet%20service%20provider">Internet providers</a>. Allowing direct data link layer communication between customer nodes exposes the network to various security attacks, such as <a href="ARP%20spoofing">ARP spoofing</a>. Controlling the broadcast domain in this fashion provides many of the advantages of a point-to-point network, using commodity broadcast-based hardware.

<doc id="4282" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4282" title="Beechcraft">
Beechcraft

Beechcraft is a brand of <a href="Textron%20Aviation">Textron Aviation</a> since 2014. Originally, it was a brand of Beech Aircraft Corporation, an American manufacturer of <a href="general%20aviation">general aviation</a>, <a href="commercial%20aircraft">commercial</a>, and <a href="military%20aircraft">military aircraft</a>, ranging from light single-engined aircraft to twin-engined turboprop transports, business jets, and military trainers. Beech later became a division of <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> and later <a href="Hawker%20Beechcraft">Hawker Beechcraft</a> before a bankruptcy sale turned its assets over to Textron (parent company of Beech's cross-town <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita</a> rival, <a href="Cessna%20Aircraft%20Company">Cessna Aircraft Company</a>).

Beech Aircraft Company was founded in <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a>, in 1932 by <a href="Walter%20Herschel%20Beech">Walter Beech</a> and his wife <a href="Olive%20Ann%20Beech">Olive Ann Beech</a>. The company began operations in an idle <a href="Cessna">Cessna</a> factory. With designer Ted Wells, they developed the first aircraft under the Beechcraft name, the classic <a href="Beechcraft%20Model%2017%20Staggerwing">Beechcraft Model 17 Staggerwing</a>, which first flew in November 1932. Over 750 Staggerwings were built, with 270 manufactured for the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Beechcraft was not Beech's first company, as he had previously formed <a href="Travel%20Air">Travel Air</a> in 1924 and the design numbers used at Beechcraft followed the sequence started at Travel Air, and were then continued at Curtiss-Wright, after Travel Air had been absorbed into the much larger company in 1929. Beech became President of the Curtiss-Wright's airplane division and VP of sales, but became dissatisfied with being so far removed from aircraft production and quit to form Beechcraft, using the original Travel Air facilities and employing many of the same people. Model numbers prior to 11/11000 were built under the Travel Air name, while Curtiss-Wright built the CW-12, 14, 15, and 16 as well as previous successful Travel Air models (mostly the model 4).

In 1942 Beech won its first <a href="Army-Navy%20%26quot%3BE%26quot%3B%20Award">Army-Navy "E" Award</a> production award and became one of the elite five percent of war contracting firms in the country to win five straight awards for production efficiency, mostly for the production of the <a href="Beechcraft%20Model%2018">Beechcraft Model 18</a> which remains in widespread use worldwide. Beechcraft ranked 69th among United States corporations in the value of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> military production contracts.

After the war, the Staggerwing was replaced by the revolutionary <a href="Beechcraft%20Bonanza">Beechcraft Bonanza</a> with a distinctive <a href="V-tail">V-tail</a>. Perhaps the best known Beech aircraft, the single-engined Bonanza has been manufactured in various models since 1947. The Bonanza has had the longest production run of any airplane, past or present, in the world. Other important Beech aircraft are the <a href="Beechcraft%20King%20Air">King Air</a>/<a href="Beechcraft%20Super%20King%20Air">Super King Air</a> line of twin-engined turboprops, in production since 1964, the <a href="Beechcraft%20Baron">Baron</a>, a twin-engined variant of the Bonanza, and the Beechcraft Model 18, originally a business transport and commuter airliner from the late 1930s through the 1960s, which remains in active service as a cargo transport.

In 1950, Olive Ann Beech was installed as president and CEO of the company, after the sudden death of her husband from a heart attack on November 29 of that year. She continued as CEO until Beech was purchased by <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon Company</a> on February 8, 1980. Ted Wells had been replaced as Chief Engineer by Herbert Rawdon, who remained at the post until his retirement in the early 1960s.

In 1994, Raytheon merged Beechcraft with the Hawker product line it had acquired in 1993 from <a href="British%20Aerospace">British Aerospace</a>, forming <a href="Raytheon%20Aircraft%20Company">Raytheon Aircraft Company</a>. In 2002, the Beechcraft brand was revived to again designate the Wichita-produced aircraft. In 2006, Raytheon sold Raytheon Aircraft to Goldman Sachs creating <a href="Hawker%20Beechcraft">Hawker Beechcraft</a>. Since its inception Beechcraft has resided in <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a>, also the home of chief competitor <a href="Cessna">Cessna</a>, the birthplace of <a href="Learjet">Learjet</a> and of <a href="Stearman%20Aircraft">Stearman</a>, whose trainers were used in large numbers during WW2.

The entry into bankruptcy of <a href="Hawker%20Beechcraft">Hawker Beechcraft</a> on May 3, 2012 ended with its emergence on February 16, 2013 as a new entity, Beechcraft Corporation, with the Hawker Beechcraft name being retired. The new and much smaller company will produce the King Air line of aircraft as well as the T-6 and AT-6 military trainer/attack aircraft, as well as the piston-powered single-engined Bonanza and twin-engined Baron aircraft. The jet line was discontinued, but the new company would continue to support the aircraft already produced with parts, plus engineering and airworthiness documentation.

By October 2013, the company, now financially turned around, was up for sale.

On December 26, 2013, <a href="Textron">Textron</a> agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale was concluded in the first half of 2014, with government approval. Textron CEO Scott Donnelly indicated that Beechcraft and Cessna would be combined to form a new light aircraft manufacturing concern, <a href="Textron%20Aviation">Textron Aviation</a>, that will result in US$65M-$85M in annual savings over keeping the companies separate. Textron has kept both the Beechcraft and Cessna names as separate brands.




<a href="Beech%20Factory%20Airport">Beech Factory Airport</a> house Beechcraft's head office, manufacturing facility, and runway for test flights.

The Battle of Peleliu, codenamed Operation Stalemate II by the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> military, was fought between the U.S. and the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a> during the <a href="Mariana%20and%20Palau%20Islands%20campaign">Mariana & Palau Campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, from September to November 1944, on the island of <a href="Peleliu">Peleliu</a>.

U.S. Marines of the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division">1st Marine Division</a>, and later soldiers of the U.S. Army's <a href="81st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">81st Infantry Division</a>, fought to capture an <a href="airstrip">airstrip</a> on the small <a href="coral">coral</a> island. This battle was part of a larger offensive campaign known as <a href="Operation%20Forager">Operation Forager</a>, which ran from June to November 1944, in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific Theater</a>.

<a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="William%20Rupertus">William Rupertus</a>, Commander of the 1st Marine Division, predicted the island would be secured within four days. However, after repeated <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Army</a> defeats in previous island campaigns, Japan had developed new island-defense tactics and well-crafted fortifications that allowed stiff resistance, extending the battle through more than two months. In the United States, this was a controversial battle because of the island's questionable strategic value and the high casualty rate, which exceeded that of all other amphibious operations during the Pacific War. The <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20Marine%20Corps">National Museum of the Marine Corps</a> called it "the bitterest battle of the war for the Marines".

By 1944, American victories in the Southwest and <a href="Central%20Pacific%20Area">Central Pacific</a> had brought the war closer to Japan, with American bombers able to strike at the Japanese main islands from air bases secured during the <a href="Mariana%20Islands%20campaign">Mariana Islands campaign</a> (June—August 1944). There was disagreement among the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">U.S. Joint Chiefs</a> over two proposed strategies to defeat the Japanese Empire. The strategy proposed by General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> called for the recapture of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, followed by the capture of <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, then an <a href="Operation%20Downfall">attack on the Japanese mainland</a>. Admiral <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a> favored a more direct strategy of bypassing the Philippines, but seizing Okinawa and Taiwan as <a href="staging%20area">staging area</a>s to an attack on the Japanese mainland, followed by the future invasion of Japan's southernmost islands. Both strategies included the invasion of Peleliu, but for different reasons.

The <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a> had already been chosen to make the assault. President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> traveled to <a href="Naval%20Station%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> to personally meet both commanders and hear their arguments. MacArthur's strategy was chosen. However, before MacArthur could retake the Philippines, the <a href="Palau%20Islands">Palau Islands</a>, specifically Peleliu and <a href="Angaur">Angaur</a>, were to be neutralized and an airfield built to protect MacArthur's right flank.

By 1944, Peleliu Island was occupied by about 11,000 Japanese of the <a href="14th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">14th Infantry Division</a> with Korean and <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>n laborers. Colonel <a href="Kunio%20Nakagawa">Kunio Nakagawa</a>, commander of the division's 2nd Regiment, led the preparations for the island's defense.

After their losses in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20campaign">Solomons</a>, <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Marshall%20Islands%20campaign">Gilberts, Marshalls</a> and <a href="Mariana%20and%20Palau%20Islands%20campaign">Marianas</a>, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Army</a> assembled a research team to develop new island-defense tactics. They chose to abandon the old strategy of stopping the enemy at the beach. The new tactics would only disrupt the landings at the water's edge and depend on an in-depth defense farther inland. Colonel Nakagawa used the rough terrain to his advantage, by constructing a system of heavily fortified bunkers, caves and underground positions all interlocked into a "honeycomb" system. The old "<a href="banzai%20charge">banzai charge</a>" attack was also discontinued as being both wasteful of men and ineffective. These changes would force the Americans into a war of attrition requiring increasingly more resources.
Nakagawa's defenses were based at Peleliu's highest point, Umurbrogol Mountain, a collection of hills and steep ridges located at the center of Peleliu overlooking a large portion of the island, including the crucial airfield. The Umurbrogol contained some 500 limestone caves, interconnected by tunnels. Many of these were former mine shafts that were turned into defense positions. Engineers added sliding armored steel doors with multiple openings to serve both artillery and machine guns. Cave entrances were built slanted as a defense against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast system throughout central Peleliu, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking <a href="interior%20lines">interior lines</a>.

The Japanese were well armed with <a href="Type%2097%2081%20mm%20infantry%20mortar"></a> and <a href="Type%2096%20150%20mm%20Infantry%20Mortar">mortar</a>s and <a href="Type%2098%2020%20mm%20AA%20Machine%20Cannon"></a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> <a href="Autocannon">cannon</a>s, backed by a light tank unit and an anti-aircraft detachment.

The Japanese also used the beach terrain to their advantage. The northern end of the landing beaches faced a coral promontory that overlooked the beaches from a small peninsula, a spot later known to the Marines who assaulted it simply as "The Point". Holes were blasted into the ridge to accommodate a <a href="Type%201%2047%20mm%20Anti-Tank%20Gun">gun</a>, and six 20-mm cannons. The positions were then sealed shut, leaving just a small firing slit to assault the beaches. Similar positions were crafted along the stretch of landing beaches.

The beaches were also filled with thousands of obstacles for the landing craft, principally mines and a large number of heavy artillery shells buried with the fuses exposed to explode when they were run over. A battalion was placed along the beach to defend against the landing, but they were meant to merely delay the inevitable American advance inland.

Unlike the Japanese, who drastically altered their tactics for the upcoming battle, the American invasion plan was unchanged from that of previous amphibious landings, even after suffering 3,000 casualties and two months of delaying tactics against the entrenched Japanese defenders at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Biak">Battle of Biak</a>. On Peleliu, American planners chose to land on the southwest beaches because of their proximity to the airfield on South Peleliu. The <a href="1st%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Regiment</a>, commanded by Colonel <a href="Chesty%20Puller">Lewis B. Puller</a>, was to land on the northern end of the beaches. The <a href="5th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th Marine Regiment</a>, under Colonel <a href="Harold%20D.%20Harris">Harold D. Harris</a>, would land in the center, and the <a href="7th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">7th Marine Regiment</a>, under Col. <a href="Herman%20Hanneken">Herman H. Hanneken</a>, would land at the southern end.

The division's artillery regiment, the <a href="11th%20Marine%20Regiment">11th Marines</a>, would land after the <a href="infantry">infantry</a> regiments. The plan was for the 1st and 7th Marines to push inland, guarding the 5th Marines left and right flank, and allowing them to capture the airfield located directly to the center of the landing beaches. The 5th Marines were to push to the eastern shore, cutting the island in half. The 1st Marines would push north into the Umurbrogol, while the 7th Marines would clear the southern end of the island. Only one battalion was left behind in reserve, with the U.S. Army's 81st Infantry Division available for support from Angaur, just south of Peleliu.

On September 4, the Marines shipped off from their station on <a href="Pavuvu">Pavuvu</a>, just north of <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>, a trip across the Pacific to Peleliu. A U.S. Navy's <a href="Underwater%20Demolition%20Team">Underwater Demolition Team</a> went in first to clear the beaches of obstacles, while <a href="United%20States%20Navy">Navy</a> warships began their pre-invasion bombardment of Peleliu on September 12.

The <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s , , , and , <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s , , and , and <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s , and , led by the command ship , subjected the tiny island, only in size, to a massive three-day bombardment, pausing only to permit air strikes from the three <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s, five <a href="light%20aircraft%20carrier">light aircraft carrier</a>s, and eleven <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s with the attack force. A total of 519 rounds of shells, 1,845 rounds of shells and 1,793 bombs were dropped on the islands during this period.

The Americans believed the bombardment to be successful, as <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Jesse%20Oldendorf">Jesse Oldendorf</a> claimed that the Navy had run out of targets. In reality, the majority of the Japanese positions were completely unharmed. Even the battalion left to defend the beaches was virtually unscathed. During the assault, the island's defenders exercised unusual firing discipline to avoid giving away their positions. The bombardment managed only to destroy Japan's aircraft on the island, as well as the buildings surrounding the airfield. The Japanese remained in their fortified positions, ready to attack the American landing troops.

U.S. Marines landed on Peleliu at 08:32, on September 15, the 1st Marines to the north on White Beach 1 and 2 and the 5th and 7th Marines to the center and south on Orange Beach 1, 2, and 3. As the other landing craft approached the beaches, the Marines were caught in a crossfire when the Japanese opened the steel doors guarding their positions and fired artillery. The positions on the coral promontories guarding each flank fired on the Marines with 47-mm guns and 20-mm cannons. By 09:30, the Japanese had destroyed 60 <a href="Landing%20Vehicle%20Tracked">LVT</a>s and <a href="DUKW">DUKW</a>s.
The 1st Marines were quickly bogged down by heavy fire from the extreme left flank and a 30-foot-high coral ridge, "The Point". Colonel <a href="Chesty%20Puller">Chesty Puller</a> narrowly escaped death when a dud high velocity artillery round struck his LVT. His communications section was destroyed on its way to the beach by a hit from a 47-mm round. The 7th Marines faced a cluttered Orange Beach 3, with natural and man-made obstacles, forcing the <a href="Amtrac">Amtrac</a>s to approach in column.

The 5th Marines made the most progress on the first day, aided by cover provided by coconut groves. They pushed toward the airfield, but were met with Nakagawa's first counterattack. His armored tank company raced across the airfield to push the Marines back, but was soon engaged by tanks, howitzers, naval guns and dive bombers. Nakagawa's tanks and escorting infantrymen were quickly destroyed.

At the end of the first day, the Americans held their stretch of landing beaches, but little else. Their biggest push in the south moved inland, but the 1st Marines to the north made very little progress because of the extremely thick resistance. The Marines had suffered 200 dead and 900 wounded. Rupertus, still unaware of his enemy's change of tactics, believed the Japanese would quickly crumble since their perimeter had been broken.

The 7th Marines were in need of stretcher bearers for the wounded and sent three men to find help. They found two units, the 16th Marine Field Depot and 17th (special) Seabees. They were not certain what their officers would think because both were segregated units but they knew they needed help. The 17th Seabees were assigned to the 1st Pioneers as shore party. They carried the wounded, buried the dead, reinforced the line where directed, provided a crew for a 37mm gun, and volunteered for anything. On the first night nearly the entire battalion humped ammo to the front and it is written that they remained there several days. For their efforts they received an official a "Well Done". The 33rd NCB also had 202 men assigned to the shore party.

On the second day, the 5th Marines moved to capture the airfield and push toward the eastern shore. They ran across the airfield, enduring heavy artillery fire from the highlands to the north, suffering heavy casualties in the process. After capturing the airfield, they rapidly advanced to the eastern end of Peleliu, leaving the island's southern defenders to be destroyed by the 7th Marines.

This area was hotly contested by the Japanese, who still occupied numerous pillboxes. Heat indices were around , and the Marines soon suffered high casualties from <a href="heat%20exhaustion">heat exhaustion</a>. Further complicating the situation, the Marines' water was distributed in empty oil drums, contaminating the water with the oil residue. Still, by the eighth day the 5th and 7th Marines had accomplished their objectives, holding the airfield and the southern portion of the island, although the airfield remained under threat of sustained Japanese fire from the heights of Umurbrogol Mountain until the end of the battle.

American forces put the airfield to use on the third day. <a href="L-2%20Grasshopper">L-2 Grasshopper</a>s from <a href="VMO-1">VMO-1</a> began <a href="Aerial%20observer">aerial spotting</a> missions for Marine artillery and <a href="naval%20gunfire%20support">naval gunfire support</a>. On September 26 (D+11), Marine <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">F4U Corsair</a>s from <a href="VMF-114">VMF-114</a> landed on the airstrip. The Corsairs began <a href="dive-bombing">dive-bombing</a> missions across Peleliu, firing rockets into open cave entrances for the infantrymen, and dropping <a href="napalm">napalm</a>; it was only the second time the latter weapon had been used in the Pacific. Napalm proved useful, burning away the vegetation hiding <a href="spider%20hole">spider hole</a>s and usually killing their occupants.

The time from liftoff to the target area for the Corsairs based on Peleliu Airfield was very short, sometimes only 10 to 15 seconds. Consequently, there was almost no time for pilots to raise their aircraft undercarriage; most pilots did not bother and left them down during the air strike. After the air strike was completed and the payload dropped, the Corsair simply turned back into the landing pattern again.

The <a href="fortress">fortress</a> at the end of the southern landing beaches (a.k.a. “The Point”) continued to cause heavy Marine casualties due to enfilading fire from Japanese heavy machine guns and <a href="Anti-tank%20warfare">anti-tank</a> artillery across the landing beaches. Puller ordered <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">Captain</a> George P. Hunt, commander of K Company, <a href="3rd%20Battalion%201st%20Marines">3rd Battalion, 1st Marines</a>, to capture the position. Hunt's company approached The Point short on supplies, having lost most of its machine guns while approaching the beaches. Hunt's second <a href="platoon">platoon</a> was pinned down for nearly a day in an <a href="anti-tank%20trench">anti-tank trench</a> between <a href="fortification">fortification</a>s. The rest of his <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> was endangered when the Japanese cut a hole in their line, surrounding his company and leaving his right flank cut off.

However, a <a href="rifle%20platoon">rifle platoon</a> began knocking out the Japanese gun positions one by one. Using <a href="smoke%20grenade">smoke grenade</a>s for cover, the platoon swept through each hole, destroying the positions with <a href="rifle%20grenade">rifle grenade</a>s and <a href="Close%20combat">close-quarters combat</a>. After knocking out the six machine gun positions, the Marines faced the 47 mm gun cave. A <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> blinded the 47 mm gunner's visibility with a smoke grenade, allowing <a href="Corporal">Corporal</a> <a href="Henry%20W.%20Hahn">Henry W. Hahn</a> to launch a grenade through the cave's aperture. The grenade detonated the 47 mm's shells, forcing the cave's occupants out with their bodies lit aflame as well as their ammunition belts exploding around their waists. A Marine fire team was positioned on the flank of the cave where the former occupants were shot down.

K Company had captured The Point, but Nakagawa <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a>ed. The next 30 hours saw four major counterattacks against a sole company, critically low on <a href="materiel">supplies</a>, out of water, and surrounded. The <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a> soon had to resort to <a href="hand-to-hand%20combat">hand-to-hand combat</a> to fend off the Japanese attackers. By the time <a href="reinforcement">reinforcement</a>s arrived, the company had successfully repulsed all of the Japanese attacks, but had been reduced to 18 men, suffering 157 casualties during the battle for The Point. Hunt and Hahn were both awarded the <a href="Navy%20Cross">Navy Cross</a> for their actions.

The 5th Marines—after having secured the airfield—were sent to capture Ngesebus Island, just north of Peleliu. Ngesebus was occupied by many Japanese artillery positions, and was the site of an airfield still under construction. The tiny island was connected to Peleliu by a small causeway, but 5th Marines commander Harris opted instead to make a shore-to-shore amphibious landing, predicting the causeway to be an obvious target for the island's defenders.

Harris coordinated a pre-landing bombardment of the island on September 28, carried out by Army guns, naval guns, howitzers from the <a href="11th%20Marine%20Regiment">11th Marines</a>, strafing runs from VMF-114's Corsairs, and fire from the approaching LVTs. Unlike the Navy's bombardment of Peleliu, Harris' assault on Ngesebus successfully killed most of the Japanese defenders. The Marines still faced opposition in the ridges and caves, but the island fell quickly, with relatively light casualties for the 5th Marines. They had suffered 15 killed and 33 wounded, and inflicted 470 casualties on the Japanese.

After capturing The Point, the 1st Marines moved north into the Umurbrogol pocket, named "Bloody Nose Ridge" by the Marines. Puller led his men in numerous assaults, but every one brought on severe casualties by the Japanese. The 1st Marines were trapped within the narrow paths between the ridges, with each ridge fortification supporting the other with deadly crossfire.
The Marines took increasingly high casualties as they slowly advanced through the ridges. The Japanese again showed unusual fire discipline, striking only when they could inflict maximum casualties. As casualties mounted, Japanese <a href="sniper">sniper</a>s began to take aim at <a href="stretcher">stretcher</a> bearers, knowing that if two stretcher bearers were injured or killed, more would have to return to replace them, and the snipers could steadily pick off more and more Marines. The Japanese infiltrated the American lines at night to attack the Marines in their fighting holes. The Marines built two-man fighting holes, so one Marine could sleep while the other kept watch for infiltrators.

One particularly bloody battle on Bloody Nose came when the <a href="1st%20Battalion%201st%20Marines">1st Battalion, 1st Marines</a>—under the command of <a href="Major">Major</a> <a href="Ray%20Davis%20%28U.S.%20Marine%29">Raymond Davis</a>—attacked Hill 100. Over six days of fighting, the battalion suffered 71% casualties. <a href="Everett%20P.%20Pope">Captain Everett Pope</a> and his company penetrated deep into the ridges, leading his remaining 90 men to seize what he thought was Hill 100. It took a day's fighting to reach what he thought was the crest of the hill, which was in fact another ridge occupied by more Japanese defenders.
Trapped at the base of the ridge, Captain Pope set up a small defense perimeter, which was attacked relentlessly by the Japanese throughout the night. The Marines soon ran out of ammunition, and had to fight the attackers with knives and fists, even resorting to throwing coral rock and empty ammunition boxes at the Japanese. Pope and his men managed to hold out until dawn came, which brought on more deadly fire. When they evacuated the position, only nine men remained. Pope later received the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> for the action. <a href="http%3A//static.panoramio.com/photos/large/81326046.jpg">(Picture of the Peleliu Memorial dedicated on the 50th anniversary of the landing on Peleliu with Captain Pope's name)</a>

The Japanese eventually inflicted 70% casualties on Puller's 1st Marines, or 1,749 men. After six days of fighting in the ridges of Umurbrogol, <a href="General">General</a> <a href="Roy%20Geiger">Roy Geiger</a>, commander of the III Amphibious Corps, sent elements of U.S. Army's 81st Infantry Division to Peleliu to relieve the regiment. The <a href="321st%20Regiment%20Combat%20Team">321st Regiment Combat Team</a> landed on the western beaches of Peleliu—at the northern end of Umurbrogol mountain—on 23 September. The 321st and the 7th Marines encircled The Pocket by 24 Sept., D+9.

By 15 October, the 7th Marines had suffered 46% casualties and General Geiger relieved them with the 5th Marines. Col. Harris adopted siege tactics, using bulldozers and flame-thrower tanks, pushing from the north. On October 30, the 81st Infantry Division took over command of Peleliu, taking another six weeks, with the same tactics, to reduce The Pocket.

On 24 November, Nakagawa proclaimed "Our sword is broken and we have run out of spears". He then burnt his regimental colors and performed <a href="seppuku">ritual suicide</a>. He was posthumously promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant general</a> for his valor displayed on Peleliu. On 27 November, the island was declared secure, ending the 73-day-long battle.

A <a href="Japanese%20holdout%231945-1949">Japanese lieutenant</a> with twenty-six 2nd Infantry soldiers and eight 45th Guard Force sailors held out in the caves in Peleliu until April 22, 1947 and surrendered after a Japanese admiral convinced them the war was over.

The reduction of the Japanese pocket around Umurbrogol mountain has been called the most difficult fight that the U.S. military encountered in the entire war. The 1st Marine Division was severely mauled and it remained out of action until the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">invasion of Okinawa</a> began on April 1, 1945. In total, the 1st Marine Division suffered over 6,500 casualties during their month on Peleliu, over of their entire division. The 81st Infantry Division also suffered heavy losses with 3,300 casualties during their tenure on the island.

Postwar statisticians calculated that it took U.S. forces over 1500 rounds of ammunition to kill each Japanese defender, and that during the course of the battle, the Americans expended 13.32 million rounds of 30-calibre, 1.52 million rounds of 45-calibre, 693,657 rounds of 50-calibre bullets, 118,262 hand grenades, and approximately 150,000 mortar rounds.

The battle was controversial in the United States due to the island's lack of strategic value and the high casualty rate. The defenders lacked the means to interfere with potential US operations in the Philippines, and the airfield captured on Peleliu never played a key role in subsequent operations. The high casualty rate exceeded all other amphibious operations during the Pacific War.

Instead, the <a href="Ulithi%20Atoll">Ulithi Atoll</a> in the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> was used as a staging base for the invasion of Okinawa. In addition, few news reports were published about the battle because Rupertus' prediction of a "three days" victory motivated only six reporters to report from shore. The battle was also overshadowed by MacArthur's <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte">return to the Philippines</a> and the Allies' push towards <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> in <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Europe</a>.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20Angaur">battles for Angaur</a> and Peleliu showed Americans the pattern of future Japanese island defense which would be seen again at <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a> and Okinawa. Naval bombardment prior to amphibious assault at Iwo Jima was only slightly more effective than at Peleliu, but at Okinawa the preliminary shelling was much improved. <a href="Frogmen">Frogmen</a> performing <a href="underwater%20demolition">underwater demolition</a> at Iwo Jima confused the enemy by sweeping both coasts, but later alerted Japanese defenders to the exact assault beaches at Okinawa. American ground forces at Peleliu gained experience in assaulting heavily fortified positions such as they would find again at Okinawa.

On the recommendation of Admiral <a href="William%20F.%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William F. Halsey, Jr.</a>, the planned occupation of <a href="Yap">Yap</a> Island in the Caroline Islands was canceled. Halsey actually recommended that the landings on Peleliu and Angaur be canceled, too, and their Marines and soldiers be thrown into <a href="Leyte%20Island">Leyte Island</a> instead, but was overruled by Nimitz.

The Battle of Peleliu is featured in many World War II themed video games including "". The player takes the role of a US Marine forced to take Peleliu Airfield, repel counter-attacks, destroy machine-gun and mortar positions and eventually secure Japanese artillery emplacements at the point. In flight-simulation game "<a href="War%20Thunder">War Thunder</a>", two teams of players clash to hold the southern and northern airfields. In multi-player shooter "<a href="Rising%20Storm%20%28video%20game%29">Red Orchestra 2: Rising Storm</a>", a team of American troops attack the defensive Japanese team's control points.

The battle including footage and stills are featured in the fifth episode of "<a href="The%20War%20%282007%20film%29">Ken Burns' The War</a>".

The battle features in Episodes 5, 6 and 7 of the TV mini-series "<a href="The%20Pacific%20%28TV%20miniseries%29">The Pacific</a>".

In his book, 'With the Old Breed,' Eugene Bondurant Sledge described his experiences in the battle for Peleliu.

In 2015, the Japanese magazine "<a href="Young%20Animal%20%28magazine%29">Young Animal</a>" commenced serialization of "Peleliu: Rakuen no Guernica" by Masao Hiratsuka and artist Kazuyoshi Takeda, telling the story of the battle in <a href="manga">manga</a> form.

One of the final scenes in "Parer's War", a 2014 Australian television film, shows the Battle of Peleliu recorded by <a href="Damien%20Parer">Damien Parer</a> with his camera at the time of his death.

Battle of Stalingrad

The Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943) was a major battle of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in which <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and its allies fought the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> for control of the city of <a href="Volgograd">Stalingrad</a> (now <a href="Volgograd">Volgograd</a>) in <a href="Southern%20Russia">Southern Russia</a>.

Marked by fierce <a href="close%20quarters%20combat">close quarters combat</a> and direct assaults on civilians by <a href="Luftwaffe">air raids</a>, it is often regarded as one of the single largest (nearly 2.2 million personnel) and <a href="List%20of%20battles%20by%20casualties">bloodiest</a> (1.7–2 million wounded, killed or captured) battles in the history of warfare. It was an extremely costly defeat for German forces, and the Army High Command had to withdraw vast military forces from the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">West</a> to replace their losses.

The German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in August 1942, using the <a href="6th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German 6th Army</a> and elements of the <a href="4th%20Panzer%20Army">4th Panzer Army</a>. The attack was supported by intensive "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into <a href="Urban%20warfare">house-to-house fighting</a>, and both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the <a href="Volga%20River">Volga River</a>.

On 19 November 1942, the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> launched <a href="Operation%20Uranus">Operation Uranus</a>, a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romanian</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920-1946%29">Hungarian</a> armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks. The <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was <a href="encirclement">cut off and surrounded</a> in the Stalingrad area. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food. The remaining units of the 6th Army surrendered. The battle lasted five months, one week, and three days.

By the spring of 1942, despite the failure of <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> to decisively defeat the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in a single campaign, the Wehrmacht had captured vast expanses of territory, including Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic republics. Elsewhere, the war had been progressing well: the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">U-boat offensive</a> in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> had been very successful and <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Rommel</a> had just captured <a href="Tobruk%23Capture%20of%20Tobruk">Tobruk</a>. In the east, they had stabilized their front in a line running from <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a> in the north to <a href="Rostov-on-Don">Rostov</a> in the south. There were a number of <a href="Salient%20%28territory%29">salients</a>, but these were not particularly threatening. Hitler was confident that he could master the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> after the winter of 1942, because even though <a href="Army%20Group%20Centre">Army Group Centre</a> ("Heeresgruppe Mitte") had suffered heavy losses west of <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> the previous winter, 65% of Army Group Centre's infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re-equipped. Neither Army Group North nor Army Group South had been particularly hard pressed over the winter. Stalin was expecting the main thrust of the German summer attacks to be directed against Moscow again.

With the initial operations being very successful, the Germans decided that their summer campaign in 1942 would be directed at the southern parts of the Soviet Union. The initial objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the <a href="Volga%20River">Volga River</a>. The river was a key route from the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic. The Germans cut the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July. The capture of Stalingrad would make the delivery of <a href="Lend%20Lease">Lend Lease</a> supplies via the <a href="Persian%20Corridor">Persian Corridor</a> much more difficult.

On 23 July 1942, Hitler personally rewrote the operational objectives for the 1942 campaign, greatly expanding them to include the occupation of the city of Stalingrad. Both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city based on it bearing the name of the leader of the Soviet Union. Hitler proclaimed that after Stalingrad's capture, its male citizens were to be killed and all women and children were to be deported because its population was "thoroughly communistic" and "especially dangerous". It was assumed that the fall of the city would also firmly secure the northern and western flanks of the German armies as they advanced on <a href="Baku">Baku</a>, with the aim of securing these strategic petroleum resources for Germany. The expansion of objectives was a significant factor in Germany's failure at Stalingrad, caused by German overconfidence and an underestimation of Soviet reserves.

The Soviets realized that they were under tremendous constraints of time and resources and ordered that anyone strong enough to hold a rifle be sent to fight.

<a href="Army%20Group%20South">Army Group South</a> was selected for a sprint forward through the southern Russian <a href="steppe">steppe</a>s into the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> to capture the vital Soviet <a href="oil%20field">oil field</a>s <a href="Petroleum%20industry%20in%20Azerbaijan%23World%20War%20II">there</a>. The planned summer offensive was <a href="Code%20name">code-named</a> "Fall Blau" (<a href="Case%20Blue">Case Blue</a>). It was to include the German <a href="6th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">6th</a>, <a href="17th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">17th</a>, <a href="German%20Fourth%20Panzer%20Army">4th Panzer</a> and <a href="1st%20Panzer%20Army">1st Panzer</a> Armies. Army Group South had overrun the <a href="Ukrainian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> in 1941. Poised in Eastern <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, it was to spearhead the offensive.

Hitler intervened, however, ordering the <a href="Army%20Group">Army Group</a> to split in two. Army Group South (A), under the command of <a href="Wilhelm%20List">Wilhelm List</a>, was to continue advancing south towards the Caucasus as planned with the 17th Army and First Panzer Army. Army Group South (B), including <a href="Friedrich%20Paulus">Friedrich Paulus</a>'s 6th Army and <a href="Hermann%20Hoth">Hermann Hoth</a>'s 4th Panzer Army, was to move east towards the Volga and Stalingrad. <a href="Army%20Group%20B">Army Group B</a> was commanded initially by <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Fedor%20von%20Bock">Fedor von Bock</a> and later by General <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Weichs">Maximilian von Weichs</a>.
The start of "Case Blue" had been planned for late May 1942. A number of German and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romanian</a> units that were to take part in "Blau", however, were <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281942%29">besieging Sevastopol</a> on the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimean Peninsula</a>. Delays in ending the siege pushed back the start date for "Blau" several times, and the city did not fall until the end of June.

Operation Fridericus I by the Germans against the "Isium bulge", pinched off the Soviet <a href="Salient%20%28military%29">salient</a> in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Kharkov">Second Battle of Kharkov</a>, and resulted in the <a href="envelopment">envelopment</a> of a large Soviet force between 17 May and 29 May. Similarly, Operation Wilhelm attacked Voltshansk on 13 June and Operation Fridericus attacked Kupiansk on 22 June.

"Blau" finally opened as Army Group South began its attack into southern Russia on 28 June 1942. The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units <a href="flanking%20maneuver">outflanked</a> them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around <a href="Millerovo">Millerovo</a>, <a href="Rostov%20Oblast">Rostov Oblast</a>, a week later. Meanwhile, the <a href="Second%20Army%20%28Hungary%29">Hungarian 2nd Army</a> and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an <a href="Battle%20of%20Voronezh%20%281942%29">assault on Voronezh</a>, capturing the city on 5 July.
The initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive <a href="traffic%20jam">traffic jam</a> resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.

By the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the <a href="Don%20River%2C%20Russia">Don River</a>. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers were only apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don, which had important implications later in the course of the battle. The Germans began using the armies of their <a href="Italian%20war%20in%20Soviet%20Union%2C%201941-1943">Italian</a>, Hungarian and <a href="Romanian%20Armies%20in%20the%20Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Romanian</a> allies to guard their left (northern) flank. The Italians won several accolades in official German communiques. Sometimes they were held in little regard by the Germans, and were even accused of having low morale: in reality, the Italian divisions fought comparatively well, with the <a href="3rd%20Mountain%20Infantry%20Division%20Ravenna">3rd Mountain Infantry Division Ravenna</a> and <a href="5th%20Infantry%20Division%20Cosseria">5th Infantry Division Cosseria</a> proving to have good morale, according to a German liaison officer and being forced to retreat only after a massive armoured attack in which German reinforcements had failed to arrive in time, according to a German historian. Indeed the Italians distinguished themselves in numerous battles, as in the <a href="battle%20of%20Nikolayevka">battle of Nikolayevka</a>.
On 25 July the Germans faced stiff resistance with a Soviet bridgehead west of <a href="Battle%20of%20Kalach">Kalach</a>. "We had had to pay a high cost in men and material...left on the Kalatch battlefield were numerous burnt-out or shot-up German tanks."

The Germans formed bridgeheads across the Don on 20 Aug. with the 295th and 76th Infantry Divisions, enabling the XIVth Panzer Corps "to thrust to the Volga north of Stalingrad." The German 6th Army was only a few dozen kilometers from Stalingrad. The 4th Panzer Army, ordered south on 13 July to block the Soviet retreat "weakened by the 17th Army and the 1st Panzer Army", had turned northwards to help take the city from the south.

To the south, <a href="Army%20Group%20A">Army Group A</a> was pushing far into the Caucasus, but their advance slowed as supply lines grew overextended. The two German army groups were not positioned to support one another due to the great distances involved.

After German intentions became clear in July 1942, Stalin appointed <a href="Marshal%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Marshal</a> <a href="Andrey%20Yeryomenko">Andrey Yeryomenko</a> as commander of the Southeastern Front on 1 August 1942. Yeryomenko and <a href="Commissar">Commissar</a> <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> were tasked with planning the defense of Stalingrad. The eastern border of Stalingrad was the wide River Volga, and over the river, additional Soviet units were deployed. These units became the newly formed 62nd Army, which Yeryomenko placed under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Vasily%20Chuikov">Vasiliy Chuikov</a> on 11 September 1942. The situation was extremely dire. When asked how he interpreted his task, he responded "We will defend the city or die in the attempt." The 62nd Army's mission was to defend Stalingrad at all costs. Chuikov's generalship during the battle earned him one of his two <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a> awards.

<a href="David%20Glantz">David Glantz</a> <a href="Secrets%20of%20the%20Dead%23Season%209%20%282009%20%E2%80%93%202010%29">indicated</a> that four hard-fought battles – collectively known as the Kotluban Operations – north of Stalingrad, where the Soviets made their greatest stand, decided Germany's fate before the Nazis ever set foot in the city itself, and were a turning point in the war. Beginning in late August, continuing in September and into October, the Soviets committed between two and four armies in hastily coordinated and poorly controlled attacks against the German's northern flank. The actions resulted in more than 200,000 Red Army casualties but did slow the German assault.

On 23 August the 6th Army reached the outskirts of Stalingrad in pursuit of the <a href="62nd%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">62nd</a> and 64th Armies, which had fallen back into the city. <a href="Paul%20Ludwig%20Ewald%20von%20Kleist">Kleist</a> later said after the war:

The Soviets had enough warning of the Germans' advance to ship grain, cattle, and railway cars across the Volga and out of harm's way but most civilian residents were not evacuated. This "harvest victory" left the city short of food even before the German attack began. Before the "<a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">Heer</a>" reached the city itself, the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" had rendered the River Volga, vital for bringing supplies into the city, unusable to Soviet shipping. Between 25 and 31 July, 32 Soviet ships were sunk, with another nine crippled.
The battle began with the heavy bombing of the city by "Generaloberst" <a href="Wolfram%20von%20Richthofen">Wolfram von Richthofen</a>'s "<a href="Luftflotte%204">Luftflotte 4</a>", which in the summer and autumn of 1942 was the single most powerful air <a href="formation%20%28military%29">formation</a> in the world. Some 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped in 48 hours, more than in London at the height of the Blitz. Stalin refused to evacuate civilian population from the city, so when bombing began 400,000 civilians were trapped within city boundaries. The exact number of civilians killed during the course of the battle is unknown but was most likely very high.
Around 40,000 were moved to Germany as slave workers, some fled the city during battle and a small number were evacuated by the Soviets. In February 1943 only between 10,000 to 60,000 civilians were still alive in Stalingrad. Much of the city was quickly turned to rubble, although some factories continued production while workers joined in the fighting. The Stalingrad Tractor Factory continued to turn out T-34 tanks literally until German troops burst into the plant. The <a href="369th%20%28Croatian%29%20Reinforced%20Infantry%20Regiment">369th (Croatian) Reinforced Infantry Regiment</a> was the only non-German unit selected by the "Wehrmacht" to enter Stalingrad city during assault operations. It fought as part of the 100th Jäger Division.
Stalin rushed all available troops to the east bank of the Volga, some from as far away as <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. All the regular ferries were quickly destroyed by the Luftwaffe, which then targeted troop barges being towed slowly across the river by tugs. It has been said that Stalin prevented civilians from leaving the city in the belief that their presence would encourage greater resistance from the city's defenders. Civilians, including women and children, were put to work building <a href="trench">trench</a>works and protective fortifications. A massive German air raid on 23 August caused a <a href="firestorm">firestorm</a>, killing hundreds and turning Stalingrad into a vast landscape of rubble and burnt ruins. Ninety percent of the living space in the Voroshilovskiy area was destroyed. Between 23 and 26 August, Soviet reports indicate 955 people were killed and another 1,181 wounded as a result of the bombing. Casualties of 40,000 were greatly exaggerated, and after 25 August, the Soviets did not record any civilian and military casualties as a result of air raids.

The <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a>, the "Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily" (VVS), was swept aside by the Luftwaffe. The VVS bases in the immediate area lost 201 aircraft between 23 and 31 August, and despite meager reinforcements of some 100 aircraft in August, it was left with just 192 serviceable aircraft, 57 of which were fighters. The Soviets continued to pour aerial reinforcements into the Stalingrad area in late September, but continued to suffer appalling losses; the "Luftwaffe" had complete control of the skies.
The burden of the initial defense of the city fell on the <a href="1077th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment">1077th Anti-Aircraft Regiment</a>, a unit made up mainly of young female volunteers who had no training for engaging ground targets. Despite this, and with no support available from other units, the AA gunners stayed at their posts and took on the advancing panzers. The <a href="German%2016th%20Panzer%20Division">German 16th Panzer Division</a> reportedly had to fight the 1077th's gunners "shot for shot" until all 37 anti-aircraft guns were destroyed or overrun. The 16th Panzer was shocked to find that, due to Soviet manpower shortages, it had been fighting female soldiers. In the early stages of the battle, the NKVD organized poorly armed "Workers' <a href="militia">militia</a>s" composed of civilians not directly involved in war production for immediate use in the battle. The civilians were often sent into battle without rifles. Staff and students from the local technical university formed a "tank destroyer" unit. They assembled tanks from leftover parts at the tractor factory. These tanks, unpainted and lacking gunsights, were driven directly from the factory floor to the front line. They could only be aimed at <a href="point-blank%20range">point-blank range</a> through the gun barrel.

By the end of August, Army Group South (B) had finally reached the Volga, north of Stalingrad. Another advance to the river south of the city followed, while the Soviets abandoned their Rossoshka position for the inner defensive ring west of Stalingrad. The wings of the 6th Army and the 4th Panzer Army met near Jablotchni along the Zaritza on 2 Sept. By 1 September, the Soviets could only reinforce and supply their forces in Stalingrad by perilous crossings of the Volga under constant bombardment by artillery and aircraft.

On 5 September, the Soviet 24th and <a href="66th%20Army">66th</a> Armies organized a massive attack against <a href="XIV%20Panzer%20Corps">XIV Panzer Corps</a>. The "Luftwaffe" helped repulse the offensive by heavily attacking Soviet artillery positions and defensive lines. The Soviets were forced to withdraw at midday after only a few hours. Of the 120 tanks the Soviets had committed, 30 were lost to air attack.
Soviet operations were constantly hampered by the "Luftwaffe". On 18 September, the Soviet <a href="1st%20Guards%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">1st Guards</a> and <a href="24th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">24th Army</a> launched an offensive against VIII Army Corps at Kotluban. "<a href="8th%20Air%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">VIII. Fliegerkorps</a>" dispatched wave after wave of <a href="Stuka">Stuka</a> dive-bombers to prevent a breakthrough. The offensive was repulsed. The Stukas claimed 41 of the 106 Soviet tanks knocked out that morning, while escorting <a href="Bf%20109">Bf 109</a>s destroyed 77 Soviet aircraft.
Amid the debris of the wrecked city, the Soviet <a href="62nd%20Army">62nd</a> and 64th <a href="Army%20%28Soviet%20Army%29">Armies</a>, which included the Soviet <a href="13th%20Guards%20Rifle%20Division">13th Guards Rifle Division</a>, anchored their defense lines with strongpoints in houses and factories.
Fighting within the ruined city was fierce and desperate. Lieutenant General <a href="Alexander%20Rodimtsev">Alexander Rodimtsev</a> was in charge of the 13th Guards Rifle Division, and received one of two <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Heroes of the Soviet Union</a> awarded during the battle for his actions. Stalin's <a href="Order%20No.%20227">Order No. 227</a> of 27 July 1942 decreed that all commanders who ordered unauthorized retreat would be subject to a military tribunal. However, it was the <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> that ordered the regular army and lectured them, on the need to show some guts. Through brutal coercion for self-sacrifice, thousands of deserters and presumed malingerers were captured or executed to discipline the troops. At Stalingrad, it is estimated that 14,000 soldiers of the Red Army were executed in order to keep the formation. "<a href="Order%20No.%20227">Not a step back</a>!" and "There is no land behind the Volga!" were the slogans. The Germans pushing forward into Stalingrad suffered heavy casualties.

By 12 September, at the time of their retreat into the city, the Soviet 62nd Army had been reduced to 90 tanks, 700 mortars and just 20,000 personnel. The remaining tanks were used as immobile strongpoints within the city. The initial German attack attempted to take the city in a rush. One infantry division went after the <a href="Mamayev%20Kurgan">Mamayev Kurgan</a> hill, one attacked the central rail station and one attacked toward the central landing stage on the Volga.
Though initially successful, the German attacks stalled in the face of Soviet reinforcements brought in from across the Volga. The Soviet <a href="13th%20Guards%20Rifle%20Division">13th Guards Rifle Division</a>, assigned to counterattack at the Mamayev Kurgan and at Railway Station No. 1 suffered particularly heavy losses. Over 30 percent of its soldiers were killed in the first 24 hours, and just 320 out of the original 10,000 survived the entire battle. Both objectives were retaken, but only temporarily. The railway station changed hands 14 times in six hours. By the following evening, the 13th Guards Rifle Division had ceased to exist.

Combat raged for three days at the giant grain elevator in the south of the city. About fifty Red Army defenders, cut off from resupply, held the position for five days and fought off ten different assaults before running out of ammunition and water. Only forty dead Soviet fighters were found, though the Germans had thought there were many more due to the intensity of resistance. The Soviets burned large amounts of grain during their retreat in order to deny the enemy food. Paulus chose the grain elevator and silos as the symbol of Stalingrad for a patch he was having designed to commemorate the battle after a German victory.
German <a href="military%20doctrine">military doctrine</a> was based on the principle of <a href="Combined%20arms">combined-arms teams</a> and close cooperation between tanks, infantry, <a href="Military%20engineer">engineers</a>, artillery and <a href="Ground%20attack%20aircraft">ground-attack aircraft</a>. Some Soviet commanders adopted the tactic of always keeping their front-line positions as close to the Germans as physically possible; Chuikov called this "hugging" the Germans. This slowed the German advance and reduced the effectiveness of the German advantage in supporting fire.

The Red Army gradually adopted a strategy to hold for as long as possible all the ground in the city. Thus, they converted multi-floored apartment blocks, factories, warehouses, street corner residences and office buildings into a series of well defended strongpoints with small 5–10 man units. Manpower in the city was constantly refreshed by bringing additional troops over the Volga. When a position was lost, an immediate attempt was usually made to re-take it with fresh forces.
Bitter fighting raged for every ruin, street, factory, house, basement, and staircase. Even the sewers were the sites of firefights. The Germans, calling this unseen <a href="urban%20warfare">urban warfare</a> "Rattenkrieg" ("Rat War"), bitterly joked about capturing the kitchen but still fighting for the living room and the bedroom. Buildings had to be cleared room by room through the bombed-out debris of residential neighborhoods, office blocks, basements and apartment high-rises. Some of the taller buildings, blasted into roofless shells by earlier German aerial bombardment, saw floor-by-floor, <a href="Close%20combat">close quarters combat</a>, with the Germans and Soviets on alternate levels, firing at each other through holes in the floors.

Fighting on and around <a href="Mamayev%20Kurgan">Mamayev Kurgan</a>, a prominent hill above the city, was particularly merciless; indeed, the position changed hands many times.

In another part of the city, a Soviet <a href="platoon">platoon</a> under the command of Sergeant <a href="Yakov%20Pavlov">Yakov Pavlov</a> fortified a four-story building that oversaw a square 300 meters from the river bank, later called "<a href="Pavlov%27s%20House">Pavlov's House</a>". The soldiers surrounded it with minefields, set up machine-gun positions at the windows and breached the walls in the basement for better communications. The soldiers found about ten Soviet civilians hiding in the basement. They were not relieved, and not significantly reinforced, for two months. The building was labeled "Festung" ("Fortress") on German maps. Sgt. Pavlov was awarded the <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a> for his actions.
The Germans made slow but steady progress through the city. Positions were taken individually, but the Germans were never able to capture the key crossing points along the river bank. By 27 Sept. the Germans occupied the southern portion of the city, but the Soviets held the center and northern part. Most importantly, the Soviets controlled the ferries to their supplies on the east bank of the Volga.
The Germans used airpower, tanks and <a href="heavy%20artillery">heavy artillery</a> to clear the city with varying degrees of success. Toward the end of the battle, the gigantic <a href="railroad%20gun">railroad gun</a> <a href="Dora%20%28artillery%29">nicknamed "Dora"</a> was brought into the area. The Soviets built up a large number of artillery batteries on the east bank of the Volga. This artillery was able to bombard the German positions or at least to provide counter-battery fire.
Snipers on both sides used the ruins to inflict casualties. The most famous <a href="Soviet%20sniper">Soviet sniper</a> in Stalingrad was <a href="Vasily%20Zaytsev">Vasily Zaytsev</a>, with 225 confirmed kills during the battle. Targets were often soldiers bringing up food or water to forward positions. Artillery spotters were an especially prized target for snipers.
A significant historical debate concerns the degree of terror in the Red Army. The British historian <a href="Antony%20Beevor">Antony Beevor</a> noted the "sinister" message from the Stalingrad Front's Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: "The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower" as an example of the sort of coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (later to be renamed <a href="SMERSH">SMERSH</a>). On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun">Verdun</a>, and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self-sacrifice. <a href="Richard%20Overy">Richard Overy</a> addresses the question of just how important the Red Army's coercive methods were to the Soviet war effort compared with other motivational factors such as hatred for the enemy. He argues that, though it is "easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the Soviet army fought because it was forced to fight," to concentrate solely on coercion is nonetheless to "distort our view of the Soviet war effort." After conducting hundreds of interviews with Soviet veterans on the subject of terror on the Eastern Front – and specifically about Order No. 227 ("Not a step back!") at Stalingrad – <a href="Catherine%20Merridale">Catherine Merridale</a> notes that, seemingly paradoxically, "their response was frequently relief." Infantryman Lev Lvovich's explanation, for example, is typical for these interviews; as he recalls, "[i]t was a necessary and important step. We all knew where we stood after we had heard it. And we all – it's true – felt better. Yes, we felt better."
Many women fought on the Soviet side, or were under fire. As General Chuikov acknowledged, "Remembering the defence of Stalingrad, I can't overlook the very important question ... about the role of women in war, in the rear, but also at the front. Equally with men they bore all the burdens of combat life and together with us men, they went all the way to Berlin." At the beginning of the battle there were 75,000 women and girls from the Stalingrad area who had finished military or medical training, and all of whom were to serve in the battle. Women staffed a great many of the anti-aircraft batteries that fought not only the Luftwaffe but German tanks. Soviet nurses not only treated wounded personnel under fire but were involved in the highly dangerous work of bringing wounded soldiers back to the hospitals under enemy fire. Many of the Soviet wireless and telephone operators were women who often suffered heavy casualties when their command posts came under fire. Though women were not usually trained as infantry, many Soviet women fought as machine gunners, mortar operators, and scouts. Women were also snipers at Stalingrad. Three air regiments at Stalingrad were entirely female. At least three women won the title Hero of the Soviet Union while driving tanks at Stalingrad.
For both Stalin and Hitler, Stalingrad became a matter of prestige far beyond its strategic significance. The Soviet command moved units from the Red Army strategic reserve in the Moscow area to the lower Volga, and transferred aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad region.

The strain on both military commanders was immense: Paulus developed an uncontrollable tic in his eye, which eventually afflicted the left side of his face, while Chuikov experienced an outbreak of <a href="eczema">eczema</a> that required him to have his hands completely bandaged. Troops on both sides faced the constant strain of close-range combat.

Determined to crush Soviet resistance, "Luftflotte" 4's "Stukawaffe" flew 900 individual sorties against Soviet positions at the <a href="Volgograd%20Tractor%20Factory">"Dzerzhinskiy" Tractor Factory</a> on 5 October. Several Soviet regiments were wiped out; the entire staff of the Soviet 339th Infantry Regiment was killed the following morning during an air raid.

In mid-October, the "Luftwaffe" intensified its efforts against remaining Red Army positions holding the west bank. "Luftflotte" 4 flew 2,000 sorties on 14 October and of bombs were dropped while German infantry surrounded the three factories. "Stukageschwader" 1, 2, and 77 had largely silenced Soviet artillery on the eastern bank of the Volga before turning their attention to the shipping that was once again trying to reinforce the narrowing Soviet pockets of resistance. The 62nd Army had been cut in two, and, due to intensive air attack on its supply ferries, was receiving much less material support. With the Soviets forced into a strip of land on the western bank of the Volga, over 1,208 "Stuka" missions were flown in an effort to eliminate them.

The "Luftwaffe" retained <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> into November and Soviet daytime aerial resistance was nonexistent. However, the combination of constant air support operations on the German side and the Soviet surrender of the daytime skies began to affect the strategic balance in the air. After flying 20,000 individual sorties, the "Luftwaffe" original strength of 1,600 serviceable aircraft had fallen to 950. The "Kampfwaffe" (bomber force) had been hardest hit, having only 232 out of a force of 480 left. The "VVS" remained qualitatively inferior, but by the time of the Soviet counter-offensive, the "VVS" had reached numerical superiority.
The Soviet bomber force, the "Aviatsiya Dal'nego Deystviya" (<a href="Long%20Range%20Aviation">Long Range Aviation</a>; ADD), having taken crippling losses over the past 18 months, was restricted to flying at night. The Soviets flew 11,317 night sorties over Stalingrad and the Don-bend sector between 17 July and 19 November. These raids caused little damage and were of nuisance value only.

On 8 November, substantial units from "Luftflotte" 4 were withdrawn to combat <a href="Operation%20Torch">the Allied landings in North Africa</a>. The German air arm found itself spread thinly across Europe, struggling to maintain its strength in the other southern sectors of the Soviet-German front. The Soviets began receiving material assistance from the American government under the <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> program. During the last quarter of 1942, the U.S. sent the Soviet Union of explosives and of aviation fuel.

As historian Chris Bellamy notes, the Germans paid a high strategic price for the aircraft sent into Stalingrad: the "Luftwaffe" was forced to divert much of its air strength away from the oil-rich Caucasus, which had been Hitler's original grand-strategic objective.

After three months of slow advance, the Germans finally reached the river banks, capturing 90% of the ruined city and splitting the remaining Soviet forces into two narrow pockets. Ice floes on the Volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the Soviet defenders. Nevertheless, the fighting, especially on the slopes of Mamayev Kurgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city, continued.

Recognizing that German troops were ill prepared for offensive operations during the winter of 1942, and that most of them were redeployed elsewhere on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the <a href="Stavka">Stavka</a> decided to conduct a number of offensive operations between 19 November 1942 and 2 February 1943. These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942–1943 (19 November 1942 – 3 March 1943), which involved some 15 Armies operating on several fronts.

According to Zhukov, "German operational blunders were aggravated by poor intelligence: they failed to spot preparations for the major counter-offensive near Stalingrad where there were 10 field, 1 tank and 4 air armies."

During the siege, the German and allied <a href="Italian%20war%20in%20Soviet%20Union%2C%201941-1943">Italian</a>, Hungarian, and Romanian armies protecting Army Group B's <a href="Flanking%20maneuver">flanks</a> had pressed their <a href="headquarters">headquarters</a> for support. The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and <a href="Voronezh">Voronezh</a>. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where stretches were being defended by a single <a href="platoon">platoon</a>. These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons.

Zhukov states, "Compared with the Germans, the troops of the satellites were not so well armed, less experienced and less efficient, even in defence."

Because of the total focus on the city, the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> forces had neglected for months to consolidate their positions along the natural defensive line of the Don River. The Soviet forces were allowed to retain bridgeheads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These bridgeheads in retrospect presented a serious threat to Army Group B.

Similarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector the front southwest of <a href="Kotelnikovo">Kotelnikovo</a> was held only by the Romanian 4th Army. Beyond that army, a single German division, the <a href="16th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">16th Motorized Infantry</a>, covered 400 km. Paulus had requested permission to "withdraw the 6th Army behind the Don," but was rejected. According to Paulus' comments to Adam, "There is still the order whereby no commander of an army group or an army has the right to relinquish a village, even a trench, without Hitler's consent."

In autumn, the Soviet generals <a href="Georgy%20Zhukov">Georgy Zhukov</a> and <a href="Aleksandr%20Vasilevsky">Aleksandr Vasilevsky</a>, responsible for strategic planning in the Stalingrad area, concentrated forces in the steppes to the north and south of the city. The northern flank was defended by Hungarian and Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes. The natural line of defense, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side. The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons. The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.

During the preparations for the attack, <a href="Marshal%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Marshal</a> Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organization, insisted on a one-week delay in the start date of the planned attack. The operation was code-named "Uranus" and launched in conjunction with <a href="Operation%20Mars">Operation Mars</a>, which was directed at <a href="Army%20Group%20Center">Army Group Center</a>. The plan was similar to the one Zhukov had used to achieve victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Khalkhin%20Gol">Khalkhin Gol</a> three years before, where he had sprung a <a href="pincer%20movement">double envelopment</a> and destroyed the <a href="IJA%2023d%20Division">23rd Division</a> of the Japanese army.

On 19 November 1942, the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> launched Operation Uranus. The attacking Soviet units under the command of Gen. <a href="Nikolay%20Vatutin">Nikolay Vatutin</a> consisted of three complete armies, the <a href="Soviet%20First%20Guards%20Army">1st Guards Army</a>, <a href="5th%20Guards%20Tank%20Army">5th Tank Army</a>, and 21st Army, including a total of 18 infantry <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a>, eight tank <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s, two <a href="Mechanized%20force">motorized</a> brigades, six <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> divisions and one anti-tank brigade. The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, deployed in exposed positions, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the <a href="Romanian%20Third%20Army">Romanian 3rd Army</a>, which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was overrun.

Behind the front lines, no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as <a href="Kalach-na-Donu">Kalach</a>. The response by the "Wehrmacht" was both chaotic and indecisive. Poor weather prevented effective air action against the Soviet offensive.

On 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad against points held by the Romanian <a href="4th%20Army%20Corps%20%28Romania%29">4th Army Corps</a>. The Romanian forces, made up primarily of infantry, were overrun by large numbers of tanks. The Soviet forces raced west and met on 23 November at the town of <a href="Kalach-na-Donu">Kalach</a>, sealing the ring around Stalingrad. The link-up of the Soviet forces, not filmed at the time, was later re-enacted for a <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> film which was shown worldwide.

About 265,000 German, Romanian, and Italian soldiers, the 369th (Croatian) Reinforced Infantry Regiment, and other volunteer subsidiary troops including some 40,000 Soviet conscripts and volunteers fighting for the Germans (Beevor states that one quarter of the sixth army's frontline strength were <a href="Hiwi%20%28volunteer%29">HIWIs</a>, as collaborationists recruited from the ranks of Soviet POWs were called) were surrounded. These Soviet HIWIs remained loyal, knowing the Soviet penalty for helping the Germans was <a href="summary%20execution">summary execution</a>. German strength in the pocket was about 210,000 according to strength breakdowns of the 20 field divisions (average size 9,000) and 100 battalion sized units of the Sixth Army on 19 November 1942. Inside the <a href="Pocket%20%28military%29">pocket</a> (, literally "cauldron"), there were also around 10,000 Soviet civilians and several thousand Soviet soldiers the Germans had taken captive during the battle. Not all of the 6th Army was trapped; 50,000 soldiers were brushed aside outside the pocket. These belonged mostly to the other 2 divisions of the 6th Army between the Italian and Romanian Armies: the 62nd and 298th Infantry Divisions. Of the 210,000 Germans, 10,000 remained to fight on, 105,000 surrendered, 35,000 left by air and the remaining 60,000 died.

<a href="Army%20Group%20Don">Army Group Don</a> was formed under Field Marshal von Manstein. Under his command were the 20 German and 2 Romanian divisions encircled at Stalingrad, Adam's battle groups formed along the <a href="Chir%20River">Chir River</a> and on the Don bridgehead, plus the remains of the Romanian 3rd Army.

The Red Army units immediately formed two defensive fronts: a <a href="circumvallation">circumvallation</a> facing inward and a <a href="contravallation">contravallation</a> facing outward. Field Marshal <a href="Erich%20von%20Manstein">Erich von Manstein</a> advised Hitler not to order the 6th Army to break out, stating that he could break through the Soviet lines and relieve the besieged 6th Army. The American historians <a href="Williamson%20Murray">Williamson Murray</a> and <a href="Alan%20Millet">Alan Millet</a> wrote that it was Manstein's message to Hitler on 24 November advising him that the 6th Army should not break out, along with Göring's statements that the Luftwaffe could supply Stalingrad that "... sealed the fate of the Sixth Army." After 1945, Manstein claimed that he told Hitler that the 6th Army must break out. The American historian <a href="Gerhard%20Weinberg">Gerhard Weinberg</a> wrote that Manstein distorted his record on the matter. Manstein was tasked to conduct a relief operation, named <a href="Operation%20Winter%20Storm">Operation Winter Storm</a> ("Unternehmen Wintergewitter") against Stalingrad, which he thought was feasible if the 6th Army was temporarily supplied through the air.

<a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> had declared in a public speech (in the <a href="Berlin%20Sportpalast">Berlin Sportpalast</a>) on 30 September 1942 that the German army would never leave the city. At a meeting shortly after the Soviet <a href="encirclement">encirclement</a>, German army chiefs pushed for an immediate breakout to a new line on the west of the Don, but Hitler was at his Bavarian retreat of <a href="Obersalzberg">Obersalzberg</a> in <a href="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a> with the head of the "Luftwaffe", <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a>. When asked by Hitler, Göring replied, after being convinced by <a href="Hans%20Jeschonnek">Hans Jeschonnek</a>, that the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> could supply the 6th Army with an "<a href="airbridge%20%28logistics%29">air bridge</a>." This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on temporarily while a relief force was assembled. A similar plan had been used a year earlier at the <a href="Demyansk%20Pocket">Demyansk Pocket</a>, albeit on a much smaller scale: a corps at Demyansk rather than an entire army.
The director of "Luftflotte" 4, <a href="Wolfram%20von%20Richthofen">Wolfram von Richthofen</a>, tried to get this decision overturned. The forces under the 6th Army were almost twice as large as a regular German army unit, plus there was also a corps of the 4th Panzer Army trapped in the pocket. The maximum they could deliver a day – based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at Pitomnik to land at – was far less than the minimum needed. To supplement the limited number of <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2052">Junkers Ju 52</a> transports, the Germans pressed other aircraft into the role, such as the <a href="Heinkel%20He%20177">Heinkel He 177</a> bomber (some bombers performed adequately – the <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a> proved to be quite capable and was much faster than the Ju 52). General Richthofen informed Manstein on 27 November of the small transport capacity of the Luftwaffe and the impossibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air. Manstein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions. The next day he made a six-page situation report to the general staff. Based on the information of the expert Richthofen, he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of Demyansk the permanent supply by air would be impossible. If only a narrow link could be established to Sixth Army, he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the encirclement, and said that the Luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt. He acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice that giving up Stalingrad would mean, but this would be made easier to bear by the conserving the combat power of Sixth Army and regaining the initiative. He ignored the limited mobility of the army and the difficulties of disengaging the Soviets. Hitler reiterated that Sixth Army would stay at Stalingrad and that the air bridge would supply it until the encirclement was broken by a new German offensive.

Supplying the 270,000 men trapped in the "cauldron" required 700 tons of supplies a day. That would mean 350 <a href="Ju52">Ju52</a> flights a day into Pitomnik. At a minimum, 500 tons were required. However, according to Adam, "On not one single day have the minimal essential number of tons of supplies been flown in." The "Luftwaffe" was able to deliver an average of of supplies per day out of an air transport capacity of per day. The most successful day, 19 December, delivered of supplies in 154 flights. The outcome of the airlift was the Luftwaffe's failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft – tools that included airfield facilities, supplies, manpower, and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions. These factors, taken together, prevented the Luftwaffe from effectively employing the full potential of its transport forces, ensuring that they were unable to deliver the quantity of supplies needed to sustain the 6th Army.

In the early parts of the operation, fuel was shipped at a higher priority than food and ammunition because of a belief that there would be a breakout from the city. Transport aircraft also evacuated technical specialists and sick or wounded personnel from the besieged enclave. Sources differ on the number flown out: at least 25,000 to at most 35,000. Carell: 42,000, of which 5000 did not survive.
Initially, supply flights came in from the field at <a href="Tatsinskaya%20Airfield">Tatsinskaya</a>, called 'Tazi' by the German pilots. On 23 December, the Soviet 24th Tank Corps, commanded by Major-General <a href="Vasily%20Badanov">Vasily Mikhaylovich Badanov</a>, reached nearby Skassirskaya and in the early morning of 24 December, <a href="Tatsinskaya%20Raid">the tanks reached Tatsinskaya</a>. Without any soldiers to defend the airfield, it was abandoned under heavy fire; in a little under an hour, 108 Ju 52s and 16 <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2086">Ju 86s</a> took off for <a href="Novocherkassk">Novocherkassk</a> – leaving 72 Ju 52s and many other aircraft burning on the ground. A new base was established some from Stalingrad at <a href="Salsk">Salsk</a>, the additional distance would become another obstacle to the resupply efforts. Salsk was abandoned in turn by mid-January for a rough facility at Zverevo, near Shakhty. The field at Zverevo was attacked repeatedly on 18 January and a further 50 Ju 52s were destroyed. Winter weather conditions, technical failures, heavy Soviet <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft</a> fire and fighter interceptions eventually led to the loss of 488 German aircraft.

In spite of the failure of the German offensive to reach the 6th Army, the air supply operation continued under ever more difficult circumstances. The 6th Army slowly starved. General <a href="Kurt%20Zeitzler">Zeitzler</a>, moved by their plight, began to limit himself to their slim rations at meal times. After a few weeks on such a diet, he had "visibly lost weight", according to <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a>, and Hitler "commanded Zeitler to resume at once taking sufficient nourishment." 

The toll on the "Transportgruppen" was heavy. 160 aircraft were destroyed and 328 were heavily damaged (beyond repair). Some 266 Junkers Ju 52s were destroyed; one-third of the fleet's strength on the Eastern Front. The He 111 "gruppen" lost 165 aircraft in transport operations. Other losses included 42 Ju 86s, 9 <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20200">Fw 200</a> Condors, 5 He 177 bombers and 1 <a href="Junkers%20Ju%20290">Ju 290</a>. The "Luftwaffe" also lost close to 1,000 highly experienced bomber crew personnel. So heavy were the "Luftwaffe"s losses that four of "Luftflotte" 4's transport units (KGrzbV 700, KGrzbV 900, I./KGrzbV 1 and II./KGzbV 1) were "formally dissolved."

Soviet forces consolidated their positions around Stalingrad, and fierce fighting to shrink the pocket began. Operation Winter Storm ("Operation Wintergewitter"), the German attempt led by <a href="Erich%20von%20Manstein">Erich von Manstein</a> to relieve the trapped army from the south, was initially successful. By 18 December, the German Army had pushed to within 48 km (30 mi) of Sixth Army's positions. The starving encircled forces at Stalingrad made no attempt to break out or link up with Manstein's advance. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler's orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, concerned about the Red Army attacks on the flank of Army Group Don and Army Group B in their advance on <a href="Rostov-on-Don">Rostov-on-Don</a>, "an early abandonment" of Stalingrad "would result in the destruction of Army Group A in the Caucasus," and the fact that his 6th Army tanks only had fuel for a 30 km advance towards Hoth's spearhead, a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of resupply by air. Of his questions to Army Group Don, Paulus was told, "Wait, implement Operation 'Thunderclap' only on explicit orders!" Operation Thunderclap being the code word initiating the breakout.

On 23 December, the attempt to relieve Stalingrad was abandoned and Manstein's forces switched over to the defensive to deal with new Soviet offensives. As Zhukov states, "The military and political leadership of Nazi Germany sought not to relieve them, but to get them to fight on for as long possible so as to tie up the Soviet forces. The aim was to win as much time as possible to withdraw forces from the Caucasus and to rush troops from other Fronts to form a new front that would be able in some measure to check our counter-offensive."

On 16 December, the Soviets launched Operation Little Saturn, which attempted to punch through the Axis army (mainly Italians) on the Don and take <a href="Rostov-on-Don">Rostov</a>. The Germans set up a "mobile defense" of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armor arrived. From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions – supported by at least 100 tanks – attacked the Italian Cosseria and Ravenna Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders, but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines.

The fighting forced a total revaluation of the German situation. The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus. The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions. But in its defensive position on the Volga, 6th Army continued to tie down a significant number of Soviet Armies.

The Red Army High Command sent three envoys while simultaneously aircraft and loudspeakers announced terms of capitulation on 7 Jan. 1943. The letter was signed by Colonel-General of Artillery Voronov and the commander-in-chief of the Don Front, Lieutenant-General Rokossovski. The German High Command informed Paulus, "Every day that the army holds out longer helps the whole front and draws away the Russian divisions from it."

The Germans inside the pocket retreated from the <a href="suburb">suburb</a>s of Stalingrad to the city itself. The loss of the two airfields, at <a href="Pitomnik%20Airfield">Pitomnik</a> on 16 January 1943 and <a href="Gumrak">Gumrak</a> on the night of 21/22 January, meant an end to air supplies and to the evacuation of the wounded. The third and last serviceable runway was at the Stalingradskaya flight school, which reportedly had the last landings and takeoffs on 23 Jan. After 23 Jan. there were no more reported landings, just intermittent air drops of ammunition and food until the end.
The Germans were now not only starving, but running out of ammunition. Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called "<a href="Hiwi%20%28volunteer%29">HiWis</a>", Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody <a href="urban%20warfare">urban warfare</a> began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defense of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown.

The Germans had no usable tanks in the city, and those that still functioned could, at best, be used as makeshift pillboxes. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility. A low-level Soviet envoy party (comprising Major Aleksandr Smyslov, Captain <a href="Nikolay%20Dyatlenko">Nikolay Dyatlenko</a> and a trumpeter) carried an offer to Paulus: if he surrendered within 24 hours, he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners, medical care for the sick and wounded, prisoners being allowed to keep their personal belongings, "normal" food rations, and <a href="repatriation">repatriation</a> to any country they wished after the war; but Paulus – ordered not to surrender by Hitler – did not respond.

On 22 January, Paulus requested that he be granted permission to surrender. Hitler rejected it on a point of honour. He telegraphed the 6th Army later that day, claiming that it had made a historic contribution to the greatest struggle in German history and that it should stand fast "to the last soldier and the last bullet." Hitler told Goebbels that the plight of the 6th Army was a "heroic drama of German history."

On 24 Jan., in his radio report to Hitler, Paulus reported "18,000 wounded without the slightest aid of bandages and medicines."

On 26 January 1943, the German forces inside Stalingrad were split into two pockets north and south of Mamai-Kurgan. The northern pocket consisting of the VIIIth Corps, under General <a href="Walter%20Heitz">Walter Heitz</a>, and the XIth Corps, was now cut off from telephone communication with Paulus in the southern pocket. Now "each part of the cauldron came personally under Hitler."

On 28 Jan., the cauldron was split into three parts. The northern cauldron consisted of the XIth Corps, the central with the VIIIth and LIst Corps, and the southern with the XIVth Panzer Corps and IVth Corps "without units". The sick and wounded reached 40,000 to 50,000.

On 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of Hitler's coming to power, Goebbels read out a proclamation that included the sentence: "The heroic struggle of our soldiers on the Volga should be a warning for everybody to do the utmost for the struggle for Germany's freedom and the future of our people, and thus in a wider sense for the maintenance of our entire continent." Hitler promoted Paulus to the rank of "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>". No German field marshal had ever surrendered, and the implication was clear: if Paulus surrendered, he would shame himself and would become the highest ranking German officer ever to be captured. Hitler believed that Paulus would either fight to the last man or commit suicide.

On the next day, the southern pocket in Stalingrad collapsed. Soviet forces reached the entrance to the German headquarters in the ruined <a href="State%20Universal%20Store">GUM</a> department store. General Schmidt negotiated a surrender of the headquarters while Paulus was unaware in another room. When interrogated by the Soviets, Paulus claimed that he had not surrendered. He said that he had been taken by surprise. He denied that he was the commander of the remaining northern pocket in Stalingrad and refused to issue an order in his name for them to surrender. The central pocket, under the command of Heitz, surrendered the same day while the northern pocket, under the command of Strecker, held out for two more days. When Strecker finally surrendered he and his Chief of Staff, <a href="Helmuth%20Groscurth">Helmuth Groscurth</a>, drafted the final signal sent from Stalingrad, purposely omitting the customary exclamation to Hitler, replacing it with "Long live Germany!"

Four Soviet armies were deployed against the remaining northern pocket. At four in the morning on 2 February, General Strecker was informed that one of his own officers had gone to the Soviets to negotiate surrender terms. Seeing no point in continuing, he sent a radio message saying that his command had done its duty and fought to the last man. He then surrendered. Around 91,000 exhausted, ill, wounded, and starving prisoners were taken, including 3,000 Romanians (the survivors of the 20th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division and "Col. Voicu" Detachment). The prisoners included 22 generals. Hitler was furious and confided that Paulus "could have freed himself from all sorrow and ascended into eternity and national immortality, but he prefers to go to Moscow."

The German public was not officially told of the impending disaster until the end of January 1943, though positive media reports had stopped in the weeks before the announcement. Stalingrad marked the first time that the Nazi government publicly acknowledged a failure in its war effort; it was not only the first big defeat for the German military but German losses were almost equal to those of the Soviets and this was unprecedented. Previous Soviet losses were generally three times as high as those of the Germans. On 31 January, regular programmes on German state radio were replaced by a broadcast of the somber Adagio movement from <a href="Anton%20Bruckner">Anton Bruckner</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Bruckner%29">Seventh Symphony</a>, followed by the announcement of the defeat at Stalingrad. On 18 February, <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Enlightenment%20and%20Propaganda">Minister of Propaganda</a> <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> gave the famous <a href="Sportpalast%20speech">"Sportpalast" speech</a> in Berlin, encouraging the Germans to accept a <a href="total%20war">total war</a> that would claim all resources and efforts from the entire population.
Based on Soviet records, over 10,000 soldiers continued to resist in isolated groups within the city for the next month. Some have presumed that they were motivated by a belief that fighting on was better than a slow death in Soviet captivity. Brown University historian <a href="Omer%20Bartov">Omer Bartov</a> claims they were motivated by National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany. Almost every letter expressed belief in Germany's ultimate victory and their willingness to fight and die at Stalingrad to achieve that victory. Bartov reported that a great many of the soldiers were well aware that they would not be able to escape from Stalingrad but in their letters to their families boasted that they were proud to "sacrifice themselves for the Führer".

The remaining forces continued to resist, hiding in cellars and sewers but by early March 1943, the last small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered. According to Soviet intelligence documents shown in the documentary, a remarkable NKVD report from March 1943 is available showing the tenacity of some of these German groups:

The operative report of the Don Front's staff issued on 5 February 1943, 22:00 said,

The condition of the troops that surrendered was pitiful. British war correspondent <a href="Alexander%20Werth">Alexander Werth</a> described the following scene in his "Russia at War" book, based on a first-hand account of his visit to Stalingrad from 3–5 February 1943,

Out of the nearly 91,000 German prisoners captured in Stalingrad, only about 5,000 returned. Weakened by disease, starvation and lack of medical care during the encirclement, they were sent on foot marches to prisoner camps and later to <a href="labour%20camp">labour camp</a>s all over the Soviet Union. Some 35,000 were eventually sent on transports, of which 17,000 did not survive. Most died of wounds, disease (particularly <a href="typhus">typhus</a>), cold, overwork, mistreatment and malnutrition. Some were kept in the city to help rebuild.

A handful of senior officers were taken to Moscow and used for propaganda purposes, and some of them joined the <a href="National%20Committee%20for%20a%20Free%20Germany">National Committee for a Free Germany</a>. Some, including Paulus, signed anti-Hitler statements that were broadcast to German troops. Paulus testified for the prosecution during the Nuremberg Trials and assured families in Germany that those soldiers taken prisoner at Stalingrad were safe. He remained in the Soviet Union until 1952, then moved to Dresden in East Germany, where he spent the remainder of his days defending his actions at Stalingrad and was quoted as saying that Communism was the best hope for postwar Europe. General <a href="Walther%20von%20Seydlitz-Kurzbach">Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach</a> offered to raise an anti-Hitler army from the Stalingrad survivors, but the Soviets did not accept. It was not until 1955 that the last of the 5,000–6,000 survivors were <a href="Repatriation">repatriated</a> (to <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>) after a plea to the <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a> by <a href="Konrad%20Adenauer">Konrad Adenauer</a>.

Stalingrad has been described as the biggest defeat in the history of the German Army. It is often identified as the turning point on the Eastern Front, in the war against Germany overall, and the entire Second World War. Before Stalingrad, the German forces had gone from victory to victory on the Eastern Front, with a limited setback in the winter of 1941–42. After Stalingrad, they won no decisive battles, even in summer. The Red Army had the initiative, and the Wehrmacht was in retreat. A year of German gains during <a href="Case%20Blue">Case Blue</a> had been wiped out. Germany's Sixth Army had ceased to exist, and the forces of Germany's European allies, except Finland, had been shattered. In a speech on 9 November 1944, Hitler himself blamed Stalingrad for Germany's impending doom.

Stalingrad's significance has been downplayed by some historians, who point either to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow">Battle of Moscow</a> or the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kursk">Battle of Kursk</a> as more strategically decisive. Others maintain that the destruction of an entire army (the largest killed, captured, wounded figures for Axis soldiers, nearly 1 million, during the war) and the frustration of Germany's grand strategy made the battle a watershed moment. At the time, however, the global significance of the battle was not in doubt. Writing in his diary on 1 January 1943, British General <a href="Alan%20Brooke">Alan Brooke</a>, <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Imperial%20General%20Staff">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a>, reflected on the change in the position from a year before:

At this point, the British had won the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Battle of El Alamein</a> in November 1942. However, there were only about 50,000 German soldiers at El Alamein in Egypt, while at Stalingrad 200,000 Germans had been lost.

Regardless of the strategic implications, there is little doubt about Stalingrad's symbolism. Germany's defeat shattered its reputation for invincibility and dealt a devastating blow to German morale. On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. Germany was looking in the face of defeat.

The reverse was the case on the Soviet side. There was an overwhelming surge in confidence and belief in victory. A common saying was: "You cannot stop an army which has done Stalingrad." Stalin was feted as the hero of the hour and made a <a href="Marshal%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Marshal of the Soviet Union</a>. 

The news of the battle echoed round the world, with many people now believing that Hitler's defeat was inevitable. The <a href="Turkey">Turkish</a> Consul in Moscow predicted that "the lands which the Germans have destined for their <a href="lebensraum">living space</a> will become their dying space". Britain's conservative "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" proclaimed that the victory had saved European civilisation. The country celebrated "Red Army Day" on 23 February 1943. A ceremonial <a href="Sword%20of%20Stalingrad">Sword of Stalingrad</a> was forged by King George VI. After being put on public display in Britain, this was presented to Stalin by Winston Churchill at the <a href="Tehran%20Conference">Tehran Conference</a> later in 1943. Soviet propaganda spared no effort and wasted no time in capitalising on the triumph, impressing a global audience. The prestige of Stalin, the Soviet Union, and the worldwide Communist movement was immense, and their political position greatly enhanced.

In recognition of the determination of its defenders, Stalingrad was awarded the title <a href="Hero%20City">Hero City</a> in 1945. A colossal monument called <a href="The%20Motherland%20Calls">The Motherland Calls</a> was erected in 1967 on <a href="Mamayev%20Kurgan">Mamayev Kurgan</a>, the hill overlooking the city where bones and rusty metal splinters can still be found. The statue forms part of a war memorial complex which includes the ruins of the Grain Silo and <a href="Pavlov%27s%20House">Pavlov's House</a>. On 2 February 2013 <a href="Volgograd">Volgograd</a> hosted a a military parade and other events to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the final victory.

During the defence of Stalingrad, the Red Army deployed five armies (<a href="28th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">28th</a>, <a href="51st%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">51st</a>, <a href="57th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">57th</a>, <a href="62nd%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">62nd</a> and <a href="64th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">64th Armies</a>) in and around the city and an additional nine armies in the encirclement counter offensive. The nine armies amassed for the counteroffensive were the <a href="24th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">24th Army</a>, <a href="65th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">65th Army</a>, <a href="66th%20Army">66th Army</a> and <a href="16th%20Air%20Army">16th Air Army</a> from the north as part of the <a href="Don%20Front">Don Front</a> offensive and <a href="1st%20Guards%20Tank%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">1st Guards Army</a>, <a href="5th%20Guards%20Tank%20Army">5th Tank</a>, <a href="21st%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">21st Army</a>, <a href="2nd%20Air%20Army">2nd Air Army</a> and <a href="17th%20Air%20Army">17th Air Army</a> from the south as part of the <a href="Soviet%20Southwestern%20Front">Southwestern Front</a>.

The calculation of casualties depends on what scope is given to the Battle of Stalingrad. The scope can vary from the fighting in the city and suburbs to the inclusion of almost all fighting on the southern wing of the Soviet–German front from the spring of 1942 to the end of the fighting in the city in the winter of 1943. Scholars have produced different estimates depending on their definition of the scope of the battle. The difference is comparing the city against the region. The Axis suffered 730,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and its allies; 400,000 Germans, 109,000 Romanians of which at least 70,000 were captured or missing, 114,000 Italians and 105,000 Hungarians were killed, wounded or captured.

The Germans lost 900 aircraft (including 274 transports and 165 bombers used as transports), 500 tanks and 6,000 artillery pieces. According to a contemporary Soviet report, 5,762 guns, 1,312 mortars, 12,701 heavy machine guns, 156,987 rifles, 80,438 sub-machine guns, 10,722 trucks, 744 aircraft; 1,666 tanks, 261 other armored vehicles, 571 half-tracks and 10,679 motorcycles were captured by the Soviets. An unknown amount of Hungarian, Italian, and Romanian materiel was lost.

The USSR, according to archival figures, suffered 1,129,619 total casualties; 478,741 personnel killed or missing, and 650,878 wounded or sick. The USSR lost 4,341 tanks destroyed or damaged, 15,728 artillery pieces and 2,769 combat aircraft. 955 Soviet civilians died in Stalingrad and its suburbs from aerial bombing by "Luftflotte" 4 as the German 4th Panzer and 6th Armies approached the city.

The losses of transport planes were especially serious, as they destroyed the capacity for supply of the trapped 6th Army. The destruction of 72 aircraft when the airfield at Tatsinskaya was overrun meant the loss of about 10 percent of the Luftwaffe transport fleet.

These losses amounted to about 50 percent of the aircraft committed and the Luftwaffe training program was stopped and sorties in other theaters of war were significantly reduced to save fuel for use at Stalingrad.

The events of the Battle for Stalingrad have been covered in numerous media works of British, American, <a href="Stalingrad%20%28disambiguation%29%23Films">German</a>, and Russian origin, for its significance as a turning point in the Second World War and for the loss of life associated with the battle. The term Stalingrad has become almost synonymous with large-scale urban battles with high casualties on both sides.

Bodhidharma

Bodhidharma was a <a href="Bhikkhu">Buddhist monk</a> who lived during the 5th or 6th century. He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of <a href="Chan%20Buddhism">Chan Buddhism</a> to <a href="China">China</a>, and regarded as its first Chinese <a href="Lineage%20%28Buddhism%29">patriarch</a>. According to Chinese legend, he also began the physical training of the monks of <a href="Shaolin%20Monastery">Shaolin Monastery</a> that led to the creation of <a href="Shaolin%20kungfu">Shaolin kungfu</a>. In Japan, he is known as Daruma.

Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend.

According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the <a href="Western%20Regions">Western Regions</a>, which refers to Central Asia but may also include the Indian subcontinent, and was either a "Persian Central Asian" or a "South Indian [...] the third son of a great Indian king."

Throughout <a href="Buddhist%20art">Buddhist art</a>, Bodhidharma is depicted as an ill-tempered, profusely-bearded, wide-eyed <a href="Hua%E2%80%93Yi%20distinction">non-Chinese person</a>. He is referred as "The Blue-Eyed Barbarian" () in Chan texts.

Aside from the Chinese accounts, several popular traditions also exist regarding Bodhidharma's origins.

The accounts also differ on the date of his arrival, with one early account claiming that he arrived during the <a href="Liu%20Song%20dynasty">Liu Song dynasty</a> (420–479) and later accounts dating his arrival to the <a href="Liang%20dynasty">Liang dynasty</a> (502–557). Bodhidharma was primarily active in the territory of the <a href="Northern%20Wei">Northern Wei</a> (386-634). Modern scholarship dates him to about the early 5th century.

Bodhidharma's teachings and practice centered on meditation and the "<a href="La%E1%B9%85k%C4%81vat%C4%81ra%20S%C5%ABtra">Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra</a>". The "<a href="Anthology%20of%20the%20Patriarchal%20Hall">Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall</a>" (952) identifies Bodhidharma as the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in an uninterrupted line that extends all the way back to the <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> himself.

There are two known extant accounts written by contemporaries of Bodhidharma. According to these sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western regions, and was either a "Persian Central Asian" or a "South Indian [...] the third son of a great Indian king." Later sources draw on these two sources, adding additional details, including a change to being descendent from a "Brahmin" king, which accords with the reign of the <a href="Pallavas">Pallavas</a>, who were Brahmins.

The "<a href="Western%20Regions">Western Regions</a>" was a historical name specified in the Chinese chronicles between the 3rd century BC to the 8th century AD that referred to the regions west of <a href="Yumen%20Pass">Yumen Pass</a>, most often <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> or sometimes more specifically the easternmost portion of it (e.g. <a href="Altishahr">Altishahr</a> or the <a href="Tarim%20Basin">Tarim Basin</a> in southern <a href="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>). Sometimes it was used more generally to refer to other regions to the west of China as well, such as the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> (as in the novel "<a href="Journey%20to%20the%20West">Journey to the West</a>").

The earliest text mentioning Bodhidharma is "The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>" ( "Luòyáng Qiélánjì") which was compiled in 547 by Yáng Xuànzhī (楊衒之), a writer and translator of <a href="Mahayana%20sutras">Mahayana sutras</a> into Chinese. Yang gave the following account:

The second account was written by Tánlín (曇林; 506–574). Tánlín's brief biography of the "<a href="Dharma">Dharma</a> Master" is found in his preface to the "<a href="Long%20Scroll%20of%20the%20Treatise%20on%20the%20Two%20Entrances%20and%20Four%20Practices">Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices</a>", a text traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma and the first text to identify him as <a href="Dravidian%20peoples">South Indian</a>:
Tánlín's account was the first to mention that Bodhidharma attracted disciples, specifically mentioning Dàoyù (道育) and <a href="Dazu%20Huike">Dazu Huike</a> (慧可), the latter of whom would later figure very prominently in the Bodhidharma literature. Although Tánlín has traditionally been considered a disciple of Bodhidharma, it is more likely that he was a student of Huìkě.

Tanlin's preface has also been preserved in Jingjue's (683-750) "Lengjie Shizi ji" "Chronicle of the "Laṅkāvatāra" Masters", which dates from 713-716./ca. 715 He writes, 
In the 7th-century historical work "Further Biographies of Eminent Monks" (續高僧傳 "Xù gāosēng zhuàn"), <a href="D%C3%A0oxu%C4%81n">Dàoxuān</a> (道宣; 596-667) possibly drew on Tanlin's preface as a basic source, but made several significant additions:

Firstly, Dàoxuān adds more detail concerning Bodhidharma's origins, writing that he was of "South Indian <a href="Brahman">Brahman</a> stock" (南天竺婆羅門種 "nán tiānzhú póluómén zhŏng").

Secondly, more detail is provided concerning Bodhidharma's journeys. Tanlin's original is imprecise about Bodhidharma's travels, saying only that he "crossed distant mountains and seas" before arriving in Wei. Dàoxuān's account, however, implies "a specific itinerary": "He first arrived at <a href="Nanyue">Nan-yüeh</a> during the <a href="Liu%20Song%20dynasty">Sung period</a>. From there he turned north and came to the Kingdom of Wei" This implies that Bodhidharma had travelled to China by sea and that he had crossed over the <a href="Yangtze">Yangtze</a>.

Thirdly, Dàoxuān suggests a date for Bodhidharma's arrival in China. He writes that Bodhidharma makes landfall in the time of the Song, thus making his arrival no later than the time of the Song's fall to the <a href="Southern%20Qi">Southern Qi</a> in 479.

Finally, Dàoxuān provides information concerning Bodhidharma's death. Bodhidharma, he writes, died at the banks of the <a href="Luo%20River%20%28Henan%29">Luo River</a>, where he was interred by his disciple Dazu Huike, possibly in a cave. According to Dàoxuān's chronology, Bodhidharma's death must have occurred prior to 534, the date of the Northern Wei's fall, because Dazu Huike subsequently leaves Luoyang for <a href="Ye%20%28ancient%20China%29">Ye</a>. Furthermore, citing the shore of the Luo River as the place of death might possibly suggest that Bodhidharma died in <a href="Emperor%20Xiaozhuang%20of%20Northern%20Wei%23The%20Heyin%20Massacre%20and%20aftermath">the mass executions at Heyin</a> (河陰) in 528. Supporting this possibility is a report in the <a href="Chinese%20Buddhist%20canon">Chinese Buddhist canon</a> stating that a Buddhist monk was among the victims at Héyīn.

In the "<a href="Anthology%20of%20the%20Patriarchal%20Hall">Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall</a>" (祖堂集 "Zǔtángjí") of 952, the elements of the traditional Bodhidharma story are in place. Bodhidharma is said to have been a disciple of <a href="Prajnatara">Prajñātāra</a>, thus establishing the latter as the 27th patriarch in India. After a three-year journey, Bodhidharma reached China in 527, during the Liang (as opposed to the Song in Dàoxuān's text). The "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall" includes Bodhidharma's encounter with <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Liang">Emperor Wu of Liang</a>, which was first recorded around 758 in the appendix to a text by Shenhui (神會), a disciple of Huineng.

Finally, as opposed to Daoxuan's figure of "over 180 years," the "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall" states that Bodhidharma died at the age of 150. He was then buried on Mount Xiong'er (熊耳山 "Xióng'ĕr Shān") to the west of Luoyang. However, three years after the burial, in the <a href="Pamir%20Mountains">Pamir Mountains</a>, Sòngyún (宋雲)—an official of one of the later Wei kingdoms—encountered Bodhidharma, who claimed to be returning to India and was carrying a single sandal. Bodhidharma predicted the death of Songyun's ruler, a prediction which was borne out upon the latter's return. Bodhidharma's tomb was then opened, and only a single sandal was found inside.

According to the "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall", Bodhidharma left the Liang court in 527 and relocated to <a href="Mount%20Song">Mount Song</a> near Luoyang and the Shaolin Monastery, where he "faced a wall for nine years, not speaking for the entire time", his date of death can have been no earlier than 536. Moreover, his encounter with the Wei official indicates a date of death no later than 554, three years before the fall of the <a href="Western%20Wei">Western Wei</a>.

Subsequent to the "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall", the only dated addition to the biography of Bodhidharma is in the "<a href="Transmission%20of%20the%20Lamp">Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp</a>" (景德傳燈錄 "Jĭngdé chuándēng lù", published 1004 <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a>), by Dàoyuán (道原), in which it is stated that Bodhidharma's original name had been Bodhitāra but was changed by his master Prajñātāra. The same account is given by the Japanese master Keizan's 13th century work of the same title.

Several contemporary popular traditions also exist regarding Bodhidharma's origins. An Indian tradition regards Bodhidharma to be the third son of a <a href="Pallava%20dynasty">Pallava king</a> from <a href="Kanchipuram">Kanchipuram</a>. This is consistent with the Southeast Asian traditions which also describe Bodhidharma as a former <a href="South%20India">South India</a>n Tamil prince who had awakened his <a href="kundalini">kundalini</a> and renounced royal life to become a monk. The Tibetan version similarly characterises him as a dark-skinned <a href="siddhar">siddha</a> from South India. Conversely, the Japanese tradition generally regards Bodhidharma as <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a>.

Several stories about Bodhidharma have become popular legends, which are still being used in the Ch'an, Seon and Zen-tradition.

The "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall" says that in 527, Bodhidharma visited <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Liang">Emperor Wu of Liang</a> (Xiāo Yǎn 蕭衍, posthumous name Wǔdì 武帝), a fervent patron of Buddhism:
This encounter was included as the first <a href="k%C5%8Dan">kōan</a> of the "<a href="Blue%20Cliff%20Record">Blue Cliff Record</a>".

Failing to make a favorable impression in <a href="South%20China">South China</a>, Bodhidharma is said to have travelled to the Shaolin Monastery. After either being refused entry or being ejected after a short time, he lived in a nearby cave, where he "faced a wall for nine years, not speaking for the entire time".

The biographical tradition is littered with apocryphal tales about Bodhidharma's life and circumstances. In one version of the story, he is said to have fallen asleep seven years into his nine years of wall-gazing. Becoming angry with himself, he cut off his eyelids to prevent it from happening again. According to the legend, as his eyelids hit the floor the first <a href="Camellia%20sinensis">tea plants</a> sprang up, and thereafter <a href="tea">tea</a> would provide a stimulant to help keep students of Chan awake during <a href="zazen">zazen</a>.

The most popular account relates that Bodhidharma was admitted into the Shaolin temple after nine years in the cave and taught there for some time. However, other versions report that he "passed away, seated upright"; or that he disappeared, leaving behind the "<a href="Yijin%20Jing">Yijin Jing</a>"; or that his legs atrophied after nine years of sitting, which is why <a href="Daruma%20doll">Daruma doll</a>s have no legs.

In one legend, Bodhidharma refused to resume teaching until his would-be student, <a href="Dazu%20Huike">Dazu Huike</a>, who had kept vigil for weeks in the deep snow outside of the monastery, cut off his own left arm to demonstrate sincerity.

"Jǐngdé Records of the Transmission of the Lamp" (Jǐngdé chuándēng lù 景德传灯录) of Dàoyuán 道原, presented to the emperor in 1004, records that Bodhidharma wished to return to India and called together his disciples:

Bodhidharma passed on the symbolic robe and bowl of dharma succession to Dazu Huike and, some texts claim, a copy of the "Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra". Bodhidharma then either returned to India or died.

Some Chinese myths and legends describe Bodhidharma as being disturbed by the poor physical shape of the Shaolin monks, after which he instructed them in techniques to maintain their physical condition as well as teaching meditation. He is said to have taught a series of external exercises called the <a href="Luohan%20%28martial%20arts%29">Eighteen Arhat Hands</a> and an internal practice called the Sinew Metamorphosis Classic. In addition, after his departure from the temple, two manuscripts by Bodhidharma were said to be discovered inside the temple: the "<a href="Yijin%20Jing">Yijin Jing</a>" and the "Xisui Jing". Copies and translations of the "Yijin Jing" survive to the modern day. The "Xisui Jing" has been lost.

According to <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>n folklore, Bodhidharma travelled from <a href="Jambudvipa">Jambudvipa</a> by sea to <a href="Palembang">Palembang</a>, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. Passing through <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, <a href="Java">Java</a>, <a href="Bali">Bali</a>, and <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, he eventually entered China through <a href="Nanyue">Nanyue</a>. In his travels through the region, Bodhidharma is said to have transmitted his knowledge of the Mahayana doctrine and the martial arts. Malay legend holds that he introduced <a href="kata">forms</a> to <a href="silat">silat</a>.

<a href="Vajrayana">Vajrayana</a> tradition links Bodhidharma with the 11th-century south Indian monk <a href="Dampa%20Sangye">Dampa Sangye</a> who travelled extensively to Tibet and China spreading tantric teachings.

Three years after Bodhidharma's death, Ambassador Sòngyún of northern Wei is said to have seen him walking while holding a shoe at the <a href="Pamir%20Mountains">Pamir Heights</a>. Sòngyún asked Bodhidharma where he was going, to which Bodhidharma replied "I am going home". When asked why he was holding his shoe, Bodhidharma answered "You will know when you reach Shaolin monastery. Don't mention that you saw me or you will meet with disaster". After arriving at the palace, Sòngyún told the emperor that he met Bodhidharma on the way. The emperor said Bodhidharma was already dead and buried and had Sòngyún arrested for lying. At Shaolin Monastery, the monks informed them that Bodhidharma was dead and had been buried in a hill behind the temple. The grave was exhumed and was found to contain a single shoe. The monks then said "Master has gone back home" and prostrated three times: "For nine years he had remained and nobody knew him; Carrying a shoe in hand he went home quietly, without ceremony."

Bodhidharma is traditionally seen as introducing dhyana-practice in China.

One of the fundamental Chán texts attributed to Bodhidharma is a four-line stanza whose first two verses echo the "Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra"s disdain for words and whose second two verses stress the importance of the insight into reality achieved through "self-realization":

The stanza, in fact, is not Bodhidharma's, but rather dates to the year 1108.

Tanlin, in the preface to "Two Entrances and Four Acts", and Daoxuan, in the "Further Biographies of Eminent Monks", mention a practice of Bodhidharma's termed "wall-gazing" (壁觀 "bìguān"). Both Tanlin and Daoxuan associate this "wall-gazing" with "quieting [the] mind" ().

In the "Two Entrances and Four Acts", traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma, the term "wall-gazing" is given as follows: Daoxuan states, "The merits of Mahāyāna wall-gazing are the highest".

These are the first mentions in the historical record of what may be a type of <a href="Buddhist%20meditation">meditation</a> being ascribed to Bodhidharma.

Exactly what sort of practice Bodhidharma's "wall-gazing" was remains uncertain. Nearly all accounts have treated it either as an undefined variety of meditation, as Daoxuan and Dumoulin, or as a variety of seated meditation akin to the <a href="zazen">zazen</a> () that later became a defining characteristic of Chan. The latter interpretation is particularly common among those working from a Chan standpoint.

There have also, however, been interpretations of "wall-gazing" as a non-meditative phenomenon.

There are early texts which explicitly associate Bodhidharma with the "Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra". Daoxuan, for example, in a late recension of his biography of Bodhidharma's successor <a href="Dazu%20Huike">Huike</a>, has the sūtra as a basic and important element of the teachings passed down by Bodhidharma:
Another early text, the "<a href="Lengqie%20shizi%20ji">Record of the Masters and Disciples of the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra</a>" () of Jìngjué (淨覺; 683–750), also mentions Bodhidharma in relation to this text. Jingjue's account also makes explicit mention of "sitting meditation" or zazen:
In other early texts, the school that would later become known as Chan Buddhism is sometimes referred to as the "Laṅkāvatāra school" (楞伽宗 "Léngqié zōng").

The "Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra", one of the <a href="Mahayana%20sutras">Mahayana sutras</a>, is a highly "difficult and obscure" text whose basic thrust is to emphasize "the inner <a href="Bodhi">enlightenment</a> that does away with all duality and is raised above all distinctions". It is among the first and most important texts for <a href="East%20Asian%20Yog%C4%81c%C4%81ra">East Asian Yogācāra</a>.

One of the recurrent emphases in the "Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra" is a lack of reliance on words to effectively express reality:

In contrast to the ineffectiveness of words, the sūtra instead stresses the importance of the "self-realization" that is "attained by noble wisdom" and occurs "when one has an insight into reality as it is": "The truth is the state of self-realization and is beyond categories of discrimination". The sūtra goes on to outline the ultimate effects of an experience of self-realization:

The idea of a <a href="Lineage%20%28Buddhism%29">patriarchal lineage</a> in Ch'an dates back to the <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> for Fărú (法如 638–689), a disciple of the 5th patriarch Hóngrĕn (弘忍 601–674). In the "Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices" and the "Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks", Daoyu and Dazu Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.

In the 6th century biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre the typical Chan lineage was developed:
<a href="D.%20T.%20Suzuki">D. T. Suzuki</a> contends that Chan's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had "no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism" and that Chan historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.

The earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma into the 5th to 7th generation of patriarchs. Various records of different authors are known, which give a variation of transmission lines:
Eventually these descriptions of the lineage evolved into a continuous lineage from Śākyamuni Buddha to Bodhidharma. The idea of a line of descent from Śākyamuni Buddha is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of Chan Buddhism.

According to the "<a href="Song%20of%20Enlightenment">Song of Enlightenment</a>" (證道歌 "Zhèngdào gē") by Yǒngjiā Xuánjué (665-713), one of the chief disciples of <a href="Huineng">Huìnéng</a>, was Bodhidharma, the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in a line of descent from Gautama Buddha via his disciple <a href="Mah%C4%81k%C4%81%C5%9Byapa">Mahākāśyapa</a>:
<poem>Mahakashyapa was the first, leading the line of transmission;
Twenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;
The Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;
And Bodhidharma became the First Father here
His mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,
And by them many minds came to see the Light.</poem>
The "Transmission of the Light" gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission:

Bodhidharma has been the subject of critical scientific research, which has shed new light on the traditional stories about Bodhidharma.

According to John McRae, Bodhidharma has been the subject of a <a href="Hagiography">hagiographic process</a> which served the needs of Chan Buddhism. According to him it is not possible to write an accurate biography of Bodhidharma:
McRae's standpoint accords with Yanagida's standpoint: "Yanagida ascribes great historical value to the witness of the disciple T'an-lin, but at the same time acknowledges the presence of "many puzzles in the biography of Bodhidharma". Given the present state of the sources, he considers it impossible to compile a reliable account of Bodhidharma's life.

Several scholars have suggested that the composed image of Bodhidharma depended on the combination of supposed historical information on various historical figures over several centuries. Bodhidharma as a historical person may even never have actually existed.

Dumoulin comments on the three principal sources. The Persian heritage is doubtful, according to Dumoulin: "In the description of the Lo-yang temple, bodhidharma is called a Persian. Given the ambiguity of geographical references in writings of this period, such a statement should not be taken too seriously." Dumoulin considers Tan-lin's account of Bodhidharma being "the third son of a great Brahman king" to be a later addition, and finds the exact meaning of "South Indian Brahman stock" unclear: "And when Tao-hsuan speaks of origins from South Indian Brahman stock, it is not clear whether he is referring to roots in nobility or to India in general as the land of the Brahmans."

These Chinese sources lend themselves to make inferences about Bodhidharma's origins. "The third son of a Brahman king" has been speculated to mean "the third son of a Pallavine king". Based on a specific pronunciation of the Chinese characters 香至 as Kang-zhi, "meaning fragrance extreme", Tsutomu Kambe identifies 香至 to be <a href="Kanchipuram">Kanchipuram</a>, an old capital town in the state <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, <a href="India">India</a>. According to Tsutomu Kambe, "Kanchi means 'a radiant jewel' or 'a luxury belt with jewels', and puram means a town or a state in the sense of earlier times. Thus, it is understood that the '香至-Kingdom' corresponds to the old capital 'Kanchipuram'."

The <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>i scholar <a href="Ahmad%20Hasan%20Dani">Ahmad Hasan Dani</a> speculated that according to popular accounts in Pakistan's northwest, Bodhidharma may be from the region around the <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a> valley, or possibly around modern Afghanistan's eastern border with Pakistan.

In the context of the <a href="Caste%20system%20in%20India">Indian caste system</a> the mention of "Brahman king" acquires a nuance. Broughton notes that "king" implies that Bodhidharma was of a member of the <a href="Kshatriya">thondaiman caste, an shatriya</a> caste of warriors and rulers. Brahman is, in western contexts, easily understood as Brahmana or <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>, which means "priest".

According to tradition Bodhidharma was given this name by his teacher known variously as Panyatara, <a href="Prajnatara">Prajnatara</a>, or Prajñādhara. His name prior to monkhood is said to be Jayavarman.

Bodhidharma is associated with several other names, and is also known by the name Bodhitara. Faure notes that:
Tibetan sources give his name as "Bodhidharmottāra" or "Dharmottara", that is, "Highest teaching (dharma) of enlightenment".

Buswell dates Bodhidharma abode in China approximately at the early 5th century. Broughton dates Bodhidharma's presence in Luoyang to between 516 and 526, when the temple referred to—Yǒngníngsì (永寧寺), was at the height of its glory. Starting in 526, Yǒngníngsì suffered damage from a series of events, ultimately leading to its destruction in 534.

Traditionally Bodhidharma is credited as founder of the martial arts at the Shaolin Temple. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th-century <a href="qigong">qigong</a> manual known as the "<a href="Yijin%20Jing">Yijin Jing</a>".

The authenticity of the "Yi Jin Jing" has been discredited by some historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Matsuda Ryuchi. This argument is summarized by modern historian Lin Boyuan in his "Zhongguo wushu shi":
The oldest available copy was published in 1827. The composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624. Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904–1907 serialization of the novel "The Travels of Lao Ts'an" in "Illustrated Fiction Magazine":

<doc id="4292" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4292" title="Base pair">
Base pair

A base pair (bp) is a unit consisting of two <a href="nucleobase">nucleobase</a>s bound to each other by <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s. They form the building blocks of the <a href="DNA">DNA</a> double helix, and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and <a href="RNA">RNA</a>. Dictated by specific <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>ing patterns, Watson-Crick base pairs (<a href="guanine">guanine</a>-<a href="cytosine">cytosine</a> and <a href="adenine">adenine</a>-<a href="thymine">thymine</a>) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its <a href="nucleotide%20sequence">nucleotide sequence</a>. The <a href="Complementarity%20%28molecular%20biology%29">complementary</a> nature of this based-paired structure provides a backup copy of all <a href="genetic%20information">genetic information</a> encoded within double-stranded DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a> replicates DNA, and <a href="RNA%20polymerase">RNA polymerase</a> transcribes DNA into RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.

Intramolecular base pairs can occur within single-stranded nucleic acids. This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., <a href="transfer%20RNA">transfer RNA</a>), where Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-<a href="uracil">uracil</a>) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g., G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional <a href="RNA%20structure">structures</a>. In addition, base-pairing between <a href="transfer%20RNA">transfer RNA</a> (tRNA) and <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA) forms the basis for the <a href="molecular%20recognition">molecular recognition</a> events that result in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming <a href="Genetic%20code">translated</a> into the amino acid sequence of <a href="protein">protein</a>s via the <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a>.

The size of an individual <a href="gene">gene</a> or an organism's entire <a href="genome">genome</a> is often measured in base pairs because DNA is usually double-stranded. Hence, the number of total base pairs is equal to the number of nucleotides in one of the strands (with the exception of non-coding single-stranded regions of <a href="telomere">telomere</a>s). The <a href="haploid">haploid</a> <a href="human%20genome">human genome</a> (23 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s) is estimated to be about 3.2 billion bases long and to contain 20,000–25,000 distinct protein-coding genes. A <a href="kilobase">kilobase</a> (kb) is a unit of measurement in <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a> equal to 1000 base pairs of DNA or RNA. The total amount of related <a href="DNA">DNA</a> base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10, and weighs 50 billion <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s. In comparison, the total <a href="Biomass%20%28ecology%29">mass</a> of the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a> has been estimated to be as much as 4 <a href="tonnes%23Derived%20units">TtC</a> (trillion tons of <a href="carbon">carbon</a>).

<a href="Hydrogen%20bond">Hydrogen bond</a>ing is the chemical interaction that underlies the base-pairing rules described above. Appropriate geometrical correspondence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows only the "right" pairs to form stably. DNA with high <a href="GC-content">GC-content</a> is more stable than DNA with low GC-content, but, contrary to popular belief, the hydrogen bonds do not stabilize the DNA significantly, and stabilization is mainly due to stacking interactions.

The larger <a href="nucleobase">nucleobase</a>s, adenine and guanine, are members of a class of double-ringed chemical structures called <a href="purine">purine</a>s; the smaller nucleobases, cytosine and thymine (and uracil), are members of a class of single-ringed chemical structures called <a href="pyrimidine">pyrimidine</a>s. Purines are complementary only with pyrimidines: pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too far apart for hydrogen bonding to be established; purine-purine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too close, leading to overlap repulsion. Purine-pyrimidine base pairing of AT or GC or UA (in RNA) results in proper duplex structure. The only other purine-pyrimidine pairings would be AC and GT and UG (in RNA); these pairings are mismatches because the patterns of hydrogen donors and acceptors do not correspond. The GU pairing, with two hydrogen bonds, does occur fairly often in <a href="RNA">RNA</a> (see <a href="wobble%20base%20pair">wobble base pair</a>).

Paired DNA and RNA molecules are comparatively stable at room temperature but the two nucleotide strands will separate above a <a href="Dna%20melting">melting point</a> that is determined by the length of the molecules, the extent of mispairing (if any), and the GC content. Higher GC content results in higher melting temperatures; it is, therefore, unsurprising that the genomes of <a href="extremophile">extremophile</a> organisms such as "<a href="Thermus%20thermophilus">Thermus thermophilus</a>" are particularly GC-rich. On the converse, regions of a genome that need to separate frequently — for example, the promoter regions for often-<a href="transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcribed</a> genes — are comparatively GC-poor (for example, see <a href="TATA%20box">TATA box</a>). GC content and melting temperature must also be taken into account when designing <a href="primer%20%28molecular%20biology%29">primers</a> for <a href="PCR">PCR</a> reactions.

The following DNA sequences illustrate pair double-stranded patterns. By convention, the top strand is written from the <a href="5%27%20end">5' end</a> to the <a href="3%27%20end">3' end</a>; thus, the bottom strand is written 3' to 5'.

Chemical analogs of nucleotides can take the place of proper nucleotides and establish non-canonical base-pairing, leading to errors (mostly <a href="point%20mutation">point mutation</a>s) in <a href="DNA%20replication">DNA replication</a> and <a href="Transcription%20%28genetics%29">DNA transcription</a>. This is due to their <a href="isosteric">isosteric</a> chemistry. One common mutagenic base analog is <a href="5-bromouracil">5-bromouracil</a>, which resembles thymine but can base-pair to guanine in its <a href="enol">enol</a> form.

Other chemicals, known as <a href="DNA%20intercalation">DNA intercalators</a>, fit into the gap between adjacent bases on a single strand and induce <a href="frameshift%20mutation">frameshift mutation</a>s by "masquerading" as a base, causing the DNA replication machinery to skip or insert additional nucleotides at the intercalated site. Most intercalators are large <a href="polyaromatic">polyaromatic</a> compounds and are known or suspected <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>s. Examples include <a href="ethidium%20bromide">ethidium bromide</a> and <a href="acridine">acridine</a>.

An unnatural base pair (UBP) is a designed subunit (or <a href="nucleobase">nucleobase</a>) of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature. DNA sequences have been described which use newly created nucleobases to form a third base pair, in addition to the two base pairs found in nature, A-T (<a href="adenine">adenine</a> - <a href="thymine">thymine</a>) and G-C (<a href="guanine">guanine</a> - <a href="cytosine">cytosine</a>). A few research groups have been searching for a third base pair for DNA, including teams led by <a href="Steven%20A.%20Benner">Steven A. Benner</a>, <a href="Philippe%20Marliere">Philippe Marliere</a>, <a href="Floyd%20Romesberg">Floyd Romesberg</a> and <a href="Ichiro%20Hirao">Ichiro Hirao</a>. Some new base pairs have been reported.

In 1989 Steven Benner, then at the <a href="ETH%20Zurich">Swiss Federal Institute of Technology</a> in Zurich, and his team led with modified forms of cytosine and guanine into DNA molecules "in vitro". The nucleotides, which encoded RNA and proteins, were successfully replicated "in vitro". Since then, Benner's team has been trying to engineer cells that can make foreign bases from scratch, obviating the need for a feedstock.

In 2002, Ichiro Hirao’s group in Japan developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions in transcription and translation, for the site-specific incorporation of non-standard amino acids into proteins. In 2006, they created 7-(2-thienyl)imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (Ds) and pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (Pa) as a third base pair for replication and transcription. Afterward, Ds and 4-[3-(6-aminohexanamido)-1-propynyl]-2-nitropyrrole (Px) was discovered as a high fidelity pair in PCR amplification. In 2013, they applied the Ds-Px pair to DNA aptamer generation by "in vitro" selection (SELEX) and demonstrated the genetic alphabet expansion significantly augment DNA aptamer affinities to target proteins.

In 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the <a href="Scripps%20Research%20Institute">Scripps Research Institute</a> in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair (UBP). The two new artificial nucleotides or "Unnatural Base Pair" (UBP) were named <a href="d5SICS">d5SICS</a> and <a href="dNaM">dNaM</a>. More technically, these artificial <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s bearing hydrophobic <a href="nucleobase">nucleobase</a>s, feature two fused <a href="Aromatic%20hydrocarbon">aromatic rings</a> that form a (d5SICS–dNaM) complex or base pair in DNA. His team designed a variety of "in vitro" or "test tube" templates containing the unnatural base pair and they confirmed that it was efficiently replicated with high fidelity in virtually all sequence contexts using the modern standard "in vitro" techniques, namely <a href="Polymerase%20chain%20reaction">PCR amplification of DNA</a> and PCR-based applications. Their results show that for PCR and PCR-based applications, the d5SICS–dNaM unnatural base pair is functionally equivalent to a natural base pair, and when combined with the other two natural base pairs used by all organisms, A–T and G–C, they provide a fully functional and expanded six-letter "genetic alphabet".

In 2014 the same team from the Scripps Research Institute reported that they synthesized a stretch of circular DNA known as a <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a> containing natural T-A and C-G base pairs along with the best-performing UBP Romesberg's laboratory had designed, and inserted it into cells of the common bacterium "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>" that successfully replicated the unnatural base pairs through multiple generations. The <a href="transfection">transfection</a> did not hamper the growth of the "E. coli" cells, and showed no sign of losing its unnatural base pairs to its natural <a href="DNA%20repair">DNA repair</a> mechanisms. This is the first known example of a living organism passing along an expanded genetic code to subsequent generations. Romesberg said he and his colleagues created 300 variants to refine the design of nucleotides that would be stable enough and would be replicated as easily as the natural ones when the cells divide. This was in part achieved by the addition of a supportive <a href="Algae">algal gene</a> that expresses a <a href="Nucleoside%20triphosphate">nucleotide triphosphate</a> transporter which efficiently imports the triphosphates of both d5SICSTP and dNaMTP into "E. coli" bacteria. Then, the natural bacterial replication pathways use them to accurately replicate a <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a> containing d5SICS–dNaM. Other researchers were surprised that the bacteria replicated these human-made DNA subunits.

The successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 20 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel <a href="protein">protein</a>s. The artificial strings of DNA do not encode for anything yet, but scientists speculate they could be designed to manufacture new proteins which could have industrial or pharmaceutical uses. Experts said the synthetic DNA incorporating the unnatural base pair raises the possibility of life forms based on a different DNA code.

The following abbreviations are commonly used to describe the length of a D/R<a href="DNA">NA molecule</a>:

For case of single-stranded DNA/RNA units of <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s are used, abbreviated nt (or knt, Mnt, Gnt), as they are not paired.
For distinction between units of <a href="computer%20storage">computer storage</a> and bases kbp, Mbp, Gbp, etc. may be used for base pairs.

The <a href="centimorgan">centimorgan</a> is also often used to imply distance along a chromosome, but the number of base pairs it corresponds to varies widely. In the Human genome, the centimorgan is about 1 million base pairs.

Baltimore Ravens

The Baltimore Ravens are a professional <a href="American%20football">American football</a> team based in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore, Maryland</a>. The Ravens compete in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>. The team plays its home games at <a href="M%26amp%3BT%20Bank%20Stadium">M&T Bank Stadium</a> and is headquartered in <a href="Owings%20Mills%2C%20Maryland">Owings Mills</a>.

The Ravens were established in 1996, when <a href="Art%20Modell">Art Modell</a>, who was then the owner of the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, announced plans to <a href="Cleveland%20Browns%20relocation%20controversy">relocate</a> the franchise from <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a> to Baltimore. As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns' history and records in Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would take control in 1999. In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore, where such personnel would then form an <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>.

The Ravens have been one of the more successful franchises since their inception, having qualified for the <a href="National%20Football%20League%20playoffs">NFL playoffs</a> ten times since 2000, with two Super Bowl victories (<a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXV">Super Bowl XXXV</a> and <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVII">Super Bowl XLVII</a>), two <a href="AFC%20Championship%20Game">AFC Championship</a> titles (2000 and 2012), 15 playoff victories, four AFC Championship game appearances (2000, 2008, 2011 and 2012), four AFC North division titles (2003, 2006, 2011 and 2012), and are currently the only team in the NFL to hold a perfect record in multiple Super Bowl and <a href="NFL%20on%20Thanksgiving%20Day">Thanksgiving Day</a> appearances. The Ravens organization has been led by general manager <a href="Ozzie%20Newsome">Ozzie Newsome</a> since 1996, and has had three head coaches: <a href="Ted%20Marchibroda">Ted Marchibroda</a>, <a href="Brian%20Billick">Brian Billick</a>, and <a href="John%20Harbaugh">John Harbaugh</a>. With a record-breaking defensive unit in their <a href="2000%20Baltimore%20Ravens%20season">2000 season</a>, the team established a reputation for relying on strong defensive play, led by players like middle linebacker <a href="Ray%20Lewis">Ray Lewis</a>, who, until his retirement, was considered the "face of the franchise." The team is owned by <a href="Steve%20Bisciotti">Steve Bisciotti</a> and valued at $1.5 billion, making the Ravens the 24th-most valuable sports franchise in the world.
The name "Ravens" was inspired by <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Raven">The Raven</a>". Chosen in a fan contest that drew 33,288 voters, the allusion honors Poe, who spent the early part of his career in Baltimore and is buried there. As the "<a href="Baltimore%20Sun">Baltimore Sun</a>" reported at the time, fans also "liked the tie-in with the other birds in town, <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">the Orioles</a>, and found it easy to visualize a tough, menacing black bird."

After the <a href="Baltimore%20Colts%20relocation%20to%20Indianapolis">controversial relocation</a> of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Baltimore%20Colts">Colts</a> to Indianapolis, several attempts were made to bring an NFL team back to Baltimore. In 1993, ahead of the 1995 league expansion, the city was considered a favorite, behind only <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, to be granted one of two new franchises. League officials and team owners feared litigation due to conflicts between rival bidding groups if St. Louis was awarded a franchise, and in October <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a> was the first city chosen. Several weeks later, Baltimore's bid for a franchise—dubbed the <a href="Baltimore%20Bombers%20%28proposed%20NFL%20team%29">Baltimore Bombers</a>, in honor of the locally produced <a href="Martin%20B-26%20Marauder">Martin B-26 Marauder</a> <a href="bomber">bomber</a>—had three ownership groups in place and a state financial package which included a proposed $200 million, rent-free stadium and permission to charge up to $80 million in personal seat license fees. Baltimore, however, was unexpectedly passed over in favor of <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, despite Jacksonville's minor TV market status and that the city had withdrawn from contention in the summer, only to return with then-Commissioner <a href="Paul%20Tagliabue">Paul Tagliabue</a>'s urging. Although league officials denied that any city had been favored, it was reported that Taglibue and his longtime friend <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> owner <a href="Jack%20Kent%20Cooke">Jack Kent Cooke</a> had lobbied against Baltimore due to its proximity to Washington, D.C., and that Taglibue had used the initial committee voting system to prevent the entire league ownership from voting on Baltimore's bid. This led to public outrage and the "<a href="Baltimore%20Sun">Baltimore Sun</a>" describing Taglibue as having an "Anybody But Baltimore" policy. Maryland governor <a href="William%20Donald%20Schaefer">William Donald Schaefer</a> said afterward that Taglibue had led him on, praising Baltimore and the proposed owners while working behind-the-scenes to oppose Baltimore's bid.

By May 1994, <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> owner <a href="Peter%20Angelos">Peter Angelos</a> had gathered a new group of investors, including author <a href="Tom%20Clancy">Tom Clancy</a>, to bid on teams whose owners had expressed interest in relocating. Angelos found a potential partner in <a href="Georgia%20Frontiere">Georgia Frontiere</a>, who was open to moving the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a> to Baltimore. Jack Kent Cooke opposed the move, intending to build the Redskins' new stadium in <a href="Laurel%2C%20Maryland">Laurel, Maryland</a>, close enough to Baltimore to cool outside interest in bringing in a new franchise. This led to heated arguments between Cooke and Angelos, who accused Cooke of being a "<a href="carpetbagger">carpetbagger</a>." The league eventually persuaded Rams team president John Shaw to relocate to St. Louis instead, leading to a league-wide rumor that Tagliabue was again steering interest away from Baltimore, a claim which Tagliabue denied. In response to anger in Baltimore, including Governor Schaefer's threat to announce over the loudspeakers Tagliabue's exact location in <a href="Camden%20Yards">Camden Yards</a> any time he attended a <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> game, Tagliabue remarked of Baltimore's financial package: "Maybe (Baltimore) can open another museum with that money." Following this, Angelos made an unsuccessful $200 million bid to bring the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> to Baltimore.

Having failed to obtain a franchise via the expansion, the city, despite having "misgivings," turned to the possibility of obtaining the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, whose owner <a href="Art%20Modell">Art Modell</a> was financially struggling and at odds with the city of Cleveland over needed improvements to the team's stadium.

Enticed by Baltimore's available funds for a first-class stadium and a promised yearly operating subsidy of $25 million dollars, Modell announced on November 6, 1995 his intention to relocate the team from Cleveland to Baltimore the following year. The resulting <a href="Cleveland%20Browns%20relocation%20controversy">controversy</a> ended when representatives of Cleveland and the NFL reached a settlement on February 8, 1996. Tagliabue promised the city of Cleveland that an NFL team would be located in Cleveland, either through relocation or expansion, "no later than 1999". Additionally, the agreement stipulated that the Browns' name, colors, uniform design and franchise records would remain in Cleveland. The franchise history includes Browns club records and connections with <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> players. Modell's Baltimore team, while retaining all current player contracts, would, for purposes of team history, appear as an <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>, a new franchise. Not all players, staff or front office would make the move to Baltimore, however.

After relocation, Modell hired <a href="Ted%20Marchibroda">Ted Marchibroda</a> as the head coach for his new team in Baltimore. Marchibroda was already well known because of his work as head coach of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> during the 1970s and the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> during the early 1990s. <a href="Ozzie%20Newsome">Ozzie Newsome</a>, the Browns' tight end for many seasons, joined Modell in Baltimore as director of football operations. He was later promoted to vice-president/general manager.

The home stadium for the Ravens first two seasons was Baltimore's <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Baltimore%29">Memorial Stadium</a>, home field of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> and <a href="Baltimore%20Stallions">Baltimore Stallions</a> years before. The Ravens moved to their own new stadium next to <a href="Camden%20Yards">Camden Yards</a> in 1998. Raven Stadium would subsequently wear the names <a href="PSINet">PSI Net</a> Stadium and then <a href="M%26amp%3BT%20Bank%20Stadium">M&T Bank Stadium</a>.

In the <a href="1996%20NFL%20Draft">1996 NFL Draft</a>, the Ravens, with two picks in the first round, drafted offensive tackle <a href="Jonathan%20Ogden">Jonathan Ogden</a> at No. 4 overall and linebacker <a href="Ray%20Lewis">Ray Lewis</a> at No. 26 overall.
The 1996 Ravens won their opening game against the <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>, but finished the season 4–12 despite receiver <a href="Michael%20Jackson%20%28wide%20receiver%29">Michael Jackson</a> leading the league with 14 touchdown catches.

The 1997 Ravens started 3–1. <a href="Peter%20Boulware">Peter Boulware</a>, a rookie defender from <a href="Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football">Florida State</a>, recorded 11.5 sacks and was named AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year. The team finished 6–9–1. On October 26, the team made its first trip to <a href="Landover%2C%20Maryland">Landover, Maryland</a> to play their new <a href="Baltimore-Washington%20Metropolitan%20Area">regional rivals</a>, the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>, for the first time in the regular season, at the new <a href="FedExField">Jack Kent Cooke Stadium</a> (replacing the still-standing <a href="RFK%20Stadium">RFK Stadium</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, DC</a>). The Ravens won the game 20–17.

Quarterback <a href="Vinny%20Testaverde">Vinny Testaverde</a> left for the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a> before the <a href="1998%20NFL%20season">1998 season</a>, and was replaced by former Indianapolis Colt <a href="Jim%20Harbaugh">Jim Harbaugh</a>, and later <a href="Eric%20Zeier">Eric Zeier</a>. Cornerback <a href="Rod%20Woodson">Rod Woodson</a> joined the team after a successful stint with the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, and <a href="Priest%20Holmes">Priest Holmes</a> started getting the first playing time of his career and ran for 1,000 yards.

The Ravens finished 1998 with a 6–10 record. On November 29, the Ravens welcomed the Colts back to Baltimore for the first time in 15 years. Amidst a shower of negative cheers towards the Colts, the Ravens, with Jim Harbaugh at quarterback, won 38–31.

Three consecutive losing seasons under Marchibroda led to a change in the head coach. <a href="Brian%20Billick">Brian Billick</a> took over as head coach in <a href="1999%20NFL%20season">1999</a>. Billick had been offensive coordinator for the record-setting <a href="Minnesota%20Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a> the season before. Quarterback <a href="Tony%20Banks%20%28quarterback%29">Tony Banks</a> came to Baltimore from the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Rams">St. Louis Rams</a> and had the best season of his career with 17 touchdown passes and an 81.2 pass rating. He was joined by receiver <a href="Qadry%20Ismail">Qadry Ismail</a>, who posted a 1,000-yard season. The Ravens initially struggled with a record of 4–7 but managed to finish with an 8–8 record.

Due to continual financial hardships for the organization, the NFL took an unusual move and directed Modell to initiate the sale of his franchise. On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to <a href="Steve%20Bisciotti">Steve Bisciotti</a>. In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004 the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti's purchase of the majority stake in the club.

Banks shared playing time in the 2000 regular season with <a href="Trent%20Dilfer">Trent Dilfer</a>. Both players put up decent numbers (and a 1,364-yard rushing season by rookie <a href="Jamal%20Lewis">Jamal Lewis</a> helped too) but the defense became the team's hallmark and bailed a struggling offense out in many instances through the season. <a href="Ray%20Lewis%20%28American%20football%29">Ray Lewis</a> was named Defensive Player of the Year. Two of his defensive teammates, <a href="Sam%20Adams%20%28football%20player%29">Sam Adams</a> and <a href="Rod%20Woodson">Rod Woodson</a>, made the <a href="Pro%20Bowl">Pro Bowl</a>. Baltimore's season started strong with a 5–1 record. But the team struggled through mid-season, at one point going five games without scoring an offensive touchdown. The team regrouped and won each of their last seven games, finishing 12–4 and making the <a href="NFL%20playoffs%2C%202000-01">playoffs</a> for the first time.

During the 2000 season, the Ravens defense broke two notable NFL records. They held opposing teams to 165 total points, surpassing the <a href="1985%20Chicago%20Bears%20season">1985 Chicago Bears</a> mark of 198 points for a 16-game season as well as surpassing the <a href="1986%20Chicago%20Bears%20season">1986 Chicago Bears</a> mark of 187 points for a 16-game season, which at that time was the current NFL record.

Since the divisional rival <a href="2000%20Tennessee%20Titans%20season">Tennessee Titans</a> had a record of 13–3, the Ravens had to play in the <a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29%23National%20Football%20League">wild card</a> round. They dominated the <a href="2000%20Denver%20Broncos%20season">Denver Broncos</a> 21–3 in their first game. In the divisional playoff, they went on the road to Tennessee. With the score tied 10–10 in the fourth quarter, an <a href="Al%20Del%20Greco">Al Del Greco</a> <a href="field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> attempt was blocked and returned for a touchdown by Anthony Mitchell, and a <a href="Ray%20Lewis%20%28American%20football%29">Ray Lewis</a> interception return for a score put the game squarely in Baltimore's favor. The 24–10 win put the Ravens in the <a href="AFC%20Championship">AFC Championship</a> against the <a href="2000%20Oakland%20Raiders%20season">Oakland Raiders</a>. The game was rarely in doubt. <a href="Shannon%20Sharpe">Shannon Sharpe</a>'s 96-yard touchdown catch early in the second quarter followed by an injury to Raiders quarterback <a href="Rich%20Gannon">Rich Gannon</a> were crucial as the Ravens won easily, 16–3.

Baltimore then went to <a href="Tampa">Tampa</a> for <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXV">Super Bowl XXXV</a> against the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a>. The game was also dominated by the Ravens. They recorded four sacks and forced five turnovers, one of which was a <a href="Kerry%20Collins">Kerry Collins</a> interception returned for a touchdown by <a href="Duane%20Starks">Duane Starks</a>. The Giants' only score was a <a href="Ron%20Dixon">Ron Dixon</a> kickoff return for another touchdown; however, the Ravens immediately countered with a return by <a href="Jermaine%20Lewis%20%28American%20football%2C%20born%201974%29">Jermaine Lewis</a>. The Ravens became champions with a 34–7 win, becoming only the third <a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29%23National%20Football%20League">wild card</a> team to win a Super Bowl championship.

In <a href="2001%20NFL%20season">2001</a>, the Ravens attempted to defend their title with <a href="Elvis%20Grbac">Elvis Grbac</a> as their new starting quarterback, but a season-ending injury to <a href="Jamal%20Lewis">Jamal Lewis</a> on the first day of training camp and poor offensive performances stymied the team. After a 3–3 start, the Ravens defeated the <a href="Minnesota%20Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a> in the final week to clinch a wild card berth at 10–6. In the first round the Ravens showed flashes of their previous year with a 20–3 win over the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>, in which the team forced three turnovers and out-gained the Dolphins 347 yards to 151. In the divisional playoff the Ravens played the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. Three interceptions by Grbac ended the Ravens' season, as they lost 27–10.

Baltimore ran into <a href="salary%20cap">salary cap</a> problems entering the 2002 season and was forced to part with a number of impact players. In the NFL Draft, the team selected <a href="Ed%20Reed">Ed Reed</a> with the 24th overall pick. Reed would go on to become one of the best safeties in NFL history, making nine Pro Bowls until leaving the Ravens for the Houston Texans in 2013. Despite low expectations, the Ravens stayed somewhat competitive in 2002 until a losing streak in December eliminated any chances of a post-season berth. Their final record that year was 7–9.

In <a href="2003%20NFL%20season">2003</a>, the Ravens drafted their new quarterback, <a href="Kyle%20Boller">Kyle Boller</a>, but he was injured midway through the season and was replaced by <a href="Anthony%20Wright%20%28quarterback%29">Anthony Wright</a>. Jamal Lewis ran for 2,066 yards (including a record 295 yards in one game against the <a href="2003%20Cleveland%20Browns%20season">Cleveland Browns</a> on September 14). With a 10–6 record, Baltimore won their first <a href="AFC%20North">AFC North</a> division title. Their first playoff game, at home against the <a href="2003%20Tennessee%20Titans%20season">Tennessee Titans</a>, went back and forth, with the Ravens being held to only 54 yards total rushing. The Titans won 20–17 on a late field goal, and Baltimore's season ended early.

Ray Lewis was also named Defensive Player of the year for the second time in his career.

In April 2003, <a href="Art%20Modell">Art Modell</a> sold 49% of the team to <a href="Steve%20Bisciotti">Steve Bisciotti</a>, a local businessman who had made his fortune in the temporary staffing field. After the season, Art Modell sold his remaining 51% ownership to Bisciotti, ending over 40 years of tenure as an NFL franchise owner.

The Ravens did not make the playoffs in <a href="2004%20NFL%20season">2004</a> and finished the season with a record of 9–7 with <a href="Kyle%20Boller">Kyle Boller</a> spending the season at QB. They did get good play from veteran corner <a href="Deion%20Sanders">Deion Sanders</a> and third year safety <a href="Ed%20Reed">Ed Reed</a>, who won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. They were also the only team to defeat the 15–1 <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> in the regular season.

In the 2005 offseason the Ravens looked to augment their receiving corps (which was second-worst in the NFL in 2004) by signing <a href="Derrick%20Mason">Derrick Mason</a> from the Titans and drafting star Oklahoma wide receiver <a href="Mark%20J.%20Clayton">Mark Clayton</a> in the first round of the <a href="2005%20NFL%20Draft">2005 NFL Draft</a>. However, the Ravens ended their season 6–10, but defeated the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> 48–3 on <a href="Monday%20Night%20Football">Monday Night Football</a> and the Super Bowl champion Steelers.

The 2006 Baltimore Ravens season began with the team trying to improve on their 6–10 record of 2005. The Ravens, for the first time in franchise history, started 4–0, under the leadership of former Titans quarterback <a href="Steve%20McNair">Steve McNair</a>.

The Ravens lost two straight games mid-season on offensive troubles, prompting coach Billick to drop their offensive coordinator <a href="Jim%20Fassel">Jim Fassel</a> in their week seven bye. After the bye, and with Billick calling the offense, Baltimore would record a five-game win streak before losing to the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> in week 13.

Still ranked second overall to first-place <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a>, the Ravens continued on. They defeated the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, and held the defending Super Bowl champion <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> to only one touchdown at <a href="Heinz%20Field">Heinz Field</a>, allowing the Ravens to clinch the <a href="AFC%20North">AFC North</a>.

The Ravens ended the regular season with a franchise-best 13–3 record. Baltimore had secured the AFC North title, the No. 2 AFC playoff seed, and clinched a 1st-round bye by season's end. The Ravens were slated to face the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> in the second round of the playoffs, in the first meeting of the two teams in the playoffs. Many Baltimore and Indianapolis fans saw this historic meeting as a sort of "Judgment Day" with the new team of Baltimore facing the old team of Baltimore (the former Baltimore Colts having left Baltimore under questionable circumstances in 1984). Both Indianapolis and Baltimore were held to scoring only field goals as the two defenses slugged it out all over M&T Bank Stadium. McNair threw two costly interceptions, including one at the 1-yard line. The eventual Super Bowl champion Colts won 15–6, ending Baltimore's season.

After a stellar 2006 season, the Ravens hoped to improve upon their 13–3 record but injuries and poor play plagued the team. The Ravens finished the <a href="2007%20NFL%20season">2007 season</a> in the AFC North cellar with a disappointing 5–11 record. A humiliating 22–16 overtime loss to the previously winless <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> on December 16 ultimately led to Billick's dismissal on New Year's Eve, one day after the end of the regular season. He was replaced by John Harbaugh, the special teams coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and the older brother of former Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh (1998).

With rookies at head coach (<a href="John%20Harbaugh">John Harbaugh</a>) and quarterback (<a href="Joe%20Flacco">Joe Flacco</a>), the Ravens entered the 2008 campaign with lots of uncertainty. Baltimore smartly recovered in 2008, winning eleven games and achieving a wild card spot in the postseason. On the strength of four interceptions, one resulting in an <a href="Ed%20Reed">Ed Reed</a> touchdown, the Ravens began its postseason run by winning a rematch over Miami 27–9 at <a href="Dolphin%20Stadium">Dolphin Stadium</a> on January 4, 2009 in a wild-card game. Six days later, they advanced to the <a href="AFC%20Championship%20Game">AFC Championship Game</a> by avenging a Week 5 loss to the Titans 13–10 at <a href="LP%20Field">LP Field</a> on a <a href="Matt%20Stover">Matt Stover</a> field goal with 53 seconds left in regulation time. The Ravens fell one victory short of <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLIII">Super Bowl XLIII</a> by losing to the Steelers 23–14 at <a href="Heinz%20Field">Heinz Field</a> on January 18, 2009.

In <a href="2009%20NFL%20season">2009</a>, the Ravens won their first three matches, then lost the next three, including a close match in <a href="2009%20Minnesota%20Vikings%20season">Minnesota</a>. The rest of the season was an uneven string of wins and losses, which included a home victory over Pittsburgh in overtime followed by a Monday Night loss in <a href="2009%20Green%20Bay%20Packers%20season">Green Bay</a>. That game was notable for the huge number of penalties committed, costing a total of 310 yards, and almost tying with the record set by <a href="1976%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season">Tampa Bay</a> and <a href="1976%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season">Seattle</a> in <a href="1976%20NFL%20season">1976</a>. Afterwards, the Ravens easily crushed the <a href="2009%20Detroit%20Lions%20season">Lions</a> and <a href="2009%20Chicago%20Bears%20season">Bears</a>, giving up less than ten points in both games. The next match was against the <a href="2009%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season">Steelers</a>, where Baltimore lost a close one before beating the <a href="2009%20Oakland%20Raiders%20season">Raiders</a> to end the season. With a record of 9–7, the team finished second in the division and gained another wild card. Moving into the playoffs, they overwhelmed the <a href="2009%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">Patriots</a>; nevertheless they did not reach the AFC Championship because they were routed 20–3 by the <a href="2009%20Indianapolis%20Colts%20season">Colts</a> in the divisional round a week later.

Baltimore managed to beat the Jets 10–9 on the 2010 opener, but then lost a poorly-played game against Cincinnati the following week. The Ravens rebounded against the other two division teams, beating Cleveland 24–17 in Week 3 and then Pittsburgh 17–14 in Week 4. The Ravens scored a fine win (31–17) at home against Denver in Week 5. After an overtime loss to New England, they narrowly avoided losing at home to the winless Bills. Next, the Ravens hosted Miami and won 26–10, breaking that team's 4–0 road streak. On Thursday Night, the team headed to Atlanta and lost 26–21 in a game that had some criticizing the officiating. The Ravens finished the season 12–4, second in the division due to a tiebreaker with Pittsburgh, and earning a wild card spot. Baltimore headed to Kansas City and crushed the unprepared Chiefs 34–7, but once again were knocked from the playoffs by Pittsburgh in a hard-fought battle.

The Ravens hosted their arch-enemy in Week 1 of the 2011 season. On a hot, humid day in M&T Bank Stadium, crowd noise and multiple Steelers mistakes allowed Baltimore to crush them with three touchdowns 35–7. The frustrated Pittsburgh players also committed several costly penalties. Thus, the Ravens had gained their first ever victory over the Steelers with Ben Roethlisberger playing and avenged themselves of repeated regular and postseason losses in the series.

But in Week 2, the Ravens collapsed in Tennessee and lost 26–13. They rebounded by routing the Rams in Week 3 and then overpowering the Jets 34–17 in Week 4.
Week 5, the Ravens had a bye week, following a game against the Texans. But in Week 7, Baltimore had a stunning MNF upset loss in Jacksonville as they were held to one touchdown in a 12–7 loss. Their final scoring drive failed as Joe Flacco threw an interception in the closing seconds of the game.

After beating the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17 of the regular season, the Ravens advanced to the playoffs as the Number 2 seed in the AFC with a record of 12-4. They gained the distinction of AFC North Champions over Pittsburgh (12-4) due to a tie breaker.

Ravens' Lee Evans was stripped of a 14-yard touchdown pass by the Patriots Sterling Moore with 22 seconds left and Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff pushed a 32-yard field goal attempt wide left on fourth down as the Patriots held on to beat the Ravens 23-20 during the AFC championship game and advance to Super Bowl XLVI.

The Ravens' attempt to convert Joe Flacco into a pocket passer remained a work in progress as the 2012 season began. Terrell Suggs suffered a tendon injury during an off-season basketball game and was unable to play for at least several weeks. In the opener on September 10, Baltimore routed Cincinnati 44-13. After this easy win, the team headed to Philadelphia. The Eagles had struggled during their Week 1 match in Cleveland and were not expected to win, but a bizarre game ensued thanks to the NFL facing another lockout mess, this one involving the league's referees, who were replaced by ex-college officials. The replacement officials were widely criticized throughout the league. This game featured multiple questionable calls that went against the Ravens, perhaps costing them the game 24-23.

Returning home for a primetime rematch of the AFC Championship, another bizarre game ensued. New England picked apart the Baltimore defense (which was considerably weakened without Terrell Suggs and some other players lost over the off-season) for the first half. Trouble began early in the game when a streaker ran out onto the field and had to be tackled by security, and accelerated when, at 2:18 in the 4th quarter, the referees made a holding call on RG <a href="Marshal%20Yanda">Marshal Yanda</a>. Enraged fans repeatedly chanted an obscenity at this penalty. The Ravens finally drove downfield and on the last play of the game, <a href="Justin%20Tucker">Justin Tucker</a> kicked a 27-yard field goal to win the game 31-30, capping off a second intense and controversially-officiated game in a row for the Ravens.

The Ravens would win the AFC North with a 10-6 record, but finished 4th in the AFC playoff seeding, and thus had to play a wild-card game. After defeating the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> 24-9 at home (the final home game of Ray Lewis), the Ravens traveled to Denver to play against the top seeded Broncos. In a very back-and-forth contest, the Ravens pulled out a 38-35 victory in double overtime. They then won their 2nd AFC championship by coming back from a 13-7 halftime deficit to defeat the New England Patriots once again, 28-13.

The Ravens played the <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVII">Super Bowl XLVII</a> on February 3, 2013, against the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>. Baltimore built a 28–6 lead early in the third quarter before a partial <a href="power%20outage">power outage</a> in the Superdome suspended play for 34 minutes (earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl). After play resumed, San Francisco scored 17 unanswered third-quarter points to cut the Ravens' lead, 28–23, and continued to chip away in the fourth quarter. With the Ravens leading late in the game, 34–29, the 49ers advanced to the Baltimore 7-yard line just before the <a href="two-minute%20warning">two-minute warning</a> but turned the ball over on downs. The Ravens then took an intentional <a href="Safety%20%28gridiron%20football%20score%29">safety</a> in the waning moments of the game to preserve the victory. Baltimore quarterback <a href="Joe%20Flacco">Joe Flacco</a>, who completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns, was named Super Bowl MVP.

Coming off as the defending Super Bowl champions, this was the first year in franchise history for the team without Ray Lewis. The Ravens started out 3-2, and started the 2-0 Houston Texans 14-loss streak by shutting them 30-9 in Week 3. However, the Ravens lost their next 3 games, losing to the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers in last-minute field goals and were shut out in an attempt to tie the game against the Cleveland Browns 18-24. 

After winning and losing their next game, the Baltimore Ravens came out 4-6, but managed winning their next four games in dominating the Jets 19-3 in Baltimore, a Steelers win 20-22 during Thanksgiving, a booming ending in Baltimore against the Vikings 29-26, and a 18-16 win at Detroit, including Justin Tucker's 61-yard game-winning field goal. The Ravens were 8-6, with the 6th seed, but after losing their next two games, and the San Diego Chargers winning their next two to clinch the 6th seed, the Ravens finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007.

On January 27, 2014, the Ravens hired former <a href="Houston%20Texans">Houston Texans</a> head coach <a href="Gary%20Kubiak">Gary Kubiak</a> to be their new offensive coordinator after <a href="Jim%20Caldwell%20%28American%20football%29">Jim Caldwell</a> accepted the new available head coaching job with the <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a>. On February 15, 2014, star running back Ray Rice and his fiancée Janay Palmer were arrested and charged with assault after a physical altercation at <a href="Revel%20Atlantic%20City">Revel Casino</a> in <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>. Celebrity news website <a href="TMZ">TMZ</a> posted a video of Rice dragging Palmer's body out of an elevator after apparently knocking her out. For the incident, Rice was initially suspended for the first two games of the <a href="2014%20NFL%20season">2014 NFL season</a> on July 25, 2014, which led to widespread criticism of the NFL.

In Week 1, on September 7, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, 23-16. The next day, on September 8, 2014, <a href="TMZ">TMZ</a> released additional footage from an elevator camera showing Rice punching Palmer. The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's contract as a result, and was later indefinitely suspended by the NFL. Although starting out 0-1 for two straight seasons and having received unwanted media attention for the Ray Rice incident, on September 11, 2014, the Ravens rallied back and beat the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> 26-6, to improve to 1-1. In Week 12, the Ravens traveled down for an interconference battle with the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>, which the Ravens won 34-27, reaching a 4-0 sweep of the NFC south. In Week 16, the Ravens traveled to Houston to take on the Texans. In one of Joe Flacco's worst performances, the offense sputtered against the Houston defense and Flacco threw three interceptions, falling to the Texans 25-13. With their playoff chances and season hanging in the balance, the Ravens took on the Browns in Week 17 at home. After three quarters had gone by and down 10-3, Joe Flacco led the Ravens on a comeback scoring 17 unanswered points, winning 20-10. With the win, and the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Diego Chargers, the Ravens clinched their sixth playoff berth in seven seasons, and the first since winning Super Bowl XLVII.

In the wildcard playoff game, the Ravens won 30-17 against their divisional rivals, the <a href="2014%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, at <a href="Heinz%20Field">Heinz Field</a>. In the next game in the Divisional round, the Ravens faced the <a href="2014%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">New England Patriots</a>. Despite a strong offensive effort and having a 14-point lead twice in the game, the Ravens were defeated by the Patriots 35-31, ending their season.

The 2015 season marked 20 seasons of the franchise's existence, competing in the NFL which the franchise have recognized with a special badge being worn on their uniforms during the 2015 NFL season.
After coming up just short against the Patriots in the playoffs, the Ravens were picked by some to win the AFC and even the Super Bowl. However, they lost key players such as Joe Flacco, <a href="Justin%20Forsett">Justin Forsett</a>, Terrell Suggs, Steve Smith Sr., and Eugene Monroe to season-ending injuries. Injuries and their inability to win close games early in the season led to the first losing season in the John Harbaugh-Flacco era.

The 2016 Ravens improved on their 5–11 record from <a href="2015%20Baltimore%20Ravens%20season">2015</a>, finishing 8–8, but failed to qualify the playoffs for the second straight year. They were eliminated from playoff contention after their Week 16 loss to their division rivals, the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Steelers</a>. This was the first time the Ravens missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons since <a href="2004%20Baltimore%20Ravens%20season">2004</a>–<a href="2005%20Baltimore%20Ravens%20season">2005</a>, as well as the first in the Harbaugh/Flacco era.

By far the team's biggest rival is the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are separated by a less-than-5-hour drive along <a href="Interstate%2070">Interstate 70</a>. Both teams are known for their hard-hitting physical style of play. They play twice a year in the <a href="AFC%20North">AFC North</a>, and have met four times in the playoffs. Games between these two teams usually come down to the wire as most within the last 5 years have come down to 3 points or less.
The rivalry is considered one of the most significant and intense in the <a href="NFL">NFL</a> today.

Although the Steelers rivalry is based on mutual respect and antagonism for each other, the Ravens' rivalry with the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> is fueled by the fans' animosity towards the organization, not contention between the players. This is due to the fact that the then-Colts owner, Robert Irsay, under the threat of eminent domain from the city of Baltimore, was forced to sneak the Colts out of Baltimore in the middle of the night to take them to Indianapolis. During Ravens home games the scoreboard lists the away team simply as "Away" or "Indy" rather than the team name that is traditionally used for the visiting opponent. The PA announcer will also refer to the Colts as the Indianapolis Professional Football Team; although on January 6, 2013 the scoreboard at the playoff game between the Baltimore Ravens and Indianapolis Colts at <a href="M%26amp%3BT%20Bank%20Stadium">M&T Bank Stadium</a> listed the away team as "Colts". The Indianapolis Colts hold an all-time 9–4 advantage over the Baltimore Ravens, including a 2–1 advantage in the playoffs.

The Ravens also have divisional rivalries with the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> and <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>.

The reactivated <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> and their fans maintain a hatred of Baltimore's team due to its move from Cleveland. The rivalry with the Browns has been very one-sided; Baltimore holds an advantage of 27-9 against Cleveland.

The rivalry with Cincinnati has been closer, with both teams tied at 21-21 following the 2016 season.

The Ravens first met the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27–24 loss in the Patriots <a href="2007%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">quest for perfection</a>. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Patriots beat the Ravens 27–21 in a game that involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback <a href="Tom%20Brady">Tom Brady</a> and Ravens linebacker <a href="Terrell%20Suggs">Terrell Suggs</a>. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game. The Ravens faced the Patriots in a 2009 AFC wild card playoff game and won 33–14; the Ravens ran the ball for more than 250 yards.

The Ravens faced the Patriots in Week 6 of the 2010 season; the Ravens ended up losing 23–20 in overtime; the game caused controversy due to a hit to the helmet of tight end <a href="Todd%20Heap">Todd Heap</a> by Patriots safety <a href="Brandon%20Meriweather">Brandon Meriweather</a>.

The Ravens played the Patriots for the third consecutive season, in the 2011 AFC championship game in which the Ravens lost 23–20. The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 20–16 lead in the fourth quarter but Patriots quarterback <a href="Tom%20Brady">Tom Brady</a> dove into the end zone to make the score 23–20 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown. On the Ravens last possession of the game, quarterback <a href="Joe%20Flacco">Joe Flacco</a> threw a pass to wide receiver <a href="Lee%20Evans%20%28American%20football%29">Lee Evans</a> in the corner of the end zone which looked to be the game-winning touchdown, before a last second strip by <a href="Sterling%20Moore">Sterling Moore</a> forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided on a last minute field goal by Ravens <a href="placekicker">placekicker</a> <a href="Billy%20Cundiff">Billy Cundiff</a>. With eleven seconds remaining on the clock, the kicker missed the 32-yard field goal attempt by a very wide margin, allowing the Patriots to kill the clock on their way to <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVI">Super Bowl XLVI</a>.

The Ravens' first regular-season win over the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was emotional as receiver <a href="Torrey%20Smith">Torrey Smith</a> was competing following the death of his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before. Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13–0 deficit in the first half and led 14–13, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20–14 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30–21 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on <a href="Devin%20McCourty">Devin McCourty</a> put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker <a href="Justin%20Tucker">Justin Tucker</a> booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as <a href="Bill%20Belichick">Bill Belichick</a> angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.

The two teams met again on January 20, 2013 in the AFC Championship, where the Ravens won 28–13. The Patriots led at halftime, 13–7, but the Ravens' defense gave up no points in the second half. It was the first time ever that Tom Brady lost a game at home after leading at halftime, and the first time a road team beat the Patriots in the AFC Championship.

On December 22, 2013 the teams met again, this rematch of the AFC championship game was a mismatch from the outset. New England took a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter and never let up behind a defense that forced four turnovers and had four sacks. New England would go on to win the game 41-7.

On January 10, 2015, the two teams would meet in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. Unlike the previous meeting, the Ravens put up a strong offensive performance, leading by 14 points twice in the game. However, Tom Brady would bring the Patriots back by attacking the Ravens vulnerable secondary and taking a 35-31 lead late in the 4th quarter. Joe Flacco would drive to the Patriots side of the field with under two minutes to play in regulation. However, a key interception by Flacco due to a misplay on the ball by Torrey Smith essentially sealed the game in the Patriots favor to send them to the AFC Championship.

The team's first helmet logo, used from 1996 through 1998, featured raven wings outspread from a shield displaying a letter "B" framed by the word "Ravens" overhead and a <a href="cross%20bottony">cross bottony</a> underneath. The <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Fourth%20Circuit">US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> affirmed a jury verdict that the logo <a href="Copyright%20infringement">infringed</a> on a <a href="copyright">copyright</a> retained by Frederick E. Bouchat, an amateur artist and security guard in Maryland, but that he was entitled to only three dollars in damages from the NFL.

Bouchat had submitted his design to the Maryland Stadium Authority by fax after learning that Baltimore was to acquire an NFL team. He was not credited for the design when the logo was announced. Bouchat sued the team, claiming to be the designer of the emblem; representatives of the team asserted that the image had been designed independently. The court ruled in favor of Bouchat, noting that team owner Modell had access to Bouchat's work. Bouchat's fax had gone to John Moag, the Maryland Stadium Authority chairman, whose office was located in the same building as Modell's. Bouchat ultimately was not awarded monetary compensation in the damages phase of the case.

The "<a href="Baltimore%20Sun">Baltimore Sun</a>" ran a poll showing three designs for new helmet logos. Fans participating in the poll expressed a preference for a raven's head in profile over other designs. <a href="Art%20Modell">Art Modell</a> announced that he would honor this preference but still wanted a letter "B" to appear somewhere in the design. The new Ravens logo featured a raven's head in profile with the letter superimposed. The secondary logo is a shield that honors Baltimore's history of <a href="heraldry">heraldry</a>. Alternating Calvert and Crossland emblems (seen also in the <a href="flag%20of%20Maryland">flag of Maryland</a> and the <a href="flag%20of%20Baltimore">flag of Baltimore</a>) are interlocked with stylized letters "B" and "R".

The design of the Ravens uniform has remained essentially unchanged since the team's inaugural season in 1996. Art Modell admitted to ESPN's Roy Firestone that the Ravens' colors, introduced in early 1996, were inspired by the <a href="Northwestern%20Wildcats">Northwestern Wildcats</a> 1995 dream season. Helmets are <a href="black">black</a> with <a href="purple">purple</a> "talon" stripes rising from the facemask to the crown. Players normally wear purple jerseys at home and white jerseys on the road. In 1996 the team wore black pants with a single large white stripe for all games. At home games the combination of black pants with purple jersey made the Ravens the first NFL team to wear dark colors head to calf. A number of NFL teams have since donned the look, beginning with the all-black home uniform worn in three games by the 2001 <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>.

In 1997 the Ravens opted for a more classic NFL look with white pants sporting stripes in purple and black, along with the jerseys sporting a different font for the uniform numbers. The white pants were worn with both home and road jerseys. The road uniform (white pants with white jerseys) was worn by the Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV, at the end of the 2000 NFL season.

In the 2002 season the Ravens began the practice of wearing white jerseys for the home opener and, occasionally, other early games in the season that have a 1:00 kickoff. Since John Harbaugh became the head coach in 2008, the Ravens have also worn their white jerseys at home for preseason games.

In November 2004 the team introduced an alternate uniform design featuring black jerseys and solid black pants with black socks. The all-black uniform was first worn for a home game against the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, entitled "Pitch Black" night, that resulted in a Ravens win. The uniform has since been worn for select prime-time national game broadcasts and other games of significance.

The Ravens began wearing black pants again with the white jersey in 2008. On December 7, 2008, during a Sunday Night Football game against the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>, the Ravens introduced a new combination of black jersey with white pants. It was believed to be due to the fact that John Harbaugh doesn't like the "blackout" look. However, on December 19, 2010, the Ravens wore their black jerseys and black pants in a 30–24 victory over the New Orleans Saints.

On December 5, 2010, the Ravens reverted to the black pants with the purple jerseys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers during NBC's "Sunday Night Football" telecast. The Ravens lost to the Steelers 13–10. They wore the same look again for their game against the Cleveland Browns on December 24, 2011, and they won, 20–14. They wore this combination a third time against the <a href="Houston%20Texans">Houston Texans</a> on January 15, 2012 in the AFC Divisional playoff. They won 20–13. They would again wear this combination on January 6, 2013, during the <a href="2012-13%20NFL%20playoffs">AFC Wild Card playoff</a> and what turned out to be Ray Lewis' final home game, where they defeated the Indianapolis Colts 24-9.

From their inaugural season until 2006, the Ravens wore white cleats with their uniforms; they switched to black cleats in 2007.

On December 20, 2015, the team unexpectedly debuted gold pants for the first time, wearing them with their regular purple jerseys against the Kansas City Chiefs. Although gold is an official accent color of the Ravens, the pants got an overwhelmingly negative response on <a href="social%20media">social media</a> by both Ravens fans and fans of other NFL teams, with some comparisons being made to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers' pants.

The team marching band is called <a href="Baltimore%27s%20Marching%20Ravens">Baltimore's Marching Ravens</a>. They began as the Colts' marching band and have operated continuously from September 7, 1947 to the present. They helped campaign for football to return to Baltimore after the Colts moved. Because they stayed in Baltimore after the Colts left, the band is nicknamed "the band that would not die" and were the subject of <a href="The%20Band%20that%20Wouldn%27t%20Die">an episode</a> of ESPN's "<a href="30%20for%2030">30 for 30</a>". The <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> are the only other NFL team that currently has a marching band.

The Ravens do not officially have retired numbers. However, the number 19 is not issued out of respect for <a href="History%20of%20the%20Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> quarterback <a href="Johnny%20Unitas">Johnny Unitas</a>, except for quarterback <a href="Scott%20Mitchell%20%28quarterback%29">Scott Mitchell</a> in his lone season in Baltimore in 1999. In addition, numbers 75, 52, and 20, in honor of <a href="Jonathan%20Ogden">Jonathan Ogden</a>, <a href="Ray%20Lewis">Ray Lewis</a>, and <a href="Ed%20Reed">Ed Reed</a> respectively, have not been issued since those players' retirements from football. The number 3 has been in very limited circulation (offseason only) in respect to former kicker <a href="Matt%20Stover">Matt Stover</a>.

The Ravens have a "Ring of Honor" which is on permanent display encircling the field of M&T Bank Stadium. The ring currently honors the following, including 8 former members of the <a href="Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a>. Bold Numbers are those whose numbers have not been issued or reissued after a player's time in Baltimore:

The Baltimore Ravens had their first draft in 1996, where they selected offensive lineman from UCLA and current <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">NFL Hall of Famer</a>, and 11-time Pro-Bowler <a href="Jonathan%20Ogden">Jonathan Ogden</a>. Along with their pick in the next year's draft, this was the highest first-round draft pick that the Ravens have had. They also selected <a href="Ray%20Lewis">Ray Lewis</a> with the 26th pick. In both 1996 and 2000, the Ravens had two first-round draft picks. However, in 2004 they had none. In their history, the Ravens have drafted 4 offensive linemen, 3 linebackers, 2 wide receivers, 2 cornerbacks, 2 quarterbacks, a running back, tight end, safety, and defensive tackle. The Ravens have 56 combined Pro-Bowl appearances from their first-round draft picks.

British National Party

The British National Party (BNP) is a <a href="Far-right%20politics">far-right</a> and <a href="Fascism">fascist</a> <a href="list%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">political party in the United Kingdom</a>. It is headquartered in <a href="Wigton">Wigton</a>, <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>, and its current leader is <a href="Adam%20Walker%20%28British%20politician%29">Adam Walker</a>. A <a href="minor%20party">minor party</a>, it currently has one councillor in UK local government. During its heyday in the 2000s, it had over fifty seats in local government, one seat on the <a href="London%20Assembly">London Assembly</a>, and two <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">Members of the European Parliament</a>.

The BNP was formed in 1982 by <a href="John%20Tyndall%20%28politician%29">John Tyndall</a> and other former members of the <a href="National%20Front%20%28UK%29">National Front</a> (NF). By Tyndall's admission, it remained ideologically identical to the NF, and took its name from that of a <a href="British%20National%20Party%20%281960%29">defunct 1960s party</a>. During its first two decades, the BNP placed little emphasis on contesting elections, in which it did poorly, but rather focused on street marches and rallies. A growing 'moderniser' faction was frustrated by Tyndall's leadership and in 1999 ousted him. The new leader <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> sought to broaden the BNP's electoral base by moderating some of its policies, targeting concerns about rising immigration rates, and emphasising localised community campaigns. This resulted in increased electoral growth throughout the 2000s, to the extent that it became the most electorally successful far-right party in British history. Concerns regarding financial mismanagement resulted in Griffin being ousted in 2014. By this point the BNP's membership and vote share had declined dramatically, and members had split to form rival groups like <a href="Britain%20First">Britain First</a>.

Ideologically positioned on the extreme or far-right of British politics, the BNP has been characterised as fascist or <a href="Neo-fascism">neo-fascist</a> by <a href="political%20science">political scientists</a>. Under Tyndall's leadership, it was more specifically regarded as <a href="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazi</a>. The party is <a href="ethnic%20nationalism">ethnic nationalist</a>, and it espouses the view that only <a href="white%20people">white people</a> should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls for an end to non-white migration into the UK and the removal of settled non-white populations from the country. Initially, it called for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites, although it has since advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes <a href="scientific%20racism">biological racism</a> and the <a href="white%20genocide%20conspiracy%20theory">white genocide conspiracy theory</a>, calling for global <a href="racial%20segregation">racial separatism</a> and condemning <a href="Miscegenation">mixed-race relationships</a>. Under Tyndall, the BNP emphasised <a href="Antisemitism">anti-semitism</a> and <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust denial</a>, although Griffin switched the party's focus on to <a href="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>. It promotes <a href="economic%20protectionism">economic protectionism</a>, <a href="Euroscepticism">Euroscepticism</a>, and a transformation away from <a href="liberal%20democracy">liberal democracy</a>, while its social policies oppose <a href="feminism">feminism</a>, <a href="LGBT%20rights">LGBT rights</a>, and <a href="permissive%20society">societal permissiveness</a>.

The BNP has a highly centralised structure that gives its chairman near total control. It established a range of sub-groups—such as a youth wing, record label, and trade union—and built links with extreme-right parties across Europe. Regarded as the most successful far-right party in British history, the BNP attracted most support from within <a href="White%20British">White British</a> working-class communities in Northern and Eastern England, particularly among middle-aged and elderly men. More widely, it was highly unpopular and faced much opposition from <a href="anti-fascism">anti-fascist</a>s, religious organisations, and mainstream politicians and media. BNP members were banned from a number of professions and polling suggested that a majority of Britons favoured the party's criminalisation.

The British National Party (BNP) was founded by the extreme-right political activist <a href="John%20Tyndall%20%28politician%29">John Tyndall</a>. Tyndall had been involved in <a href="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazi</a> groups since the late 1950s before leading the far-right <a href="National%20Front%20%28UK%29">National Front</a> (NF) throughout most of the 1970s. Following an argument with senior party member <a href="Martin%20Webster">Martin Webster</a>, he resigned from the NF in 1980. In June 1980 Tyndall established a rival, the New National Front (NNF). At the recommendation of <a href="Ray%20Hill">Ray Hill</a>—who was secretly an <a href="anti-fascism">anti-fascist</a> spy seeking to sow disharmony among Britain's far-right—Tyndall decided to unite an array of extreme-right groups as a single party. To this end, Tyndall established a Committee for Nationalist Unity (CNU) in January 1982. In March 1982, the CNU held a conference at the <a href="Charing%20Cross%20Hotel">Charing Cross Hotel</a> in London, at which 50 far-right activists agreed to the formation of the BNP.

The BNP was formally launched on 7 April 1982 at a press conference in <a href="Victoria%2C%20London">Victoria</a>. Led by Tyndall, most of its early members came from the NNF, although others were defectors from the NF, <a href="British%20Movement">British Movement</a>, <a href="British%20Democratic%20Party">British Democratic Party</a>, and <a href="Constitutional%20Movement">Nationalist Party</a>. Tyndall remarked that there was "scarcely any difference [between the BNP and NF] in ideology or policy save in the minutest detail", and most of the BNP's leading activists had formerly been senior NF figures. Under Tyndall's leadership the party was Neo-Nazi in orientation and engaged in nostalgia for <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. It adopted the NF's tactic of holding street marches and rallies, believing that these boosted morale and attracted new recruits. Their first march took place in London on <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Day">St. George's Day</a> 1982. These marches often involved clashes with anti-fascist protesters and resulted in multiple arrests, helping to cement the BNP's association with political violence and older <a href="fascism">fascist</a> groups in the public eye. As a result, BNP organisers began to favour indoor rallies, although street marches continued to be held throughout the mid-to-late 1980s.

In its early years, the BNP's involvement in elections was "irregular and intermittent", and for its first two decades it faced consistent electoral failure. It suffered from low finances and few personnel, and its leadership was aware that its electoral viability was weakened by the anti-immigration rhetoric of <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201983">1983 general election</a>, the BNP stood 54 candidates although could only campaign in five seats. It averaged a vote share of 0.06% in the seats it contested although had been able to air its first <a href="party%20political%20broadcast">party political broadcast</a>.
After the <a href="Representation%20of%20the%20People%20Act%201985">Representation of the People Act 1985</a> raised the electoral <a href="Deposit%20%28politics%29">deposit</a> to £500, the BNP adopted a policy of "very limited involvement" in elections. It abstained in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201987">1987 general election</a>, and stood only 13 candidates in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201992">1992 general election</a>. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%201993">1993 local elections</a>, the BNP gained one council seat—won by <a href="Derek%20Beackon">Derek Beackon</a> in the East London town of <a href="Millwall">Millwall</a>—after a campaign that played to local whites who were angry at the perceived preferential treatment received by Bangladeshi migrants in <a href="social%20housing">social housing</a>. However, following an anti-BNP campaign launched by local religious groups and the <a href="Anti-Nazi%20League">Anti-Nazi League</a> it lost this seat during the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%201994">1994 local elections</a>. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997">1997 general election</a>, it contested 55 seats and gained an average 1.4% of the vote.

In the early 1990s, the paramilitary group <a href="Combat%2018">Combat 18</a> (C18)—its name a reference to <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>—was formed to protect BNP events from anti-fascists. In 1992, C18 carried out attacks on left-wing targets like an <a href="anarchism">anarchist</a> bookshop and the headquarters of the "<a href="Morning%20Star%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Morning Star</a>". Tyndall was angered by C18's growing influence on the BNP's street activities, and by August 1993, C18 activists were physically clashing with other BNP members. In December 1993, Tyndall issued a bulletin to BNP branches declaring C18 to be a proscribed organisation, furthermore suggesting that it may have been established by agents of the state to discredit the party. To counter the group's influence among militant British nationalists, he secured the American white nationalist militant <a href="William%20Luther%20Pierce">William Pierce</a> as a guest speaker at the BNP's annual rally in November 1995.

In the early 1990s, a "moderniser" faction emerged within the party, favouring a more electorally palatable strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections. They were impressed by the electoral gains made by a number of extreme-right parties in continental Europe—such as <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Haider">Jörg Haider</a>'s <a href="Austrian%20Freedom%20Party">Austrian Freedom Party</a> and <a href="Jean-Marie%20Le%20Pen">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>'s <a href="National%20Front%20%28France%29">National Front</a>—which had been achieved by both switching focus from <a href="biological%20racism">biological racism</a> to the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups and by replacing anti-democratic platforms with <a href="populism">populist</a> ones. 
The modernisers called for community campaigns among the white working-class populations of London's <a href="East%20End">East End</a>, and Northern England. While the modernisers gained some concessions from the party's hard-liners, Tyndall opposed many of their ideas and sought to stem their growing influence. In his view, "we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves in order to make our features more appealing to the public".

After the BNP's poor performance at the 1997 general election, opposition to Tyndall's leadership grew. The modernisers called the party's first leadership election, and in October 1999 Tyndall was ousted when two-thirds of those voting backed <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a>, who offered an improved administration, financial transparency, and greater support for local branches. Often characterised as a political chameleon, Griffin had once been considered a party hardliner before switching allegiance to the modernisers in the late 1990s. In his youth, he had been involved in the NF as well as <a href="Third%20Position">Third Position</a>ist groups like <a href="Political%20Soldier">Political Soldier</a> and the <a href="International%20Third%20Position">International Third Position</a>. Criticising his predecessors for fuelling the image of the BNP as "thugs, losers and troublemakers", Griffin inaugurated a period of change in the party.

Influenced by Le Pen's National Front in France, Griffin sought to widen the BNP's appeal to individuals who were concerned about immigration but had not previously voted for the extreme-right. The BNP replaced Tyndall's policy of compulsory deportation of non-whites to a voluntary system whereby non-whites would be given financial incentives to emigrate. It downplayed <a href="biological%20racism">biological racism</a> and stressed the cultural incompatibility of different racial groups. This emphasis on culture allowed it to foreground <a href="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>, and following the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> in 2001 it launched a "Campaign Against Islam". It stressed the claim that the BNP was ""not" a racist party" but an "organised response to anti-white racism". At the same time Griffin sought to reassure the party's base that these reforms were based on pragmatism and not a change in principle.

Griffin also sought to shed the BNP's image as a <a href="single-issue%20party">single-issue party</a>, by embracing a diverse array of social and economic issues. Griffin renamed the party's monthly newspaper from "British Nationalist" to "The Voice of Freedom", and established a new journal, "Identity". The party developed community-based campaigns, through which it targeted local issues, particularly in those areas with large numbers of skilled white working-class people who were disaffected with the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> government. For instance, in <a href="Burnley">Burnley</a> it campaigned for lower speed limits on housing estates and against the closure of a local swimming bath, while in South Birmingham it targeted pensioners' concerns about youth gangs. In 2006 the party urged its activists to carry out local activities like cleaning up children's play areas and removing <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> while wearing high-vis jackets emblazoned with the party logo.

Griffin believed that <a href="Peak%20Oil">Peak Oil</a> and a growth in Third World migrants arriving in Britain would result in a BNP government coming to power by 2040. 
The close of the twentieth century produced more favourable conditions for the extreme-right in Britain as a result of increased public concerns about immigration and established Muslim communities coupled with growing dissatisfaction with the established mainstream parties. In turn, the BNP gained rapidly growing levels of support over the coming years. In July 2000, it came second in the <a href="Bexley%20London%20Borough%20Council%20elections%231998-2002">council elections for the North End of the London Borough of Bexley</a>, its best result since 1993. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202001">2001 general election</a> it gained 16% of the vote in one constituency and over 10% in two others. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202002">2002 local elections</a> the BNP gained four councillors, three of whom were in Burnley, where it had capitalised on white anger surrounding the disproportionately high levels of funding being directed to the Asian-dominated Daneshouse ward. This breakthrough generated public anxieties about the party, with a poll finding that six in ten supported a ban on it. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202003">2003 local elections</a> the BNP gained 13 additional councillors, including seven more in Burnley, having attained over 100,000 votes. Concerned that much of their potential vote was going to the <a href="UK%20Independence%20Party">UK Independence Party</a> (UKIP), in 2003 the BNP offered UKIP an electoral pact but was rebuffed. Griffin then accused UKIP of being a Labour Party scheme to steal the BNP's votes. They invested much in the campaign for the <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202004%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2004 European Parliament election</a>, at which they gained 800,000 votes but failed to secure a parliamentary seat. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202004">2004 local elections</a>, they secured four more seats, including three in <a href="Epping%2C%20Essex">Epping</a>.
For the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202005">2005 general election</a>, the BNP expanded its number of candidates to 119 and targeted specific regions. Its average vote in the areas it contested rose to 4.3%. It gained significantly more support in three seats, achieving 10% in <a href="Burnley%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Burnley</a>, 13% in <a href="Dewsbury%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Dewsbury</a>, and 17% in <a href="Barking%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Barking</a>. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202006">2006 local elections</a> the party gained 220,000 votes, with 33 additional councillors, having averaged a vote share of 18% in the areas it contested. In Barking and Dagenham, it saw 12 of its 13 candidates elected to the council. At the <a href="London%20Assembly%20election%2C%202008">2008 London Assembly election</a>, the BNP gained 130,000 votes, reaching the 5% mark and thus gaining an Assembly seat. At the <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202009%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2009 European Parliament election</a>, the party gained almost 1 million votes, with two of its candidates, Nick Griffin and <a href="Andrew%20Brons">Andrew Brons</a>, being elected as Members of the European Parliament for <a href="North%20West%20England%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North West England</a> and <a href="Yorkshire%20and%20the%20Humber%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Yorkshire and the Humber</a> respectively. That election also saw extreme-right parties winning seats for various other EU member-states. This victory marked a major watershed for the party. Amid <a href="Question%20Time%20British%20National%20Party%20controversy">significant public controversy</a>, Griffin was invited to appear on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> show "<a href="Question%20Time">Question Time</a>" in October 2009, the first time that the BNP had been invited to share a national television platform with mainstream panellists. Griffin's performance was however widely regarded as poor.

Despite its success, there was dissent in the party. In 2007 a group of senior members known as the "December rebels" challenged Griffin, calling for internal party democracy and financial transparency, but were expelled. In 2008, a group of BNP activists in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a> split to form the <a href="Democratic%20Nationalists">Democratic Nationalists</a>. Eddy Butler then led a challenge to Griffin's leadership, alleging financial corruption, but he had insufficient support. The rebels who supported him split into two groups: one section remained as the internal Reform Group, the other left the BNP to form the <a href="British%20Freedom%20Party">British Freedom Party</a>.
By 2010, there was discontent among the party's grassroots, a result of the change to its white-only membership policy and rumours of financial corruption among its leadership. Some defected to the National Front or left to form parties like <a href="Britain%20First">Britain First</a>, <a href="British%20Freedom%20Party">British Freedom Party</a>, the <a href="National%20People%27s%20Party%20%28UK%29">National People's Party</a> and the <a href="Britannica%20Party">Britannica Party</a>. <a href="Anti-fascism">Anti-fascist</a> groups like <a href="Hope%20not%20Hate">Hope not Hate</a> had campaigned extensively in Barking to stop the area's locals voting for the BNP. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 general election</a>, the BNP had hoped to make a breakthrough by gaining a seat in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, although it failed to achieve this. It nevertheless gained the fifth largest national vote share, with 1.9% of the vote, representing the most successful electoral performance for an extreme-right party in UK history. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202010">2010 local elections</a>, it lost all of its councillors in Barking and Dagenham. Nationally, the party's number of councillors dropped from over fifty to 28. Griffin described the results as "disastrous".

A <a href="British%20National%20Party%20leadership%20election%2C%202011">leadership election</a> took place in 2011. Griffin secured a narrow victory, beating Brons by nine votes of a total of 2,316 votes cast.
In October 2012, Brons left the party, leaving Griffin as its sole MEP. 
In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202012">2012 local elections</a>, the party lost all of its seats and saw its vote share fall dramatically; whereas it gained over 240,000 votes in 2008, this had fallen to under 26,000 by 2012. In the <a href="London%20mayoral%20election%2C%202012">2012 London mayoral election</a>, the BNP candidate came seventh, with 1.3% of first-preference votes, its poorest showing in the London mayoral contest. The 2012 election results established that the BNP's steady growth had ended.
In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202013">2013</a> local elections, the BNP won no council seats and witnessed a large drop in terms of their average vote.

In June 2013, Griffin visited Syria on a "peace mission" along with members of <a href="Jobbik">Jobbik</a> to meet with the Speaker of the Syrian People's Assembly, <a href="Mohammad%20Jihad%20al-Laham">Mohammad Jihad al-Laham</a>, and the Prime Minister <a href="Wael%20Nader%20al-Halqi">Wael Nader al-Halqi</a>, among other government officials. Griffin claims he was influential in the speaker of Syria's Parliament writing an open letter to British MPs urging them to "turn Great Britain from the warpath" by not intervening in the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian conflict</a>.
Griffin lost his European Parliament seat in the <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202014%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">May 2014 European election</a>. The party blamed the <a href="UK%20Independence%20Party">UK Independence Party</a> for its decline, accusing UKIP of stealing BNP policies and slogans. Two months later, in July, Griffin lost a leadership contest and was succeeded by <a href="Adam%20Walker%20%28British%20politician%29">Adam Walker</a> as acting chairman. In October, Griffin was expelled from the party for "trying to cause disunity [in the party] by deliberately fabricating a state of crisis," he was told in a letter.

In January 2015, membership of the party numbered 500, down from 4,220 in December 2013. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202015">general election in 2015</a>, the BNP fielded eight candidates, down from 338 in 2010. The party's vote share declined 99.7% from its 2010 result.
In January 2016, the <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Electoral Commission</a> de-registered the British National Party after it had failed to pay its annual registration fee of . At this time, it was estimated that BNP assets totalled less than . According to the Commission, "BNP candidates cannot, at present, use the party's name, descriptions or emblems on the ballot paper at elections." A month later, the party was re-registered.

The party stood in various contests within the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202016">2016 local and regional elections</a>, but failed to win any seats, leaving them with only one elected representative in the country, a local councillor. They came next to last in the <a href="London%20Assembly%20election%2C%202016">London Assembly elections</a> on 0.6%, a fall of 1.5% compared to the previous elections. There were ten BNP candidates at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202017">general election in 2017</a>, up from 8 in 2015.

In November 2016, Brian Parker, the last remaining councillor to be a member of the BNP (excluding parish or town councillors, for which records are not readily available) resigned in order to become an independent. He subsequently withdrew his resignation and is currently listed as a BNP councilor on the <a href="Pendle%20Council">Pendle Council</a> website. He is due to retire in 2018.

Many academic historians and political scientists have described the BNP as a <a href="far-right">far-right</a> party, or as an <a href="extreme-right">extreme-right</a> party. As the political scientist <a href="Matthew%20Goodwin">Matthew Goodwin</a> used it, the term referred to "a particular form of political ideology that is defined by two anti-constitutional and anti-democratic elements: first, right-wing extremists are "extremist" because they reject or undermine the values, procedures and institutions of the democratic constitutional state; and second they are "right-wing" because they reject the principle of fundamental human equality."

Various political scientists and historians have described the BNP as being <a href="fascism">fascist</a> in ideology. Others have instead described it as <a href="neo-fascism">neo-fascist</a>, a term which the historian Nigel Copsey argued was more exact. Academic observers—including the historians Copsey, Graham Macklin, and <a href="Roger%20Griffin">Roger Griffin</a>, and the political theologian Andrew P. Davey—have argued that Nick Griffin's reforms were little more than a cosmetic process to obfuscate the party's fascist roots. According to Copsey, under Griffin the BNP was "fascism recalibrated – a form of neo-fascism – to suit contemporary sensibilities". Macklin noted that despite Griffin's 'modernisation' project, the BNP retained its ideological continuity with earlier fascist groups and thus had not transformed itself into a genuinely "post-fascist" party. In this it was distinct from parties like the Italian <a href="National%20Alliance%20%28Italy%29">National Alliance</a> of <a href="Gianfranco%20Fini">Gianfranco Fini</a>, which has been credited with successfully shedding its fascist past and becoming post-fascist.

The anti-fascist activist <a href="Gerry%20Gable">Gerry Gable</a> referred to the BNP as a "Nazi organisation", while the <a href="Anti-Nazi%20League">Anti-Nazi League</a> published leaflets describing the BNP as the "British Nazi Party". Copsey suggested that while the BNP under Tyndall could be described as "Neo-Nazi", it was not "crudely mimetic" of the original German Nazism. Davey characterised the BNP as a "populist ethno-nationalist" party.

In his writings, Griffin himself acknowledged that much of his 'modernisation' was an attempt to hide the BNP's core ideology behind more electorally palatable policies. Like the National Front, the BNP's private discourse was different from its public one, with Griffin stating that "Of course we must teach the truth to the hardcore... [but] when it comes to influencing the public, forget about racial differences, genetics, Zionism, historical revisionism and so on... we must at all times present them with an image of moderate reasonableness". The BNP has eschewed the labels "fascist" and "Nazi", claiming that it is neither. In its 1992 electoral manifesto, it insisted that "Fascism was Italian. Nazism was German. We are British. We will do things our own way; we will not copy foreigners". Griffin has rejected the description of "fascist", claiming that that label is "a smear that comes from the far left" designed to discourage people from voting BNP.

Many on Britain's extreme-right have sought to avoid the term "British fascism" because of its electorally unpalatable connotations, instead utilising "British nationalism" in its place. After Griffin took control of the party, it made increasing use of <a href="Nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a> themes in order to emphasise its "British" credentials. In its published material, the party made appeals to the idea of Britain and Britishness in a manner not dissimilar to mainstream political parties. In this material it has also made prominent use of the <a href="Union%20flag">Union flag</a> and the colours red, white, and blue. Roger Griffin noted that the terms "Britain" and "England" appear "confusingly interchangeable" in BNP literature, while Copsey has pointed out that the BNP's form of British nationalism is "Anglo-centric". The party employed militaristic rhetoric under both Tyndall and Griffin's leadership; under the latter for example its published material spoke of a "war without uniforms" and a "war for our survival as a people". Tyndall described the BNP as a revolutionary party, calling it a "guerrilla army operating in occupied territory".

The BNP adheres to <a href="scientific%20racism">biological racist</a> ideas, displaying an obsession with the perceived differences of racial groups. Both Tyndall and Griffin believed that there was a biologically distinct white-skinned "British race" which was one branch of a wider <a href="Nordic%20race">Nordic race</a>. In this, Tyndall's views were similar both to Hitler and to prominent British fascist <a href="Arnold%20Leese">Arnold Leese</a>. 

The BNP adheres to an ideology of <a href="ethnic%20nationalism">ethnic nationalism</a>. It promotes the idea that not all citizens of the United Kingdom belong to the British nation. Instead, it claims that the nation only belongs to "the English, Scots, Irish and Welsh along with the limited numbers of peoples of European descent, who have arrived centuries or decades ago and who have fully integrated into our society". This is a group that Griffin referred to as the "home people" or "the folk". According to Tyndall, "The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism." Richard Edmonds in 1993 told "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"'s <a href="Duncan%20Campbell%20%28The%20Guardian%29">Duncan Campbell</a> that "we [the BNP] are 100% racist". The BNP does not regard UK citizens who are not ethnic white Europeans as "British", and party literature calls on supporters to avoid referring to such individuals as "black Britons" or "Asian Britons", instead describing them as "racial foreigners".

The party emphasises what it sees as the need to protect the racial purity of the white British. It condemns <a href="miscegenation">miscegenation</a> and "race mixing", claiming that this is a threat to the British race. Tyndall stated that he "felt deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage" but had "no sympathy whatsoever for the parents". Griffin similarly stated that mixed-race children were "the most tragic victims of enforced multi-racism", and that the party would not "accept miscegenation as moral or normal... we never will." In its 1983 election manifesto, the BNP stated that "family size is a private matter" but still called for white Britons who are "of intelligent, healthy and industrious stock" to have large families and thus raise the white British birth-rate. The encouragement of high birth rates among white British families continued under Griffin's leadership. 

Tyndall believed the Nordic race to be superior to other races, and under his leadership, the BNP promoted a variety of <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscientific</a> claims in support of <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a>. Following Griffin's ascendency to power in the party, it officially repudiated racial supremacism and insisted that no racial group was superior or inferior to another. Instead it foregrounded an "<a href="Ethnopluralism">ethno-pluralist</a>" racial separatism, claiming that different racial groups had to be kept separate and distinct for their own preservation, maintaining that global ethno-cultural diversity was something to be protected. At the same time it switched focus from openly promoting biological racism to stressing what it perceived as the <a href="cultural%20racism">cultural incompatibility of racial groups</a>. It placed great focus on opposing what it referred to as "<a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>", characterising this as a form of "cultural genocide", which promotes the interests of non-whites at the expense of the white British population. However, internal documents produced and circulated under Griffin's leadership demonstrated that it retained its dedication to biological racist ideas. In focusing on culture rather than biology and speaking of 'ethno-pluralism', Griffin's BNP borrowed much of its discourse from the French <a href="Nouvelle%20Droite">Nouvelle Droite</a>.

During Tyndall's period of leadership, the BNP promoted <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>, calling for the forced sterilisation of those with genetically transmittable disabilities. In party literature, it talked of improving the British 'racial stock' by removing "inferior strains within the indigenous races of the British Isles". Tyndall argued that medical professionals should be responsible for determining who to sterilise, while a lowering of welfare benefits would discourage breeding among those he deemed to be genetic inferiors. In his magazine "Spearhead", Tyndall also stated that "the gas chamber system" should be used to eliminate "sub-human elements", "perverts", and "asocials" from British society.

Opposition to immigration has been central to the BNP's political platform. It has engaged in <a href="xenophobia">xenophobic</a> campaigns which emphasise the idea that immigrants and ethnic minorities are both different from, and a threat to, the white British and white Irish populations. In its campaign material it presented non-whites both as a source of crime in the UK, and as a socio-economic threat to the white British population by taking jobs, housing, and welfare away from them. It engaged in <a href="welfare%20chauvinism">welfare chauvinism</a>, calling for white Britons to be prioritised by the UK's welfare state. Party literature included such as claims as that the BNP was the only party which could "do anything effective about the swamping of Britain by the Third World" or "lead the native peoples of Britain in our version of the New Crusade that must be organised if Europe is not to sink under the Islamic yoke".

Much of its published material made claims about a forthcoming <a href="race%20war">race war</a> and promoted the <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theory</a> about <a href="white%20genocide">white genocide</a>. In a 2009 radio interview, Griffin referred to this as a "bloodless genocide". It presents the idea that white Britons are engaged in a battle against their own extinction as a racial group. It reiterated a sense of urgency about the situation, claiming that both high immigration rates and high birth rates among ethnic minorities were a threat to the white British. In 2010, it for instance was promoting the idea that at current levels, "indigenous Britons" would be a minority within the UK by 2060.

The BNP calls for the non-white population of Britain to either be reduced in size or removed from the country altogether. Under Tyndall's leadership it promoted the compulsory removal of non-whites from the UK, stating that under a BNP government they would be "repatriated" to their countries of origin. In the early 1990s it produced stickers with the slogan "Our Final Solution: Repatriation". Tyndall understood this to be a two-stage process that would take ten to twenty years, with some non-whites initially leaving willingly and the others then being forcibly deported. During the 1990s, party modernisers suggested that the BNP move away from a policy of compulsory repatriation and toward a voluntary system, whereby non-white persons would be offered financial incentives to leave the UK. This idea, adopted from <a href="Powellism">Powellism</a>, was deemed more electorally palatable.

When Griffin took control of the party, the policy of voluntary repatriation was officially adopted, with the party suggesting that this could be financed through the use of the UK's pre-existing <a href="Department%20for%20International%20Development">foreign aid budget</a>. It stated that any non-whites who refused to leave would be stripped of their British citizenship and categorised as "permanent guests", while continuing to be offered incentives to emigrate. Griffin's BNP also stressed its support for an immediate halt to non-white immigration into Britain and for the deportation of any illegal migrants in the country. Speaking on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="The%20Andrew%20Marr%20Show">Andrew Marr Show</a>" in 2009, Griffin declared that, unlike Tyndall, he "does not want all-white UK" because "nobody out there wants it or would pay for it".

Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP was openly <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a>. From <a href="A.%20K.%20Chesterton">A. K. Chesterton</a>, Tyndall had inherited a belief that there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, viewing the "<a href="Protocols%20of%20the%20Elders%20of%20Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>" as genuine evidence for this. He believed that Jews were responsible for both <a href="communism">communism</a> and international finance capitalism and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race. He believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of the Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races. Tyndall had expressed the view that "if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?" Tyndall added <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust denial</a> to the anti-Semitic beliefs inherited from Chesterton, believing that the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> was a hoax created by the Jews to gain sympathy for themselves and thus aid their plot for world domination. Among those to endorse such anti-Semitic conspiracy theories was Griffin, who promoted them in his 1997 pamphlet, "<a href="Who%20are%20the%20Mind%20Benders%3F">Who are the Mind Benders?</a>". Griffin also engaged in Holocaust denial, publishing articles promoting such ideas in "The Rune", a magazine produced by the <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a> BNP. In 1998, these articles resulted in Griffin being convicted of <a href="Incitement%20to%20ethnic%20or%20racial%20hatred">inciting racial hatred</a>.

When Griffin took power, he sought to banish overt anti-Semitic discourse from the party. He informed party members that "we can get away with criticising Zionists, but any criticism of Jews is likely to be legal and political suicide". In 2006, he complained that the "obsession" that many BNP members had with "the Jews" was "insane and politically disastrous". In 2004, the party selected a Jewish candidate, <a href="Pat%20Richardson">Pat Richardson</a>, to stand for it during local council elections, something Tyndall lambasted as a "gimmick". References to Jews in BNP literature were often coded to hide the party's electorally unpalatable anti-Semitic ideas. For instance, the term "<a href="Zionism">Zionists</a>" was often used in party literature as a euphemism for "Jews". As noted by Macklin, Griffin still framed many of his arguments "within the parameters of recognizably anti-Semitic discourse". The BNP's literature is replete with references to a conspiratorial group who have sought to suppress nationalist sentiment among the British population, who have encouraged immigration and mixed race relationships, and who are promoting the Islamification of the country. This group is likely a reference to the Jews, an old fascist canard.

Under Griffin, the BNP's website linked to other web pages that explicitly portrayed immigration as part of a Jewish conspiracy, while it also sold books that promoted Holocaust denial. In 2004, secretly filmed footage was captured in which Griffin was seen claiming that "the Jews simply bought the West, in terms of press and so on, for their own political ends". Sectors of the extreme-right were highly critical of Griffin's softening on the subject of the Jews, claiming that he had "sold out" to the '<a href="Zionist%20Occupied%20Government">Zionist Occupied Government</a>'. In 2006, John Blean, editor of "Identity", included an article in which he reassured BNP members that the party had not "sold out to the Jews" or "embraced Zionism" but that it remained "committed to fighting... subversive Jews".

Copsey noted that despite Griffin's reforms, a "culture of anti-Semitism" still pervaded the BNP. In 2004, a London activist told reporters that "most of us hate Jews", while a Scottish BNP group was observed making <a href="Nazi%20salute">Nazi salute</a>s while shouting "Auschwitz". The party's <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne%20Central%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Newcastle upon Tyne Central</a> candidate compared the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> to <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a>, while their <a href="Luton%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Luton North</a> candidate stated her refusal to buy from "the kikes that run <a href="Tesco">Tesco</a>". In 2009, a BNP councillor from <a href="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a> resigned from the party, complaining that it still contained Holocaust deniers and Nazi sympathisers.

Griffin informed BNP members that rather than "bang on" about the Jews—which would be deemed extremist and prove electorally unpopular—their party should focus on criticising Islam, an issue that would be more resonant among the British public. After Griffin took over, the party increasingly embraced an Islamophobic stance, launching a "Campaign Against Islam" in September 2001. In "Islam: A Threat to Us All", a leaflet distributed to London households in 2007, the BNP claimed that it would stand up to both Islamic extremism and "the threat that 'mainstream' Islam poses to our British culture". In contrast to the mainstream British view that the actions of militant <a href="Islamism">Islamists</a>—such as those who perpetrated the <a href="7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings">7 July 2005 London bombings</a>—are not representative of mainstream Islam, the BNP insists that they are. In some of its literature it presents the view that every Muslim in Britain is a threat to the country. Griffin referred to Islam as an "evil, wicked faith", and elsewhere publicly described it as a "cancer" that needed to be removed from Europe through "chemotherapy".

The BNP has called for the prohibition of immigration from Muslim countries and for the banning of the <a href="burqa">burka</a>, <a href="halal">halal</a> meat, and the building of new <a href="mosques">mosques</a> in the UK. It also called for the immediate deportation of radical <a href="Islamism">Islamist</a> preachers from the country. In 2005 the party claimed that its primary issue of concern was the "growth of fundamentalist-militant Islam in the UK and its ever-increasing threat to Western civilization and our implicit values". To broaden its anti-Islamic agenda, Griffin's BNP made overtures to the UK's Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities; Griffin's claim that Jews can make "good allies" in the fight against Islam caused controversy within the international far-right.

Tyndall believed that liberal democracy was damaging to British society, claiming that liberalism was a "doctrine of decay and degeneration". Under Tyndall, the party sought to dismantle the UK's liberal democratic system of parliamentary governance, although was vague about what it sought to replace this system with. In his 1988 work "The Eleventh Hour", Tyndall wrote of the need for "an utter rejection of liberalism and a dedication to the resurgence of authority". Tyndall's BNP perceived itself as a revolutionary force that would bring about a <a href="Palingenetic%20ultranationalism">national rebirth</a> in Britain, entailing a radical transformation of society. It proposed a state in which the Prime Minister would have full executive powers, and would be elected directly by the population for an indefinite period of time. This Prime Minister could be dismissed from office in a further election that could be called if Parliament produced a <a href="vote%20of%20no%20confidence">vote of no confidence</a> in them. It stated that rather than having political parties, candidates standing for election to the parliament would be independent. During the period of Griffin's leadership, the party downplayed its anti-democratic themes and instead foregrounded <a href="populism">populist</a> ones. Its campaign material called for the devolution of greater powers to local communities, the reestablishment of <a href="county%20councils">county councils</a>, and the introduction of citizens' initiative referendums based on those used in Switzerland.
The BNP has adopted a hard Eurosceptic platform from its foundation.
Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP had overt anti-Europeanist tendencies. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he maintained the party's opposition to the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a>. Antagonism toward what became the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> was retained under Griffin's leadership, which called for the UK to leave the Union.
One of <a href="Vote%20Leave">Vote Leave</a>'s biggest donors during the <a href="Brexit">Brexit</a> referendum was former BNP member Gladys Bramall and the party has claimed that its anti-Establishment rhetoric "created the road" to Britain's <a href="Brexit">vote to leave</a> the European Union.

Tyndall suggested replacing the EEC with a trading association among the "White Commonwealth", namely countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Tyndall held <a href="imperialism">imperialist</a> views and was sympathetic to the re-establishment of the British Empire through the recolonization of parts of Africa. However, officially the BNP had no plans to re-establish the British Empire or secure dominion over non-white nations. In the 2000s, it called for an immediate military withdrawal from both the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> and the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%932014%29">Afghan War</a>. It has advocated ending overseas aid to provide economic support within the UK and to finance the voluntary repatriation of legal immigrants.

Under Tyndall, the BNP rejected both <a href="Welsh%20nationalism">Welsh nationalism</a> and <a href="Scottish%20nationalism">Scottish nationalism</a>, claiming that they were bogus because they caused division among the wider 'British race'. Tyndall also led the BNP in support of <a href="Ulster%20loyalism">Ulster loyalism</a>, for instance by holding public demonstrations against the <a href="Irish%20republicanism">Irish republican</a> party <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a>, and endorsing Ulster loyalist paramilitaries. Under Griffin, the BNP continued to support Ulster's membership of the United Kingdom, calling for the crushing of the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army">Irish Republican Army</a> and the scrapping of the <a href="Anglo-Irish%20Agreement">Anglo-Irish Agreement</a>. Griffin later expressed the view that "the only solution that could possibly be acceptable to loyalists and republicans alike" would be the reintegration of the Irish Republic into the United Kingdom, which would be reorganised along <a href="federalism">federal</a> lines. However, while retaining the party's commitment to Ulster loyalism, under Griffin the importance of the issue was downplayed, something that was criticised by Tyndall loyalists.

Tyndall described his approach to the economy as "National Economics", expressing the view that "politics must lead, and not be led by, economic forces". His approach rejected <a href="economic%20liberalism">economic liberalism</a> because it did not serve "the national interest", although still saw advantages in a <a href="capitalism">capitalist</a> system, looking favourably on individual enterprise. He called on capitalist elements to be combined with <a href="socialism">socialist</a> ones, with the government playing a role in planning the economy. He promoted the idea of the UK becoming an <a href="autarky">autarky</a> which was economically self-sufficient, with domestic production protected from foreign competition. This attitude was heavily informed by the <a href="corporatism">corporatist</a> system that had been introduced in <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s Fascist Italy.

A number of senior members, including Griffin and <a href="John%20Bean">John Bean</a>, had <a href="anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a> leanings, having been influenced by <a href="Strasserism">Strasserism</a> and <a href="National%20Bolshevism">National Bolshevism</a>. Under Griffin's leadership, the BNP promoted <a href="economic%20protectionism">economic protectionism</a> and <a href="anti-globalisation">anti-globalisation</a>. Its economic policies reflect a vague commitment to distributist economics, <a href="ethno-socialism">ethno-socialism</a>, and <a href="Autarky">national autarky</a>. The BNP maintains a policy of <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a> and <a href="economic%20nationalism">economic nationalism</a>, although in comparison with other far-right nationalist parties, the BNP focuses less on <a href="corporatism">corporatism</a>. It has called for British ownership of its own industries and resources and the "subordination of the power of the City to the power of the government". It has promoted the regeneration of farming in the United Kingdom, with the object of achieving maximum <a href="self-sufficiency">self-sufficiency</a> in food production. In 2002, the party criticised corporatism as a "mixture of big capitalism and state control", saying it favoured a "<a href="distributism">distributionist</a> tradition established by home-grown thinkers" favouring small business.

When it comes to <a href="environmentalism">environmentalism</a>, the BNP refers to itself as the "real green party", claiming that the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Green Party of England and Wales</a> engages in "watermelon" politics by being green (environmentalist) on the outside but red (leftist) on the inside. Influenced by the <a href="Nouvelle%20Droite">Nouvelle Droite</a>, it framed its arguments regarding environmentalism in an anti-immigration manner, talking about the need for 'sustainability'. It engages in <a href="climate%20change%20denial">climate change denial</a>, with Griffin claiming that global warming is a hoax orchestrated by those trying to establish the <a href="New%20world%20order%20%28politics%29">New World Order</a>.

The BNP <a href="Anti-feminism">is opposed</a> to <a href="feminism">feminism</a> and has pledged that—if in government—it would introduce financial incentives to encourage women to leave employment and become housewives. It would also seek to discourage children being born out of wedlock. It has stated that it would criminalise <a href="abortion">abortion</a>, except in cases where the child has been conceived as a result of rape, the mother's life is threatened, or the child will be disabled. There are nevertheless circumstances where it has altered this anti-abortion stance; an article in "British Nationalist" stated that a white woman bearing the child of a black man should "abort the pregnancy... for the good of society". More widely, the party censures inter-racial sex and accuses the British media of encouraging inter-racial relationships.

Under Tyndall, the BNP called for the re-criminalisation of homosexual activity. Following Griffin's takeover, it moderated its policy on homosexuality, although opposed the 2004 <a href="Civil%20partnership%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">introduction</a> of <a href="civil%20partnership">civil partnership</a>s for same-sex couples. During his 2009 "Question Time" appearance, Griffin described the sight of two men kissing as "really creepy". The party has also condemned the availability of pornography; its 1992 manifesto stated that the BNP would give the "pedlars of this filth... the criminal status that they deserve". The BNP promoted the reintroduction of <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a>, and the sterilisation of some criminals. It also called for the reintroduction of <a href="national%20service">national service</a> in the UK, adding that on completion of this service adults would be permitted to keep their standard issue <a href="assault%20rifle">assault rifle</a>.

According to the academic Steven Woodbridge, the BNP had a "rather ambivalent attitude toward Christian belief and religious themes in general" during most of its history, but that under Griffin's modernisation the party increasingly utilised Christian terminology and themes in its discourse. Various members of the party presented themselves as "true Christians", and defenders of the faith, with key ideologues claiming that the religion has been "betrayed" and "sold out" by mainstream clergy and the British establishment. British Christianity, the BNP claimed, was under threat from Islam, <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, multiculturalism, and "<a href="political%20correctness">political correctness</a>". On analysing the BNP's use of Christianity, Davey argued that the party's emphasis was not on Christian faith itself, but on the inheritance of European Christian culture.

The BNP long considered the mainstream media to be one of its major impediments to electoral success. Tyndall claimed that the media represents a "state above the state" which was committed to the "left-liberal" goals of <a href="internationalism%20%28politics%29">internationalism</a>, liberal democracy, and racial integration. The party has claimed that the mainstream media has given disproportionate coverage to the achievements of ethnic minority sportsmen and to the victims of anti-black racism while ignoring white victims of racial prejudice and the BNP's activities. Both Tyndall and Griffin have claimed that the mainstream media is controlled by Jews, who use it for their own devices; the latter promoted this idea in his "Who are the Mind Benders?". Griffin has described the BBC as "a thoroughly unpleasant, ultra-leftist establishment". The BNP has stated that if it took power, it would end "the dictatorship of the media over free debate". It claims that it would introduce a law prohibiting the media from disseminating falsehoods about an individual or organisation for financial or political gain, and that it would ban the media from promoting racial integration.
BNP policy pledges to protect <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, as part of which it would repeal all laws banning racial or religious hate speech. It would repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.

In contrast to the UK's mainstream parties, the BNP received few donations from businesses, wealthy donors, or trade unions. Instead it relied on finances produced by its membership. Under Tyndall, the party operated on a shoestring budget with a lack of transparency; in 1992 it collected £5000 and in 1997 it collected £10,000. It also tried raising money by selling extreme-right literature, and opened a bookshop in <a href="Welling">Welling</a> in 1989, although this was closed in 1996 after being attacked by anti-fascists and proving too costly to run. In 1992 the party formed a <a href="dining%20club">dining club</a> of its wealthier supporters, which was renamed the Trafalgar Club in 2000. By the 1997 general election it admitted that its expenses had "far out-stripped" its income, and it was appealing for donations to pay off loans it had taken out.

Griffin placed greater emphasis on fundraising, and from 2001 through to 2008 the BNP's annual turnover increased almost fivefold. Membership subscriptions grew from £35,000 to £166,000, while its donations raised from £38,000 to £660,000. However, expenses also rose as the BNP spent more on its electoral campaigns, and the party reported a financial deficit in 2004 and again in 2005. Between 2007 and 2009 the BNP accumulated debts of £500,000.

For most of its history, the BNP had a whites-only membership policy. In 2009, the state's <a href="Equality%20and%20Human%20Rights%20Commission">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> stated that this was a violation of the <a href="Race%20Relations%20Act%201976">Race Relations Act 1976</a> and called on the party to amend its constitution accordingly. Responding to this, in early 2010 members voted to remove the racial restriction to membership, although it is unlikely that many non-whites joined. 
At its creation, the BNP had approximately 1,200 members. By the 1983 general election this had grown to approximately 2,500, although by 1987 had slumped to 1000, with no significant further growth until the 21st century. After taking control Griffin began publishing the party's membership figures: 2,174 in 2001, 3,487 in 2002, 5,737 in 2003, and 7,916 in 2004. Membership dropped slightly to 6,281 in 2005, but had grown to 9,297 in 2007 and to 10,276 in spring 2010. In 2011, it was noted that this meant that the BNP had experienced the most rapid growth since 2001 of any minor party in the UK.

A party membership list dating from late 2007 was leaked onto the internet by a disgruntled activist, containing the names and addresses of 12,000 members. This included names, addresses and other personal details. People on the list included prison officers (barred from BNP membership), teachers, soldiers, civil servants and members of the clergy. The leaked list indicated that membership was concentrated in particular areas, namely the East Midlands, Essex, and Pennine Lancashire, but with particular clusters in <a href="Charnwood%20%28ward%29">Charnwood</a>, <a href="Pendle">Pendle</a>, and <a href="Amber%20Valley">Amber Valley</a>. Many of these areas had long been targeted by extreme-right campaigns, dating back to the NF activity of the 1970s, suggesting that such longstanding activism may have had an effect on levels of BNP membership This information also revealed that membership was most likely in urban areas with low rates of educational attainment and large numbers of economically insecure people employed in manufacturing, with further correlations to nearby Muslim communities. Following an investigation by Welsh police and the <a href="Information%20Commissioner%27s%20Office%20%28UK%29">Information Commissioner's Office</a>, two people were arrested in December 2008 for breach of the <a href="Data%20Protection%20Act%201998">Data Protection Act</a> concerning the leak. Matthew Single was subsequently found guilty and fined £200. The fine was criticised as an "absolute disgrace" by a BNP spokesman and a detective sergeant involved said he was "disappointed" with the outcome.

The leaked membership list showed that the party was 17.22% female. While women have occupied key positions within the BNP, men dominated at every level of the party. In 2009, over 80% of the party's Advisory Council was male and from 2002 to 2009, three-quarters of its councillors were male. The average percentage of female candidates presented at local elections in 2001 was 6%, although this had risen to 16% by 2010. Since 2006, the party had made a point of selecting female candidates, with Griffin stating that this was necessary to "soften" the party's image. Goodwin suggested that membership fell into three camps: the "activist old guard" who had previously been involved in the NF during the 1970s, the "political wanderers" who had defected from other parties to the BNP, and the "new recruits" who had joined post-2001 and who had little or no political interest or experience beforehand.

Having performed <a href="qualitative%20research">qualitative research</a> among the BNP by interviewing various members, Goodwin noted that few of those he interviewed "conformed to the popular stereotypes of them being irrational and uninformed crude racists". He noted that most strongly identified with the working class and claimed to have either been former Labour voters or from a Labour-voting family. None of those interviewed claimed a family background in the ethnic nationalist movement. Instead, he noted that members claimed that they joined the party as a result of a "profound sense of anxiety over immigration and rising ethno-cultural diversity" in Britain, along with its concomitant impact on "British culture and society". He noted that among these members, the perceived cultural threat of immigrants and ethnic minorities was given greater prominence than the perceived economic threat that they posed to white Britons. He noted that in his interviews with them, members often framed Islam in particular as a threat to British values and society, expressing the fear that British Muslims wanted to Islamicise the country and eventually impose "<a href="sharia">sharia</a>" law on its population.

Goodwin described the BNP's voters as being "socially distinct and concerned about a specific set of issues". Under Griffin's leadership, the party targeted areas with high proportions of skilled white working-class voters, particularly those who were disenchanted with the Labour government. It has attempted to appeal to disaffected Labour voters with slogans such as "We are the Labour Party your Grandfather Voted For". The BNP had little success in gaining support from women, the middle classes, and the more educated.

Goodwin noted a "strong male bias" in the party's support base, with statistical polling revealing that between 2002 and 2006, seven out of ten BNP voters were male. That same research also indicated that BNP voters were disproportionately middle-aged and elderly, with three quarters being aged over 35, and only 11% aged between 18 and 24. This contrasted to the NF's support base during the 1970s, when 40% of its voters were aged between 18 and 24. Goodwin suggested two possibilities for the BNP's failure to appeal to younger voters: one was the 'life cycle effect', that older people have obtained more during in their life and thus have more to lose, feeling both more threatened by change and more socially conservative in their views. The other explanation was the 'generational effect', with younger Britons who have grown up since the onset of mass immigration having had greater social exposure to ethnic minorities and thus being more tolerant toward them. Conversely, many older voters came of age during the 1970s, under the impact of the anti-immigrant rhetoric promoted by Powellism, Thatcherism, and the NF, and thus have less tolerant attitudes.

Most BNP voters had no formal qualifications and the party's support was centred largely in areas with low educational attainment. According to the 2002–06 data, two-thirds of BNP voters had either no formal qualifications or had left education after their <a href="O-levels">O-levels</a>/<a href="GCSE">GCSE</a>s. Only one in ten BNP voters possessed an <a href="A-level">A-level</a>, and an even smaller percentage had a university degree. Most of the BNP's voting base were from the financially insecure lower classes. Research conducted from 2002 to 2006 indicated that seven out of ten BNP voters were either skilled or unskilled workers or unemployed. A 2009 poll found that six out of ten BNP voters fitted this profile. Goodwin suggested that it was the skilled working classes rather than their unskilled or unemployed neighbours who were the main support base behind the BNP, because they owned some assets and thus felt that they had more to lose as a result of the economic threat posed by immigrants and ethnic minorities.

Research indicated that BNP voters also held opinions that were distinct from the average British citizen. They were far more pessimistic about their economic prospects than average, with seven out of ten BNP voters expecting their economic prospects to decline in future, contrasted with four out of ten who held this view in the wider population. In the 2002–06 period, 59% of BNP voters considered immigration to be the most important issue facing the UK, compared with only 16% of the wider population who agreed. By 2009, 87% of BNP voters identified immigration and asylum as the most important issue, to 49% of the wider population. BNP voters were also more likely to identify law and order, the EU, and Islamic extremism as the most important issues facing the UK than other voters, and less likely than average to rate the economy, NHS, pensions, and housing market as the most important.

BNP voters were also more likely than average to believe both that white Britons face unfair discrimination, and that Muslims, non-whites, and homosexuals had unfair advantages in British society. 78% of BNP voters endorsed the belief that the Labour Party prioritised immigrants and ethnic minorities over white British people, to 44% of the wider population. When asked questions about immigration and Muslims, BNP voters were found to be far more hostile to them than the average Briton, and also more willing than average to support outright racially discriminatory policies toward them. Copsey believed that "popular racism"—namely against asylum seekers and Muslims—generated the BNP's "largest reservoir of support", and that in many Northern English towns the main factors behind BNP support were white resentment toward Asian communities, anger at Asian-on-white crime, and the perception that Asians received disproportionately high levels of public funding.

Research also indicated that BNP voters were more mistrustful of the establishment than average citizens. In 2002–06, 92% of BNP voters described themselves as being dissatisfied with the government, to 62% of the wider population. Over 80% of BNP voters were found to distrust their local Member of Parliament, council officials, and civil servants, and were also more likely than average to think that politicians were personally corrupt. There was also a tendency for BNP voters to read tabloids like the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>", "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", and "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>", all of which promote anti-immigration sentiment. Whether these voters gained such sentiment as a result of reading these tabloids or they read these tabloids because it endorsed their pre-existing views is unclear.

The early stronghold of the BNP was in London, where it established enclaves of support in the boroughs of Enfield, Hackney, Lewisham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets, with smaller units in Bexley, Camden, Greenwich, Hillingdon, Lambeth, and Redbridge.
By the late 1990s, the party was increasingly retreating from its original East End heartland, finding that its electoral support had declined in the area. Griffin expressed the view that it was too dangerous for BNP activists to campaign in East End, suggesting that they would likely be attacked by opponents. Instead the party shifted its focus to parts of <a href="Outer%20London">Outer London</a>, in particular the boroughs of Barking, Bexley, Dagenham, Greenwich, and Havering. 

After Griffin took power, the party focused on building support in the North of England, taking advantage of the anxieties generated by the ethnic riots that took place <a href="2001%20Bradford%20riots">in Bradford</a>, Oldham, and Burnley in 2001. In the period between 2002 and 2006, over 40% of the BNP's voters were in Northern England.

On its formation, the BNP avoided the National Front's committee-rule system of collective leadership in the hope of evading the infighting and factionalism that had damaged the NF. Instead it was founded around what it called the "leadership principle", with a central chairman having complete control over the party, which was then arranged in a highly hierarchical structure. The BNP lacked any internal democracy, with the grassroots membership having no formal powers. On taking power, Griffin retained the leadership principle inherited from Tyndall. He nevertheless established an Advisory Council which would meet several times a year; the members were to be selected by Griffin himself and would serve as his advisors.

The party's branches and local groups were referred to as "units" within the party. These were designed to recruit followers, raise funds, and campaign during elections. Under Tyndall, the party operated with a skeleton organisation. It had no full-time staff and for most of the 1980s lacked a telephone number. Instead it relied on a handful of geographically scattered, unpaid regional organisers. Its early activists were recruited from within the extreme-right movement, and thus lacked the experience and skills in electoral campaigning. When Griffin took control, he introduced a variety of internal departments to help manage the party's activities: the administration and enquiries department, department for group development, legal affairs department, security department, and communications department. Griffin tried to build a more professional party machine by educating and training BNP members, providing them with incentives, establishing a steady income stream, and overcoming factionalism and dissent. He launched an "annual college" for activists in 2001 and formed an education and training department in 2007. In 2008 and 2010 he oversaw the establishment of "summer schools" for high-ranking officials. The party also began employing full-time members of staff, having three in 2001 and 13 in 2007.

To incentivise members to remain committed to the party, Griffin followed the example of the Swedish <a href="National%20Democrats%20%28Sweden%29">National Democrats</a> by implementing a new "voting membership" scheme in 2007. This meant that those who had been BNP members for two years could become a "voting member", at which they would go on a year's probation. During this year they were required to attend educational and training seminars, to engage in a certain amount of activism, and to donate a particular of money to the party. Once completed, they were allowed to vote on certain matters at general members' meetings and annual conferences, to participate in policy debates, and to be eligible for intermediate and senior positions. This policy ensured that those who reached the higher echelons of the BNP were fully trained in the party's ideology and electoral strategy.

Griffin hoped to build a wider <a href="social%20movement">social movement</a> around the BNP by establishing affiliated networks and organisations. In many cases, these were presented to the public in a way that concealed any direct connection to the BNP. Most of these affiliated groups were poorly funded and had few members. The party established its own <a href="record%20label">record label</a>, Great White Records, a radio station, and a <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> known as <a href="Solidarity%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Union%20for%20British%20Workers">Solidarity – The Union for British Workers</a>. It formed a group for young people known as the Young BNP, although in 2010 renamed this group as the BNP Crusaders, "to pay homage to our ancestors from the Middle Ages who saved Christian Europe from the onslaught of Islam". It established a Land and People group to recruit support in rural areas, a Family Circle to recruit women and families, and both a Veterans Group and an Association of British ex-Servicemen for former military servicemen. A group called Families Against Immigrant Racism was established to counter perceived racism against white Britons, while an Ethnic Liaison Committee was created to build links with anti-Muslim <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="Sikhism">Sikh</a> groups active in Britain. Another group was the <a href="American%20Friends%20of%20the%20British%20National%20Party">American Friends of the British National Party</a> (AFBNP), set up by <a href="Mark%20Cotterill">Mark Cotterill</a> in 1999 to gain support from sympathisers in the United States. In 2001 it had 100 members, and by 2008 had 107.

A group called Islands of the North Atlantic (IONA) was established to promote the BNP's view of British culture and identity. The British Students Association was founded to promote the party's views among university students in 2000.
Albion Life Insurance was set up in September 2006 as an insurance brokerage company established on behalf of the BNP to raise funds for its activities. The firm ceased to operate in November 2006. In 2006, the BNP launched the <a href="Christian%20Council%20of%20Britain">Christian Council of Britain</a> (CCB), a group designed to rival the <a href="Muslim%20Council%20of%20Britain">Muslim Council of Britain</a> and oppose the growing "Islamification" of inner city areas. The CCB was established and run by BNP member <a href="Robert%20West%20%28politician%29">Robert West</a>, who claimed to have been ordained by the <a href="Apostolic%20Church%20%28denomination%29">Apostolic Church</a>, a claim that the church denies. West is a <a href="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> and espouses a theology of nations which is influenced by Calvinist theologians like <a href="Abraham%20Kuyper">Abraham Kuyper</a>, holding that God wishes every race and nation to remain separate until <a href="end%20time">end time</a>.

Griffin's BNP also established an annual Red, White and Blue festival, which was based on the 'Blue Blanc Rouge' organised by France's National Front. The festival brought party activists together and aimed to promote a more <a href="family%20friendly">family friendly</a> image for the group, although it also provided a venue for <a href="white%20power%20skinhead">white power skinhead</a> bands like Stigger, Nemesis and Warlord. Around 1,000 BNP members attended the party's 2001 festival.

Under Griffin's leadership, the BNP zealously embraced the use of <a href="alternative%20media">alternative media</a> to promote itself in a way different from the negative portrayal that featured in the mainstream media. On its website—which had been established in 1995—it created an internet television channel, 'BNPtv'. It has created blogs that cover different themes without being explicitly political in order to promote the party's message. The BNP established an online marketing platform, Excalibur, through which to sell its merchandise. In 2003, the BNP claimed that it had the most viewed website of a political party in Britain, and by 2011 was claiming to have the most viewed such website in Europe. In September 2007, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" newspaper reported that <a href="Hitwise">Hitwise</a>, the online competitive intelligence service, said that the BNP website had more hits than any other website of a British political party.

Under Griffin, the BNP forged stronger links with various extreme-right parties elsewhere in Europe, among them France's National Front, Germany's <a href="National%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">National Democratic Party</a> (NPD), Sweden's National Democrats, and Hungary's <a href="Jobbik">Jobbik</a>. Griffin unsuccessfully urged the NPD to move away from Neo-Nazism and embark on the same 'modernisation' project that he had taken the BNP. <a href="Jean-Marie%20Le%20Pen">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a> of the French <a href="Front%20National">Front National</a> was the guest of honour at an "Anglo-French Patriotic Dinner" held by the BNP in April 2004.
Griffin met leaders of the Hungarian far right party <a href="Jobbik">Jobbik</a> to discuss co-operation between the two parties and spoke at a Jobbik party rally in August 2008. In April 2009, <a href="Simon%20Darby">Simon Darby</a>, deputy chairman of the BNP, was welcomed with fascist salutes by members of the Italian nationalist <a href="Forza%20Nuova">Forza Nuova</a> during a trip to Milan. Darby stated that the BNP would look to form an alliance with France's Front National in the European Parliament, Following the election of two BNP MEPs in 2009, the following year saw the BNP join with other extreme-right parties to form the <a href="Alliance%20of%20European%20National%20Movements">Alliance of European National Movements</a>, with Griffin becoming its vice president. The party also had close links with the <a href="Historical%20Review%20Press">Historical Review Press</a>, a publisher focused on promoting Holocaust denial.

Britain's extreme-right has long faced internal and public divisions. Disgruntled BNP members left the party to found or join a wide range of rivals, among them the <a href="British%20Freedom%20Party">British Freedom Party</a>, <a href="White%20Nationalist%20Party">White Nationalist Party</a>, <a href="Nationalist%20Alliance">Nationalist Alliance</a>, <a href="Wolf%27s%20Hook%20White%20Brotherhood">Wolf's Hook White Brotherhood</a>, <a href="British%20People%27s%20Party%20%282005%29">British People's Party</a>, <a href="England%20First%20Party">England First Party</a>, <a href="Britain%20First">Britain First</a>, <a href="Democratic%20Nationalists">Democratic Nationalists</a>, and the <a href="New%20Nationalist%20Party">New Nationalist Party</a>. Various BNP members were involved in the nascent <a href="English%20Defence%20League">English Defence League</a> (EDL)—with EDL leader <a href="Tommy%20Robinson%20%28activist%29">Tommy Robinson</a> having been a former BNP activist—although Griffin proscribed the organisation and condemned it as having been manipulated by "Zionists". The <a href="Steadfast%20Trust">Steadfast Trust</a> was established as a charity in 2004 with the stated aims of reducing poverty among those of <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> descent and supporting English culture. It has many former and current BNP, <a href="National%20Front%20%28UK%29">National Front</a> and British <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> members. It was deregistered as a charity by the Charity Commission in February 2014. In 2014, after Nick Griffin lost the leadership of BNP, he set up <a href="British%20Voice">British Voice</a>, but before it was launched, he decided to set up a different group, <a href="British%20Unity">British Unity</a>.

Some members of the BNP were radicalised during their involvement with the party and subsequently sought to carry out acts of violence and terrorism. <a href="Tony%20Lecomber">Tony Lecomber</a> was imprisoned for three years for possessing explosives, after a <a href="nail%20bomb">nail bomb</a> exploded while he was transporting it to the offices of the <a href="Workers%27%20Revolutionary%20Party%20%28UK%29">Workers' Revolutionary Party</a> in 1985. He was imprisoned for three years in 1991 whilst serving as the BNP's Director of Propaganda for assaulting a Jewish teacher. In 1999, the ex-BNP member <a href="David%20Copeland">David Copeland</a> used nail bombs to target homosexuals and ethnic minorities in London. In 2005, the BNP's Burnley candidate <a href="Robert%20Cottage">Robert Cottage</a> was <a href="Talbot%20Street%20bomb-making%20haul">convicted of stockpiling chemicals</a> for use in what he believed was a coming civil war, while a Yorkshire BNP member, Terry Gavan, was convicted in 2010 for stockpiling firearms and nail bombs.

The BNP has contested seats in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research from Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin shows that BNP support is concentrated among older and less educated working-class men living in the declining industrial towns of the North and Midlands regions, in contrast to previous significant far-right parties like the National Front, which drew support from a younger demographic.

The BNP placed comparatively little emphasis on elections to the British House of Commons, aware that the <a href="first%20past%20the%20post">first past the post</a> voting system was a major obstacle.

The British National Party has contested general elections since 1983.
The BNP in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202001">2001 general election</a> saved five deposits (out of 33 contested seats) and secured its best general election result in <a href="Oldham%20West%20and%20Royton">Oldham West and Royton</a> (which had recently been the scene of racially motivated rioting between white and Asian youths) where party leader <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> secured 16% of the vote.

The <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202005">2005 general election</a> was considered a major breakthrough by the BNP, as they picked up 192,746 votes in the 119 constituencies it contested, took a 0.7% share of the overall vote, and retained a deposit in 40 of the seats.

The BNP put forward candidates for 338 out of 650 seats for the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 general election</a> gaining 563,743 votes (1.9%), finishing in fifth place and failing to win any seats. However, a record of 73 deposits were saved. Party chairman Griffin came third in the <a href="Barking%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Barking</a> constituency, behind <a href="Margaret%20Hodge">Margaret Hodge</a> of Labour and Simon Marcus of the Conservatives, who were first and second respectively. At 14.6%, this was the BNP's best result in any of the seats it contested that year.

The BNP's first electoral success came in 1993, when <a href="Derek%20Beackon">Derek Beackon</a> was returned as a councillor in <a href="Millwall">Millwall</a>, London. He lost his seat in elections the following year. The next BNP success in local elections was not until the <a href="Burnley%20Council%20election%2C%202002">2002</a> local elections, when three BNP candidates gained seats on <a href="Burnley%20%28borough%29">Burnley</a> council. The BNP's first councillor for six years was <a href="John%20Haycock">John Haycock</a>, elected as a parish councillor for <a href="Bromyard%20and%20Winslow">Bromyard and Winslow</a> in <a href="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a> in 2000. Haycock failed to attend any council meetings for six months and was later disqualified from office.

The party had 55 councillors for a time in 2009. After the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202013">2013 local county council elections</a>, the BNP was left with a total of two <a href="borough%20council">borough council</a>lors in <a href="Local%20government%20in%20England">England</a>:

As of 2011, the BNP had yet to make "a major breakthrough" on local councils.
The BNP's councillors usually had "an extremely limited impact on local politics" because they were isolated as individuals or small groups on the council. Councillors from the main parties often disliked their BNP colleagues and deemed having to work alongside them as an affront to dignity and decency.
Questions were often raised as to whether BNP councillors could adequately represent the interests of all of their local constituents. On being elected, Beackon for instance stated that he refused to serve his Asian constituents in Millwall. There were also allegations made that BNP councillors had particularly low attendance at council meetings, although research indicated that this was not the case, with the BNP's attendance record being largely average.

There is evidence to suggest that racially and religiously motivated crime increased in those areas where BNP councillors had been elected. For instance, after the 1993 election of Beackon, there was a spike in racist attacks in the borough of Tower Hamlets. BNP members were directly responsible for some of this; the party's national organiser <a href="Richard%20Edmonds">Richard Edmonds</a> was sentenced to three months imprisonment for his part in an attack on a black man and his white girlfriend.

BNP lead candidate <a href="Richard%20Barnbrook">Richard Barnbrook</a> won a seat in the <a href="London%20Assembly">London Assembly</a> in May 2008, after the party gained 5.3% of the London-wide vote. However, in August 2010, he resigned the party whip and became an independent.

In the 2007 <a href="Welsh%20Assembly">Welsh Assembly</a> <a href="National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales%20election%2C%202007">elections</a>, the BNP fielded 20 candidates, four in each of the five regional lists, with <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> standing in the <a href="South%20Wales%20West%20%28National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales%20electoral%20region%29">South Wales West</a> region. It did not win any seats, but was the only minor party to have saved deposits in the electoral regions, one in the North Wales region and the other in the South Wales West region. In total the BNP polled 42,197 votes (4.3%).

In the <a href="National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales%20election%2C%202011">2011 Welsh Assembly elections</a>, the BNP fielded 20 candidates, four in each of the five regional lists and for the first time 7 candidates were fielded in <a href="First-past-the-post%20voting">FPTP</a> constituencies. On the regional lists, the BNP polled 22,610 votes (2.4%), down 1.9% from 2007. In 2 out of the 7 FPTP constituencies contested the BNP saved desposits: (<a href="Swansea%20East%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29">Swansea East</a> and <a href="Islwyn%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29">Islwyn</a>).

In the <a href="2007%20Scottish%20Parliament%20election">2007 Scottish Parliament election</a>, the party fielded 32 candidates, entitling it to public funding and an election broadcast, prompting criticism. The BNP received 24,616 votes (1.2%), no seats were won, nor were any deposits saved. In the <a href="2011%20Scottish%20Parliament%20election">2011 Scottish Parliament election</a>, the BNP fielded 32 candidates in the regional lists. 15,580 votes were polled (0.78%).

The BNP fielded 3 candidates for the first time in three constituencies each in the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly%20election%2C%202011">2011 Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly elections</a> (<a href="Belfast%20East%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29">Belfast East</a>, <a href="East%20Antrim%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29">East Antrim</a> and <a href="South%20Antrim%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29">South Antrim</a>). 1,252 votes were polled (0.2%), winning no seats for the party.

The BNP has taken part in European Parliament elections since 1999, when they received 1.13% of the total vote (102,647 votes).

In the <a href="European%20Parliament%20Election%2C%202004%20%28UK%29">2004 elections to the European Parliament</a>, the BNP won 4.9% of the vote, making it the sixth biggest party overall, but did not win any seats.

The BNP won two seats in the European Parliament in the <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202009%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2009 elections</a>. <a href="Andrew%20Brons">Andrew Brons</a> was elected in the <a href="Yorkshire%20and%20the%20Humber%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Yorkshire and the Humber</a> regional constituency with 9.8% of the vote. Party chairman <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> was elected in the <a href="North%20West%20England%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North West region</a>, with 8% of the vote. Nationally, the BNP received 6.26%.

The BNP says that <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Journalists">National Union of Journalists</a> guidelines on reporting "far right" organisations forbid unionised journalists from reporting uncritically on the party. In April 2007, an election broadcast was cancelled by <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Wales">BBC Radio Wales</a> whose lawyers believed that the broadcast was defamatory of the <a href="Chief%20Constable">Chief Constable</a> of <a href="North%20Wales%20Police">North Wales Police</a>, <a href="Richard%20Brunstrom">Richard Brunstrom</a>. The BNP claimed that BBC editors were following an agenda.

The leaders and senior officers of the BNP have criminal convictions for inciting racial hatred.
John Hagan claims that the BNP has conducted <a href="Right-wing%20politics%20and%20violence">right-wing extremist violence</a> to gain "institutionalized power". Critics of the BNP, such as <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> in a 1997 report, have asserted that the party recruits from skinhead groups and that it promotes racist violence.

In the past, Nick Griffin has defended the threat of violence to further the party's aims. After the BNP won its first council seat in 1993, he wrote that the BNP should not be a "postmodernist rightist party" but "a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan 'Defend Rights for Whites' with well-directed boots and fists. When the crunch comes, power is the product of force and will, not of rational debate". In 1997 he said: "It is more important to control the streets of a city than its council chambers."

A BBC "<a href="Panorama%20%28TV%20series%29">Panorama</a>" programme reported on a number of BNP members who have had criminal convictions, some racially motivated. Some of the more notable convictions include:

In 2011, Goodwin described the BNP as being "the most successful party in the history of the extreme right in Britain". That same year, John E. Richardson noted that it had achieved "a level of electoral success that is unparalleled in the history of British fascism". The historian Alan Sykes stated that "in electoral terms", the BNP achieved "more in the first three years of the twenty-first century" than the British far right "as a whole achieved in the previous seventy". However, Copsey noted that the party's belief that one day the conditions would be right for it to win a general election belonged to the "Never-Never Land of British politics". Copsey also noted that the BNP's electoral successes had been modest in comparison to those achieved by extreme-right groups elsewhere in Western Europe such as France's National Front, Italy's National Alliance, and Belgium's <a href="Vlaams%20Blok">Vlaams Blok</a>.

The BNP's growth met a hostile reaction, and in 2011 the political scientists Copsey and Macklin described it as "Britain's most disliked party." It was widely reviled as racist and even following Griffin's 'modernisation' project it was still heavily tainted by its associations with Neo-Nazism. For many years it remained closely associated with the National Front in the British public imagination.
The Conservative leader <a href="Michael%20Howard">Michael Howard</a> stated that the BNP were a "stain" on British democracy, adding that "this is not a political movement, this is a bunch of thugs dressed up as a political party". His successor <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> described it as a "completely unacceptable" organisation which "thrives on hatred". The Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair called it a "nasty, extreme organisation", while the Liberal Democrat leader <a href="Nick%20Clegg">Nick Clegg</a> termed it a "party of thugs and fascists". The Bishops of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> stated that supporting the BNP was "like spitting in the face of God". <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s family has criticised the BNP's use of his image and quotations, labelling it "offensive and disgusting". The singer <a href="Vera%20Lynn">Vera Lynn</a> condemned the party for selling her CD on its website. In 2009, the <a href="Royal%20British%20Legion">Royal British Legion</a> asked Griffin—at first privately and then publicly—to not wear their poppy symbol. In 2004, the <a href="General%20Synod%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">General Synod of the Church of England</a> declared that supporting the BNP was incompatible with Christianity.

The BNP remained unable to gain a broad appeal or widespread credibility. In a 2004 poll, seven out of ten voters said that they would never consider voting for the BNP. A 2009 poll found that two-thirds would "under no circumstances" consider voting BNP, while only 4% of respondents would "definitely consider" voting for them.
The British police, <a href="Fire%20Brigades%20Union">Fire Brigades Union</a>, and <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, prohibited its members from becoming BNP members. Individuals whose membership of the party was made public sometimes faced ostracism and the loss of their job: examples include a school headmaster who had to resign, a caretaker who was sacked after attending a BNP rally, and a police officer dismissed from his position. After BNP membership lists were leaked on the Internet, a number of police forces investigated officers whose names appeared on the lists.

A ban on BNP membership for prison workers was imposed by <a href="Martin%20Narey">Martin Narey</a>, Director of the Prison Service, in 2002. Narey told the BBC that he received hate mail and a death threat as a result. In February 2009, the <a href="General%20Synod%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">General Synod of the Church of England</a> voted to ban its clergy from joining the BNP. Christian groups throughout Britain have maintained that the BNP's hostility toward cultural and ethnic diversity in the country was at odds with mainstream Christianity's emphasis on inclusiveness, tolerance, and interfaith dialogue. In 2010 Education Secretary <a href="Michael%20Gove">Michael Gove</a> pledged to allow head teachers to dismiss employees who are members of the BNP, saying that "I don't believe that membership of the BNP is compatible with being a teacher... allow headteachers and governing bodies the powers and confidence to be able to dismiss teachers engaging in extremist activity."

The British Government announced in 2009 that the BNP's two MEPs would be denied some of the access and information afforded to other MEPs. The BNP would be subject to the "same general principles governing official impartiality" and they would receive "standard written briefings as appropriate from time to time", but diplomats would not be "proactive" in dealing with the BNP MEPs and that any requests for policy briefings from them would be treated differently and on a discretionary basis.

In 2005, an invitation to Nick Griffin by the <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> Union Debating Society to participate in a debate on multiculturalism was withdrawn after protests.

Attitudes toward the BNP in both mainstream broadcast media and print journalism have been overwhelmingly negative. No mainstream newspaper has endorsed the party. This hostile coverage has even been found in right-wing tabloids like the "Daily Mail", "Daily Express" and "The Sun" which otherwise share the BNP's hostile attitude toward issues like immigration. In 2003, the "Daily Mail" described the BNP as "poisonous bigots", while in 2004 "The Sun" printed the headline of "BNP: Bloody Nasty People". Senior BNP figures nevertheless believed that these tabloids' hostile coverage of immigration and Islam helped to legitimise and normalise the party and its views among much of the British public, a view echoed by some academic observers. When, in 2004, anti-racists picketed outside the "Daily Mail" office in central London in protest at its negative coverage of asylum seekers, BNP members organised a counter-picket at which they displayed the placard "Vote BNP, Read the "Daily Mail"".

The BNP initially faced a '<a href="No%20Platform">no platform for fascists</a>' policy from the broadcast media, although this eroded as Griffin was invited on to a number of television programmes amid the party's growing electoral success. When the BBC invited him to appear on "Question Time" in 2009 it was criticised by several trade unions, sections of the media, and several Labour politicians, all of whom believed that the BNP should not be given a public platform. Anti-fascist protesters assembled outside of the television studio to protest Griffin's inclusion.

The first academic attention to be directed at the BNP appeared after it gained a councillor in the 1993 local elections. Nevertheless, throughout the 1990s it remained the subject of little academic research. Academic interest increased following its victories at local elections from 2002 onward. The first detailed monograph study to be devoted to the party was Nigel Copsey's "Contemporary British Fascism", first published in 2004. In September 2008, an academic symposium on the BNP was held at <a href="Teesside%20University">Teesside University</a>.

Opposition to the BNP also came from the organised anti-fascist movement. By the mid-1990s, the BNP's attempts to stage public events in Scotland, the North West and the Midlands were largely thwarted by the militant disruption of the <a href="Anti-Fascist%20Action">Anti-Fascist Action</a> (AFA) group. The BNP's modernisation and move away from street demonstrations and toward electoral campaigning caused problems for the AFA, who proved unable to successfully change their tactics; on those occasions when AFA activists tried to forcibly disrupt BNP activities, they were prevented and arrested by <a href="riot%20police">riot police</a>.

More liberal sections of the anti-fascist movement sought to counter the BNP through community-based initiatives. "<a href="Searchlight%20%28magazine%29">Searchlight</a>" encouraged trade unions to establish localised campaigns that would ensure that ethnic minority and other anti-BNP locals voted. It suggested that such campaigns should avoid associating with the mainstream parties from which BNP voters felt disenfranchised and that they should not be afraid of calling out Islamic fundamentalists and extremists active in the area. The <a href="Unite%20Against%20Fascism">Unite Against Fascism</a> group also sought to maximise anti-BNP turnout at elections, calling on the electorate to vote for "anyone but fascists". Evidence suggests that such anti-fascist activities did little to erode the far-right vote; this was in part because anti-fascist groups had encouraged the stereotype that BNP candidates were violent skinheads, something which conflicted with the more normal, friendly image that BNP activists cultivated when canvassing.

The BNP often received a hostile response from other sections of the British extreme-right. Some extreme-right-wingers, such as the British Freedom Party, expressed frustration at the party's inability to moderate itself further on the issue of race, while those such as <a href="Colin%20Jordan">Colin Jordan</a> and the NF accused the BNP—particularly under Griffin's leadership—of being too moderate. This latter view was articulated by an extreme-right <a href="groupuscule">groupuscule</a>, the International Third Position, when it claimed that the BNP "has been openly courting the Jewish vote and pumping out material which confirms what most us knew years ago: the BNP has become a multi-racist, Zionist, queer-tolerant anti-Muslim pressure group".

In "<a href="ASLEF%20v.%20United%20Kingdom">ASLEF v.

Batavi (Germanic tribe)

The Batavi were an ancient <a href="Germanic%20tribes">Germanic</a> tribe that lived around the modern <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> delta in the area that the Romans called <a href="Batavia%20%28region%29">Batavia</a>, from the second half of the first century BC to the third century AD. The name is also applied to several military units employed by the Romans that were originally raised among the Batavi. The tribal name, probably a derivation from "batawjō" ("good island", from <a href="Germanic%20Languages">Germanic</a> "bat-" "good, excellent," which is also in the English "better," and "awjō" "island, land near water"), refers to the region's fertility, today known as the "fruitbasket of the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>" (the <a href="Betuwe">Betuwe</a>).

Finds of <a href="Wax%20tablet">wooden tablets</a> show that at least some were literate.

The Batavi themselves are not mentioned by <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> in his commentary "<a href="Commentarii%20de%20Bello%20Gallico">Commentarii de Bello Gallico</a>". But he did mention the "Batavian island" in the <a href="Rhine%20river">Rhine river</a>. The island's easternmost point is at a split in the Rhine, one arm being the <a href="Waal%20%28river%29">Waal</a> the other the <a href="Nederrijn">Lower Rhine</a>/<a href="Oude%20Rijn%20%28Utrecht%20and%20South%20Holland%29">Old Rhine</a> (hence the Latin name "Insula Batavorum", "Island of the Batavi"). Much later <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> wrote that they had originally been a tribe of the <a href="Chatti">Chatti</a>, a tribe in Germany never mentioned by Caesar, who were forced by internal dissension to move to their new home. The time when this happened is unknown, but Caesar does describe similar movements of two tribes in his time, the <a href="Usipetes">Usipetes</a> and <a href="Tencteri">Tencteri</a>.

Tacitus also reports that before their arrival the area had been "an uninhabited district on the extremity of the coast of Gaul, and also of a neighbouring island, surrounded by the ocean in front, and by the river Rhine in the rear and on either side". This view, however, is contradicted by the archeological evidence, which shows continuous habitation from at least the third century BC onward. 
The strategic position, to wit the high bank of the Waal—which offered an unimpeded view far into Germania Transrhenana (Germania Beyond the Rhine)—was recognized first by <a href="Nero%20Claudius%20Drusus">Drusus</a>, who built a massive fortress ("castra") and a headquarters ("praetorium") in imperial style. The latter was in use until the Batavian revolt.

Archeological evidence suggests they lived in small villages, composed of six to 12 houses in the very fertile lands between the rivers, and lived by agriculture and cattle-raising. Finds of horse skeletons in graves suggest a strong equestrian preoccupation. On the south bank of the Waal (in what is now Nijmegen) a Roman administrative center was built, called "Oppidum Batavorum". An <a href="Oppidum">Oppidum</a> was a fortified warehouse, where a tribe's treasures were stored and guarded. This centre was razed during the Batavian Revolt.

The first Batavi commander we know of is named <a href="Chariovalda">Chariovalda</a>, who led a charge across the Vīsurgis (<a href="Weser">Weser</a>) river against the <a href="Cherusci">Cherusci</a> led by Arminius during the campaigns of Germanicus in "Germania Transrhenana".

Tacitus ("<a href="De%20origine%20et%20situ%20Germanorum">De origine et situ Germanorum</a>" XXIX) described the Batavi as the bravest of the tribes of the area, hardened in the Germanic wars, with cohorts under their own commanders transferred to <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a>. They retained the honour of the ancient association with the Romans, not required to pay tribute or taxes and used by the Romans only for war: "They furnished to the Empire nothing but men and arms", Tacitus remarked. Well regarded for their skills in horsemanship and swimming—for men and horses could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus. <a href="Dio%20Cassius">Dio Cassius</a> describes this surprise tactic employed by <a href="Aulus%20Plautius">Aulus Plautius</a> against the "barbarians"—the British Celts— at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Medway">battle of the River Medway</a>, 43:

It is uncertain how they were able to accomplish this feat. The late 4th century writer on Roman military affairs Vegetius mentions soldiers using reed rafts, drawn by leather leads, to transport equipment across rivers. But the sources suggest the Batavi were able to swim across rivers actually wearing full armour and weapons. This would only have been possible by the use of some kind of buoyancy device: <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> mentions that the "<a href="Cornuti">Cornuti</a>" regiment swam across a river floating on their shields "as on a canoe" (357). Since the shields were wooden, they may have provided sufficient buoyancy

The Batavi were used to form the bulk of the Emperor's personal <a href="Germanic%20bodyguard">Germanic bodyguard</a> from <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> to <a href="Galba">Galba</a>. They also provided a contingent for their indirect successors, the Emperor's horse guards, the "<a href="Equites%20singulares%20Augusti">Equites singulares Augusti</a>".

A Batavian contingent was used in an amphibious assault on <a href="Anglesey">Ynys Mon (Anglesey)</a>, taking the assembled <a href="Druids">Druids</a> by surprise, as they were only expecting Roman ships.

Numerous altars and tombstones of the cohorts of Batavi, dating to the 2nd century and 3rd century, have been found along <a href="Hadrian%27s%20Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a>, notably at <a href="Castlecary">Castlecary</a> and <a href="Carrawburgh">Carrawburgh</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="Austria">Austria</a>.

Despite the alliance, one of the high-ranking Batavi, Julius Paullus, to give him his Roman name, was executed by Fonteius Capito on a false charge of rebellion. His kinsman <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Civilis">Gaius Julius Civilis</a> was paraded in chains in Rome before <a href="Nero">Nero</a>; though he was acquitted by <a href="Galba">Galba</a>, he was retained at Rome, and when he returned to his kin in the year of upheaval in the Roman Empire, 69, he headed a Batavian rebellion. He managed to capture <a href="Castra%20Vetera">Castra Vetera</a>, the Romans lost two legions while two others (I Germanica and XVI Gallica) were controlled by the rebels. The rebellion became a real threat to the Empire when the conflict escalated to northern Gaul and Germania. The Roman army retaliated and invaded the "insula Batavorum". A bridge was built over the river <a href="Nabalia">Nabalia</a>, where the warring parties approached each other on both sides to negotiate peace. The narrative was told in great detail in Tacitus' History, book iv, although, unfortunately, the narrative breaks off abruptly at the climax. Following the uprising, <a href="Legio%20X%20Gemina">Legio X "Gemina"</a> was housed in a stone "castra" to keep an eye on the Batavians.

The Batavi were still mentioned in 355 during the reign of <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a> (317 - 361), when their island was already dominated by the <a href="Salian%20Franks">Salii</a>, a Frankish tribe that had sought Roman protection there in 297 after having been expelled from their own country by the Saxons.

<a href="Constantius%20Gallus">Constantius Gallus</a> added inhabitants of Batavia to his legions, "of whose discipline we still make use." It has been assumed they merged with the Salii shortly before or after and, after having been expelled by another tribe (it has been proposed this was the <a href="Chamavi">Chamavi</a>), shared their subsequent migration to <a href="Toxandria">Toxandria</a>. In the <a href="Late%20Roman%20army">Late Roman army</a> there was a unit called "<a href="Batavi%20%28military%20unit%29">Batavi</a>".

The name of the Bavarian town of <a href="Passau">Passau</a> descends from the Roman "Batavis", which was named after the Batavi. The town's name is old as it shows the typical effects of the <a href="High%20German%20consonant%20shift">High German consonant shift</a> (b > p, t > ss).

In the 16th-century emergence of a popular foundation story and origin myth for the <a href="Dutch%20people">Dutch people</a>, the Batavians came to be regarded as their ancestors during their national struggle for independence during the <a href="Eighty%20Years%20War">Eighty Years War</a>. The mix of fancy and fact in the "Cronyke van Hollandt, Zeelandt ende Vriesland" (called the "Divisiekroniek") by the Augustinian friar and humanist Cornelius Gerardi Aurelius, first published in 1517, brought the spare remarks in Tacitus' newly rediscovered "Germania" to a popular public; it was being reprinted as late as 1802. Contemporary Dutch virtues of independence, fortitude and industry were fully recognizable among the Batavians in more scholarly history represented in <a href="Hugo%20Grotius">Hugo Grotius</a>' "Liber de Antiquitate Republicae Batavicorum" (1610). The origin was perpetuated by Romeyn de Hooghe's "Spiegel van Staat der Vereenigden Nederlanden" ("Mirror of the State of the United Netherlands," 1706), which also ran to many editions, and it was revived in the atmosphere of <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">Romantic nationalism</a> in the late eighteenth-century reforms that saw a short-lived <a href="Batavian%20Republic">Batavian Republic</a> and, in the colony of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, a capital that was named <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a>. Though since Indonesian independence the city is called <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, its inhabitants up to the present still themselves "<a href="Betawi%20people">Betawi</a>" or "<a href="Orang%20Betawi">Orang Betawi</a>", i.e. "People of Batavia" - a name ultimately derived from the ancient Batavians. 

The success of this tale of origins was mostly due to resemblance in anthropology, which was based on <a href="tribal%20knowledge">tribal knowledge</a>. Being politically and geographically inclusive, this historical vision filled the needs of Dutch nation-building and integration in the 1890-1914 era.

However, a disadvantage of this historical nationalism soon became apparent. It suggested there were no strong external borders, while allowing for the fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society pillarized into three parts. After 1945 the tribal knowledge lost its grip on anthropology and mostly vanished. Modern variants of the Batavian <a href="founding%20myth">founding myth</a> are made more accurate by pointing out that the Batavians were one part of the ancestry of the Dutch people - together with the <a href="Frisians">Frisians</a>, <a href="Franks">Franks</a> and <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a> - by tracing patterns of <a href="DNA">DNA</a>. Echoes of this cultural continuity can still be found among various areas of Dutch modern culture, such as the very popular replica of the <a href="Batavia%20%28ship%29">ship "Batavia"</a> that can today be found in <a href="Lelystad">Lelystad</a>.

Baptism

Baptism (from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> noun βάπτισμα "baptisma"; <a href="%23Etymology">see below</a>) is a <a href="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a> of <a href="Initiation">admission</a> and <a href="Adoption%20%28theology%29">adoption</a>, almost invariably with the use of water, into the <a href="Christian%20Church">Christian Church</a> generally. The canonical <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s report that <a href="Baptism%20of%20Jesus">Jesus was baptized</a>—a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned. Baptism has been called a holy <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a> and an <a href="ordinance%20%28Christian%29">ordinance</a> of Jesus Christ. In some denominations, baptism is also called christening, but for others the word "christening" is reserved for the <a href="Infant%20baptism">baptism of infants</a>. Baptism has also given its name to the <a href="Baptists">Baptist churches and denominations</a>.

The usual form of baptism among <a href="Early%20Christians">the earliest Christians</a> was for the candidate to be <a href="immersion%20baptism">immersed</a>, either totally (submerged completely under the water) or partially (standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her). While <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>'s use of a deep river for his baptism suggests immersion, "The fact that he chose a permanent and deep river suggests that more than a token quantity of water was needed, and both the preposition 'in' (the Jordan) and the basic meaning of the verb 'baptize' probably indicate immersion. In v. 16, Matthew will speak of Jesus 'coming up out of the water'. The traditional depiction in Christian art of John the Baptist pouring water over Jesus' head may therefore be based on later Christian practice." Pictorial and archaeological evidence of Christian baptism from the 3rd century onward indicates that a normal form was to have the candidate stand in water while water was poured over the upper body. Other common forms of baptism now in use include pouring water three times on the forehead, a method called <a href="affusion">affusion</a>.

<a href="Martyrdom">Martyrdom</a> was identified early in Church history as "baptism by blood", enabling martyrs who had not been baptized by water to be saved. Later, the Catholic Church identified a <a href="baptism%20of%20desire">baptism of desire</a>, by which those preparing for baptism who die before actually receiving the sacrament are considered saved. As evidenced also in the common Christian practice of <a href="infant%20baptism">infant baptism</a>, baptism was universally seen by Christians as in some sense necessary for <a href="salvation">salvation</a>, until <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Huldrych Zwingli</a> in the 16th century denied its necessity.

<a href="Quakers">Quakers</a> and <a href="The%20Salvation%20Army">The Salvation Army</a> practice <a href="Baptism%20with%20the%20Holy%20Spirit">Baptism with the Holy Spirit</a> instead of baptism with water. Among denominations that practice baptism by water, differences can be found in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite. Most Christians baptize "in the name of the <a href="God%20the%20Father">Father</a>, and of the <a href="God%20the%20Son">Son</a>, and of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>" (following the <a href="Great%20Commission">Great Commission</a>), but some baptize in <a href="Jesus%27%20Name%20doctrine">Jesus' name only</a>. Much more than half of all Christians <a href="infant%20baptism">baptize infants</a>; many others hold that only <a href="believer%27s%20baptism">believer's baptism</a> is true baptism. Some insist on submersion or at least partial immersion of the person who is baptized, others consider that any form of washing by water, as long as the water flows on the head, is sufficient. The term "baptism" has also been used to refer to any ceremony, trial, or experience by which a person is initiated, purified, or given a name.

The English word "baptism" is derived indirectly through <a href="Latin">Latin</a> from the neuter <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> concept noun "baptisma" (Greek , "washing-ism"), which is a <a href="neologism">neologism</a> in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> derived from the masculine Greek noun "baptismos" (), a term for ritual washing in Greek language texts of <a href="Hellenistic%20Judaism">Hellenistic Judaism</a> during the <a href="Second%20Temple%20period">Second Temple period</a>, such as the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>. Both of these nouns are derived from the verb "baptizō" (, "I wash" <a href="transitive%20verb">transitive verb</a>), which is used in Jewish texts for ritual washing, and in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> both for ritual washing and also for the apparently new rite of "baptisma". The Greek verb "baptō" (), "dip", from which the verb "baptizo" is derived, is in turn hypothetically traced to a reconstructed <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> root *"gʷabh-", "dip". The Greek words are used in a great variety of meanings.

Baptism has similarities to <a href="Tvilah">Tvilah</a>, a Jewish purification ritual of immersing in water, which is required for, among other things, <a href="conversion%20to%20Judaism%23Requirements">conversion to Judaism</a>, but which differs in being repeatable, while baptism is to be performed only once. (In fact, the <a href="Modern%20Hebrew">Modern Hebrew</a> term for "baptism" is "Christian Tvilah".) <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, who is considered a forerunner to Christianity, used baptism as the central sacrament of his messianic movement. The apostle Paul distinguished between the baptism of John, ("baptism of repentance") and baptism in the name of Jesus, and it is questionable whether Christian baptism was in some way linked with that of John. Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism, though whether Jesus intended to institute a continuing, organized church is a matter of dispute among scholars.

The earliest Christian baptisms were probably normally by <a href="Immersion%20baptism">immersion</a>, complete or partial. though other modes may have also been used. 
The first recorded <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> of baptism, written down by Saint <a href="Hippolytus%20of%20Rome">Hippolytus of Rome</a> (170–235) in his "<a href="Apostolic%20Tradition">Apostolic Tradition</a>", required men, women and children to remove all clothing, including all foreign objects such as jewellery and hair fastenings.
By the third and fourth centuries, baptism involved <a href="catechetical">catechetical</a> instruction as well as <a href="chrismation">chrismation</a>, <a href="Exorcism%20in%20Christianity">exorcism</a>s, <a href="Christian%20laying%20on%20of%20hands">laying on of hands</a>, and recitation of a <a href="creed">creed</a>.

In the <a href="early%20middle%20ages">early middle ages</a> infant baptism became common and the rite was significantly simplified. In Western Europe <a href="Affusion">Affusion</a> became the normal mode of baptism between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, though immersion was still practiced into the sixteenth. In the sixteenth century, <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> retained baptism as a sacrament, but Swiss reformer <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Huldrych Zwingli</a> considered baptism and the <a href="Lord%27s%20supper">Lord's supper</a> to be symbolic. <a href="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a>s denied the validity of the practice of infant baptism, and rebaptized converts.

Baptism is practiced in several different ways. <a href="Aspersion">Aspersion</a> is the sprinkling of water on the head, and <a href="affusion">affusion</a> is the pouring of water over the head.

The word "<a href="immersion%20baptism">immersion</a>" is derived from <a href="late%20Latin">late Latin</a> "immersio", a noun derived from the verb "immergere" ("in" – "into" + "mergere" "dip"). In relation to baptism, some use it to refer to any form of dipping, whether the body is put completely under water or is only partly dipped in water; they thus speak of immersion as being either total or partial. Others, of the Anabaptist belief, use "immersion" to mean exclusively plunging someone entirely under the surface of the water. The term "immersion" is also used of a form of baptism in which water is poured over someone standing in water, without submersion of the person. On these three meanings of the word "immersion", see <a href="Immersion%20baptism">Immersion baptism</a>.

When "immersion" is used in opposition to "submersion", it indicates the form of baptism in which the candidate stands or kneels in water and water is poured over the upper part of the body. Immersion in this sense has been employed in West and East since at least the 2nd century and is the form in which baptism is generally depicted in early Christian art. In the West, this method of baptism began to be replaced by <a href="affusion">affusion</a> baptism from around the 8th century, but it continues in use in <a href="Eastern%20Christianity">Eastern Christianity</a>.

The word submersion comes from the <a href="late%20Latin">late Latin</a> ("sub-" "under, below" + "mergere" "plunge, dip") and is also sometimes called "complete immersion". It is the form of baptism in which the water completely covers the candidate's body. Submersion is practiced in the Orthodox and several other Eastern Churches. In the <a href="Latin%20Church">Latin Church</a> of the Catholic Church, baptism by submersion is used in the <a href="Ambrosian%20Rite">Ambrosian Rite</a> and is one of the methods provided in the <a href="Roman%20Rite">Roman Rite</a> of the baptism of infants. It is seen as obligatory among some groups that have arisen since the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, such as <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a> and <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church).

The <a href="Greek-English%20Lexicon">Greek-English Lexicon</a> of Liddell and Scott gives the primary meaning of the verb "baptizein", from which the English verb "baptize" is derived, as "dip, plunge", and gives examples of plunging a sword into a throat or an embryo and for drawing wine by dipping a cup in the bowl; for New Testament usage it gives two meanings: "baptize", with which it associates the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> mention of <a href="Naaman">Naaman</a> dipping himself in the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>, and "perform ablutions", as in .

Although the Greek verb "baptizein" does not exclusively mean dip, plunge or immerse (it is used with literal and figurative meanings such as "sink", "disable", "overwhelm", "go under", "overborne", "draw from a bowl"), lexical sources typically cite this as a meaning of the word in both the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> and the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>.

"While it is true that the basic root meaning of the Greek words for baptize and baptism is immerse/immersion, it is not true that the words can simply be reduced to this meaning, as can be seen from , , //, ."

Two passages in the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s indicate that the verb "baptizein" did not always indicate submersion. The first is , which tells how a Pharisee, at whose house Jesus ate, "was astonished to see that he did not first wash ("ἐβαπτίσθη", aorist passive of "βαπτίζω"—literally, "was baptized") before dinner". This is the passage that Liddell and Scott cites as an instance of the use of ' to mean "perform ablutions". Jesus' omission of this action is similar to that of his disciples: "Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash (') not their hands when they eat bread" (). The other Gospel passage pointed to is: "The Pharisees...do not eat unless they wash ("", the ordinary word for washing) their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they wash themselves (literally, "baptize themselves"—"βαπτίσωνται", passive or middle voice of "βαπτίζω")" ().
Scholars of various denominations claim that these two passages show that invited guests, or people returning from market, would not be expected to immerse themselves ("baptize themselves") totally in water but only to practise the partial immersion of dipping their hands in water or to pour water over them, as is the only form admitted by present Jewish custom. In the second of the two passages, it is actually the hands that are specifically identified as "washed" (Mark 7:3), not the entire person, for whom the verb used is "baptizomai", literally "be baptized", "be immersed" (Mark 7:4), a fact obscured by English versions that use "wash" as a translation of both verbs. Zodhiates concludes that the washing of the hands was done by immersing them. The Liddell–Scott–Jones <a href="Greek-English%20Lexicon">Greek-English Lexicon</a> (1996) cites the other passage (Luke 11:38) as an instance of the use of the verb "baptizein" to mean "perform ablutions", not "submerge". References to the cleaning of vessels which use βαπτίζω also refer to immersion.

As already mentioned, the lexicographical work of Zodhiates says that, in the second of these two cases, , the verb "baptizein" indicates that, after coming from the market, the Pharisees washed their hands by immersing them in collected water. Balz & Schneider understand the meaning of βαπτίζω, used in place of ῥαντίσωνται (sprinkle), to be the same as βάπτω, to dip or immerse, a verb used of the partial dipping of a morsel held in the hand into wine or of a finger into spilled blood.
A possible additional use of the verb "baptizein" to relate to ritual washing is suggested by <a href="Peter%20Leithart">Peter Leithart</a> (2007) who suggests that Paul's phrase "Else what shall they do who are <a href="baptism%20for%20the%20dead">baptized for the dead</a>?" relates to Jewish ritual washing. In Jewish Greek the verb "baptizein" "baptized" has a wider reference than just "baptism" and in Jewish context primarily applies to the masculine noun "baptismos" "ritual washing" The verb "baptizein" occurs four times in the Septuagint in the context of ritual washing, "baptismos"; Judith cleansing herself from menstrual impurity, <a href="Naaman">Naaman</a> washing seven times to be cleansed from leprosy, etc. Additionally, in the New Testament only, the verb "baptizein" can also relate to the neuter noun "baptisma" "baptism" which is a <a href="neologism">neologism</a> unknown in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> and other pre-Christian Jewish texts. This broadness in the meaning of "baptizein" is reflected in English Bibles rendering "wash", where Jewish ritual washing is meant: for example Mark 7:4 states that the Pharisees "except they wash (Greek "baptize"), they do not eat", and "baptize" where "baptisma", the new Christian rite, is intended.

Two nouns derived from the verb "baptizo" (βαπτίζω) appear in the New Testament: the masculine noun "baptismos" (βαπτισμός) and the neuter noun "baptisma" (βάπτισμα):


A Christian baptism is administered in one of the following forms, performing the action either once or thrice:

Until the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, most baptisms were performed with the candidates naked—as is evidenced by most of the early portrayals of baptism (some of which are shown in this article), and the early Church Fathers and other Christian writers. Deaconesses helped female candidates for reasons of modesty.

Typical of these is <a href="Cyril%20of%20Jerusalem">Cyril of Jerusalem</a> who wrote "On the Mysteries of Baptism" in the 4th century (c. 350 AD):

The symbolism is threefold:

1. Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth—"by water and the Spirit"—the nakedness of baptism (the second birth) paralleled the condition of one's original birth. For example, St. John Chrysostom calls the baptism "λοχείαν", i.e., giving birth, and "new way of creation...from water and Spirit" ("to John" speech 25,2), and later elaborates:

2. The removal of clothing represented the "image of putting off the old man with his deeds" (as per Cyril, above), so the stripping of the body before for baptism represented taking off the trappings of sinful self, so that the "new man", which is given by Jesus, can be put on.

3. As St. Cyril again asserts above, as Adam and Eve in scripture were naked, innocent and unashamed in the Garden of Eden, nakedness during baptism was seen as a renewal of that innocence and state of original sinlessness. Other parallels can also be drawn, such as between the exposed condition of Christ during His crucifixion, and the crucifixion of the "old man" of the repentant sinner in preparation for baptism.

Changing customs and concerns regarding modesty probably contributed to the practice of permitting or requiring the baptismal candidate to either retain their undergarments (as in many Renaissance paintings of baptism such as those by da Vinci, Tintoretto, Van Scorel, Masaccio, de Wit and others) and/or to wear, as is almost universally the practice today, baptismal robes. These robes are most often white, symbolizing purity. Some groups today allow any suitable clothes to be worn, such as trousers and a T-shirt—practical considerations include how easily the clothes will dry (denim is discouraged), and whether they will become see-through when wet.

Though some form of immersion was likely the most common method of baptism, many of the writings from the ancient church appeared to view the mode of baptism as inconsequential. The Didache 7.1–3 (AD 60–150) allowed for affusion practices in situations where immersion was not practical. Likewise, Tertullian (AD 196–212) allowed for varying approaches to baptism even if those practices did not conform to biblical or traditional mandates (cf. De corona militis 3; De baptismo 17). Finally, Cyprian (ca. AD 256) explicitly stated that the amount of water was inconsequential and defended immersion, affusion, and aspersion practices (Epistle 75.12). As a result, there was no uniform or consistent mode of baptism in the ancient church prior to the fourth century.

There are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Some Christian groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>, and speak of "<a href="baptismal%20regeneration">baptismal regeneration</a>". Its importance is related to their interpretation of the meaning of the "Mystical Body of Christ" as found in the New Testament. This view is shared by the Catholic and <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodox</a> denominations, and by Churches formed early during the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> such as <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> and <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a>. For example, <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> said:

The <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Churches of Christ</a>," <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, <a href="Christadelphians">Christadelphians</a>, and <a href="LDS%20Church">LDS Church</a> also espouse baptism as necessary for salvation.

For Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of the children of God ("<a href="Catechism%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a>", 1212–13). It configures the person to Christ (CCC 1272), and obliges the Christian to share in the Church's apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood (<a href="martyrdom">martyrdom</a>). In his encyclical "<a href="Mystici%20corporis%20Christi">Mystici corporis Christi</a>" of June 29, 1943, <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a> spoke of baptism and profession of the true faith as what makes members of the one true Church, which is the body of Jesus Christ himself, as God the Holy Spirit has taught through the Apostle Paul:
By contrast, <a href="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> and <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> Protestants recognize baptism as an outward sign of an inward reality following on an individual believer's experience of forgiving grace. <a href="Reformed">Reformed</a> and <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> Protestants maintain a link between baptism and regeneration, but insist that it is not automatic or mechanical, and that regeneration may occur at a different time than baptism.

<a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Churches of Christ</a> consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do." Thus, they see baptism as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God".

The <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> of baptism for Catholics, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a>, <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a>, and <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> makes clear reference to baptism as not only a symbolic burial and resurrection, but an actual supernatural transformation, one that draws parallels to the experience of <a href="Noah">Noah</a> and the passage of the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> through the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> divided by <a href="Moses">Moses</a>. Thus, baptism is literally and symbolically not only cleansing, but also dying and rising again with Christ. Catholics believe that baptism is necessary for the cleansing of the taint of <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>, and for that reason infant baptism is a common practice. The Eastern Churches (<a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> and <a href="Oriental%20Orthodoxy">Oriental Orthodoxy</a>) also baptize infants on the basis of texts, such as , which are interpreted as supporting full Church membership for children. In these denominations, baptism is immediately followed by <a href="Chrismation">Chrismation</a> and <a href="Eucharist">Communion</a> at the next <a href="Divine%20Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a>, regardless of age. Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin of Adam. Anglicans believe that Baptism is also the entry into the Church and therefore allows them access to all rights and responsibilities as full members, including the privilege to receive Holy Communion. Most Methodists and Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.

Eastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on complete threefold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. <a href="Latin%20Church">Latin Church</a> Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Eastern Catholics usually by submersion, or at least partial immersion. However, submersion is gaining in popularity within the Latin Catholic Church. In newer church sanctuaries, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion. Anglicans baptize by submersion, immersion, affusion or sprinkling.

According to evidence which can be traced back to at latest about the year 200, sponsors or godparents are present at baptism and vow to uphold the Christian education and life of the baptized.

Baptists argue that the Greek word originally meant "to immerse". They interpret some Biblical passages concerning baptism as requiring submersion of the body in water. They also state that only submersion reflects the symbolic significance of being "buried" and "raised" with Christ. Baptist Churches baptize in the name of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, they do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation; but rather that it is an act of Christian obedience.

Some "<a href="Full%20Gospel">Full Gospel</a>" <a href="Charismatic%20Christianity">charismatic</a> churches such as <a href="Oneness%20Pentecostal">Oneness Pentecostal</a>s baptize only in the name of Jesus Christ, citing Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus as their authority. They also point to several historical sources that maintain that the early church always baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus until development of the Trinity Doctrine in the 2nd century.

In 1982 the <a href="World%20Council%20of%20Churches">World Council of Churches</a> published the <a href="Christian%20ecumenism">ecumenical</a> paper "<a href="Baptism%2C%20Eucharist%20and%20Ministry">Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry</a>". The preface of the document states:

A 1997 document, "Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism", gave the views of a commission of experts brought together under the aegis of the World Council of Churches. It states:

Those who heard, who were baptized and entered the community's life, were already made witnesses of and partakers in the promises of God for the last days: the forgiveness of sins through baptism in the name of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on all flesh. Similarly, in what may well be a baptismal pattern, <a href="First%20Epistle%20of%20Peter">1 Peter</a> testifies that proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and teaching about new life lead to purification and new birth. This, in turn, is followed by eating and drinking <a href="Holy%20Communion">God's food</a>, by participation in the life of the community—the royal priesthood, the new temple, the people of God—and by further moral formation. At the beginning of 1 Peter the writer sets this baptism in the context of obedience to Christ and sanctification by the Spirit. So baptism into Christ is seen as baptism into the Spirit. In the fourth gospel Jesus' discourse with <a href="Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a> indicates that birth by water and Spirit becomes the gracious means of entry into the place where God rules. 

Since the Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Methodist and Lutheran churches teach that baptism is a <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a> that has actual spiritual and salvific effects, certain key criteria must be complied with for it to be valid, i.e., to actually have those effects. If these key criteria are met, violation of some rules regarding baptism, such as varying the authorized rite for the ceremony, renders the baptism illicit (contrary to the church's laws) but still valid.

One of the criteria for validity is use of the correct form of words. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb "baptize" is essential. Catholics of the <a href="Latin%20Church">Latin Church</a>, Anglicans and Methodists use the form "I baptize you..." Eastern Orthodox and some <a href="Eastern%20Catholic%20Churches">Eastern Catholics</a> use a <a href="passive%20voice">passive voice</a> form "The Servant/(Handmaiden) of God is baptized in the name of..." or "This person is baptized by my hands..."

Use of the <a href="Trinitarian%20formula">Trinitarian formula</a> "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" is also considered essential; thus these churches do not accept as valid baptisms of non-<a href="Trinitarianism">Trinitarian</a> churches such as <a href="Oneness%20Pentecostals">Oneness Pentecostals</a>. 

Another essential condition is use of water. A baptism in which some liquid that would not usually be called water, such as wine, milk, soup or fruit juice was used would not be considered valid.

Another requirement is that the celebrant intends to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention "to do what the Church does", not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.

Some conditions expressly do not affect validity—for example, whether submersion, immersion, affusion or aspersion is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized. As has been stated, "it is not sufficient for the water to merely touch the candidate; it must also flow, otherwise there would seem to be no real ablution. At best, such a baptism would be considered doubtful. If the water touches only the hair, the sacrament has probably been validly conferred, though in practice the safer course must be followed. If only the clothes of the person have received the aspersion, the baptism is undoubtedly void." For many communions, validity is not affected if a single submersion or pouring is performed rather than a triple, but in Orthodoxy this is controversial.

According to the Catholic Church, baptism imparts an <a href="sacramental%20character">indelible "seal"</a> upon the soul of the baptized and therefore a person who has already been baptized cannot be validly baptized again. This teaching was affirmed against the <a href="Donatist">Donatist</a>s who practiced rebaptism. The grace received in baptism is believed to operate "ex opere operato" and is therefore considered valid even if administered in heretical or schismatic groups.

The <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a>, <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>, <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>, <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> and <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> Churches accept baptism performed by other denominations within this group as valid, subject to certain conditions, including the use of the Trinitarian formula. It is only possible to be baptized once, thus people with valid baptisms from other denominations may not be baptized again upon conversion or transfer. Such people are accepted upon making a profession of faith and, if they have not yet validly received the sacrament/rite of confirmation or chrismation, by being confirmed. Specifically, "Methodist theologians argued that since God never abrogated a covenant made and sealed with proper intentionality, rebaptism was never an option, unless the original baptism had been defective by not having been made in the name of the Trinity." In some cases it can be difficult to decide if the original baptism was in fact valid; if there is doubt, <a href="conditional%20baptism">conditional baptism</a> is administered, with a formula on the lines of "If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you..."

In the still recent past, it was common practice in the Roman Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from Protestantism because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete case. In the case of the major Protestant Churches, agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestants. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the Churches of <a href="Eastern%20Christianity">Eastern Christianity</a>, but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in the LDS Church.

Practice in the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> for converts from other communions is not uniform. However, generally baptisms performed in the name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised in the name of the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he has been baptized in another Christian confession (other than Orthodox Christianity) his previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by <a href="chrismation">chrismation</a> or, in rare circumstances, <a href="confession%20of%20faith">confession of faith</a> alone as long as the baptism was done in the name of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The exact procedure is dependent on local <a href="canon%20law">canons</a> and is the subject of some controversy.

<a href="Oriental%20Orthodox%20Church">Oriental Orthodox Church</a>es recognise the validity of baptisms performed within the Eastern Orthodox Communion. Some also recognise baptisms performed by Catholic Churches. Any supposed baptism not performed using the Trinitarian formula is considered invalid.

In the eyes of the Catholic Church, all Orthodox Churches, Anglican and Lutheran Churches, the baptism conferred by the LDS Church is invalid. An article published together with the official declaration to that effect gave reasons for that judgment, summed up in the following words: "The Baptism of the Catholic Church and that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints differ essentially, both for what concerns faith in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in whose name Baptism is conferred, and for what concerns the relationship to Christ who instituted it."

The LDS Church stresses that baptism must be administered by one having proper authority; consequently, the church does not recognize the baptism of any other church as valid.

Jehovah's Witnesses do not recognise any other baptism occurring after 1914 as valid, as they believe that they are now the one true church of Christ, and that the rest of "Christendom" is false religion.

There is debate among Christian churches as to who can administer baptism. The examples given in the New Testament only show apostles and deacons administering baptism. Ancient Christian churches interpret this as indicating that baptism should be performed by the clergy except "in extremis", i.e., <a href="emergency%20baptism">when the one being baptized is in immediate danger of death</a>. Then anyone may baptize, provided, in the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the person who does the baptizing is a member of that Church, or, in the view of the Catholic Church, that the person, even if not baptized, intends to do what the Church does in administering the rite. Many Protestant churches see no specific prohibition in the biblical examples and permit any believer to baptize another.

In the Roman Catholic Church, <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> for the <a href="Latin%20Church">Latin Church</a> lays down that the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest or deacon, but its administration is one of the functions "especially entrusted to the <a href="priest">parish priest</a>". If the person to be baptized is at least fourteen years old, that person's baptism is to be referred to the bishop, so that he can decide whether to confer the baptism himself. If no ordinary minister is available, a <a href="catechist">catechist</a> or some other person whom the local <a href="Ordinary%20%28officer%29">ordinary</a> has appointed for this purpose may licitly do the baptism; indeed in a case of necessity "any" person (irrespective of that person's religion) who has the requisite intention may confer the baptism By "a case of necessity" is meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. "The requisite intention" is, at the minimum level, the intention "to do what the Church does" through the rite of baptism.

In the <a href="Eastern%20Catholic%20Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a>, a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister. Administration of the sacrament is reserved to the Parish Priest or to another priest to whom he or the local <a href="ordinary%20%28officer%29">hierarch</a> grants permission, a permission that can be presumed if in accordance with canon law. However, "in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize."

The discipline of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, <a href="Oriental%20Orthodoxy">Oriental Orthodoxy</a> and the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. They require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the Church. The Latin Catholic Church does not insist on this condition, considering that the effect of the sacrament, such as membership of the Church, is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the Holy Spirit. For the Orthodox, while Baptism "in extremis" may be administered by a deacon or any lay-person, if the newly baptized person survives, a priest must still perform the other prayers of the Rite of Baptism, and administer the <a href="Sacred%20Mysteries">Mystery</a> of <a href="Chrismation">Chrismation</a>.

The discipline of <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a> and <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> is similar to that of the Latin Catholic Church. For <a href="Methodists">Methodists</a> and many other Protestant denominations, too, the ordinary minister of baptism is a duly ordained or appointed minister of religion.

Newer movements of Protestant <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> churches, particularly non-denominational, allow laypeople to baptize.

In the LDS Church, only a man who has been ordained to the <a href="Aaronic%20priesthood%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Aaronic priesthood</a> holding the priesthood office of <a href="Priest%20%28Mormonism%29">priest</a> or higher office in the <a href="Melchizedek%20priesthood%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Melchizedek priesthood</a> may administer baptism.

A <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> baptism is performed by a "dedicated male" adherent. Only in extraordinary circumstances would a "dedicated" baptizer be unbaptized (see section "<a href="%23Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>").

<a href="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a>s ("re-baptizers") and <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a> promote adult baptism, or "<a href="believer%27s%20baptism">believer's baptism</a>". Baptism is seen as an act identifying one as having accepted Jesus Christ as savior.

Early Anabaptists were given that name because they re-baptized persons who they felt had not been properly baptized, having received infant baptism, sprinkling.

The traditional form of Anabaptist baptism was pouring or sprinkling, the form commonly used in the West in the early 16th century when they emerged. Since the 18th century immersion and submersion became more widespread. Today all forms of baptism can be found among Anabaptist.

Baptism memorializes the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus. Baptism does not accomplish anything in itself, but is an outward personal sign or testimony that the person's sins have already been washed away by the blood of Christ's cross. It is considered a covenantal act, signifying entrance into the <a href="New%20Covenant">New Covenant</a> of Christ.

For the majority of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to the believer's faith in the final resurrection of the dead.

Furthermore, for a new convert the general practice is that baptism also allows the person to be a registered member of the local Baptist congregation (though some churches have adopted "new members classes" as a mandatory step for congregational membership).

Regarding rebaptism the general rules are:

Baptism in <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Churches of Christ</a> is performed only by full bodily immersion, based on the <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a> verb "baptizo" which means to dip, immerse, submerge or plunge. Submersion is seen as more closely conforming to the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus than other modes of baptism. Churches of Christ argue that historically immersion was the mode used in the 1st century, and that pouring and sprinkling later emerged as secondary modes when immersion was not possible. Over time these secondary modes came to replace immersion. Only those mentally capable of belief and repentance are baptized (i.e., <a href="infant%20baptism">infant baptism</a> is not practiced because the New Testament has no precedent for it).

Churches of Christ have historically had the most conservative position on baptism among the various branches of the <a href="Restoration%20Movement">Restoration Movement</a>, understanding baptism by immersion to be a necessary part of conversion. The most significant disagreements concerned the extent to which a correct understanding of the role of baptism is necessary for its validity. <a href="David%20Lipscomb">David Lipscomb</a> insisted that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey God, the baptism was valid, even if the individual did not fully understand the role baptism plays in salvation. <a href="Austin%20McGary">Austin McGary</a> contended that to be valid, the convert must also understand that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. McGary's view became the prevailing one in the early 20th century, but the approach advocated by Lipscomb never totally disappeared. As such, the general practice among churches of Christ is to require rebaptism by immersion of converts, even those who were previously baptized by immersion in other churches.

More recently, the rise of the <a href="International%20Churches%20of%20Christ">International Churches of Christ</a> (who "saw themselves as the only true Christians and insisted on reimmersing all who come into their fellowship, even those previously immersed 'for remission of sins' in a Church of Christ") has caused some to reexamine the issue.

Churches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do." Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God." While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a "sacrament", their view of it can legitimately be described as "sacramental." They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself, and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than just a symbol of conversion. A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as just a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as "the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation." There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to "reexamine the richness of the biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity."

Because of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation, some Baptists hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of <a href="baptismal%20regeneration">baptismal regeneration</a>. However, members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual. Rather, their inclination is to point to the biblical passage in which Peter, analogizing baptism to Noah's flood, posits that "likewise baptism doth also now save us" but parenthetically clarifies that baptism is ""not" the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the "response of a good conscience" toward God" (1 Peter 3:21). One author from the churches of Christ describes the relationship between faith and baptism this way, ""Faith" is the "reason why" a person is a child of God; "baptism" is the "time at which" one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God" (italics are in the source). Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance, rather than a "work" that earns salvation.

In <a href="Reformed%20baptismal%20theology">Reformed baptismal theology</a>, baptism is seen as primarily God's offer of <a href="union%20with%20Christ">union with Christ</a> and all his benefits to the baptized. This offer is believed to be intact even when it is not received in faith by the person baptized. Reformed theologians believe the Holy Spirit brings into effect the promises signified in baptism. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. Baptism also initiates one into the <a href="visible%20church">visible church</a> and the <a href="covenant%20of%20grace">covenant of grace</a>. Baptism is seen as a replacement of <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a>, which is considered the rite of initiation into the covenant of grace in the Old Testament.

Reformed Christians believe that immersion is not necessary for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, with no allowance for emergency baptism, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church, accept the validity of baptisms performed with them and do not rebaptize.

In Catholic teaching, baptism is stated to be "necessary for salvation by actual reception or at least by desire". This teaching is based on Jesus' words in the <a href="Gospel%20according%20to%20John">Gospel according to John</a>: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." It dates back to the teachings and practices of 1st-century Christians, and the connection between salvation and baptism was not, on the whole, an item of major dispute until <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Huldrych Zwingli</a> denied the necessity of baptism, which he saw as merely a sign granting admission to the Christian community. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that "Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament." The <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a> also states in the "Decree Concerning Justification" from session six that baptism is necessary for salvation. A person who knowingly, willfully and unrepentantly rejects baptism has no hope of salvation. However, if knowledge is absent, "those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church, yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience."

The Catechism of the Catholic Church also states: "Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more <a href="exorcism">exorcism</a>s are pronounced over the candidate". In the <a href="Roman%20Rite">Roman Rite</a> of the baptism of a child, the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: "Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). Through Christ our Lord."

Catholics are baptized in water, by submersion, immersion or affusion, in the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit—not three gods, but <a href="Trinity">one God subsisting in three Persons</a>. While sharing in the one divine essence, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not simply three "masks" or manifestations of one divine being. The faith of the Church and of the individual Christian is based on a relationship with these three "Persons" of the one God. Adults can also be baptized through the <a href="Rite%20of%20Christian%20Initiation%20of%20Adults">Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults</a>.

It is claimed that <a href="Pope%20Stephen%20I">Pope Stephen I</a>, <a href="St.%20Ambrose">St. Ambrose</a> and <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20I">Pope Nicholas I</a> declared that baptisms in the name of "Jesus" only as well as in the name of "Father, Son and Holy Spirit" were valid. The correct interpretation of their words is disputed. Current <a href="canonical%20law">canonical law</a> requires the Trinitarian formula and water for validity.

The Church recognizes two equivalents of baptism with water: "baptism of blood" and "<a href="baptism%20of%20desire">baptism of desire</a>". Baptism of blood is that undergone by unbaptized individuals who are <a href="martyr">martyr</a>ed for their faith, while baptism of desire generally applies to <a href="catechumen">catechumen</a>s who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:

The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This "Baptism of blood", like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament. (1258)

For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament. (1259)

The Catholic Church holds that those who are ignorant of Christ's Gospel and of the Church, but who seek the truth and do God's will as they understand it, may be supposed to have an implicit desire for baptism and can be saved: "'Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.' Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity." As for unbaptized infants, the Church is unsure of their fate; "the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God".

<a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> believe that baptism should be performed by complete immersion (submersion) only when an individual is old enough to understand its significance. They believe that water baptism is an outward symbol that a person has made an unconditional dedication through Jesus Christ to do the will of God. They consider baptism to constitute ordination as a minister.

Prospective candidates for baptism must express their desire to be baptized well in advance of a planned baptismal event, to allow for congregation <a href="Elder%20%28Christianity%29%23Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">elders</a> to assess their suitability. Elders approve candidates for baptism if the candidates are considered to understand what is expected of members of the religion and to demonstrate sincere dedication to the faith.

Most baptisms among Jehovah's Witnesses are performed at scheduled assemblies and conventions by elders and ministerial servants and rarely occur at local <a href="Kingdom%20Hall">Kingdom Hall</a>s. Prior to baptism, at the conclusion of a pre-baptism talk, candidates must affirm two questions:
Only baptized males may baptize new members. Baptizers and candidates wear swimsuits or other informal clothing for baptism, but are directed to avoid clothing that is considered undignified or revealing. Generally, candidates are individually immersed by a single baptizer, unless a candidate has special circumstances such as a physical <a href="disability">disability</a>. In circumstances of extended isolation, a qualified candidate's dedication and stated intention to become baptized may serve to identify him as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, even if immersion itself must be delayed. In rare instances, unbaptized males who had stated such an intention have reciprocally baptized each other, with both baptisms accepted as valid. Individuals who had been baptized in the 1930s and 1940s by female Witnesses, such as in concentration camps, were later re-baptized but recognized their original baptism dates.

In <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church), baptism has the main purpose of remitting the <a href="sin">sin</a>s of the participant. It is followed by <a href="Confirmation%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">confirmation</a>, which inducts the person into membership in the church and constitutes a <a href="baptism%20with%20the%20Holy%20Spirit">baptism with the Holy Spirit</a>. Latter-day Saints believe that baptism must be by full immersion, and by a precise ritualized ordinance: if some part of the participant is not fully immersed, or the ordinance was not recited verbatim, the ritual must be repeated. It typically occurs in a <a href="baptismal%20font">baptismal font</a>.

In addition, members of the LDS Church do not believe a baptism is valid unless it is performed by a Latter-day Saint one who has proper authority (a <a href="Priest%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">priest</a> or <a href="Elder%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">elder</a>). Authority is passed down through a form of <a href="apostolic%20succession">apostolic succession</a>. All new converts to the faith must be baptized or <a href="rebaptism%20%28Mormonism%29">re-baptized</a>. Baptism is seen as symbolic both of Jesus' death, burial and <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a> and is also symbolic of the baptized individual discarding their "natural" self and donning a new identity as a disciple of Jesus.

According to Latter-day Saint theology, <a href="faith">faith</a> and <a href="repentance">repentance</a> are prerequisites to baptism. The ritual does not cleanse the participant of <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>, as Latter-day Saints do not believe the doctrine of original sin. Mormonism rejects <a href="infant%20baptism">infant baptism</a> and baptism must occur after the <a href="age%20of%20accountability">age of accountability</a>, defined in Latter-day Saint scripture as eight years old.

Latter-day Saint theology also teaches <a href="baptism%20for%20the%20dead">baptism for the dead</a> in which deceased ancestors are baptized vicariously by the living, and believe that their practice is what Paul wrote of in . This occurs in <a href="Temple%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Latter-day Saint temples</a>.

<a href="Quakers">Quakers</a> (members of the <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Religious Society of Friends</a>) do not believe in the baptism of either children or adults with water, rejecting all forms of outward <a href="sacraments">sacraments</a> in their religious life. <a href="Robert%20Barclay">Robert Barclay</a>'s "Apology for the True Christian Divinity" (a historic explanation of Quaker theology from the 17th century), explains Quakers' opposition to baptism with water thus:

<a href="Robert%20Barclay">Barclay</a> argued that water baptism was only something that happened until the time of Christ, but that now, people are baptised inwardly by the spirit of Christ, and hence there is no need for the external sacrament of water baptism, which <a href="Quakers">Quakers</a> argue is meaningless.

The <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> does not practice water baptism, or indeed other outward <a href="sacraments">sacraments</a>. <a href="William%20Booth">William Booth</a> and <a href="Catherine%20Booth">Catherine Booth</a>, the founders of the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a>, believed that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. They believed what was important was spiritual grace itself. However, although the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> does not practice baptism, they are not opposed to baptism within other Christian denominations.

There are some Christians termed "<a href="Hyperdispensationalism">Hyperdispensationalists</a>" (Mid-Acts dispensationalism)who accept only Paul's Epistles as directly applicable for the church today. They do not accept water baptism as a practice for the church since Paul who was God's apostle to the nations was not sent to baptize. Ultradispensationalists (Acts 28 dispensationalism) who do not accept the practice of the Lord's supper, do not practice baptism because these are not found in the Prison Epistles. Both sects believe water baptism was a valid practice for covenant Israel. Hyperdispensationalists also teach that Peter's gospel message was not the same as Paul's. Hyperdispensationalists assert:


Water baptism found early in the pageRank.Book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism foretold by John the Baptist. Others make a distinction between John's prophesied baptism by Christ with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit's baptism of the believer into the body of Christ; the latter being the one baptism for today. The one baptism for today, it is asserted, is the "baptism of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>" of the believer into the Body of Christ church.

Many in this group also argue that John's promised <a href="Baptized%20by%20fire">baptism by fire</a> is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire.

John, as he said "baptized with water", as did Jesus's disciples to the early, Jewish Christian church. Jesus himself never personally baptized with water, but did so through his disciples. Unlike Jesus' first apostles, Paul, his apostle to the Gentiles, was sent to preach rather than to baptize in contradiction to the Great Commission. But Paul did occasionally still baptize Jews, for instance in Corinth and in Philippi. He also taught the spiritual significance of Spirit baptism in identifying the believer with the atoning death of Christ, his burial, and resurrection. Romans 6 baptism does not mention nor imply water but is rather a real baptism into Christ's death.

Other Hyperdispensationalists believe that baptism was necessary until mid-Acts. The great commission and its baptism was directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later. Any Jew who believed did not receive salvation or the baptism of the Holy Spirit until they were water baptized. This period ended with the calling of Paul. Peter's reaction when the Gentiles received the Holy Spirit before baptism is seen as proof of transition from water to Spirit baptism. Also significant is the lack of any instructions in the Acts 15 apostolic conference requiring Gentiles to be water baptized.

Comparative Summary of Baptisms of Denominations of Christian Influence. (This section does not give a complete listing of denominations, and therefore, it only mentions a fraction of the churches practicing "believer's baptism".)

Most Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be <a href="sacramental%20character">neither repeated nor undone</a>. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by <a href="irreligion">rejecting religion</a> entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing debaptism.

Many cultures practice or have practiced initiation rites, with or without the use of water, including the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian">ancient Egyptian</a>, the <a href="Hebrews">Hebraic</a>/Jewish, the <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>n, the <a href="Maya%20civilization">Mayan</a>, and the <a href="Norsemen">Norse</a> cultures. The modern Japanese practice of <a href="Miyamairi">Miyamairi</a> is such as ceremony that does not use water. In some, such evidence may be <a href="archaeology">archaeological</a> and descriptive in nature, rather than a modern practice.

<a href="Apuleius">Apuleius</a>, a 2nd-century <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> writer, described an initiation into the <a href="Greco-Roman%20mysteries">mysteries</a> of <a href="Isis">Isis</a>. The initiation was preceded by a normal bathing in the public baths and a ceremonial sprinkling by the priest of Isis, after which the candidate was given secret instructions in the temple of the goddess. The candidate then fasted for ten days from meat and wine, after which he was dressed in linen and led at night into the innermost part of the sanctuary, where the actual initiation, the details of which were secret, took place. On the next two days, dressed in the robes of his consecration, he participated in feasting. Apuleius describes also an initiation into the cult of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> and yet a third initiation, of the same pattern as the initiation into the cult of Isis, without mention of a preliminary bathing.

The water-less initiations of Lucius, the character in Apuleius's story who had been turned into an ass and changed back by Isis into human form, into the successive degrees of the rites of the goddess was accomplished only after a significant period of study to demonstrate his loyalty and trustworthiness, akin to <a href="catechumen">catechumen</a>al practices preceding baptism in Christianity.

The <a href="Ecclesia%20Gnostica%20Catholica">Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica</a>, or Gnostic Catholic Church (the ecclesiastical arm of <a href="Ordo%20Templi%20Orientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a>), offers its Rite of Baptism to any person at least 11 years old. The ceremony is performed before a <a href="Gnostic%20Mass">Gnostic Mass</a> and represents a symbolic birth into the <a href="Thelemic">Thelemic</a> community.

The word "baptism" or "christening" is sometimes used to describe the inauguration of certain objects for use.

Bocce

The sport is also very popular on the eastern side of the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a>, especially in <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> and <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, where the sport is known in <a href="Serbo-Croatian%20language">Serbo-Croatian</a> as ' ('playing '') or ' (colloquially also '). In <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> the sport is known as ' or colloquially 'playing '', or ' (from Italian ' and Venetian "", meaning 'balls', respectively).

Bocce is traditionally played on natural soil and asphalt courts in length and wide. Bocce balls can be made of <a href="metal">metal</a> or various kinds of <a href="plastic">plastic</a>. Unlike <a href="lawn%20bowls">lawn bowls</a>, bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias. 
A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the jack (called a ' ('little bocce') or ' ('bullet') in Italian, depending on local custom), from one end of the court into a zone in length, ending from the far end of the court. If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.
The side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does "not" have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its remaining balls. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically from 7 to 13 points.

Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately.

A variation called ' uses a metal ball, which is thrown overhand (palm down), after a run-up to the throwing line. In that latter respect, it is similar to the French boules game ' also known as '. A French variant of the game is called ', and (lacking the run-up) is more similar in some respects to traditional ".

Another development, for persons with disabilities, is called ". It is a shorter-range game, played with leather balls on an indoor, smooth surface.

Beatmatching

Beatmatching or pitch cue is a <a href="disc%20jockey">disc jockey</a> technique of <a href="pitch%20shift">pitch shift</a>ing or <a href="Audio%20timescale-pitch%20modification">timestretching</a> an upcoming track to match its <a href="tempo">tempo</a> to that of the currently playing track, and to adjust them such that the beats (and, usually, the bars) are synchronised — i.e., the kicks and snares in two house records hit at the same time when both records are played simultaneously. Beatmatching is a component of beatmixing which employs beatmatching combined with equalization, attention to phrasing and track selection in an attempt to make a single mix that flows together and has a good structure.

The technique was developed to keep the people from leaving the dancefloor at the end of the song. These days it is considered basic among disc jockeys (DJs) in <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">electronic dance music</a> genres, and it is standard practice in clubs to keep the constant beat through the night, even if DJs change in the middle.

Beatmatching is no longer considered a novelty, and new digital software has made the technique much easier to master.

The beatmatching technique consists of the following steps:


One of the key things to consider when beatmatching is the tempo of both songs, and the musical theory behind the songs. Attempting to beatmatch songs with completely different BPM's (Beats Per Minute), will usually result in one or both of the songs sounding too fast or too slow. For example, mixing a song with a BPM of 130, and a song with a BPM of 90, would most likely not sound great, as to be on the same beats per minute, one song will need to be sped up, and one slowed down. When beatmatching songs of similar BPM's it is important to consider the genre of each song. While most songs with the same BPM have similar beat structures, some genres will feature songs that won't mix well with others. 

When beatmatching, a popular technique used by many disc jockeys around the world is to vary the equalization of both tracks. For example, when the kicks are occurring on the same beat, a more seamless transition can occur if the lower frequencies are taken out of one of the songs, and the lower frequencies of the other song is boosted. Doing so creates a smoother transition that the audience would generally react to better . 

The <a href="Pitch%20%28music%29">pitch</a> and tempo of a track are normally linked together: spin a disc 5% faster and both pitch and tempo will be 5% higher. However, some modern DJ software can change pitch and tempo independently using <a href="Audio%20timescale-pitch%20modification">time-stretching and pitch-shifting</a>, allowing <a href="harmonic%20mixing">harmonic mixing</a>. There is also a feature in most modern DJ software to change the tempo but keeping the original pitch, this is often referred to as <a href="master%20tempo">master tempo</a> or <a href="key%20adjust">key adjust</a>.

Beatmatching was invented by <a href="Francis%20Grasso">Francis Grasso</a> in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Initially he was counting the tempo with a <a href="metronome">metronome</a> and looking for records with the same tempo. Later a mixer was built for him by <a href="Alex%20Rosner">Alex Rosner</a> which let him listen to any channel in the headphones independently of what was playing on the speakers; this became the defining feature of <a href="DJ%20mixer">DJ mixer</a>s. That and turntables with <a href="pitch%20control">pitch control</a> enabled him to mix tracks with different tempo by changing the pitch of the "cued" (redirected to headphones) track to match its tempo with the track being played by ear. Essentially, the technique he originated hasn't changed since.

These days beat-matching is considered central to DJing, and features making it possible are a requirement for DJ-oriented players. In 1978, the <a href="Technics%20SL-1200">Technics SL-1200MK2</a> turntable was released, whose comfortable and precise sliding pitch control and high torque <a href="Direct-drive%20turntable">direct drive</a> motor made beat-matching easier and it became the standard among DJs. With the advent of the compact disc, DJ-oriented <a href="Compact%20Disc%20player">Compact Disc player</a>s with pitch control and other features enabling beat-matching (and sometimes <a href="scratching">scratching</a>), dubbed <a href="CDJ">CDJ</a>s, were introduced by various companies. More recently, software with similar capabilities has been developed to allow manipulation of <a href="digital%20audio">digital audio</a> files stored on computers using turntables with special vinyl records (e.g. <a href="Final%20Scratch">Final Scratch</a>, <a href="M-Audio%20Torq">M-Audio Torq</a>, <a href="Serato%20Scratch%20Live">Serato Scratch Live</a>) or computer interface (e.g. <a href="Traktor%20DJ%20Studio">Traktor DJ Studio</a>, <a href="Mixxx">Mixxx</a>, <a href="Virtual%20DJ">Virtual DJ</a>). Other software including algorithmic beat-matching is <a href="Ableton%20Live">Ableton Live</a>, which allows for realtime music manipulation and deconstruction, or <a href="Mixmeister">Mixmeister</a>, a DJ Mixset creation tool. Freeware software such as <a href="Rapid%20Evolution">Rapid Evolution</a> can detect the <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a> and determine the percent BPM difference between songs. 

The change from pure hardware to software is on the rise, and big DJs are introducing new equipment to their kits such as the <a href="laptop">laptop</a>, and dropping the difficulty of carrying hundreds of CDs with them. The creation of the mp3-player allowed DJs to have an alternative tool for DJIng. Limitations with mp3-player DJing equipment has meant that only second generation equipment such as the IDJ2 or the Cortex Dmix-300 have the pitch control that alters tempo and allows for beat-matching on a digital music player. However, recent additions to the <a href="Pioneer%20Corporation">Pioneer</a> CDJ family, such as the <a href="CDJ-2000">CDJ-2000</a>, allow mp3-player and other digital storage devices (such as external hard drives, SD cards and USB memory sticks) to be connected to the CDJ device via USB. This allows the DJ to make use of the beat-matching capabilities of the CDJ unit whilst playing digital music files from the mp3-player or other storage device.

Most modern DJ hardware and software now offers a "Sync" feature which automatically adjusts the tempo between tracks being mixed so the DJ no longer needs to spend time and effort matching beats. This has caused some controversy in the DJ industry since almost anyone can beat-match thanks to the new function.

Beltane

Beltane () is the <a href="Anglicisation">anglicised</a> name for the <a href="Gaels">Gaelic</a> <a href="May%20Day">May Day</a> festival. Most commonly it is held on 1 May, or about halfway between the <a href="March%20equinox">spring equinox</a> and the <a href="summer%20solstice">summer solstice</a>. Historically, it was widely observed throughout <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>. In <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a> the name for the festival day is "Lá Bealtaine" (), in <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> "Là Bealltainn" () and in <a href="Manx%20language">Manx Gaelic</a> "Laa Boaltinn"/"Boaldyn". It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals—along with <a href="Samhain">Samhain</a>, <a href="Imbolc">Imbolc</a> and <a href="Lughnasadh">Lughnasadh</a>—and is similar to the Welsh <a href="Calan%20Mai">Calan Mai</a>.

Beltane is mentioned in some of the <a href="Early%20Irish%20literature">earliest Irish literature</a> and it is associated with important events in <a href="Irish%20mythology">Irish mythology</a>. It marked the beginning of summer and was when cattle were driven out to the summer pastures. Rituals were performed to protect the cattle, crops and people, and to encourage growth. Special <a href="bonfire">bonfire</a>s were kindled, and their flames, smoke and ashes were deemed to have protective powers. The people and their cattle would walk around the bonfire or between two bonfires, and sometimes leap over the flames or embers. All household fires would be doused and then re-lit from the Beltane bonfire. These gatherings would be accompanied by a feast, and some of the food and drink would be offered to the "<a href="aos%20s%C3%AD">aos sí</a>". Doors, windows, byres and the cattle themselves would be decorated with yellow May flowers, perhaps because they evoked fire. In parts of Ireland, people would make a May Bush: a thorn bush decorated with flowers, ribbons and bright shells. <a href="Holy%20well">Holy well</a>s were also visited, while Beltane <a href="dew">dew</a> was thought to bring beauty and maintain youthfulness. Many of these customs were part of May Day or Midsummer festivals in other parts of Great Britain and Europe.

Beltane celebrations had largely died out by the mid-20th century, although some of its customs continued and in some places it has been revived as a cultural event. Since the late 20th century, <a href="Celtic%20Neopaganism">Celtic neopagans</a> and <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>ns have observed Beltane, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. Neopagans in the Southern Hemisphere often celebrate Beltane at the other end of the year (around 1 November).

Beltane was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: <a href="Samhain">Samhain</a> (~1 November), <a href="Imbolc">Imbolc</a> (~1 February), Beltane (~1 May), and <a href="Lughnasadh">Lughnasadh</a> (~1 August). Beltane marked the beginning of the pastoral summer season, when livestock were driven out to the summer pastures. Rituals were held at that time to protect them from harm, both natural and supernatural, and this mainly involved the "symbolic use of fire". There were also rituals to protect crops, dairy products and people, and to encourage growth. The "<a href="aos%20s%C3%AD">aos sí</a>" (often referred to as spirits or fairies) were thought to be especially active at Beltane (as at Samhain) and the goal of many Beltane rituals was to appease them. Most scholars see the "aos sí" as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits. Beltaine was a "spring time festival of optimism" during which "fertility ritual again was important, perhaps connecting with the waxing power of the sun".

Beltane (the beginning of summer) and Samhain (the beginning of winter) are thought to have been the most important of the four Gaelic festivals. Sir <a href="James%20George%20Frazer">James George Frazer</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion</a>" that the times of Beltane and Samhain are of little importance to European crop-growers, but of great importance to herdsmen. Thus, he suggests that halving the year at 1 May and 1 November dates from a time when the Celts were mainly a pastoral people, dependent on their herds.

The earliest mention of Beltane is in <a href="Old%20Irish%20literature">Old Irish literature</a> from <a href="Gaelic%20Ireland">Gaelic Ireland</a>. According to the early medieval texts "<a href="Sanas%20Cormaic">Sanas Cormaic</a>" and "<a href="Tochmarc%20Emire">Tochmarc Emire</a>", Beltane was held on 1 May and marked the beginning of summer. The texts say that, to protect cattle from disease, the <a href="druid">druid</a>s would make two fires "with great incantations" and drive the cattle between them.

According to 17th century historian <a href="Geoffrey%20Keating">Geoffrey Keating</a>, there was a great gathering at the hill of <a href="Uisneach">Uisneach</a> each Beltane in medieval Ireland, where a sacrifice was made to a god named Beil. Keating wrote that two bonfires would be lit in every district of Ireland, and cattle would be driven between them to protect them from disease. There is no reference to such a gathering in <a href="Irish%20annals">the annals</a>, but the medieval "<a href="Dindsenchas">Dindsenchas</a>" includes a tale of a hero lighting a holy fire on Uisneach that blazed for seven years. Ronald Hutton writes that this may "preserve a tradition of Beltane ceremonies there", but adds "Keating or his source may simply have conflated this legend with the information in "Sanas Chormaic" to produce a piece of pseudo-history." Nevertheless, excavations at Uisneach in the 20th century found evidence of large fires and charred bones, showing it to have been ritually significant.

From the late 18th century to the mid 20th century, many accounts of Beltane customs were recorded by <a href="folkloristics">folklorists</a> and other writers.

Bonfires continued to be a key part of the festival in the modern era. All hearth fires and candles would be doused before the bonfire was lit, generally on a mountain or hill. <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> writes that "To increase the potency of the holy flames, in Britain at least they were often kindled by the most primitive of all means, of friction between wood." In the 19th century, for example, John Ramsay described Scottish Highlanders kindling a <a href="need-fire">need-fire</a> or <a href="force-fire">force-fire</a> at Beltane. Such a fire was deemed sacred. In the 19th century, the ritual of driving cattle between two fires—as described in "Sanas Cormaic" almost 1000 years before—was still practised across most of Ireland and in parts of Scotland. Sometimes the cattle would be driven "around" a bonfire or be made to leap over flames or embers. The people themselves would do likewise. In the Isle of Man, people ensured that the smoke blew over them and their cattle. When the bonfire had died down, people would daub themselves with its ashes and sprinkle it over their crops and livestock. Burning torches from the bonfire would be taken home, where they would be carried around the house or boundary of the farmstead and would be used to re-light the hearth. From these rituals, it is clear that the fire was seen as having protective powers. Similar rituals were part of May Day, Midsummer or Easter customs in other parts of the British Isles and mainland Europe. According to Frazer, the fire rituals are a kind of <a href="sympathetic%20magic">imitative or sympathetic magic</a>. According to one theory, they were meant to mimic the Sun and to "ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men, animals, and plants". According to another, they were meant to symbolically "burn up and destroy all harmful influences".
Food was also cooked at the bonfire and there were rituals involving it. <a href="Alexander%20Carmichael">Alexander Carmichael</a> wrote that there was a feast featuring lamb, and that formerly this lamb was sacrificed. In 1769, <a href="Thomas%20Pennant">Thomas Pennant</a> wrote that, in <a href="Perthshire">Perthshire</a>, a <a href="caudle">caudle</a> made from eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk was cooked on the bonfire. Some of the mixture was poured on the ground as a <a href="libation">libation</a>. Everyone present would then take an oatmeal cake, called the "bannoch Bealltainn" or "Beltane <a href="Bannock%20%28food%29">bannock</a>". A bit of it was offered to the spirits to protect their livestock (one bit to protect the horses, one bit to protect the sheep, and so forth) and a bit was offered to each of the animals that might harm their livestock (one to the fox, one to the eagle, and so forth). Afterwards, they would drink the caudle.

According to 18th century writers, in parts of Scotland there was another ritual involving the oatmeal cake. The cake would be cut and one of the slices marked with charcoal. The slices would then be put in a <a href="Bonnet%20%28headgear%29">bonnet</a> and everyone would take one out while blindfolded. According to one writer, whoever got the marked piece would have to leap through the fire three times. According to another, those present would pretend to throw him into the fire and, for some time afterwards, they would speak of him as if he were dead. This "may embody a memory of actual human sacrifice", or it may have always been symbolic. A similar ritual (i.e. of pretending to burn someone in the fire) was practised at spring and summer bonfire festivals in other parts of Europe.

Yellow flowers such as <a href="Primula%20vulgaris">primrose</a>, <a href="rowan">rowan</a>, <a href="Crataegus%20monogyna">hawthorn</a>, <a href="gorse">gorse</a>, <a href="hazel">hazel</a>, and <a href="Caltha%20palustris">marsh marigold</a> were placed at doorways and windows in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn at the doors and windows and sometimes they were made into <a href="flower%20bouquet">bouquets</a>, <a href="garland">garland</a>s or crosses and fastened to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.

The May Bush was popular in parts of Ireland until the late 19th century. This was a small tree or branch—typically hawthorn, rowan or sycamore—decorated with bright flowers, ribbons, painted shells, and so forth. There were household May Bushes (which would be placed outside each house) and communal May Bushes (which would be set in a public spot or paraded around the neighbourhood). In <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> and <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, May Bushes were brought into town from the countryside and decorated by the whole neighbourhood. Each neighbourhood vied for the most handsome tree and, sometimes, residents of one would try to steal the May Bush of another. This led to the May Bush being outlawed in <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian times</a>. In some places, it was customary to dance around the May Bush, and at the end of the festivities it may be burnt in the bonfire. Some, however, were left in place for a month. Thorn trees were seen as special trees and were associated with the "aos sí". The custom of decorating a May Bush or <a href="Maypole">May Tree</a> was found in many parts of Europe. Frazer believes that such customs are a relic of <a href="tree%20worship">tree worship</a> and writes: "The intention of these customs is to bring home to the village, and to each house, the blessings which the <a href="List%20of%20tree%20deities">tree-spirit</a> has in its power to bestow." <a href="Emyr%20Estyn%20Evans">Emyr Estyn Evans</a> suggests that the May Bush custom may have come to Ireland from England, because it seemed to be found in areas with strong English influence and because the Irish saw it as unlucky to damage certain thorn trees. However, "lucky" and "unlucky" trees varied by region, and it has been suggested that Beltane was the only time when cutting thorn trees was allowed. The practice of bedecking a May Bush with flowers, ribbons, garlands and bright shells is found among the Gaelic diaspora, most notably in <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, and in some Easter traditions on the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a>.

<a href="Holy%20well">Holy well</a>s were often visited at Beltane, and at the other Gaelic festivals of Imbolc and Lughnasadh. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking <a href="sunwise">sunwise</a> (moving from east to west) around the well. They would then leave offerings; typically coins or <a href="clootie">clootie</a>s (see <a href="clootie%20well">clootie well</a>). The first water drawn from a well on Beltane was seen as being especially potent, as was Beltane morning <a href="dew">dew</a>. At dawn on Beltane, maidens would roll in the dew or wash their faces with it. It would also be collected in a jar, left in the sunlight, and then filtered. The dew was thought to increase sexual attractiveness, maintain youthfulness, and help with skin ailments.

People also took steps specifically to ward-off or appease the "<a href="aos%20s%C3%AD">aos sí</a>". Food was left or milk poured at the doorstep or places associated with the "aos sí", such as 'fairy trees', as an offering. In Ireland, cattle would be brought to '<a href="fairy%20fort">fairy fort</a>s', where a small amount of their blood would be collected. The owners would then pour it into the earth with prayers for the herd's safety. Sometimes the blood would be left to dry and then be burnt. It was thought that dairy products were especially at risk from harmful spirits. To protect farm produce and encourage fertility, farmers would lead a procession around the boundaries of their farm. They would "carry with them seeds of grain, implements of husbandry, the first well water, and the herb vervain (or rowan as a substitute). The procession generally stopped at the four cardinal points of the compass, beginning in the east, and rituals were performed in each of the four directions".

The festival persisted widely up until the 1950s, and in some places the celebration of Beltane continues today.

As a festival, Beltane had largely died out by the mid-20th century, although some of its customs continued and in some places it has been revived as a cultural event. In Ireland, Beltane fires were common until the mid 20th century, but the custom seems to have lasted to the present day only in <a href="County%20Limerick">County Limerick</a> (especially in <a href="Limerick">Limerick</a> itself) and in <a href="Arklow">Arklow</a>, <a href="County%20Wicklow">County Wicklow</a>. However, the custom has been revived in some parts of the country. Some cultural groups have sought to revive the custom at <a href="Uisneach">Uisneach</a> and perhaps at the <a href="Hill%20of%20Tara">Hill of Tara</a>. The lighting of a community Beltane fire from which each hearth fire is then relit is observed today in some parts of the <a href="Gaelic%20diaspora">Gaelic diaspora</a>, though in most of these cases it is a cultural revival rather than an unbroken survival of the ancient tradition. In some areas of Newfoundland, the custom of decorating the May Bush is also still extant. The town of <a href="Peebles">Peebles</a> in the <a href="Scottish%20Borders">Scottish Borders</a> holds a traditional week-long Beltane Fair every year in June, when a local girl is crowned Beltane Queen on the steps of the parish church. Like other Borders festivals, it incorporates a <a href="Common%20Riding">Common Riding</a>.
Since 1988, a <a href="Beltane%20Fire%20Festival">Beltane Fire Festival</a> has been held every year during the night of 30 April on <a href="Calton%20Hill%2C%20Edinburgh">Calton Hill</a> in Edinburgh, Scotland. While inspired by traditional Beltane, this festival is a modern arts and cultural event which incorporates myth and drama from a variety of world cultures and diverse literary sources.

Beltane and Beltane-based festivals are held by some <a href="Neopaganism">Neopagans</a>. As there are many kinds of Neopaganism, their Beltane celebrations can be very different despite the shared name. Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible. Other Neopagans base their celebrations on many sources, the Gaelic festival being only one of them.

Neopagans usually celebrate Beltane on 30 April – 1 May in the Northern Hemisphere and 31 October – 1 November in the Southern Hemisphere, beginning and ending at sunset. Some Neopagans celebrate it at the astronomical midpoint between the spring <a href="equinox">equinox</a> and <a href="summer%20solstice">summer solstice</a> (or the full moon nearest this point). In the Northern Hemisphere, this midpoint is when the ecliptic longitude of the Sun reaches 45 degrees. In 2014, this was on 5 May.

<a href="Celtic%20Reconstructionist%20Paganism">Celtic Reconstructionists</a> strive to reconstruct the pre-Christian religions of the Celts. Their religious practices are based on research and historical accounts, but may be modified slightly to suit modern life. They avoid modern <a href="syncretism">syncretism</a> and eclecticism (i.e. combining practises from unrelated cultures).

Celtic Reconstructionists usually celebrate "Lá Bealtaine" when the local <a href="Common%20Hawthorn">hawthorn</a> trees are in bloom. Many observe the traditional bonfire rites, to whatever extent this is feasible where they live. This may involve passing themselves and their pets or livestock between two bonfires, and bringing home a candle lit from the bonfire. If they are unable to make a bonfire or attend a bonfire ceremony, torches or candles may be used instead. They may decorate their homes with a May Bush, branches from blooming thorn trees, or equal-armed rowan crosses. Holy wells may be visited and offerings made to the spirits or deities of the wells. Traditional festival foods may also be prepared.

<a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>ns use the name "Beltane" or "Beltain" for their May Day celebrations. It is one of the yearly Sabbats of the <a href="Wheel%20of%20the%20Year">Wheel of the Year</a>, following <a href="Ostara">Ostara</a> and preceding <a href="Midsummer">Midsummer</a>. Unlike Celtic Reconstructionism, Wicca is syncretic and melds practices from many different cultures. In general, the Wiccan Beltane is more akin to the Germanic/English May Day festival, both in its significance (focusing on fertility) and its rituals (such as <a href="maypole">maypole</a> dancing). Some Wiccans enact a ritual union of the <a href="Horned%20God">May Lord</a> and <a href="Triple%20Goddess%20%28Neopaganism%29">May Lady</a>.

In Irish, the festival is usually called "Lá Bealtaine" ("day of Beltane") while the month of May is "Mí Bhealtaine" ("month of Beltane"). In <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a>, the month is called "(An) Cèitean" or "a' Mhàigh", and the festival is "Latha Bealltainn". Sometimes the older Scottish Gaelic spelling "Bealltuinn" is used. The word "Céitean" comes from "Céad <a href="Shamhain">Shamhain</a>", an old alternative name for the festival.

In modern Scottish Gaelic, "Latha Buidhe Bealltainn" or "Là Buidhe Bealltainn" ("the yellow day of Beltane") is used to describe the first day of May. This term "Lá Buidhe Bealtaine" is also used in Irish and is translated as "Bright May Day". In Ireland it is referred to in a common folk tale as "Luan Lae Bealtaine"; the first day of the week (Monday/"Luan") is added to emphasise the first day of summer.

Since the early 20th century it has been commonly accepted that <a href="Old%20Irish">Old Irish</a> "Beltaine" is derived from a <a href="Common%20Celtic">Common Celtic</a> "*belo-te(p)niâ", meaning "bright fire". The element "*belo-" might be cognate with the English word "bale" (as in bale-fire) meaning "white" or "shining"; compare <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "bael", and <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian</a>/<a href="Latvian%20language">Latvian</a> "baltas/balts", found in the name of the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a>; in <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic languages</a> "byelo" or "beloye" also means "white", as in "Беларусь" (<a href="White%20Russia">White Russia</a> or <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>) or "Бе́лое мо́ре" (<a href="White%20Sea">White Sea</a>). A more recent etymology by Xavier Delamarre would derive it from a Common Celtic "*Beltinijā", cognate with the name of the Lithuanian goddess of death "<a href="Giltin%C4%97">Giltinė</a>", the root of both being <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> "*gʷelH-" ("suffering, death").

In Ó Duinnín's Irish dictionary (1904), Beltane is referred to as "Céadamh(ain)" which it explains is short for "Céad-shamh(ain)" meaning "first (of) summer". The dictionary also states that "Dia Céadamhan" is May Day and "Mí Céadamhan" is the month of May.

There are a number of <a href="place%20names%20in%20Ireland">place names in Ireland</a> containing the word "Bealtaine", indicating places where Bealtaine festivities were once held. It is often anglicised as "Beltany". There are three Beltanys in <a href="County%20Donegal">County Donegal</a>, including the <a href="Beltany%20stone%20circle">Beltany stone circle</a>, and two in <a href="County%20Tyrone">County Tyrone</a>. In <a href="County%20Armagh">County Armagh</a> there is a place called <a href="Laurelvale">Tamnaghvelton</a>/"Tamhnach Bhealtaine" ("the Beltane field"). Lisbalting/"Lios Bealtaine" ("the Beltane ringfort") is in <a href="County%20Tipperary">County Tipperary</a>, while Glasheennabaultina/"Glaisín na Bealtaine" ("the Beltane stream") is the name of a stream joining the River Galey in <a href="County%20Limerick">County Limerick</a>.
