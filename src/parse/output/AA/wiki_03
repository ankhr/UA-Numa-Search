Abortion

Abortion is the ending of <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> by removing a <a href="fetus">fetus</a> or <a href="embryo">embryo</a> before it can <a href="fetal%20viability">survive outside the uterus</a>. An abortion that occurs spontaneously is also known as a <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. An abortion may be caused purposely and is then called an <a href="%23Induced">induced abortion</a>, or less frequently, "induced miscarriage". The word "abortion" is often used to mean only induced abortions. A similar procedure after the fetus could potentially survive outside the womb is known as a "<a href="late%20termination%20of%20pregnancy">late termination of pregnancy</a>".
When allowed by <a href="abortion%20law">law</a>, abortion in the <a href="developed%20world">developed world</a> is <a href="%23Safety">one of the safest procedures in medicine</a>. Modern methods use <a href="medical%20abortion">medication</a> or <a href="surgical%20abortion">surgery</a> for abortions. The drug <a href="mifepristone">mifepristone</a> in combination with <a href="prostaglandin">prostaglandin</a> appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the <a href="first%20trimester">first</a> and <a href="second%20trimester">second trimester</a> of pregnancy. <a href="Birth%20control">Birth control</a>, such as <a href="combined%20oral%20contraceptive%20pill">the pill</a> or <a href="intrauterine%20device">intrauterine device</a>s, can be used immediately following abortion. When performed legally and safely, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term <a href="mental%20health">mental</a> or physical problems. In contrast, <a href="unsafe%20abortion">unsafe abortion</a>s (those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) cause 47,000 <a href="maternal%20death">deaths</a> and 5 million hospital admissions each year. The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> recommends safe and legal abortions be available to all women.
Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to <a href="family%20planning">family planning</a> and birth control increased. , 40% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed.
<a href="history%20of%20abortion">Historically</a>, abortions have been done using <a href="abortifacient">herbal medicine</a>s, sharp tools, with <a href="physical%20trauma">force</a>, or through other <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional methods</a>. <a href="Abortion%20law">Abortion law</a>s and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, <a href="fetal%20defects">problems with the fetus</a>, <a href="Socioeconomic%20status">poverty</a>, risk to a woman's health, or <a href="incest">incest</a>. In many places there is much <a href="Abortion%20debate">debate</a> over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. Those who <a href="Anti-abortion%20movements">oppose abortion</a> often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a <a href="right%20to%20life">right to life</a> and may compare abortion to <a href="murder">murder</a>. Those who <a href="Abortion-rights%20movements">favor the legality of abortion</a> often hold that <a href="reproductive%20rights">a woman has a right to make decisions about her own body</a>. 

Approximately 205 million pregnancies occur each year worldwide. Over a third are <a href="unintended%20pregnancy">unintended</a> and about a fifth end in induced abortion. Most abortions result from unintended pregnancies. In the United Kingdom, 1 to 2% of abortions are done due to genetic problems in the fetus. A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways. The manner selected often depends upon the <a href="gestational%20age">gestational age</a> of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses. Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor or a women's personal preference.

Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to save the life of the pregnant woman; prevent harm to the woman's <a href="Health">physical</a> or <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a>; terminate a pregnancy where indications are that the child will have a significantly increased chance of premature morbidity or mortality or be otherwise <a href="Disability">disabled</a>; or to <a href="selective%20reduction">selectively reduce</a> the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with <a href="multiple%20pregnancy">multiple pregnancy</a>. An abortion is referred to as an elective or voluntary abortion when it is performed at the request of the woman for non-medical reasons. Confusion sometimes arises over the term "elective" because "<a href="elective%20surgery">elective surgery</a>" generally refers to all scheduled surgery, whether medically necessary or not.

Spontaneous abortion, also known as miscarriage, is the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or fetus before the 24th <a href="gestational%20age">week of gestation</a>. A pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a <a href="live%20birth%20%28human%29">live-born</a> infant is known as a "<a href="premature%20birth">premature birth</a>" or a "preterm birth". When a fetus dies <a href="in%20utero">in utero</a> after <a href="Fetal%20viability">viability</a>, or during <a href="childbirth">delivery</a>, it is usually termed "<a href="stillbirth">stillborn</a>". Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.

Only 30% to 50% of conceptions progress past the <a href="first%20trimester">first trimester</a>. The vast majority of those that do not progress are lost before the woman is <a href="clinically%20silent">aware of the conception</a>, and many pregnancies are lost before medical practitioners can detect an embryo. Between 15% and 30% of known pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman. 80% of these spontaneous abortions happen in the first trimester.

The most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester is <a href="chromosomal%20abnormalities">chromosomal abnormalities</a> of the embryo or fetus, accounting for at least 50% of sampled early pregnancy losses. Other causes include <a href="vascular%20disease">vascular disease</a> (such as <a href="Systemic%20lupus%20erythematosus">lupus</a>), <a href="diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes</a>, other hormonal problems, infection, and abnormalities of the uterus. Advancing maternal age and a women's history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion. A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental <a href="Physical%20trauma">trauma</a>; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or <a href="feticide">feticide</a>.

Medical abortions are those induced by <a href="abortifacient">abortifacient</a> pharmaceuticals. Medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of <a href="prostaglandin">prostaglandin</a> <a href="prostaglandin%20analogue">analog</a>s in the 1970s and the <a href="antiprogestin">antiprogestogen</a> <a href="mifepristone">mifepristone</a> (also known as RU-486) in the 1980s.

The most common early first-trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog (<a href="misoprostol">misoprostol</a> or <a href="gemeprost">gemeprost</a>) up to 9 weeks gestational age, <a href="methotrexate">methotrexate</a> in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to 7 weeks gestation, or a prostaglandin analog alone. Mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens, and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone. This regime is effective in the second trimester. Medical abortion regiments involving mifepristone followed by misoprostol in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 63 days' gestation.

In very early abortions, up to 7 weeks gestation, medical abortion using a mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimen is considered to be more effective than surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration), especially when clinical practice does not include detailed inspection of aspirated tissue. Early medical abortion regimens using mifepristone, followed 24–48 hours later by buccal or vaginal misoprostol are 98% effective up to 9 weeks gestational age. If medical abortion fails, surgical abortion must be used to complete the procedure.

Early medical abortions account for the majority of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in Britain, France, Switzerland, and the Nordic countries. In the United States, the percentage of early medical abortions is far lower.

Medical abortion regimens using mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog are the most common methods used for second-trimester abortions in Canada, most of Europe, China and India, in contrast to the United States where 96% of second-trimester abortions are performed surgically by dilation and evacuation.

Up to 15 weeks' gestation, <a href="suction-aspiration%20abortion">suction-aspiration</a> or <a href="vacuum%20aspiration">vacuum aspiration</a> are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion. "Manual vacuum aspiration" (MVA) consists of removing the <a href="fetus">fetus</a> or <a href="embryo">embryo</a>, <a href="placenta">placenta</a>, and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while "electric vacuum aspiration" (EVA) uses an electric pump. These techniques differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, in how early in pregnancy they can be used, and in whether cervical dilation is necessary.

MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "<a href="menstrual%20extraction">menstrual extraction</a>", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. <a href="Dilation%20and%20curettage">Dilation and curettage</a> (D&C), the second most common method of surgical abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. <a href="Curettage">Curettage</a> refers to cleaning the walls of the <a href="uterus">uterus</a> with a <a href="curette">curette</a>. The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> recommends this procedure, also called "sharp curettage," only when MVA is unavailable.

From the 15th week of gestation until approximately the 26th, other techniques must be used. <a href="Dilation%20and%20evacuation">Dilation and evacuation</a> (D&E) consists of opening the <a href="cervix">cervix</a> of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can also be induced by <a href="intact%20dilation%20and%20extraction">intact dilation and extraction</a> (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called "<a href="partial-birth%20abortion">partial-birth abortion</a>", which has been <a href="Partial-Birth%20Abortion%20Ban%20Act">federally banned</a> in the United States.

In the third trimester of pregnancy, induced abortion may be performed surgically by <a href="intact%20dilation%20and%20extraction">intact dilation and extraction</a> or by hysterotomy. <a href="Hysterotomy%20abortion">Hysterotomy abortion</a> is a procedure similar to a <a href="caesarean%20section">caesarean section</a> and is performed under <a href="general%20anesthesia">general anesthesia</a>. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.

First-trimester procedures can generally be performed using <a href="local%20anesthesia">local anesthesia</a>, while second-trimester methods may require <a href="Sedation%23Levels%20of%20sedation">deep sedation</a> or <a href="general%20anesthesia">general anesthesia</a>.

In places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction, or where preferred by practitioners, an abortion can be induced by first <a href="Labor%20induction">inducing labor</a> and then <a href="Late%20termination%20of%20pregnancy%23Methods">inducing fetal demise</a> if necessary. This is sometimes called "induced miscarriage". This procedure may be performed from 13 weeks gestation to the third trimester. Although it is very uncommon in the United States, more than 80% of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are labor induced abortions in Sweden and other nearby countries.

Only limited data are available comparing this method with dilation and extraction. Unlike D&E, labor induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth. For this reason, labor induced abortion is legally risky in the U.S.

Historically, a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in <a href="folk%20medicine">folk medicine</a>: <a href="tansy">tansy</a>, <a href="Mentha%20pulegium">pennyroyal</a>, <a href="black%20cohosh">black cohosh</a>, and the now-extinct <a href="silphium">silphium</a>. The use of herbs in such a manner can cause serious—even lethal—side effects, such as <a href="multiple%20organ%20dysfunction%20syndrome">multiple organ failure</a>, and is not recommended by physicians.

Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen. The degree of force, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. In Southeast Asia, there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage. One of the <a href="bas%20relief">bas relief</a>s decorating the temple of <a href="Angkor%20Wat">Angkor Wat</a> in Cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the <a href="underworld">underworld</a>.

Reported methods of unsafe, <a href="self-induced%20abortion">self-induced abortion</a> include misuse of <a href="misoprostol">misoprostol</a>, and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. These methods are rarely seen in developed countries where surgical abortion is legal and available. All of these, and any other method to terminate pregnancy may be called "induced miscarriage".
The health risks of abortion depend principally upon whether the procedure is performed safely or unsafely. The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> defines <a href="unsafe%20abortion">unsafe abortion</a>s as those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities. Legal abortions performed in the <a href="developed%20country">developed world</a> are among the safest procedures in medicine. In the US, the risk of <a href="mortality%20rate">maternal death</a> from abortion is 0.7 per 100,000 procedures, making abortion about 13 times safer for women than childbirth (8.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births). The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth through at least 21 weeks' gestation. Outpatient abortion is as safe and effective from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it is from 57 to 63 days. In the United States from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than <a href="plastic%20surgery">plastic surgery</a>.

<a href="Vacuum%20aspiration">Vacuum aspiration</a> in the first trimester is the safest method of surgical abortion, and can be performed in a <a href="primary%20care">primary care office</a>, <a href="abortion%20clinic">abortion clinic</a>, or hospital. Complications are rare and can include <a href="uterine%20perforation">uterine perforation</a>, <a href="endometritis">pelvic infection</a>, and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate. Infections account for one-third of abortion-related deaths in the United States. The rate of complications of vacuum aspiration abortion in the first trimester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in a hospital, surgical center, or office. Preventive antibiotics (such as <a href="doxycycline">doxycycline</a> or <a href="metronidazole">metronidazole</a>) are typically given before elective abortion, as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection. The rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a <a href="mid-level%20practitioner">mid-level practitioner</a>. Complications after second-trimester abortion are similar to those after first-trimester abortion, and depend somewhat on the method chosen.

There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol and surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration) in early first trimester abortions up to 9 weeks gestation. Medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or surgical abortion.

Some purported risks of abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion groups,
but lack scientific support. For example, the question of a link between <a href="abortion-breast%20cancer%20hypothesis">induced abortion and breast cancer</a> has been investigated extensively. Major medical and scientific bodies (including the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>, <a href="National%20Cancer%20Institute">National Cancer Institute</a>, <a href="American%20Cancer%20Society">American Cancer Society</a>, <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Obstetricians%20and%20Gynaecologists">Royal College of OBGYN</a> and <a href="American%20Congress%20of%20Obstetricians%20and%20Gynecologists">American Congress of OBGYN</a>) have concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer.

There is no relationship between most induced abortions and <a href="abortion%20and%20mental%20health">mental-health problems</a> other than those expected for any unwanted pregnancy. The <a href="American%20Psychological%20Association">American Psychological Association</a> has concluded that a woman's first abortion is not a threat to mental health when carried out in the first trimester, with such women no more likely to have mental-health problems than those carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term; the mental-health outcome of a woman's second or greater abortion is less certain. Although some studies show negative mental-health outcomes in women who choose abortions after the first trimester because of fetal abnormalities, more rigorous research would be needed to show this conclusively. Some proposed negative psychological effects of abortion have been referred to by anti-abortion advocates as a separate condition called "<a href="post-abortion%20syndrome">post-abortion syndrome</a>", which is not recognized by medical or psychological professionals in the United States.

Women seeking to terminate their pregnancies sometimes resort to unsafe methods, particularly when access to legal abortion is restricted. They may attempt to <a href="self-induced%20abortion">self-abort</a> or rely on another person who does not have proper medical training or access to proper facilities. This has a tendency to lead to severe complications, such as incomplete abortion, <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a>, hemorrhage, and damage to internal organs.

Unsafe abortions are a major cause of injury and death among women worldwide. Although data are imprecise, it is estimated that approximately 20 million unsafe abortions are performed annually, with 97% taking place in <a href="developing%20country">developing countries</a>. Unsafe abortions are believed to result in millions of injuries. Estimates of deaths vary according to methodology, and have ranged from 37,000 to 70,000 in the past decade; deaths from unsafe abortion account for around 13% of all <a href="maternal%20deaths">maternal deaths</a>. The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> believes that mortality has fallen since the 1990s. To reduce the number of unsafe abortions, public health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the legalization of abortion, training of medical personnel, and ensuring access to reproductive-health services. However, the Dublin Declaration on Maternal Health, signed in 2012, notes that "the prohibition of abortion does not affect, in any way, the availability of optimal care to pregnant women".

A major factor in whether abortions are performed safely or not is the legal standing of abortion. Countries with restrictive abortion laws have higher rates of unsafe abortion and similar overall abortion rates compared to those where abortion is legal and available. For example, the 1996 legalization of abortion in South Africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortion-related complications, with abortion-related deaths dropping by more than 90%. Similar reductions in maternal mortality have been observed after other countries have liberalized their abortion laws, such as <a href="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>. A 2011 study concluded that in the United States, some state-level anti-abortion laws are correlated with lower rates of abortion in that state. The analysis, however, did not take into account travel to other states without such laws to obtain an abortion. In addition, a lack of access to effective contraception contributes to unsafe abortion. It has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by up to 75% (from 20 million to 5 million annually) if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally. Rates of such abortions may be difficult to measure because they can be reported variously as miscarriage, "induced miscarriage", "menstrual regulation", "mini-abortion", and "regulation of a delayed/suspended menstruation".

Forty percent of the world's women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits, while an additional 35 percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical, mental, or socioeconomic criteria. While <a href="maternal%20death">maternal mortality</a> seldom results from safe abortions, unsafe abortions result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year. Complications of unsafe abortion account for approximately an eighth of <a href="maternal%20death">maternal mortalities</a> worldwide, though this varies by region. Secondary infertility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated 24 million women. The rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44% to 49% between 1995 and 2008. Health education, access to family planning, and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon.

Although it is very uncommon, women undergoing surgical abortion after 18 weeks gestation sometimes give birth to a fetus that may survive briefly. <a href="Fetal%20viability">Longer term survival</a> is possible after 22 weeks.

If medical staff observe signs of life, they may be required to provide care: emergency medical care if the child has a good chance of survival and palliative care if not. <a href="feticide%23Use%20during%20legal%20abortion">Induced fetal demise</a> before termination of pregnancy after 20–21 weeks gestation is recommended to avoid this.

Death following live birth which is caused by abortion is given the ; data are identified as either fetus or newborn. Between 1999 and 2013, in the U.S., the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">CDC</a> recorded 531 such deaths for newborns, approximately 4 per 100,000 abortions.

There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:

In many places, where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma, medical reporting of abortion is not reliable. For this reason, estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error.

The number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years, with 41.6 million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8 million having been performed in 2008. The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women, though it was 24 per 1000 women for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries.

On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions which are performed unsafely. The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the <a href="Guttmacher%20Institute">Guttmacher Institute</a>, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide.

The rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. According to the report of employees of Guttmacher Institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women (Germany and Switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women (Estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and Romania, whose statistics were deemed incomplete.

The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as "total abortion rate" (TAR).

Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) reported that 26% of abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 9.7% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6.2% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4.1% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1.4% at more than 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by "<a href="curettage">curettage</a>" (<a href="Suction-aspiration%20abortion">suction-aspiration</a>, <a href="dilation%20and%20curettage">dilation and curettage</a>, <a href="dilation%20and%20evacuation">dilation and evacuation</a>), 7.7% by "<a href="medical%20abortion">medical</a>" means (<a href="mifepristone">mifepristone</a>), 0.4% by "<a href="instillation%20abortion">intrauterine instillation</a>" (saline or <a href="prostaglandin">prostaglandin</a>), and 1.0% by "other" (including <a href="hysterotomy%20abortion">hysterotomy</a> and <a href="hysterectomy">hysterectomy</a>). According to the CDC, due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion.

The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2,200 <a href="intact%20dilation%20and%20extraction">intact dilation and extraction</a> procedures in the US during 2000; this accounts for 0.17% of the total number of abortions performed that year. Similarly, in England and Wales in 2006, 89% of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks, 9% between 13 and 19 weeks, and 1.5% at or over 20 weeks. 64% of those reported were by vacuum aspiration, 6% by D&E, and 30% were medical. There are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as China, India and Vietnam than in developed countries.

The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.

Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race, disapproval of single or early motherhood, stigmatization of people with disabilities, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward <a href="population%20control">population control</a> (such as China's <a href="one-child%20policy">one-child policy</a>). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or <a href="sex-selective%20abortion">sex-selective abortion</a>.

An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of <a href="birth%20control">contraception</a> at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using <a href="condom">condom</a>s and three-quarters of those using the <a href="combined%20oral%20contraceptive%20pill">birth-control pill</a>; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that "most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women" because minority women "have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy."

An additional factor is risk to maternal or fetal health, which was cited as the primary reason for abortion in over a third of cases in some countries and as a significant factor in only a single-digit percentage of abortions in other countries.

In the U.S., the Supreme Court decisions in "<a href="Roe%20vs%20Wade">Roe vs Wade</a>" and "<a href="Doe%20vs%20Bolton">Doe vs Bolton</a>": "ruled that the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother. Even after the point of viability, the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman. Under the right of privacy, physicians must be free to use their "medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother." On the same day that the Court decided Roe, it also decided Doe v. Bolton, in which the Court defined health very broadly: "The medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age—relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment."

Public opinion shifted in America following television personality <a href="Sherri%20Finkbine">Sherri Finkbine</a>'s discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to <a href="thalidomide">thalidomide</a>, unable to abort in the United States she traveled to Sweden. From 1962-65 there was an outbreak of <a href="Rubella">German measles</a> that left 15,000 babies with severe birth defects. In 1967, the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws. A National Opinion Research Center poll in 1965 showed 73% supported abortion when the mothers life was at risk, 57% when birth defects were present and 59% for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.

The rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0.02–1%, and in many cases, cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother, or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment. This is particularly true for <a href="cervical%20cancer">cervical cancer</a>, the most common type which occurs in 1 of every 2,000–13,000 pregnancies, for which initiation of treatment "cannot co-exist with preservation of fetal life (unless <a href="neoadjuvant%20chemotherapy">neoadjuvant chemotherapy</a> is chosen)". Very early stage cervical cancers (I and IIa) may be treated by <a href="radical%20hysterectomy">radical hysterectomy</a> and pelvic <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a> dissection, <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a>, or both, while later stages are treated by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used simultaneously. Treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations, because <a href="lumpectomy">lumpectomy</a> is discouraged in favor of modified <a href="radical%20mastectomy">radical mastectomy</a> unless late-term pregnancy allows follow-up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth.

Exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7.5–17% risk of <a href="teratogenic">teratogenic</a> effects on the fetus, with higher risks for multiple drug treatments. Treatment with more than 40 <a href="gray%20%28unit%29">Gy</a> of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion. Exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester, especially 8 to 15 weeks of development, can cause <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> or <a href="microcephaly">microcephaly</a>, and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight. Exposures above 0.005–0.025 Gy cause a dose-dependent reduction in <a href="IQ">IQ</a>. It is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding, depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus.

The process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk. "Vaginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels, haemorrhage, cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site, while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non-surgical treatment."

Since <a href="history%20of%20abortion">ancient times</a> abortions have been done using <a href="abortifacient">herbal medicine</a>s, sharp tools, with <a href="physical%20trauma">force</a>, or through other <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional methods</a>. Induced abortion has long history, and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as China under <a href="Shennong">Shennong</a> (c. 2700 BCE), <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> with its <a href="Ebers%20Papyrus">Ebers Papyrus</a> (c. 1550 BCE), and the Roman Empire in the time of <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a> (c. 200 CE). There is evidence to suggest that pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of abortifacient herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques. One of the <a href="History%20of%20abortion%235th%20century%20to%2018th%20century">earliest</a> known artistic representations of abortion is in a <a href="bas%20relief">bas relief</a> at Angkor Wat (c. 1150). Found in a series of <a href="frieze">frieze</a>s that represent judgment after death in <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> culture, it depicts the technique of abdominal abortion.

Some medical scholars and abortion opponents have suggested that the <a href="Hippocratic%20Oath">Hippocratic Oath</a> forbade <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek</a> physicians from performing abortions; other scholars disagree with this interpretation, and state the medical texts of <a href="Hippocratic%20Corpus">Hippocratic Corpus</a> contain descriptions of abortive techniques right alongside the <a href="Hippocratic%20Oath">Oath</a>. The physician <a href="Scribonius%20Largus">Scribonius Largus</a> wrote in 43 CE that the Hippocratic Oath prohibits abortion, as did <a href="Soranus%20of%20Ephesus">Soranus</a>, although apparently not all doctors adhered to it strictly at the time. According to <a href="Soranus%20of%20Ephesus">Soranus</a>' 1st or 2nd century CE work "Gynaecology", one party of medical practitioners banished all abortives as required by the Hippocratic Oath; the other party—to which he belonged—was willing to prescribe abortions, but only for the sake of the mother's health.

<a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, in his treatise on government "<a href="Politics%20%28Aristotle%29">Politics</a>" (350 BCE), condemns infanticide as a means of population control. He preferred abortion in such cases, with the restriction "<nowiki>[that it]</nowiki> must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life; for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive." <a href="Christianity%20and%20abortion">In Christianity</a>, <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20V">Pope Sixtus V</a> (1585–90) was the first Pope to declare that abortion is homicide regardless of the stage of pregnancy; the Catholic Church had previously been divided on whether it believed that abortion was murder, and did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the 19th century. <a href="Islam%20and%20abortion">Islamic tradition</a> has traditionally permitted abortion until a point in time when Muslims believe the soul enters the fetus, considered by various theologians to be at conception, 40 days after conception, 120 days after conception, or <a href="quickening">quickening</a>.<ref name="BBC and Islam / Abortion"></ref> However, abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high Islamic faith such as the <a href="Middle%20East%20and%20North%20Africa">Middle East and North Africa</a>.

In Europe and North America, abortion techniques advanced starting in the 17th century. However, conservatism by most physicians with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of safe abortion techniques. Other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services, and they were not widely regulated until the 19th century, when the practice (sometimes called "restellism") was banned in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Church groups as well as physicians were highly influential in anti-abortion movements. In the US, abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930 when incremental improvements in abortion procedures relative to childbirth made abortion safer. Soviet Russia (1919), Iceland (1935) and Sweden (1938) were among the first countries to legalize certain or all forms of abortion. In 1935 Nazi Germany, a law was passed permitting abortions for those deemed "hereditarily ill", while women considered of German stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions. Beginning in the second half of the twentieth century, abortion was legalized in a greater number of countries.
A bill passed by the state legislature of New York legalizing abortion was signed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in April 1970.

Induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate. <a href="Medical%20ethics">Ethical</a>, <a href="Morality">moral</a>, <a href="Philosophical%20aspects%20of%20the%20abortion%20debate">philosophical</a>, <a href="Therapeutic%20abortion">biological</a>, <a href="Ethics%20in%20religion">religious</a> and <a href="Abortion%20law">legal</a> issues surrounding abortion are related to <a href="value%20system">value system</a>s. Opinions of abortion may be about <a href="fetal%20rights">fetal rights</a>, governmental authority, and <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a>.

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion. The <a href="World%20Medical%20Association">World Medical Association</a> Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion notes that "circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated". Abortion debates, especially pertaining to <a href="abortion%20law">abortion law</a>s, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. Anti-abortion groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as "pro-life" while abortion rights groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as "pro-choice". Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a <a href="Personhood">human person</a> with a <a href="right%20to%20life">right to live</a>, making abortion morally the same as <a href="murder">murder</a>. The latter position argues that a woman has certain <a href="reproductive%20rights">reproductive rights</a>, especially the choice whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The right to life, the right to liberty, the right to <a href="security%20of%20person">security of person</a>, and the right to <a href="reproductive%20health">reproductive health</a> are major issues of human rights that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or absence of laws controlling abortion.

In jurisdictions where abortion is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe, legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered <a href="feticide">feticide</a>). These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a <a href="Pregnancy%23Terminology">trimester</a>-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the U.S., on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' <a href="Fetal%20viability">viability</a>. Some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on <a href="prenatal%20development">fetal development</a>, or require that <a href="minors%20and%20abortion">parents be contacted</a> if their minor daughter requests an abortion. Other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the <a href="Paternal%20rights%20and%20abortion">consent of the fetus' father</a> before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including "risks" not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary. Many restrictions are waived in emergency situations. China, which has ended their <a href="one-child%20policy">one-child policy</a>, and now has a two child policy. has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy.

Other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. Many, but not all, of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances. These circumstances vary based on jurisdiction, but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, the fetus' development is impaired, the woman's physical or mental well-being is endangered, or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship. In countries where abortion is banned entirely, such as <a href="Abortion%20in%20Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors' fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies. Some countries, such as Bangladesh, that nominally ban abortion, may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene. This is also a terminology in traditional medicine. In places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma, pregnant women may engage in <a href="medical%20tourism">medical tourism</a> and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies. Women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves.

<a href="Medical%20ultrasonography">Sonography</a> and <a href="amniocentesis">amniocentesis</a> allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to <a href="sex-selective%20abortion%20and%20female%20infanticide">sex-selective abortion</a>, or the termination of a fetus based on sex. The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.

Sex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan, South Korea, India, and China. This deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sex-selective abortion or even sex-screening. In China, a historical preference for a male child has been exacerbated by the <a href="one-child%20policy">one-child policy</a>, which was enacted in 1979.

Many countries have taken legislative steps to reduce the incidence of sex-selective abortion. At the <a href="International%20Conference%20on%20Population%20and%20Development">International Conference on Population and Development</a> in 1994 over 180 states agreed to eliminate "all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference", conditions which were also condemned by a <a href="Parliamentary%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20Europe">PACE</a> resolution in 2011. The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> and <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>, along with other United Nations agencies, have found that measures to reduce access to abortion are much less effective at reducing sex-selective abortions than measures to reduce gender inequality.

In a number of cases, abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence, including murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, stalking, assault, arson, and bombing. Anti-abortion violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as terrorism. Only a small fraction of those opposed to abortion commit violence.

In the United States, four physicians who performed abortions have been murdered: <a href="David%20Gunn%20%28doctor%29">David Gunn</a> (1993), <a href="John%20Britton%20%28doctor%29">John Britton</a> (1994), <a href="Barnett%20Slepian">Barnett Slepian</a> (1998), and <a href="George%20Tiller">George Tiller</a> (2009). Also murdered, in the U.S. and Australia, have been other personnel at abortion clinics, including receptionists and security guards such as James Barrett, Shannon Lowney, Lee Ann Nichols, and Robert Sanderson. Woundings (e.g., <a href="Garson%20Romalis">Garson Romalis</a>) and attempted murders have also taken place in the United States and Canada. Hundreds of bombings, arsons, acid attacks, invasions, and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have occurred. Notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include <a href="Eric%20Robert%20Rudolph">Eric Robert Rudolph</a>, <a href="Scott%20Roeder">Scott Roeder</a>, <a href="Shelley%20Shannon">Shelley Shannon</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Jennings%20Hill">Paul Jennings Hill</a>, the first person to be executed in the United States for murdering an abortion provider.

<a href="Legal%20protection%20of%20access%20to%20abortion">Legal protection of access to abortion</a> has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal. These laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.

Far more common than physical violence is psychological pressure. In 2003, <a href="Chris%20Danze">Chris Danze</a> organized pro-life organizations throughout Texas to prevent the construction of a <a href="Planned%20Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a> facility in Austin. The organizations <a href="doxing">released the personal information</a> online, of those involved with construction, sending them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contacting their churches. Some protestors record women entering clinics on camera.

Spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals. For example, in sheep, it may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs. In cows, abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a> or "<a href="Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a>", but can often be controlled by vaccination. Eating <a href="pine%20needle">pine needle</a>s can also induce abortions in cows. In horses, a fetus may be aborted or resorbed if it has <a href="lethal%20white%20syndrome">lethal white syndrome</a> (congenital intestinal aganglionosis). Foal embryos that are homozygous for the <a href="dominant%20white">dominant white</a> gene (WW) are theorized to also be aborted or resorbed before birth.

Viral infection can cause abortion in dogs. Cats can experience spontaneous abortion for many reasons, including hormonal imbalance. A combined abortion and spaying is performed on pregnant cats, especially in <a href="Trap-Neuter-Return">Trap-Neuter-Return</a> programs, to prevent unwanted kittens from being born.
Female rodents may terminate a pregnancy when exposed to the smell of a male not responsible for the pregnancy, known as the <a href="Bruce%20effect">Bruce effect</a>.

Abortion may also be induced in animals, in the context of <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a>. For example, abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly, or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant, or that are pregnant with twin foals. Feticide can occur in horses and zebras due to male harassment of pregnant mares or forced copulation, although the frequency in the wild has been questioned. Male <a href="gray%20langur">gray langur</a> monkeys may attack females following male takeover, causing miscarriage.

Abstract (law)

In <a href="law">law</a>, an abstract is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long <a href="legal%20document">legal document</a> or of several related legal papers.

The Abstract of Title, used in <a href="real%20estate">real estate</a> transactions, is the more common form of abstract. An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. The abstract also records all <a href="deed">deed</a>s, <a href="will%20%28law%29">wills</a>, <a href="mortgage%20law">mortgages</a>, and other documents that affect <a href="ownership">ownership</a> of the property. An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.

A clear title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaksin the chain of legal ownership. After the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. In a few states, a different system of insuring title of real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. After this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.

In the context of <a href="patent">patent</a> law and specifically in <a href="prior%20art">prior art</a> searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to <a href="novelty%20%28patent%29">novelty</a> or <a href="Inventive%20step%20and%20non-obviousness">inventive step</a> (or <a href="Inventive%20step%20and%20non-obviousness">non-obviousness</a> in United States patent law) of an invention. Under <a href="United%20States%20patent%20law">United States patent law</a>, the abstract may be called "Abstract of the Disclosure".

Certain government bureaucracies, such as a "department of motor vehicles" will issue an abstract of a completed transaction or an updated record intended to serve as a proof of compliance with some administrative requirement. This is often done in advance of the update of reporting databases and/or the issuance of official documents.

American Revolutionary War

The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also known as the American War of Independence, was a global war that began as a conflict between <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and her <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a>, which declared independence as the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a>.

After 1765, growing <a href="American%20Revolution%23Origin">philosophical and political differences</a> strained the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. Following the <a href="Stamp%20Act%201765">Stamp Act</a>, <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriot</a> protests against <a href="No%20taxation%20without%20representation">taxation without representation</a> escalated into boycotts, which culminated in the <a href="Sons%20of%20Liberty">Sons of Liberty</a> <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">destroying a shipment of tea</a> in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of <a href="Intolerable%20Acts">punitive measures</a> against Massachusetts colony. <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Massachusetts colonists</a> responded with the <a href="Suffolk%20Resolves">Suffolk Resolves</a>, and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.

British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia at <a href="Concord%2C%20Massachusetts">Concord</a> in April 1775 <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">led to open combat</a>. Militia forces then <a href="Siege%20of%20Boston">besieged Boston</a>, forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress appointed <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> to command the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>. Concurrently, an American attempt to <a href="Invasion%20of%20Quebec%20%281775%29">invade Quebec and raise rebellion</a> against the British <a href="Battle%20of%20Quebec%20%281775%29">decisively failed</a>. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence, issuing its <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declaration</a> on July 4. <a href="William%20Howe%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Howe">Sir William Howe</a> launched a <a href="New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey%20campaign">British counter-offensive</a>, capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Trenton">Trenton</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Princeton">Princeton</a> restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an <a href="Saratoga%20Campaign">invasion from Quebec</a> under <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a>, intending to isolate <a href="New%20England%20Colonies">New England</a>. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate <a href="Philadelphia%20campaign">campaign</a> against Philadelphia, and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at <a href="Battles%20of%20Saratoga">Saratoga</a> in October 1777.

Burgoyne's defeat had drastic consequences; France formally <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alliance%20%281778%29">allied with the Americans</a> and <a href="France%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">entered the war</a> in 1778, and Spain <a href="Spain%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">joined the war</a> the following year as an <a href="Pacte%20de%20Famille">ally of France</a> but not as an ally of the United States. In 1780, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">Kingdom of Mysore</a> <a href="Second%20Anglo-Mysore%20War">attacked the British in India</a>, and tensions between Great Britain and the Netherlands erupted into <a href="Fourth%20Anglo-Dutch%20War">open war</a>. In North America, the British mounted a "<a href="Southern%20theatre%20of%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">Southern strategy</a>" led by <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Charles Cornwallis</a> which hinged upon a <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist uprising</a>, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at <a href="Battle%20of%20Kings%20Mountain">King's Mountain</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Cowpens">Cowpens</a>. He retreated to Yorktown, Virginia, intending an evacuation, but a decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Chesapeake">French naval victory</a> deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by the <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Donatien%20de%20Vimeur%2C%20comte%20de%20Rochambeau">Comte de Rochambeau</a> and Washington then <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">besieged Cornwallis' army</a> and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered.

<a href="Whiggism">Whigs</a> in Britain had long opposed the pro-war <a href="Tory">Tories</a> in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in North America, but the war continued in Europe and India. Britain remained <a href="Great%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">under siege in Gibraltar</a> but scored a <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Saintes">major victory</a> over the French navy. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war. French involvement had proven decisive, but France made few gains and incurred crippling debts. Spain made some minor territorial gains but failed in its primary aim of recovering <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. The Dutch were defeated on all counts and were compelled to cede <a href="Nagapattinam">territory</a> to Great Britain. In India, the war against Mysore and its allies <a href="Treaty%20of%20Mangalore">concluded in 1784</a> <a href="Status%20quo%20ante%20bellum">without any territorial changes</a>.

In 1651, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a> sought to regulate trade in America by passing the <a href="Navigation%20Acts%23Navigation%20Act%201651">Navigation Acts</a>, ensuring that trade <a href="Mercantilism">only enriched Britain</a>. The economic effects were minimal, but they triggered serious political friction. The American colonists had fought <a href="King%20Philip%27s%20War">King Philip's War</a> without significant assistance from the Crown, and this contributed to a growing sense of American identity separate from that of <a href="Britishness">Britain</a>. Britain continued to assert control into the 1680s, culminating in the abrogation of colonial charters and the establishment of the <a href="Dominion%20of%20New%20England">Dominion of New England</a> in 1686. Colonists, however, felt that the Dominion was undermining their democratic liberty and they <a href="1689%20Boston%20revolt">overthrew it</a> in 1689; the Crown made no attempt to restore it.

The British government continued to pursue trade control, however, passing acts that taxed <a href="Wool%20Act%201699">wool</a>, <a href="Hat%20Act">hats</a>, and <a href="Molasses%20Act">molasses</a>. The Molasses Act of 1733 was especially egregious to the colonists, as a significant part of colonial trade relied on the product. The taxes severely damaged the local economy, and consequently they were rarely paid. Smuggling, bribery, piracy, and intimidation of customs officials became commonplace.
Colonial wars were also a contributing factor. The return of <a href="Louisbourg">Louisbourg</a> to France in 1748 following the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a> caused considerable resentment in New England, the colonists having expended great effort in subduing the fortress only to have it returned to their erstwhile enemy.

Britain triumphed over France and Spain in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, but this led to a financial crisis, as the national debt had doubled to £130 million, and the annual cost of the British civil and military establishment in America had quintupled when compared to 1749. Smuggling had been tacitly accepted, but now the British began to consider that it blunted their revenue, so Whitehall decided to ensure that customs duties were unavoidable by passing the <a href="Stamp%20Act%201765">Stamp Act</a> in 1765. Colonists condemned the tax because their <a href="Rights%20of%20Englishmen">rights as Englishmen</a> protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had <a href="no%20taxation%20without%20representation">no elected representatives</a>. Parliament argued that the colonies were "<a href="Virtual%20representation">represented virtually</a>", an idea that was criticized throughout the Empire. Parliament did repeal the act in 1766; however, it also <a href="Declaratory%20Act">affirmed its right</a> to pass laws that were binding on the colonies. From 1767, Parliament began passing <a href="Townshend%20Acts">legislation</a> to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, ensuring their loyalty while inadvertently increasing resentment among the colonists, and opposition soon became widespread.

Enforcing the acts proved difficult; the seizure of the sloop "<a href="HMS%20Liberty%20%281768%29">Liberty</a>" on suspicions of smuggling triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to <a href="Treason%20Act%201543">extradite colonists</a> to face trial in England. Tensions rose after the murder of a <a href="Christopher%20Seider">teen by a customs official</a> in 1770 and escalated into outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the <a href="Boston%20Massacre">Boston Massacre</a>. In 1772, colonists in <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Rhode Island</a> boarded and burned a <a href="Gaspee%20Affair">customs schooner</a>. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the <a href="Tea%20Act">Tea Act</a> in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but the <a href="Thomas%20Hutchinson%20%28governor%29">governor of Massachusetts</a> permitted British tea ships to remain in <a href="Boston%20Harbor">Boston Harbor</a>—so the <a href="Sons%20of%20Liberty">Sons of Liberty</a> <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">destroyed the tea</a> chests.

Parliament then passed punitive legislation. It <a href="Boston%20Port%20Act">closed Boston Harbor</a> until the tea was paid for and <a href="Massachusetts%20Government%20Act">revoked</a> the <a href="Massachusetts%20Charter">Massachusetts Charter</a>, taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the <a href="Massachusetts%20Governor%27s%20Council">Massachusetts Governor's Council</a>. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy. <a href="Administration%20of%20Justice%20Act%201774">Further measures</a> allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the Empire, if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally. The act's vague reimbursement policy for travel expenses left few with the ability to testify, and colonists argued that it would allow officials to harass them with impunity. <a href="Quartering%20Act">Further laws</a> allowed the governor to <a href="billet">billet</a> troops in private property without permission. The colonists referred to the measures as the "<a href="Intolerable%20Acts">Intolerable Acts</a>", and they argued that both their constitutional rights and their <a href="natural%20rights">natural rights</a> were being violated, viewing the acts as a threat to all of America. The acts were widely opposed, driving neutral parties into support of the <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriots</a> and curtailing <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a> sentiment.

The colonists responded by establishing the <a href="Massachusetts%20Provincial%20Congress">Massachusetts Provincial Congress</a>, effectively removing Crown control of the colony outside Boston. Meanwhile, representatives from twelve colonies convened the <a href="First%20Continental%20Congress">First Continental Congress</a> to respond to the crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal which would have created an <a href="Galloway%27s%20Plan%20of%20Union">American parliament</a> to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed <a href="Continental%20Association">a compact</a> declaring a <a href="Economic%20sanctions">trade boycott</a> against Britain. Congress also affirmed that Parliament had no authority over internal American matters, but they were willing to consent to trade regulations for the benefit of the empire, and they authorized committees and conventions to enforce the boycott. The boycott was effective, as imports from Britain dropped by 97% in 1775 compared to 1774.

Parliament refused to yield. In 1775, it declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and enforced a blockade of the colony. It then passed <a href="Restraining%20Acts%201775">legislation to limit</a> colonial trade to the British West Indies and the British Isles. Colonial ships were barred from the Newfoundland cod fisheries, a measure which pleased <a href="Canadiens">Canadiens</a> but damaged New England's economy. These increasing tensions led to a <a href="Powder%20Alarm">mutual scramble for ordnance</a> and pushed the colonies toward open war. <a href="Thomas%20Gage">Thomas Gage</a> was the British <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20North%20America">Commander-in-Chief</a> and military governor of Massachusetts, and he received orders on April 14, 1775 to disarm the local militias.

On April 18, 1775, 700 troops were sent to confiscate militia ordnance stored at <a href="Concord%2C%20Massachusetts">Concord</a>. <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Fighting broke out</a>, forcing the regulars to conduct a fighting withdrawal to <a href="Boston">Boston</a>. Overnight, the local militia converged on and <a href="Siege%20of%20Boston">laid siege to Boston</a>. On March 25, 4,500 British reinforcements arrived with three senior generals; <a href="William%20Howe%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Howe">William Howe</a>, <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a> and <a href="Henry%20Clinton%20%28American%20War%20of%20Independence%29">Henry Clinton</a>. On June 17, the British <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">seized the Charlestown peninsular</a> after a costly frontal assault, leading Howe to replace Gage. Many senior officers were dismayed at the attack which had gained them little, while Gage wrote to London stressing the need for a large army to suppress the revolt. On July 3, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> took command of the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> besieging Boston. Howe made no effort to attack, much to Washington's surprise. After a plan to assault the city was rejected, in early March 1776, the Americans <a href="Fortification%20of%20Dorchester%20Heights">fortified Dorchester Heights</a> with <a href="Noble%20train%20of%20artillery">heavy artillery</a> captured <a href="Capture%20of%20Fort%20Ticonderoga">from a raid on Fort Ticonderoga</a>. On March 17, the British were <a href="Evacuation%20Day%20%28Massachusetts%29">permitted to withdraw</a> unmolested, sailing to <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a>, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. Washington then moved his army to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>.

Meanwhile, British officials in <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763-1791%29">Quebec</a> began lobbying Native American tribes to support them, while the Americans attempted to maintain their neutrality. Fearing an Anglo-Indian attack from Canada, Congress authorized an invasion of Quebec. Quebec, with a largely <a href="Francophone">Francophone</a> population, had only been under British rule for twelve years, and the Americans expected that liberating them from the British would be welcomed. After <a href="Arnold%27s%20expedition%20to%20Quebec">an arduous march</a>, the Americans attacked Quebec City on December 31, which was <a href="Battle%20of%20Quebec%20%281775%29">decisively defeated</a>. After a loose siege, the Americans withdrew on May 6. 1776. A <a href="Battle%20of%20Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res">failed counter-attack</a> on June 8 ended American operations in Quebec. However, the British could not conduct an aggressive pursuit, due to the presence of American ships on <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>. On October 11, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Valcour%20Island">British defeated the American squadron</a>, forcing the Americans to withdraw to <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Ticonderoga</a>, ending the campaign. The invasion cost the Patriots their support in British public opinion, while aggressive anti-Loyalist policies diluted <a href="Canadien">Canadien</a> support. The Patriots continued to view Quebec as a strategic aim, though no further attempts to invade were ever realized.

In <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Virginia</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Virginia">Royal governor</a>, <a href="John%20Murray%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Dunmore">Lord Dunmore</a>, had attempted to <a href="Gunpowder%20Incident">disarm the militia</a> as tensions increased, although no fighting broke out. After war broke out, Dunmore issued a <a href="Dunmore%27s%20Proclamation">proclamation</a> on November 7, 1775, promising freedom for slaves who fled their Patriot masters to fight for the Crown. After Dunmore's troops were <a href="Battle%20of%20Great%20Bridge">overwhelmed by Patriots</a> at <a href="Great%20Bridge%2C%20Virginia">Great Bridge</a>, Dunmore fled to naval ships anchored off <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk</a>. After negotiations broke down, Dunmore ordered the ships to <a href="Burning%20of%20Norfolk">destroy the town</a>. In <a href="Province%20of%20South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, <a href="Siege%20of%20Savage%27s%20Old%20Fields">fighting broke out</a> on November 19 between Loyalist and Patriot militias, and the Loyalists were subsequently <a href="Snow%20Campaign">driven out of the colony</a>. Loyalists recruited in <a href="Province%20of%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> to reassert colonial rule in the South were <a href="Battle%20of%20Moore%27s%20Creek%20Bridge">decisively defeated</a>, subduing Loyalist sentiment. An expedition of British regulars to reconquer South Carolina launched a <a href="Battle%20of%20Sullivan%27s%20Island">failed attack on Charleston</a> on June 28, 1776, effectively leaving the South in Patriot control until 1780.

The shortage of gunpowder had led Congress to authorize an expedition against the <a href="The%20Bahamas">Bahamas Colony</a> in the <a href="British%20West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, in order to secure ordnance there. On March 3, 1776, the Americans landed after a <a href="Battle%20of%20Nassau">bloodless exchange of fire</a>, and the local militia offered no resistance. For two weeks, the Americans confiscated all the supplies they could load, and sailed away on March 17. After a <a href="Battle%20of%20Block%20Island">brief skirmish</a> with the Royal Navy frigate "<a href="HMS%20Glasgow%20%281757%29">HMS Glasgow</a>" on April 6, the squadron reached <a href="New%20London%2C%20Connecticut">New London</a> on April 8.

After fighting began, <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Congress</a> launched a <a href="Olive%20Branch%20Petition">final attempt to avert war</a>, which Parliament rejected as insincere. <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Great%20Britain">King</a> <a href="George%20III%20of%20Great%20Britain">George III</a> then issued a <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Rebellion">Proclamation of Rebellion</a> on August 23, 1775, leading to an emboldening of hitherto weak support for independence in the colonies. After a speech by the King, Parliament rejected to oppose coercive measures on the colonies by 170 votes. British <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tories</a> refused to compromise, while <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whigs</a> argued current policy would drive the colonists towards secession. Despite opposition, the King himself began micromanaging the war effort. The <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Irish Parliament</a> pledged to send troops to America, and Irish Catholics were allowed to enlist in the army for the first time. <a href="Protestantism%20in%20Ireland">Irish Protestants</a> favored the Americans, while <a href="Irish%20Catholic">Catholics</a> favored the King.

Militarily, the <a href="Boston%20campaign">initial hostilities</a> was a sobering lesson for the British, causing them to rethink their views on colonial military capability. The weak British response gave the Patriots the advantage; the British lost control over every colony. The army had been kept deliberately small <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">since 1688</a> to prevent abuses of power by the King. Parliament secured treaties with small German states for <a href="Hessian%20%28soldier%29">additional troops</a>, and, after a year, were able to send an army of 32,000 men to America, the largest it had ever sent outside Europe at the time.

In the colonies, the success of <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine's</a> pamphlet "<a href="Common%20Sense%20%28pamphlet%29">Common Sense</a>" had boosted public support for independence. On July 2, Congress voted in favor of independence with twelve affirmatives and one abstention, <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">issuing its declaration</a> on July 4. Washington read the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declaration</a> to his men and the citizens of New York on July 9, invigorating the crowd to tear down a lead statue of the King, melting it to make bullets. British Tories criticized the signatories for not extending the same standards of equality to <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a>. Patriots followed independence with the Test Laws, requiring residents to swear allegiance to the state in which they lived, intending to root out neutrals or opponents to independence. Failure to do so meant possible imprisonment, exile, and, in some cases, death. American Tories were barred from public office, forbidden from practising medicine and law, forced to pay increased taxes, barred from executing wills or becoming guardians to orphans. Congress enabled states to confiscate Loyalist property to fund the war, and offered them a choice between swearing loyalty to the republic, or either face exile, or forfeit the right to protection. <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>s, who remained neutral, had their property confiscated. States later prevented Loyalists from collecting any debts they were owed.

After regrouping at Halifax, William Howe determined to take the fight to the Americans. Howe set sail in June 1776, and began landing troops on <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a> on July 2. Due to poor intelligence, Washington split his army to positions across the city. An informal attempt to negotiate peace was rejected by the Americans. On August 27, Howe <a href="Battle%20of%20Long%20Island">defeated Washington</a> and forced him back to <a href="Brooklyn%20Heights%2C%20Brooklyn">Brooklyn Heights</a>. Had Howe chose to land on <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, Washington could have been encircled and his army destroyed. Howe restrained his subordinates from pursuit, opting to besiege Washington instead. Washington managed to withdraw to Manhattan without any losses in men or ordnance. Following the withdrawal, a <a href="Staten%20Island%20Peace%20Conference">second attempt</a> to negotiate peace failed, as the British delegates did not possess authorization to grant independence. Howe then <a href="Landing%20at%20Kip%27s%20Bay">seized control</a> of New York on September 15, and unsuccessfully <a href="Battle%20of%20Harlem%20Heights">engaged the Americans</a> the following day. Howe attempted <a href="Battle%20of%20Pell%27s%20Point">encirclement of Washington again</a>, but the Americans successfully withdrew. On October 28, the British fought <a href="Battle%20of%20White%20Plains">an indecisive action</a> against Washington, in which Howe declined to attack Washington's army, instead concentrating his efforts upon a hill that was of no strategic value.

Washington's retreat left the remnants of his forces isolated, and, on November 16, the British <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Washington">captured an American army</a>, taking 3,000 prisoners, amounting to the worst American defeat to date. Washington fell back four days later. <a href="Henry%20Clinton%20%28American%20War%20of%20Independence%29">Henry Clinton</a> then captured <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport</a>, an operation which he opposed, feeling the 6,000 troops assigned to him could have been better employed in the pursuit of Washington. The American prisoners were then sent to the <a href="Prisoners%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War%23Prison%20Ships">infamous "prison ships"</a>, in which more American soldiers and sailors died of disease and neglect than died in every battle of the war combined. <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Charles Cornwallis</a> pursued Washington, but Howe ordered him to halt, and Washington escaped unmolested. The outlook of the American cause was bleak; the army had dwindled to fewer than 5,000 men, and would be reduced further when the enlistments expired at the end of the year. Popular support wavered, morale ebbed away, and Congress abandoned <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a>. Loyalist activity surged in the wake of the American defeat, especially in New York.

News of the campaign was well received in Britain; festivities took place in London, and public support reached a peak. William Howe was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Order of the Bath</a> by the King. The successes led to predictions that the British could win within a year. The American defeat revealed Washington's strategic deficiencies, such as dividing a numerically weaker army in the face of a stronger one, his inexperienced staff misreading the situation, and his poorly-trained troops, who fled in disorder when fighting began. In the meantime, the British entered <a href="Cantonment">winter quarters</a>, and were in a good place to resume campaigning.

On December 25, 1776, Washington <a href="Washington%27s%20crossing%20of%20the%20Delaware%20River">stealthily crossed</a> the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Trenton">overwhelmed</a> the <a href="Hessian%20%28soldier%29">Hessian</a> garrison at <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton</a> the following morning, taking 900 prisoners. The decisive victory rescued the army's flagging morale, and gave a new hope to the cause for independence. Cornwallis marched to re-take Trenton, though his efforts to this end <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Assunpink%20Creek">were repulsed</a> on January 2. Washington outmanoeuvred Cornwallis that night, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Princeton">defeated his rearguard</a> the following day. The victories proved instrumental in convincing the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">French</a> and <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a> that the Americans were worthwhile allies, as well as recovering morale in the army. Washington entered winter quarters at <a href="Morristown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morristown</a> on January 6, though a <a href="Forage%20War">protracted guerrilla conflict continued</a>. While encamped, Howe made no attempt to attack, much to Washington's amazement.

In December 1776, <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a> returned to London to set strategy with <a href="George%20Germain%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Sackville">Lord George Germain</a>. Burgoyne's plan was to establish control of the <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Champlain</a>-<a href="Lake%20George%20%28New%20York%29">George</a>-<a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson</a> route from New York to Quebec, isolating New England. Efforts could then be concentrated on the southern colonies, where it was believed Loyalist support was in abundance. Howe instead argued capturing <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a> and defeating Washington was a priority. Germain approved this plan, leaving Howe unable to assist Burgoyne. Washington himself was baffled by Howe's choices. Alden argues Howe was influenced by the idea that, upon success, he would not receive credit, but Burgoyne. Controversy persists over whether Germain approved Burgoyne's plan after reading Howe's, and whether he shared this information with his subordinates. Howe was not given any explicit orders to assist Burgoyne, however, a copy Germain sent to Quebec explicitly stated Howe was to assist Burgoyne's efforts. Another letter stated Howe should launch his campaign against Philadelphia as intended, while allowing enough time to assist Burgoyne. Black argues Germain either left his generals too much latitude, or without a clear direction.

Burgoyne's plan was to lead an army along <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>, while a strategic diversion advanced along the <a href="Mohawk%20River">Mohawk River</a>, and both would rendezvous at <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a>. Burgoyne set out on June 14, 1777, <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Ticonderoga%20%281777%29">quickly capturing Ticonderoga</a> on July 5. The hasty withdrawal of the Continental Army after little resistance outraged the American public. Burgoyne's pursuit ran into stiff resistance at <a href="Battle%20of%20Hubbardton">Hubbardton</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Anne">Fort Anne</a>. Leaving 1,300 men behind as a garrison, Burgoyne continued the advance. Progress was slow; the Americans blocked roads, destroyed bridges, dammed streams and <a href="scorched%20earth">denuded the area</a> of food. Meanwhile, <a href="Barry%20St.%20Ledger">Barry St. Ledger's</a> diversionary column <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Stanwix">laid siege to Fort Stanwix</a>. St. Ledger withdrew to Quebec on August 22 after his <a href="Battle%20of%20Oriskany">Indian support abandoned him</a>. On August 16, a British foraging expedition was <a href="Battle%20of%20Bennington">soundly defeated at Bennington</a>, and more than 700 troops were captured. As a result of the defeat, the vast majority of Burgoyne's Indian support abandoned him. Meanwhile, Howe informed Burgoyne he would launch his campaign on Philadelphia as planned, and would be unable to render aid.

Having considered his options, Burgoyne decided to continue the advance. On September 19, he attempted to flank the American position, and . The British won, but at the cost of 600 casualties. Burgoyne then <a href="Defensive%20fighting%20position">dug in</a>, but suffered a constant haemorrhage of deserters, and critical supplies were running low. Henry Clinton did <a href="Battle%20of%20Forts%20Clinton%20and%20Montgomery">capture two key forts</a> on October 6 to divert American resources, though he turned back ten days later. Meanwhile, the American army was growing in size daily, swelling to some 15,000 men. On October 7, a British <a href="reconnaissance%20in%20force">reconnaissance in force</a> against the American lines was . Burgoyne then withdrew with the Americans in pursuit, and by October 13, he was surrounded. With no hope of relief and supplies exhausted, Burgoyne surrendered on October 17. 6,222 soldiers became <a href="Convention%20Army">prisoners of the Americans</a>. The decisive success spurred France to <a href="France%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">enter the war</a> as an <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alliance%20%281778%29">ally of the United States</a>, securing the final elements needed for victory over Britain, that of foreign assistance.

Meanwhile, Howe launched his campaign against Washington, though his <a href="Philadelphia%20campaign%23Early%20feints">initial efforts</a> to bring him to battle in June 1777 failed. Howe declined to attack Philadelphia overland via <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, or by sea via the <a href="Delaware%20Bay">Delaware Bay</a>, even though both options would have enabled him to assist Burgoyne if necessary. Instead, he took his army on a time-consuming route through the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, leaving him completely unable to assist Burgoyne. This decision was so difficult to understand, Howe's critics accused him of treason.

Howe <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">outflanked and defeated Washington</a> on September 11, though he failed to follow-up on the victory and destroy his army. A <a href="Battle%20of%20Paoli">British victory at Willistown</a> left Philadelphia defenceless, and Howe captured the city unopposed on September 26. Howe then moved 9,000 men to <a href="Germantown%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Germantown</a>, north of Philadelphia. Washington <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">launched a surprise attack</a> on Howe's garrison on October 4, which was eventually repulsed. Again, Howe did not follow-up on his victory, leaving the American army intact and able to fight. Later, after <a href="Battle%20of%20White%20Marsh">several days of probing</a> American defences at White Marsh, Howe inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia, astonishing both sides. Howe ignored the vulnerable American rear, where an attack could have deprived Washington of his baggage and supplies. On December 19, Washington's army entered winter quarters at <a href="Valley%20Forge">Valley Forge</a>. Poor conditions and supply problems resulted in the deaths of some 2,500 troops. Howe, only 20 miles (32 km) away, made no effort to attack, which critics observed could have ended the war.

The Continental Army was put through a new training program, supervised by <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Steuben">Baron von Steuben</a>, introducing the most modern <a href="Prussian%20Army">Prussian</a> methods of drilling. Meanwhile, Howe resigned, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778. Clinton received orders to abandon Philadelphia and fortify New York following France's entry into the war. On June 18, the British departed Philadelphia, with the reinvigorated Americans in pursuit. The two armies <a href="Battle%20of%20Monmouth">fought at Monmouth Court House</a> on June 28, with the Americans holding the field, greatly boosting morale and confidence. By July, both armies were back in the same positions they had been two years prior.

The defeat at Saratoga caused considerable anxiety in Britain over foreign intervention. The <a href="North%20ministry">North ministry</a> sought <a href="Carlisle%20Peace%20Commission">reconciliation with the colonies</a> by consenting to their original demands, although <a href="Frederick%20North%2C%20Lord%20North">Lord North</a> refused to grant independence. No positive reply was received from the Americans.

<a href="Foreign%20minister%20of%20France">French foreign minister</a> the <a href="Charles%20Gravier%2C%20Comte%20de%20Vergennes">Comte de Vergennes</a> was strongly <a href="Anglophobic">anti-British</a>, and he sought a "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>" to go to war with and weaken their perennial foe following the <a href="Conquest%20of%201760">conquest of Canada</a> in 1763. The French had <a href="Roderigue%20Hortalez%20and%20Company">covertly supplied</a> the Americans through neutral <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a> ports since the onset of the war, proving invaluable throughout the Saratoga campaign. The French public favored war, though Vergennes and <a href="Monarchy%20of%20France">King</a> <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a> were hesitant, owing to the military and financial risk. The American victory at Saratoga convinced the French that supporting the Patriots was worthwhile, but doing so also brought major concerns. The King was concerned that Britain's concessions would be accepted, and that she would then reconcile with the Colonies to strike at French and Spanish possessions in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. To prevent this, France <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amity%20and%20Commerce%20%28United%20States%E2%80%93France%29">formally recognized</a> the United States on February 6, 1778 and followed with a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alliance%20%281778%29">military alliance</a>. France aimed to expel Britain from the <a href="Cod%20fishing%20in%20Newfoundland">Newfoundland fishery</a>, end restrictions on <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a> sovereignty, regain <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> in India, recover <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> and <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a>, and restore the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a> provisions pertaining to Anglo-French trade.

<a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spain</a> was wary of provoking war with Britain before she was ready, so she covertly supplied the Patriots via her colonies in <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a>. Congress hoped to persuade Spain into an open alliance, so the first American Commission met with the <a href="Pedro%20Pablo%20Abarca%20de%20Bolea%2C%2010th%20Count%20of%20Aranda">Count of Aranda</a> in 1776. Spain was still reluctant to make an early commitment, owing to a lack of direct French involvement, the threat against their <a href="Spanish%20treasure%20fleet">treasure fleets</a>, and the possibility of war with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a>, Spain's neighbor and a <a href="Anglo-Portuguese%20Alliance">close ally of Britain</a>. However, Spain affirmed its desire to support the Americans the following year, hoping to weaken Britain's empire. In the <a href="Spanish-Portuguese%20War%20%281776-77%29">Spanish-Portuguese War (1776-77)</a>, the Portuguese threat was neutralized. On 12 April 1779, Spain signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Aranjuez%20%281779%29">Treaty of Aranjuez</a> with France and went to war against Britain. Spain sought to recover <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a> in Europe, as well as <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a> and <a href="Pensacola">Pensacola</a> in Florida, and also to expel the British from <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>.

Meanwhile, George III had given up on subduing America while Britain had a European war to fight. He did not welcome war with France, but he believed that Britain had made all necessary steps to avoid it and cited the <a href="Annus%20Mirabilis">British victories over France</a> in the Seven Years' War as a reason to remain optimistic. Britain tried in vain to find a powerful ally to engage France, leaving it isolated, preventing Britain from focusing the majority of her efforts in one <a href="Theatre%20%28military%29">theater</a>, and forcing a major diversion of military resources from America. Despite this, the King determined never to recognize American independence and to ravage the colonies indefinitely, or until they pleaded to return to the yoke of the Crown. <a href="Alfred%20Thayer%20Mahan">Mahan</a> argues that Britain's attempt to fight in multiple theaters simultaneously without major allies was fundamentally flawed, citing impossible mutual support, exposing the forces to <a href="defeat%20in%20detail">defeat in detail</a>.

Since the outbreak of the conflict, Britain had appealed to her ally, the neutral Dutch Republic, to loan her the use of the Scots Brigade for service in America, but pro-American sentiment among the Dutch public forced them to deny the request. Consequently, the British attempted to invoke several treaties for outright Dutch military support, but the Republic still refused. Moreover, American troops were being supplied with ordnance by Dutch merchants via their <a href="Dutch%20West%20Indies">West Indies colonies</a>. French supplies bound for America had also passed through Dutch ports. The Republic maintained free trade with France following France's declaration of war on Britain, citing a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Westminster%20%281674%29">prior concession</a> by Britain on this issue. Britain responded by confiscating Dutch shipping, and <a href="Affair%20of%20Fielding%20and%20Bylandt">even firing</a> upon it. Consequently, the Republic joined the <a href="First%20League%20of%20Armed%20Neutrality">First League of Armed Neutrality</a> to enforce their neutral status. The Republic had also given sanctuary to American privateers and had drafted a treaty of commerce with the Americans. Britain argued that these actions contravened the Republic's neutral stance and declared war in December 1780.

Soon after France declared war, French and British fleets <a href="Battle%20of%20Ushant%20%281778%29">fought an indecisive action</a> off <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a> on 27 July 1778. On 12 April 1779, Spain entered the war, with a primary goal of capturing Gibraltar. On June 24, Spanish troops under the <a href="Louis%20des%20Balbes%20de%20Berton%20de%20Crillon%2C%20duc%20de%20Mahon">Duc de Crillon</a> <a href="Great%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">laid siege</a> to the <a href="Rock%20of%20Gibraltar">Rock</a>. The naval blockade, however, was relatively weak, and the British were able to resupply the garrison. Meanwhile, a plan was formulated for a <a href="Armada%20of%201779">combined Franco-Spanish invasion</a> of the <a href="British%20Isles">British mainland</a>. A combination of poor planning, disease, logistical issues and high financial expenditures resulted in the expedition's failure. However, a diversionary Franco-American squadron under <a href="John%20Paul%20Jones">John Paul Jones</a> did <a href="Battle%20of%20Flamborough%20Head">meet with some success</a> on 23 September. On 16 January 1780, the Royal Navy under <a href="George%20Brydges%20Rodney%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rodney">George Rodney</a> scored a <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20St.%20Vincent%20%281780%29">major victory</a> over the Spanish, weakening the naval blockade of Gibraltar.

On 9 August, a Franco-Spanish fleet commanded by <a href="Luis%20de%20C%C3%B3rdova%20y%20C%C3%B3rdova">Luis de Córdova</a> <a href="Action%20of%209%20August%201780">intercepted and decisively defeated</a> a large British convoy off <a href="The%20Azores">The Azores</a>, led by <a href="John%20Moutray">John Moutray</a>, bound for the West Indies. The defeat was catastrophic for Britain; losing 52 <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">merchant ships</a>, 5 <a href="East%20Indiaman">East Indiamen</a>, 80,000 muskets, equipment for 40,000 troops, 294 <a href="Artillery">guns</a> and 3,144 men, making it one of the most complete naval captures ever made. The loss was valued at some £1.5 million, or £ in today's money, dealing a severe blow to British commerce.

In the Caribbean, intending to damage British trade, the French blockaded the lucrative sugar islands of <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> and <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>. In order to improve communication among <a href="French%20West%20Indies">French Caribbean islands</a>, and to strike a blow to privateering, French troops led by the <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Claude%20Amour%2C%20marquis%20de%20Bouill%C3%A9">Marquis de Bouillé</a> <a href="Invasion%20of%20Dominica%20%281778%29">captured Dominica</a> on 7 September 1778. To monitor the French naval base on <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>, the British <a href="Battle%20of%20St.%20Lucia">defeated</a> a French naval force on 15 December, and <a href="Capture%20of%20St.%20Lucia">captured St. Lucia</a> on 28 December. Though both fleets received reinforcements through the first half of 1779, the French under the <a href="Charles%20Hector%2C%20comte%20d%27Estaing">Comte d'Estaing</a> soon enjoyed superiority in the Caribbean, and began capturing British territories; seizing <a href="Capture%20of%20Saint%20Vincent">St. Vincent</a> on 18 June, and <a href="Capture%20of%20Grenada%20%281779%29">Grenada</a> on 4 July. On July 6, having pursued d'Estaing from Grenada, the British fleet under <a href="John%20Byron">John Byron</a> was <a href="Battle%20of%20Grenada">tactically defeated</a>, the worst loss the Royal Navy had suffered <a href="Battle%20of%20Beachy%20Head%20%281690%29">since 1690</a>. Naval skirmishes continued until 17 April 1780, when British and French fleets <a href="Battle%20of%20Martinique%20%281780%29">clashed indecisively</a> off <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>.

On the mainland, <a href="Bernardo%20de%20G%C3%A1lvez">Bernardo de Gálvez</a>, <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Louisiana">governor</a> of <a href="Spanish%20Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, had intercepted intelligence the British were planning to invade <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, and decided to <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20campaign">strike first</a>. Gálvez intended to conquer West Florida, and set out with 670 men on August 27, 1779, though his force was soon swollen to 1,400 by local Native Americans. On 7 September, <a href="Capture%20of%20Fort%20Bute">Fort Bute fell</a> to the Spanish, who then marched on to <a href="Baton%20Rouge">Baton Rouge</a>, arriving on September 12. After <a href="Battle%20of%20Baton%20Rouge%20%281779%29">a nine-day siege</a>, the town fell. Leaving a garrison behind, Gálvez returned to New Orleans to recruit additional troops. In early 1780, Gálvez mounted an expedition to take <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a>, setting off with 750 troops on 11 January. Joined by reinforcements from Havana, siege operations commenced on March 1, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Charlotte">the town fell</a> after a 14-day siege. Gálvez had hoped to push on to <a href="Pensacola">Pensacola</a>, the British capital of West Florida, however, a hurricane devastated his expedition, stalling it till 1781.

In Central America, the defence of <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Guatemala">Guatemala</a> was a priority for Spain. The British intended to capture the key fortress of <a href="San%20Fernando%20de%20Omoa">San Fernando de Omoa</a> and drive the Spanish from the region. After inadequate first attempts, 1,200 British troops led by <a href="William%20Dalrymple%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">William Dalrymple</a> arrived on 16 October, and <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Fernando%20de%20Omoa">captured the fort</a> on 20 October. However, the British suffered terribly due to disease, and were forced to abandon the fort on 29 November, and Spanish troops subsequently reoccupied the fort. In 1780, <a href="Sir%20John%20Dalling%2C%201st%20Baronet">John Dalling</a>, <a href="Governors%20of%20Jamaica">governor</a> of Jamaica, planned an expedition to cut New Spain in two, by capturing <a href="Granada%2C%20Nicaragua">Granada</a>, which would subsequently allow them full control of the <a href="San%20Juan%20River%20%28Nicaragua%29">San Juan River</a>. The British <a href="San%20Juan%20Expedition%20%281780%29">expedition</a>, led by John Polson and <a href="Horatio%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>, set out on 3 February 1780. On 17 March, the expedition reached <a href="Fort%20San%20Juan%20%28Nicaragua%29">Fort San Juan</a> and laid siege, capturing it on 29 April. The British were ravaged by disease, and were running low on food due to poor logistics. The British withdrew on 8 November, the expedition having suffered a decisive defeat; some 2,500 troops had perished, making it the costliest British disaster of the war.

After word of <a href="Anglo-French%20War%20%281778-1783%29">hostilities with France</a> reached <a href="India">India</a>, the British <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> moved quickly to capture French possessions, and took <a href="Punducherry">Pondicherry</a> after a <a href="Siege%20of%20Pondicherry%20%281778%29">two-week siege</a> on 19 October 1778. The Company resolved to drive the French out of India entirely, capturing the <a href="Malabar%20coast">Malabar</a> port of <a href="Mah%C3%A9%2C%20India">Mahé</a> in 1779. Mahé had been under the protection of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">Mysore</a>, as French ordnance passed through the port to the Mysorean ruler, <a href="Hyder%20Ali">Hyder Ali</a>. Tensions were already inflamed due to British support for Malabar rebels against Ali, and the fall of Mahé <a href="Second%20Anglo-Mysore%20War">precipitated war</a>. In July 1780, Ali invaded the <a href="Carnatic%20%28region%29">Carnatic</a>, and <a href="Siege%20of%20Tellicherry">laid siege</a> to <a href="Thalassery">Tellicherry</a> and <a href="Arcot">Arcot</a>. A 7,000-strong Company relief force under <a href="William%20Baille">William Baille</a> was <a href="Battle%20of%20Pollilur%20%281780%29">intercepted and destroyed</a> by the <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> on 10 September; thus far the worst defeat suffered by a European army in India. Instead of pressing on for a decisive victory against a second Company army at <a href="Madras">Madras</a>, Ali renewed the siege at Arcot, capturing it on 3 November. The delay allowed British forces to regroup for campaigning the following year.

Following the British defeat at Saratoga, and the entry of France into the war, Henry Clinton withdrew from Philadelphia, consolidating in New York. French admiral the Comte d'Estaing had been dispatched to North America in April 1778 to assist Washington, arriving shortly after Clinton withdrew into New York. Concluding New York's defences were too formidable for the French fleet, the Franco-American forces opted to attack Newport. This effort, <a href="Battle%20of%20Rhode%20Island">launched on August 29</a>, failed after the French opted to withdraw, greatly angering the Americans. The war then ground down to a stalemate, with the majority of actions fought as large skirmishes, such as those at <a href="Battle%20of%20Chestnut%20Neck">Chestnut Neck</a> and <a href="The%20Affair%20at%20Little%20Egg%20Harbor">Little Egg Harbor</a>. In the summer of 1779, the Americans captured British posts at <a href="Battle%20of%20Stony%20Point">Stony Point</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Paulus%20Hook">Paulus Hook</a>.

In July, Clinton's attempts to coax Washington into a decisive engagement with a <a href="Tryon%27s%20raid">major raid into Connecticut</a> failed. That month, a large American <a href="Penobscot%20Expedition">naval operation</a> to retake <a href="Maine">Maine</a> resulted in the worst American naval defeat until <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> in 1941. The high frequency of Iroquois <a href="Northern%20theater%20of%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War%23Raiding%20in%20the%20valleys%2C%201778">raids on the locals</a> compelled Washington to mount a <a href="Sullivan%20Expedition">punitive expedition</a>, destroying a large number of Iroquois settlements, but the effort ultimately failed to stop the raids. During the winter of 1779–80, the Continental Army suffered greater hardships than at Valley Forge. Morale was poor; public support was being eroded by the long war, the <a href="Continental%20dollar">national currency</a> was virtually worthless, the army was plagued with supply problems, desertion was common, and, in early 1780, whole regiments mutinied over the conditions.

In 1780, Clinton launched an attempt to re-take New Jersey. On June 7, an invasion of 6,000 men under Hessian general <a href="Wilhelm%20von%20Knyphausen">Wilhelm von Knyphausen</a> met <a href="Battle%20of%20Connecticut%20Farms">stiff resistance</a> from the local militia. Though the British held the field, Knyphausen feared a general engagement with Washington's main army, and withdrew. A fortnight later, Knyphausen and Clinton decided upon a second attempt, which was <a href="Battle%20of%20Springfield%20%281780%29">soundly defeated at Springfield</a>, effectively ending British ambitions in New Jersey. Meanwhile, American general <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> had <a href="To%20the%20Inhabitants%20of%20America">grown disenfranchised</a> with the war, and conspired with the British to surrender the key American fortress of <a href="West%20Point">West Point</a>. Arnold's plot was foiled upon the capture of his contact, <a href="John%20Andr%C3%A9">John André</a>, and he escaped to British lines in New York. Though Arnold's reasoning reflected Loyalist opinion, Patriots strongly condemned him.

West of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachians</a>, the war was largely confined to skirmishing and raids. In February 1778, an expedition of militia to destroy British military supplies in settlements along the <a href="Cuyahoga%20River">Cuyahoga River</a> was halted due to adverse weather. Later in the year, a <a href="Illinois%20campaign">second campaign</a> was undertaken to seize the <a href="Illinois%20Country">Illinois Country</a> from the British. The Americans captured <a href="Kaskaskia%2C%20Illinois">Kaskaskia</a> on July 4, and then secured <a href="Vincennes%2C%20Indiana">Vincennes</a>, although the latter was quickly recaptured by <a href="Henry%20Hamilton%20%28governor%29">Henry Hamilton</a>, the British commander at <a href="Fort%20Detroit">Detroit</a>. In early 1779, the Americans counter-attacked by undertaking a risky winter march, and <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Vincennes">secured the surrender</a> of the British at Vincennes, taking Hamilton prisoner.

On May 25, 1780, the British launched <a href="Bird%27s%20invasion%20of%20Kentucky">an expedition into Kentucky</a>, as part of a wider operation to clear resistance from Quebec to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf coast</a>. The expedition met with only limited success, though hundreds of settlers were killed or captured. The Americans responded with a major offensive along the <a href="Mad%20River%20%28Ohio%29">Mad River</a> in August, which <a href="Battle%20of%20Piqua">met with some success</a>, but did little to abate the Native American raids on the frontier. An attempt by French militia to capture Detroit ended in disaster when <a href="Miami%20tribe">Miami Indians</a> <a href="Augustin%20de%20La%20Balme">ambushed and defeated</a> the gathered troops on November 5. The war in the west had become a stalemate; the Americans did not have the manpower to simultaneously defeat the Indian tribes and occupy their land.

In 1778, despite the defeat at Saratoga, the British turned their attention to reconquering the South. Prominent Loyalists with great influence in London had convinced the British that Loyalist support was high in the South, and that a campaign there would inspire a popular Loyalist uprising. The British centred their strategy upon this thinking. A southern campaign also had the advantage of keeping the Royal Navy closer to the Caribbean, where it would be needed to defend lucrative colonies against the Franco-Spanish fleets.

On December 29, 1778, an expeditionary corps from New York <a href="Capture%20of%20Savannah">captured Savannah</a>. British troops then moved inland to recruit Loyalist support. Despite a promising initial turnout in early 1779, a large Loyalist militia was defeated at <a href="Battle%20of%20Kettle%20Creek">Kettle Creek</a> on February 14, demonstrating their vulnerability when operating away from British regulars. The British recovered their loss, defeating Patriot militia at <a href="Battle%20of%20Brier%20Creek">Brier Creek</a> on March 3. The British then launched an <a href="Battle%20of%20Stono%20Ferry">abortive assault</a> on <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. The operation was noted for a high degree of looting by British troops, enraging both Loyalists and Patriot colonists. In October, a combined Franco-American effort to <a href="Siege%20of%20Savannah">capture Savannah</a> failed. In 1780, Henry Clinton moved against Charleston, <a href="Siege%20of%20Charleston">capturing it</a> on May 12. With few losses of their own, the British took 5,266 prisoners, effectively destroying the Continental Army in the south. Organized American resistance in the region collapsed when <a href="Banastre%20Tarleton">Banastre Tarleton</a> defeated the withdrawing Americans at <a href="Battle%20of%20Waxhaws">Waxhaws</a> on May 29.

Clinton returned to New York, leaving Charles Cornwallis in command in Charleston to oversee the southern war effort. In the interim, the war was carried on by Patriot militias, whom effectively suppressed Loyalists by winning victories in <a href="Battle%20of%20Mobley%27s%20Meeting%20House">Fairfield County</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Ramsour%27s%20Mill">Lincolnton</a>, <a href="Huck%27s%20Defeat">York County</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Colson%27s%20Mill">Stanly County</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Hanging%20Rock">Lancaster County</a>. Congress appointed <a href="Horatio%20Gates">Horatio Gates</a>, victor at Saratoga, to lead the American effort in the south. Soon after arriving, on August 16, Gates suffered a <a href="Battle%20of%20Camden">major defeat at Camden</a>, setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina. While Patriot militia continued to interfere in attempts to pacify the countryside, Cornwallis dispatched troops to raise Loyalist forces to cover his left flank as he moved north. This wing of Cornwallis' army was <a href="Battle%20of%20Kings%20Mountain">virtually destroyed</a> on October 7, irreversibly breaking Loyalist support in the Carolinas. Cornwallis subsequently aborted his advance and retreated back into South Carolina. In the interim, Washington replaced Gates with his trusted subordinate, <a href="Nathanael%20Greene">Nathanael Greene</a>.

Unable to confront the British directly, Greene dispatched a force under <a href="Daniel%20Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a> to recruit additional troops. Morgan then defeated the <a href="British%20Legion%20%28American%20Revolution%29">cream of the British army</a> under Tarleton on January 17, 1781, at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cowpens">Cowpens</a>. As after the defeat of the Loyalists at King's Mountain, Cornwallis was criticized for his decision to detach a substantial part of his army without adequate support. Despite the setbacks, Cornwallis proceeded to advance into North Carolina, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support. Greene evaded combat with Cornwallis, instead wearing his army down through a protracted <a href="war%20of%20attrition">war of attrition</a>. By March, Greene's army had grown enough where he felt confident in facing Cornwallis. The two armies engaged at <a href="Battle%20of%20Guilford%20Court%20House">Guilford Courthouse</a> on March 15, and, though Greene was beaten, Cornwallis' army had suffered irreplaceable casualties. Compounding this, far fewer Loyalists were joining as expected due to effective Patriot suppression. Cornwallis' casualties were such that he was compelled to retreat to <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington</a> for reinforcement, leaving the interior of the Carolinas, and Georgia, wide open to Greene.

In Cornwallis' absence, Greene proceeded to reconquer the South. Despite suffering a reversal at <a href="Battle%20of%20Hobkirk%27s%20Hill">Hobkirk's Hill</a> on April 25, American troops continued to dislodge strategic British posts in the area, capturing <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Watson">Fort Watson</a>, and <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Motte">Fort Motte</a>. Augusta, the last major British outpost in the South outside of Charleston and Savannah, <a href="Siege%20of%20Augusta">fell on June 6</a>. In an effort to stop Greene, a British force clashed with American troops at <a href="Battle%20of%20Eutaw%20Springs">Eutaw Springs</a> on September 8. Despite inflicting a tactical defeat on Greene's army, the casualties suffered by the British were such that they withdrew to Charleston. While minor skirmishes in the Carolinas continued till the end of the war, British troops were effectively confined to Charleston and Savannah for the remainder of the conflict.

Cornwallis had discovered that the majority of the American's supplies in the Carolinas were passing through <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and had written to both Lord Germain and Clinton detailing his intentions to invade. Cornwallis believed a successful campaign there would cut supplies to Greene's army and precipitate a collapse of American resistance in the South. Clinton strongly opposed the plan, instead favoring conducting a campaign further north in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake</a> region. Lord Germain wrote to Cornwallis approving his plan, neglecting to include Clinton in the decision-making entirely, despite him being Cornwallis' superior officer. Cornwallis then decided to move into Virginia without informing Clinton. Clinton, however, had failed to construct a coherent strategy for British operations in 1781, owing to his difficult relationship with his naval counterpart, <a href="Marriot%20Arbuthnot">Marriot Arbuthnot</a>.

Following the calamitous operations at Newport and Savannah, French planners realized closer cooperation with the Americans was required to achieve success. The French fleet, led by the <a href="Francois%20Joseph%20Paul%20de%20Grasse">Comte de Grasse</a>, had received discretionary orders from Paris to assist joint efforts in the north if naval support was needed. Washington and his French counterpart, the <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Donatien%20de%20Vimeur%2C%20comte%20de%20Rochambeau">Comte de Rochambeau</a>, discussed their options. Washington pushed for an attack on New York, while Rochambeau preferred a strike in Virginia, where the British were less well-established and thus, easier to defeat. Franco-American movements around New York caused Clinton a great deal of anxiety, fearing an attack on the city. His instructions to Cornwallis during this time were vague, rarely forming explicit orders. However, Clinton did instruct Cornwallis to establish a fortified naval base, and transfer troops to the north to defend New York. Cornwallis dug in at <a href="Yorktown%2C%20Virginia">Yorktown</a>, and awaited the Royal Navy.

Washington still favored an assault on New York, but was essentially overruled when the French opted to send their fleet to their preferred target of Yorktown. In August, the combined Franco-American army moved south to cooperate with de Grasse to defeat Cornwallis. Lacking sufficient naval resources to effectively counter the French, the British dispatched an inadequate fleet under <a href="Thomas%20Graves%2C%201st%20Baron%20Graves">Thomas Graves</a> to assist Cornwallis and assume naval dominance. On September 5, the French fleet <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Chesapeake">decisively defeated Graves</a>, giving the French control of the seas around Yorktown, cutting Cornwallis off from reinforcements and relief. Despite the continued urging of his subordinates, Cornwallis made no attempt to break out and engage the Franco-American army before it had established siege works, instead expecting reinforcements would arrive from New York.

On September 28, the Franco-American army <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">laid siege to Yorktown</a>. Believing relief from Clinton was imminent, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then occupied by the Franco-American troops, serving to hasten his subsequent defeat. A British attempt to break out of the siege across the river at <a href="Gloucester%20Point%2C%20Virginia">Gloucester Point</a> failed when a storm hit. Under increasing bombardment and with dwindling supplies, Cornwallis and his subordinates agreed their situation was untenable, and negotiated a surrender on October 17. Some 7,685 soldiers became prisoners of the Franco-American army. The same day as the surrender, 6,000 troops under Clinton had departed New York, sailing to relieve Yorktown.

Following British successes at Newport and Charleston, the North government had gained support in Parliament. However, the government's decision to allow Irish Catholics to enlist in the army was deeply unpopular, triggering a massive protest in London in 1780, culminating in <a href="Gordon%20Riots">widespread rioting</a>. The riots were the most destructive in <a href="History%20of%20London">London's history</a>, damaging the prestige of the government. On 25 November 1781, the situation worsened when news of the surrender at Yorktown arrived in London. Prime Minister Lord North is said to have repeatedly exclaimed; "Oh, God! It's all over!" King George III received the news with dignity, though later became <a href="depression%20%28mood%29">depressed</a> and considered <a href="abdication">abdication</a>. The Whig opposition gained traction in Parliament, though a motion proposed on December 12 to end the war was defeated by only one vote.

<a href="Lord%20George%20Germain">Lord Germain</a>, who had overseen strategic matters in the war effort, was dismissed from office in early 1782. Soon after, a <a href="Vote%20of%20no%20confidence">no confidence motion</a> in the Prime Minister was passed, forcing the resignation of North and leading to the collapse of his ministry. The <a href="Rockingham%20Whigs">Rockingham Whigs</a> came to power soon after and began opening negotiations for peace. Prime Minister the <a href="Charles%20Watson-Wentworth%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Rockingham">Marquess of Rockingham</a> died in office on 1 July 1782, and was succeeded by the <a href="William%20Petty%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Shelburne">Earl of Shelburne</a>, forcing the resignations of prominent Whigs <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a> and <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a>, with whom Shelburne had an icy relationship. Shelburne was initially hesitant to granting full American independence, instead preferring the colonies accept <a href="Dominion">Dominion status</a>, though such intentions were never realized.

Despite the defeats in America, the British still had 30,000 troops garrisoned there, occupying New York, Charleston and Savannah. Henry Clinton was recalled to London after the defeat at Yorktown, and departed America in March 1782. He was replaced by <a href="Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester">Guy Carleton</a>, who was under orders to suspend offensive operations in America.

After hostilities with the Dutch began in late 1780, Britain had moved quickly, enforcing a blockade across the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. Within weeks, the British had captured 200 Dutch merchantmen, and 300 more were holed up in foreign ports, though political turmoil within the Republic and peace negotiations by both sides helped keep conflict to a minimum. The majority of the Dutch public favored a military alliance with France against Britain, however, the Dutch <a href="Stadtholder">Stadtholder</a> impeded these efforts, hoping to secure an early peace. To restore diminishing trade a Dutch squadron under <a href="Johan%20Zoutman">Johan Zoutman</a> escorted a fleet of some 70 merchantmen from the <a href="Texel">Texel</a>. Zoutman's ships were intercepted by <a href="Sir%20Hyde%20Parker%2C%205th%20Baronet">Sir Hyde Parker</a>, who <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281781%29">engaged Zoutman at Dogger Bank</a> on 5 August 1781. Though the contest was tactically inconclusive, the Dutch fleet did not leave harbor again during the war, and their merchant fleet remained crippled.

On 6 January 1781, a French <a href="Battle%20of%20Jersey">attempt to capture Jersey</a> to neutralize British privateering failed. Frustrated in their attempts to capture Gibraltar, a Franco-Spanish force of 14,000 men under the <a href="Louis%20des%20Balbes%20de%20Berton%20de%20Crillon%2C%20duc%20de%20Mahon">Duc de Mahon</a> met with more success in August; <a href="Invasion%20of%20Menorca%20%281781%29">invading Menorca</a> on 19 August. After a long siege of <a href="St.%20Philip%27s%20Castle">St. Philip's</a>, the British garrison under <a href="James%20Murray%20%28Quebec%20governor%29">James Murray</a> surrendered on 5 February 1782, securing a primary war goal for the Spanish. At Gibraltar, a <a href="Great%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar%23The%20Grand%20Assault">major Franco-Spanish assault</a> on 13 September 1782 was repulsed with heavy casualties. On 20 October 1782, following a successful resupply of Gibraltar, British ships under <a href="Richard%20Howe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Howe">Richard Howe</a> successfully <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Spartel">refused battle</a> to the Franco-Spanish fleet under Luis de Córdova, denying Córdova dominance at sea. On 7 February 1783, after 1,322 days of siege, the Franco-Spanish army withdrew, decisively defeated.

In the West Indies, on 29–30 April 1781, a Royal Navy squadron under <a href="Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hood">Samuel Hood</a> was <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Royal">narrowly defeated</a> by the French, led by the Comte de Grasse. de Grasse continued seizing British territories; <a href="Invasion%20of%20Tobago">Tobago</a> fell on 2 June, <a href="Capture%20of%20Demerara%20and%20Essequibo">Demerara and Essequibo</a> on 22 January 1782, <a href="Siege%20of%20Brimstone%20Hill">St. Kitts and Nevis</a> on 12 February, despite a British <a href="Battle%20of%20Saint%20Kitts">naval victory</a> on 25 January, and <a href="Capture%20of%20Montserrat">Montserrat</a> on 22 February. In 1782, the primary strategic goal of the French and Spanish was the capture of Jamaica, whose sugar exports were more valuable to the British than the Thirteen Colonies combined. On 7 April 1782, de Grasse departed <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a> to rendezvous with Franco-Spanish troops at <a href="Saint%20Domingue">Saint Domingue</a>, and invade Jamaica from the north. The British under Hood and <a href="George%20Brydges%20Rodney%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rodney">George Rodney</a> pursued and <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Saintes">decisively defeated</a> the French off <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a> between 9–12 April. The Franco-Spanish plan to conquer Jamaica was in ruins, and the balance of naval power in the Caribbean shifted to the Royal Navy.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Charlotte">fall of Mobile</a> to Spanish troops under Bernardo de Gálvez, an attempt to capture Pensacola was thwarted due to a hurricane. Emboldened by the disaster, <a href="John%20Campbell%2C%20of%20Strachur">John Campbell</a>, British commander at Pensacola, decided to recapture Mobile. Campbell's expeditionary force of around 700 men was <a href="Battle%20of%20Mobile%20%281781%29">defeated</a> on 7 January 1781. After re-grouping at <a href="Havana%2C%20Cuba">Havana</a>, Gálvez set out for Pensacola on 13 February. Arriving on 9 March, siege operations did not begin until 24 March, owing to difficulties in bringing the ships into the bay. After a 45-day siege, Gálvez <a href="Siege%20of%20Pensacola">decisively defeated</a> the garrison, securing the conquest of West Florida. In May, Spanish troops <a href="Capture%20of%20the%20Bahamas%20%281782%29">captured the Bahamas</a>, although the British bloodlessly <a href="Capture%20of%20the%20Bahamas%20%281783%29">recaptured the islands</a> the following year on 18 April.

In Guatemala, <a href="Mat%C3%ADas%20de%20G%C3%A1lvez%20y%20Gallardo">Matías de Gálvez</a> led Spanish troops in an effort to dislocate British settlements along the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Honduras">Gulf of Honduras</a>. Gálvez <a href="Battle%20of%20Roat%C3%A1n">captured Roatán</a> on 16 March 1782, and then quickly took <a href="Black%20River%20%28settlement%29">Black River</a>. Following the decisive naval victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Saintes">Saintes</a>, <a href="Archibald%20Campbell%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Archibald Campbell</a>, the Royal governor of Jamaica, authorized <a href="Edward%20Despard">Edward Despard</a> to re-take Black River, which <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Black%20River">he did on 22 August</a>. However, with peace talks opening, and Franco-Spanish resources committed to the siege of Gibraltar, no further offensive operations took place.

Few operations were conducted against the Dutch, although several Dutch colonies <a href="Dutch%20West%20Indies%20campaign">were captured</a> by the British in 1781. Sint Eustatius, a key supply port for the Patriots, was <a href="Capture%20of%20Sint%20Eustatius">sacked by British forces</a> under George Rodney on 3 February 1782, plundering the island's wealth.

Following Dutch entry into the conflict, East India Company troops under <a href="Hector%20Munro%2C%208th%20of%20Novar">Hector Munro</a> captured the Dutch port of <a href="Negapatam">Negapatam</a> after a <a href="Siege%20of%20Negapatam">three-week siege</a> on 11 October 1781. Soon after, British Admiral <a href="Edward%20Hughes%20%28admiral%29">Edward Hughes</a> <a href="Capture%20of%20Trincomalee">captured Trincomalee</a> after a brief engagement on 11 January 1782.

In March 1781, French Admiral <a href="Bailli%20de%20Suffren">Bailli de Suffren</a> was dispatched to India to assist colonial efforts. Suffren arrived off the Indian coast in February 1782, where he <a href="Battle%20of%20Sadras">clashed with</a> a British fleet under Hughes, winning a narrow tactical victory. After landing troops at <a href="Parangipettai">Porto Novo</a> to assist Mysore, Suffren's fleet clashed with Hughes again <a href="Battle%20of%20Providien">Providien</a> on 12 April. There was no clear victor, though Hughes' fleet came off worse, and he withdrew to the British-held port of Trincomalee. Hyder Ali wished for the French to capture Negapatam to establish naval dominance over the British, and this task fell to Suffren. Suffren's fleet clashed with Hughes again <a href="Battle%20of%20Negapatam%20%281782%29">off Negapatam</a> on 6 July. Suffren withdrew to <a href="Cuddalore">Cuddalore</a>, strategically defeated, and the British remained in control of Negapatam. Intending to find a more suitable port than Cuddalore, Suffren captured Trincomalee on 1 September, and successfully <a href="Battle%20of%20Trincomalee">engaged Hughes</a> two days later.

Meanwhile, Ali's troops <a href="Siege%20of%20Vellore">loosely blockaded Vellore</a> as the East India Company regrouped. Company troops under <a href="Eyre%20Coote%20%28East%20India%20Company%20officer%29">Sir Eyre Coote</a> led a counter-offensive, defeating Ali at <a href="Battle%20of%20Porto%20Novo">Porto Novo</a> on 1 July 1781, <a href="Battle%20of%20Pollilur%20%281781%29">Pollilur</a> on 27 August, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Sholinghur">Sholinghur</a> on 27 September, expelling the Mysorean troops from the Carnatic. On 18 February 1782, Tipu Sultan defeated <a href="Sir%20John%20Braithwaite%2C%201st%20Baronet">John Braithwaite</a> near <a href="Thanjavur">Tanjore</a>, taking his entire 1,800-strong force prisoner. The war had, by this point, reached an uneasy stalemate. On 7 December 1782, Hyder Ali died, and the rule of Mysore passed to his son, Tipu Sultan.

Sultan advanced along the west coast, <a href="Siege%20of%20Mangalore">laying siege to Mangalore</a> on 20 May 1783. Meanwhile, on the east coast, an army under <a href="James%20Stuart%20%28d.%201793%29">James Stuart</a> <a href="Siege%20of%20Cuddalore">besieged</a> the French-held port of Cuddalore on 9 June 1783. On 20 June, key British naval support for the siege was neutralized when Suffren defeated Hughes' fleet <a href="Battle%20of%20Cuddalore%20%281783%29">off Cuddalore</a>, and though narrow, the victory gave Suffren the opportunity to displace British holdings in India. On 25 June, the Franco-Mysorean defenders made repeated sorties against British lines, though all assaults failed. On 30 June, news arrived of a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles%20%281783%29">preliminary peace</a> between the belligerent powers, and the siege was effectively over when the French abandoned the siege. Mangalore remained under siege, and capitulated to Sultan on 30 January 1784. Little fighting took place thereafter, and Mysore and Britain <a href="Treaty%20of%20Mangalore">made peace</a> on 11 March.

Following the surrender at Yorktown, the Whig party came to power in Britain and began opening negotiations for a cessation of hostilities. While peace negotiations were being undertaken, British troops in America were restricted from launching further offensives. Prime Minister the Earl of Shelburne was reluctant to accept American independence as a prerequisite for peace, as the British were aware that the French economy was nearly bankrupt, and reinforcements sent to the West Indies could potentially reverse the situation there. He preferred that the colonies accept Dominion status within the Empire, though a similar offer had been rejected by the Americans in 1778. Negotiations soon began in Paris.

The Americans initially demanded that Quebec be ceded to them as <a href="Prize%20of%20war">spoils of war</a>, a proposal that was dropped when Shelburne accepted American demands for recognition of independence. On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations. Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the <a href="Northwest%20Territory">area north of the Ohio River</a>, below which an <a href="Indian%20barrier%20state">Indian barrier state</a> would be established under Spanish control. The United States fiercely opposed the proposal.

The Americans skirted their allies, recognizing that more favorable terms would be found in London. They negotiated directly with Shelburne, who hoped to make Britain a valuable trading partner of America at the expense of France. To this end, Shelburne offered to cede all the land east of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, north of Florida, and south of Quebec, while also allowing American fishermen access to the rich Newfoundland fishery. According to one historian, Shelburne was hoping to facilitate the growth of the American population, creating lucrative markets that Britain could exploit at no administrative cost to London. As Vergennes commented, "the English buy peace rather than make it".

Throughout the negotiations, Britain never consulted her American Indian allies, forcing them to reluctantly accept the treaty. However, the subsequent tension erupted into conflicts between the Indians and the young United States, the largest being the <a href="Northwest%20Indian%20War">Northwest Indian War</a>. Britain continued trying to create an Indian buffer state in the American Midwest as late as 1814 during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

Britain negotiated separate treaties with Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. Gibraltar proved to be a stumbling block in the peace talks; Spain offered to relinquish their conquests in West Florida, Menorca, and the Bahamas in exchange for Gibraltar, terms which Shelburne steadfastly refused. Shelburne instead offered to cede <a href="East%20Florida">East Florida</a>, West Florida, and Menorca if Spain would relinquish the claim on Gibraltar, terms which were reluctantly accepted. However, in the long-term, the new territorial gains were of little value to Spain. France's only net gains were the island of <a href="Tobago">Tobago</a> in the Caribbean and <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> in Africa, after agreeing to return all other colonial conquests to British sovereignty. Britain returned Dutch Caribbean territories to Dutch sovereignty, in exchange for free trade rights in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> and control of the Indian port of <a href="Negapatnam">Negapatnam</a>.

Preliminary peace articles were signed in Paris on 30 November 1782, while preliminaries between Britain, Spain, France, and the Netherlands continued until September 1783. The United States <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederation">Congress of the Confederation</a> ratified the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a> on <a href="Ratification%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">January 14, 1784</a>. Copies were sent back to Europe for ratification by the other parties involved, the first reaching France in March 1784. British ratification occurred on April 9, 1784, and the ratified versions were exchanged in Paris on May 12, 1784. The war formally concluded on September 3, 1783.

The last British troops <a href="Evacuation%20Day%20%28New%20York%29">departed New York City</a> on November 25, 1783, marking the end of British rule in the new United States.

The total loss of life throughout the conflict is largely unknown. As was typical in wars of the era, diseases such as <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> claimed more lives than battle. Between 1775 and 1782, a <a href="North%20American%20smallpox%20epidemic">smallpox epidemic</a> broke out throughout North America, killing 40 people in Boston alone. Historian <a href="Joseph%20Ellis">Joseph Ellis</a> suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops <a href="inoculation">inoculated</a> against the disease was one of his most important decisions.

Between 25,000 and 70,000 American Patriots died during active military service. Of these, approximately 6,800 were killed in battle, while at least 17,000 died from disease. The majority of the latter died while <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> of the British, mostly in the <a href="Prisoners%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">prison ships</a> in New York Harbor. If the upper limit of 70,000 is accepted as the total net loss for the Patriots, it would make the conflict proportionally deadlier than the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. Uncertainty arises due to the difficulties in accurately calculating the number of those who succumbed to disease, as it is estimated at least 10,000 died in 1776 alone. The number of Patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8,500 to 25,000.

The French suffered approximately 7,000 total dead throughout the conflict; of those, 2,112 were killed in combat in the American theaters of war.

The Dutch suffered around 500 total killed, owing to the minor scale of their conflict with Britain.

British returns in 1783 listed 43,633 rank and file deaths across the <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">British Armed Forces</a>. A table from 1781 puts total British Army deaths at 9,372 soldiers killed in battle across the Americas; 6,046 in North America (1775–1779), and 3,326 in the West Indies (1778–1780). In 1784, a British lieutenant compiled a detailed list of 205 British officers killed in action during the war, encompassing Europe, the Caribbean and the East Indies. Extrapolations based upon this list puts British Army losses in the area of at least 4,000 killed or died of wounds. Approximately 7,774 <a href="Germans%20in%20the%20American%20Revolution%23Allies%20of%20Great%20Britain">Germans</a> died in British service in addition to 4,888 deserters; of the former, it is estimated 1,800 were killed in combat.

Around 171,000 <a href="sailors">sailors</a> served in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> during the war; approximately a quarter of whom had been <a href="impressment">pressed</a> into service. Around 1,240 were killed in battle, while an estimated 18,500 died from disease (1776–1780). The greatest killer at sea was <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>, a disease caused by <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a> deficiency. It was not until 1795 that scurvy was eradicated from the Royal Navy after the Admiralty declared <a href="lemon%20juice">lemon juice</a> and <a href="sugar">sugar</a> were to be issued among the standard daily rations of sailors. Around 42,000 sailors <a href="desertion">deserted</a> during the war. The impact on merchant shipping was substantial; an estimated 3,386 <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">merchant ships</a> were seized by enemy forces during the war; of those, 2,283 were taken by American privateers alone.

At the start of the war, the economy of the colonies was flourishing, and the free white population enjoyed the highest standard of living in the world. The Royal Navy enforced a naval blockade during the war to financially cripple the colonies, however, this proved unsuccessful; 90% of the population worked in farming, not in coastal trade, and, as such, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade.

Congress had immense difficulties throughout the conflict to efficiently finance the war effort. As the circulation of hard currency declined, the Americans had to rely on loans from American merchants and bankers, France, Spain and the Netherlands, saddling the young nation with crippling debts. Congress attempted to remedy this by printing vast amounts of paper money and bills of credit to raise revenue. The effect was disastrous; inflation skyrocketed, and the paper money became virtually worthless. The inflation spawned a popular phrase that anything of little value was "not worth a <a href="continental%20dollar">continental</a>".

By 1791, the United States had accumulated a national debt of approximately $75.5 million. The United States finally solved its debt and currency problems in the 1790s, when <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> secured legislation by which the national government assumed all of the state debts, and, in addition, created a <a href="First%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">national bank</a> and a funding system based on tariffs and bond issues that paid off the foreign debts.

Britain spent around <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>80 million and ended with a <a href="national%20debt">national debt</a> of £250 million, (£ in today's money), generating a yearly interest of £9.5 million annually. The debts piled upon that which it had already accumulated from the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>. Due to wartime taxation upon the British populace, the tax for the average Briton amounted to approximately four <a href="shillings">shillings</a> in every <a href="Pound%20sterling">pound</a>.

The French spent approximately 1.3 billion <a href="French%20livre">livres</a> on aiding the Americans, accumulating a national debt of 3.315.1 billion livres by 1783 on war costs. Unlike Britain, which had a very efficient taxation system, the French tax system was highly unstable, eventually leading to a financial crisis in 1786. The debts contributed to a worsening fiscal crisis that ultimately begat the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> at the end of the century. The debt continued to spiral; on the eve of the French Revolution, the national debt had skyrocketed to 12 billion livres.

Spain had nearly doubled her military spending during the war, from 454 million <a href="Spanish%20real">reales</a> in 1778 to over 700 million in 1779. Spain more easily disposed of her debts unlike her French ally, partially due to the massive increase in <a href="silver%20mining%23Americas">silver mining</a> in her American colonies; production increased approximately 600% in Mexico, and by 250% in Peru and Bolivia.

The population of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> in 1780 was approximately 12.6 million, while the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> held a population of some 2.8 million, including some 500,000 slaves. Theoretically, Britain had the advantage, however, many factors inhibited the procurement of a large army.

In 1775, the standing <a href="British%20Army%20during%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">British Army</a>, exclusive of militia, comprised 45,123 men worldwide, made up of 38,254 infantry and 6,869 cavalry. The Army had approximately eighteen regiments of foot, some 8,500 men, stationed in North America. Standing armies had played a key role in the purge of the <a href="Long%20Parliament">Long Parliament</a> in 1648, the maintenance of a <a href="Rule%20of%20the%20Major-Generals">military dictatorship</a> under <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, and the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">overthrow of James II</a>, and, as such, the Army had been deliberately kept small in peacetime to prevent abuses of power by the King. Despite this, eighteenth century armies were not easy guests, and were regarded with scorn and contempt by the <a href="News%20media">press</a> and public of the <a href="New%20World">New</a> and <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> alike, derided as enemies of liberty. An expression ran in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Navy</a>; "A messmate before a shipmate, a shipmate before a stranger, a stranger before a dog, a dog before a soldier".

Parliament suffered chronic difficulties in obtaining sufficient manpower, and found it impossible to fill the quotas they had set. The Army was a deeply unpopular profession, one contentious issue being pay. A <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">Private</a> infantryman was paid a wage of just 8<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d.</a> per day, the same pay as for a <a href="New%20Model%20Army">New Model Army</a> infantryman, 130 years earlier. The rate of pay in the army was insufficient to meet the rising costs of living, turning off potential recruits, as service was nominally for life.

To entice people to enrol, Parliament offered a <a href="bounty%20%28reward%29">bounty</a> of <a href="guinea%20%28coin%29">£</a>1.10<a href="shillings">s</a> for every recruit. As the war dragged on, Parliament became desperate for manpower; criminals were offered military service to escape legal penalties, and deserters were pardoned if they re-joined their units. After the defeat at Saratoga, Parliament doubled the bounty to £3, and increased it again the following year, to £3.3s, as well as expanding the age limit from 17–45 to 16–50 years of age.

<a href="Impressment">Impressment</a>, essentially conscription by the "press gang", was a favored recruiting method, though it was unpopular with the public, leading many to enlist in local militias to avoid regular service. Attempts were made to draft such levies, much to the chagrin of the militia commanders. Competition between naval and army press gangs, and even between rival ships or regiments, frequently resulted in brawls between the gangs in order to secure recruits for their unit. Men would maim themselves to avoid the press gangs, while many deserted at the first opportunity. Pressed men were militarily unreliable; regiments with large numbers of such men were deployed to garrisons such as Gibraltar or the West Indies, purely to increase the difficulty in successfully deserting.

By 1781, the Army numbered approximately 121,000 men globally, 48,000 of whom were stationed throughout the Americas. Of the 171,000 sailors who served in the Royal Navy throughout the conflict, around a quarter were pressed. Interestingly, this same proportion, approximately 42,000 men, deserted during the conflict. At its height, the Navy had 94 <a href="Ship%20of%20the%20line">ships-of-the-line</a>, 104 <a href="Frigate%23Age%20of%20Sail">frigates</a> and 37 <a href="sloop-of-war">sloops</a> in service.

In 1775, Britain unsuccessfully attempted to secure 20,000 mercenaries from <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>, and the use of the <a href="Scots%20Brigade">Scots Brigade</a> from the Dutch Republic, such was the shortage of manpower. Parliament managed to negotiate treaties with the princes of German states for large sums of money, in exchange for <a href="Hessian%20%28soldier%29">mercenary troops</a>. In total, 29,875 troops were hired for British service from six German states; <a href="Principality%20of%20Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Brunswick</a> (5,723), <a href="Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Hesse-Kassel</a> (16,992), <a href="Hanau">Hesse-Hannau</a> (2,422), <a href="Principality%20of%20Ansbach">Ansbach-Bayreuth</a> (2,353), <a href="Principality%20of%20Waldeck%20and%20Pyrmont">Waldeck-Pyrmont</a> (1,225) and <a href="Principality%20of%20Anhalt-Zerbst">Anhalt-Zerbst</a> (1,160). King George III, who also ruled <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Hanover</a> as a <a href="Prince-elector">Prince-elector</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, was approached by Parliament to loan the government Hanoverian soldiers for service in the war. Hanover supplied 2,365 men in five <a href="battalions">battalions</a>, however, the lease agreement permitted them to only be used in Europe.

Without any major allies, the manpower shortage became critical when France and Spain entered the war, forcing a major diversion of military resources from the Americas. Recruiting adequate numbers of Loyalist militia in America proved difficult due to high Patriot activity. To bolster numbers, the British promised freedom and grants of land to slaves who <a href="Black%20Loyalist">fought for them</a>. Approximately 25,000 Loyalists fought for the British throughout the war, and provided some of the best troops in the British service; the <a href="British%20Legion%20%28American%20Revolution%29">British Legion</a>, a mixed regiment of 250 <a href="dragoons">dragoons</a> and 200 infantry commanded by Banastre Tarleton, gained a fearsome reputation in the colonies, especially in the South.

Britain had a difficult time appointing a determined senior military leadership in America. Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of North America at the outbreak of the war, was criticized for being too lenient on the rebellious colonists. Jeffrey Amherst, who was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1778, refused a direct command in America, due to unwillingness to take sides in the war. Admiral <a href="Augustus%20Keppel%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Keppel">Augustus Keppel</a> similarly opposed a command, stating; "I cannot draw the sword in such a cause". The <a href="Thomas%20Howard%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Effingham">Earl of Effingham</a> resigned his commission when his regiment was posted to America, while William Howe and John Burgoyne were opposed to military solutions to the crisis. Howe and Henry Clinton both stated they were unwilling participants, and were only following orders.

As was the case in many European armies, except the <a href="Prussian%20Army">Prussian Army</a>, officers in British service could <a href="Purchase%20of%20commissions%20in%20the%20British%20Army">purchase commissions</a> to ascend the ranks. Despite repeated attempts by Parliament to suppress it, the practise was common in the Army. Values of commissions varied, but were usually in line with social and military prestige, for example, regiments such as the <a href="Household%20Division%23United%20Kingdom">Guards</a> commanded the highest prices. The lower ranks often regarded the treatment to high-ranking commissions by wealthier officers as "plums for [their] consumption". Wealthy individuals lacking any formal military education, or practical experience, often found their way into positions of high responsibility, diluting the effectiveness of a regiment. Though Royal authority had forbade the practise since 1711, it was still permitted for infants to hold commissions. Young boys, often orphans of deceased wealthy officers, were taken from their schooling and placed in positions of responsibility within regiments.

Logistical organization of eighteenth century armies was chaotic at best, and the British Army was no exception. No logistical corps existed in the modern sense; while on campaign in foreign territories such as America, horses, wagons, and drivers were frequently requisitioned from the locals, often by impressment or by hire. No centrally organized medical corps existed. It was common for surgeons to have no formal medical education, and no diploma or entry examination was required. Nurses sometimes were apprentices to surgeons, but many were drafted from the women who <a href="camp%20follower">followed the army</a>. Army surgeons and doctors were poorly paid and were regarded as social inferiors to other officers.

The heavy personal equipment and wool uniform of the regular infantrymen were wholly unsuitable for combat in America, and the outfit was especially ill-suited to comfort and agile movement. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monmouth">Battle of Monmouth</a> in late June 1778, the temperature exceeded 100°<a href="Fahrenheit">F</a> (37.8°<a href="Celsius">C</a>) and is said to have claimed more lives through <a href="heat%20stroke">heat stroke</a> than through actual combat. The standard-issue firearm of the British Army was the <a href="Brown%20Bess">Land Pattern Musket</a>. Some officers preferred their troops to fire careful, measured shots (around two per minute), rather than rapid firing. A bayonet made firing difficult, as its cumbersome shape hampered ramming down the charge into the barrel. British troops had a tendency to fire impetuously, resulting in inaccurate fire, a trait for which John Burgoyne criticized them during the Saratoga campaign. Burgoyne instead encouraged bayonet charges to break up enemy formations, which was a preferred tactic in most European armies at the time.

Every battalion in America had organized its own rifle company by the end of the war, although rifles were not formally issued to the army until the <a href="Baker%20Rifle">Baker Rifle</a> in 1801. Flintlocks were heavily dependent on the weather; high winds could blow the gunpowder from the <a href="flash%20pan">flash pan</a>, while heavy rain could soak the <a href="paper%20cartridge">paper cartridge</a>, ruining the powder and rendering the musket unable to fire. Furthermore, flints used in British muskets were of notoriously poor quality; they could only be fired around six times before requiring resharpening, while American flints could fire sixty. This led to a common expression among the British: "Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog".

Provisioning troops and sailors proved to be an immense challenge, as the majority of food stores had to be shipped overseas from Britain. The need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the Army from living off the land. Other factors also impeded this option; the countryside was too sparsely populated and the inhabitants were largely hostile or indifferent, the network of roads and bridges was poorly developed, and the area which the British controlled was so limited that foraging parties were frequently in danger of being ambushed. After France entered the war, the threat of the French navy increased the difficulty of transporting supplies to America. The food that could be bought in America was purchased at vastly inflated prices. Soldiers stationed in the West Indies perhaps suffered the worst; the garrison commander of Tobago, Barbados, and <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a> frequently complained of the near-total lack of regular supply from Britain, and the food that could be bought was so expensive that the pay of the troops was inadequate to cover the costs.

Food supplies were frequently in terrible condition, infested with mould, <a href="weevils">weevils</a>, worms, and maggots. Provisions were frequently destroyed by rats, and their containers were too fragile to sustain a long ocean voyage or the rigors of campaigning. The climate was also against the British in the southern colonies and the Caribbean, where the intense summer heat caused food supplies to sour and spoil. British troops stationed in America were often on the verge of starvation.

Life at sea was little better. Sailors and passengers were issued a daily food ration, largely consisting of <a href="hardtack">hardtack</a> and beer. The hardtack was often infested by weevils and was so tough that it earned the nicknames "molar breakers" and "worm castles", and it sometimes had to be broken up with cannon shot. Meat supplies often spoiled on long voyages. The lack of fresh fruit and vegetables gave rise to scurvy, one of the biggest killers at sea. Rum was issued as part of a daily ration and was a popular drink among soldiers and sailors alike, often mixed with fresh water to make <a href="grog">grog</a>.

Discipline in the armed forces was harsh, and <a href="Flagellation">the lash</a> was used to punish even trivial offences, nor was it applied sparingly. For instance, during the Saratoga campaign, two redcoats received 1,000 lashes each for robbery, while another received 800 lashes for striking a superior officer. During the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, one soldier received 700 lashes for stealing a beehive, while another, whom had received only 175 strikes of his 400-lash sentence, spent three weeks in hospital from his injuries. The practise could often be a contentious source of resentment; during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Quatre%20Bras">Battle of Quatre Bras</a> in 1815, the commander of the <a href="92nd%20%28Gordon%20Highlanders%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">92nd Foot</a> was shot and killed by a soldier whom he had recently flogged. Flogging was a common punishment in the Royal Navy, and came to be associated with the stereotypical hardiness of sailors.

Despite the harsh discipline, a distinct lack of self-discipline pervaded all ranks. Soldiers had an intense passion for gambling, reaching such excesses that troops would often wager their own uniforms. Soldiers drank heavily, and was not exclusive to the lower ranks; William Howe was said to have seen many "crapulous mornings" while campaigning in New York. John Burgoyne drank heavily on a nightly basis towards the end of the Saratoga campaign. The two generals were also reported to have found solace with the wives of subordinate officers to ease the stressful burdens of command. During the Philadelphia campaign, British officers deeply offended local Quakers by entertaining their mistresses in the houses they had been quartered in. Despite such issues, British troops are reported to have been generally scrupulous in their treatment of non-combatants. This is contrasted by Hessian diaries, who wrote of their disapproval of British conduct towards the colonists, such as the destruction of property and the execution of prisoners.

The presence of Hessian soldiers caused considerable anxiety amongst the colonists, both Patriot and Loyalist, who viewed them as brutal mercenaries. British soldiers were often contemptuous in their treatment of Hessian troops, despite orders from General Howe that "the English should treat the Germans as brothers". The order only began to have any real effect when the Hessians learned to speak a minimal degree of English, which was seen as a prerequisite for the British troops to accord them any respect.

During peacetime, the Army's idleness led to it becoming riddled with corruption and inefficiency, resulting in a myriad of administrative difficulties once campaigning began.

The British leadership soon discovered it had overestimated the capabilities of its own troops, while underestimating those of the colonists, causing a sudden re-think in British planning. The ineffective initial response of British military and civil officials to the onset of the rebellion had allowed the advantage to shift to the colonists, as British authorities rapidly lost control over every colony. A microcosm of these shortcomings were evident at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>. It took ten hours for the British leadership to respond following the sighting of the Americans on the Charlestown Peninsula, giving the colonists ample time to reinforce their defenses. Rather than opt for a simple flanking attack that would have rapidly succeeded with minimal loss, the British decided on repeated frontal attacks. The results were telling; the British suffered 1,054 casualties of a force of around 3,000 after repeated frontal assaults. The British leadership had nevertheless remained excessively optimistic, believing that just two regiments could suppress the rebellion in Massachusetts.

Debate persists over whether a British defeat was a guaranteed outcome. <a href="John%20E.%20Ferling">Ferling</a> argues that the odds were so long, the defeat of Britain was nothing short of a miracle. <a href="Joseph%20Ellis">Ellis</a>, however, considers that the odds always favored the Americans, and questions whether a British victory by any margin was realistic. Ellis argues that the British squandered their only opportunities for a decisive success in 1777, and that the strategic decisions undertaken by William Howe underestimated the challenges posed by the Americans. Ellis concludes that, once Howe failed, the opportunity for a British victory "would never come again". Conversely, the United States Army's official textbook argues that, had Britain been able to commit 10,000 fresh troops to the war in 1780, a British victory was within the realms of possibility.

Historians such as Ellis and Stewart have observed that, under William Howe's command, the British squandered several opportunities to achieve a decisive victory over the Americans. Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors, errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, Howe failed to even attempt an encirclement of Washington, and actively restrained his subordinates from mounting an aggressive pursuit of the defeated American army. At <a href="Battle%20of%20White%20Plains">White Plains</a>, he refused to engage Washington's vulnerable army, and instead concentrated his efforts upon a hill which offered the British no strategic advantage. After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army. Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats, Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.

During planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. The decision left Burgoyne precariously isolated, and left the Americans confounded at the decision. Alden argues Howe may have been motivated by <a href="political%20opportunism">political opportunism</a>; if Burgoyne was successful, he would receive the credit for a decisive victory, and not Howe. However, the confusion was further compounded by the lack of explicit and contradictory instructions from London. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so confused Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.

During the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">Battle of Brandywine</a>, and again after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">Battle of Germantown</a>. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20White%20Marsh">Battle of White Marsh</a>, Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear, and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides. While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war. Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.

Contrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive manoeuvres due to the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill. During the major campaigns in New York and Philadelphia, Howe often wrote of the scarcity of adequate provisions, which hampered his ability to mount effective campaigns. Howe's tardiness in launching the New York campaign, and his reluctance to allow Cornwallis to vigorously pursue Washington's beaten army, have both been attributed to the paucity of available food supplies.

During the winter of 1776–1777, Howe split his army into scattered cantonments. This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trenton">Battle of Trenton</a>, and the concurrent <a href="Battle%20of%20Princeton">Battle of Princeton</a>. While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision. The garrisons were widely spaced so their respective foraging parties would not interfere with each other's efforts. Howe's difficulties during the Philadelphia campaign were also greatly exacerbated by the poor quality and quantity of available provisions.

In 1780, the primary British strategy hinged upon a Loyalist uprising in the south, for which Charles Cornwallis was chiefly responsible. After an encouraging success at <a href="Battle%20of%20Camden">Camden</a>, Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kings%20Mountain">Battle of Kings Mountain</a>, and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cowpens">Battle of Cowpens</a>. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support. Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized. As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guilford%20Courthouse">Battle of Guilford Courthouse</a>, and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive <a href="war%20of%20attrition">war of attrition</a>. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.

In a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place between Washington in the North. London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction. Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions. Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year, owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.

As the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to <a href="sally%20%28military%29">sally out</a> and engage before siege lines could be erected, despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers. Expecting <a href="relief%20%28military%29">relief</a> to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat. These factors contributed to the eventual surrender of Cornwallis' entire army, and the end of major operations in North America.

Like Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland. That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed. Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food. By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a "fatal consequence will ensue" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received "an ounce" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.

Suppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived. The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signalled the end of a conflict, yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston. Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly in the power of the Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was <a href="agrarian%20society">agrarian</a>, not urban. As a result, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.

The need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the British from using the harsh methods of suppressing revolts that they had used in <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201745%23Legacy">Scotland</a> and <a href="Penal%20Laws%20%28Ireland%29">Ireland</a>. For example, British troops looted and pillaged the locals during an aborted attack on Charleston in 1779, enraging both Patriots and Loyalists. Neutral colonists were often driven into the ranks of the Patriots when brutal combat broke out between Tories and Whigs across the Carolinas in the later stages of the war. Conversely, Loyalists were often emboldened when Patriots resorted to intimidating suspected Tories, such as destroying property or <a href="tarring%20and%20feathering">tarring and feathering</a>. The vastness of the American countryside and the limited manpower available meant that the British could never simultaneously defeat the Americans and occupy captured territory. One British statesman described the attempt as "like trying to conquer a map".

Wealthy Loyalists wielded great influence in London and were successful in convincing the British that the majority view in the colonies was sympathetic toward the Crown. Consequently, British planners pinned the success of their strategies on popular uprisings of Loyalists, which never transpired on the scale required. Historians have estimated that Loyalists made up only 15–20% of the population (vs. 40-45% Patriots) and that they continued to deceive themselves on their level of support as late as 1780. The British discovered that any significant level of organized Loyalist activity would require the continued presence of British regulars, which presented them with a major dilemma. The manpower that the British had available was insufficient to both protect Loyalist territory and counter American advances. The vulnerability of Loyalist militias was repeatedly demonstrated in the South, where they suffered strings of defeats to their Patriot neighbors. The most crucial juncture of this was at Kings Mountain, and the victory of the Patriot partisans irreversibly crippled Loyalist military capability in the South.

Upon the entry of France and Spain into the conflict, the British were forced to severely limit the number of troops and warships that they sent to North America in order to defend other key territories and the British mainland. As a result, King George III abandoned any hope of subduing America militarily while he had a European war to contend with. The small size of Britain's army left them unable to concentrate their resources primarily in one <a href="theater%20%28military%29">theater</a> as they had done in the Seven Years' War, leaving them at a critical disadvantage. The British were compelled to disperse troops from the Americas to Europe and the East Indies, and these forces were unable to assist one other as a result, precariously exposing them to defeat. In North America, the immediate strategic focus of the French, Spanish, and British shifted to Jamaica, whose sugar exports were more valuable to the British than the economy of the Thirteen Colonies combined.

Following the end of the war, Britain had lost some of her most populous colonies. However, the economic effects of the loss were negligible in the long-term, and she became a global superpower just 32 years after the end of the conflict.

The Americans began the war with significant disadvantages compared to the British. They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.

However, the Americans had multiple advantages that in the long run outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports—the British could capture any port but that did not give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.

Motivation was a major asset. The Patriots wanted to win; over 200,000 fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German mercenaries to do much of their fighting.

At the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bennington">Battle of Bennington</a>, the <a href="Battles%20of%20Saratoga">Battles of Saratoga</a> and even defeats such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">Battle of Germantown</a> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.

The new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by its senior officers; officers such as <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, <a href="Horatio%20Gates">Horatio Gates</a>, <a href="Charles%20Lee%20%28general%29">Charles Lee</a>, <a href="Richard%20Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a> and <a href="Francis%20Marion">Francis Marion</a> all had military experience with the British Army during the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Steuben">Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben</a>, a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the <a href="Revolutionary%20War%20Drill%20Manual">Revolutionary War Drill Manual</a>. When the Army emerged from Valley Forge, it proved its ability to equally match the British troops in battle when they fought a successful strategic action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monmouth">Battle of Monmouth</a>.
When the war began, the 13 colonies lacked a professional army or navy. Each colony sponsored local <a href="militia">militia</a>. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the <a href="Battles%20of%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">battles</a> of <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Concord</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Bennington">Bennington</a> and <a href="Saratoga%20campaign">Saratoga</a>, and the <a href="siege%20of%20Boston">siege of Boston</a>. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when <a href="British%20Regulars">British regulars</a> were not in the area.

Seeking to coordinate military efforts, the <a href="First%20Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.

Three current branches of the <a href="United%20States%20Military">United States Military</a> trace their institutional roots to the American Revolutionary War; the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> comes from the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>, formed by a resolution of the Continental Congress on June 14, 1775. The <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> recognizes October 13, 1775 as the date of its official establishment, the passage of the resolution of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia that created the <a href="Continental%20Navy">Continental Navy</a>. And the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> traces its institutional roots to the <a href="Continental%20Marines">Continental Marines</a> of the war, formed by a resolution of the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775, a date regarded and celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. At the beginning of 1776, Washington's army had 20,000 men, with two-thirds enlisted in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias. At the end of the American Revolution in 1783, both the <a href="Continental%20Navy">Continental Navy</a> and Continental Marines were disbanded. About 250,000 men served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, but there were never more than 90,000 men under arms at one time. About 55,000 American sailors served aboard privateers during the war. The American privateers had almost 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships. <a href="John%20Paul%20Jones">John Paul Jones</a> became the first great American naval hero, capturing <a href="HMS%20Drake%20%281777%29">HMS "Drake"</a> on April 24, 1778, the first victory for any American military vessel in British waters.

Armies were small by European standards of the era, largely attributable to limitations such as lack of powder and other logistical capabilities on the American side. It was also difficult for Great Britain to transport troops across the Atlantic and they depended on local supplies that the Patriots tried to cut off. By comparison, Duffy notes that <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a> usually commanded from 23,000 to 50,000 in battle. Both figures pale in comparison to the armies that were fielded in the early 19th century, where troop formations approached or exceeded 100,000 men.

<a href="African%20Americans%20in%20the%20Revolutionary%20War">African Americans</a>—slave and free—served on both sides during the war. The British recruited slaves belonging to <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriot</a> masters and promised freedom to those who served by act of Lord <a href="Dunmore%27s%20Proclamation">Dunmore's Proclamation</a>. Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> and <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from <a href="Saint-Domingue">Saint-Domingue</a> with French colonial forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.

Tens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war. This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves belonging to Loyalists. Altogether, the British evacuated nearly 20,000 blacks at the end of the war. More than 3,000 of them were freedmen and most of these were resettled in Nova Scotia; other blacks were sold in the West Indies.

Most <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indians</a> east of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> were affected by the war, and many tribes were divided over the question of how to respond to the conflict. A few tribes were on friendly terms with the other Americans, but most Indians opposed the union of the Colonies as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men. The powerful <a href="Iroquois%20Confederacy">Iroquois Confederacy</a> was shattered as a result of the conflict, although they did not take sides; the <a href="Seneca%20nation">Seneca</a>, <a href="Onondaga%20%28tribe%29">Onondaga</a>, and <a href="Cayuga%20nation">Cayuga</a> nations sided with the British. Members of the <a href="Mohawk%20nation">Mohawk nation</a> fought on both sides. Many <a href="Tuscarora%20%28tribe%29">Tuscarora</a> and <a href="Oneida%20tribe">Oneida</a> sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the <a href="Sullivan%20Expedition">Sullivan Expedition</a> on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British. Mohawk leaders <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Cook">Joseph Louis Cook</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Brant">Joseph Brant</a> sided with the Americans and the British respectively, and this further exacerbated the split.
Early in July 1776, a major action occurred in the fledgling conflict when the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> allies of Britain attacked the <a href="Washington%20District%2C%20North%20Carolina">western frontier areas</a> of <a href="North%20Carolina%20Colony">North Carolina</a>. Their defeat resulted in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people, and was directly responsible for the rise of the <a href="Chickamauga%20Cherokee">Chickamauga Cherokee</a>, bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a <a href="Cherokee%E2%80%93American%20wars">frontier war</a> for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.

<a href="Muscogee%20people">Creek</a> and <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a> allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, a force of 800 Creeks destroyed American settlements along the <a href="Broad%20River%20%28Georgia%29">Broad River</a> in Georgia. Creek warriors also joined <a href="Thomas%20Brown%20%28loyalist%29">Thomas Brown's</a> raids into South Carolina and assisted Britain during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Savannah">Siege of Savannah</a>. Many Indians were involved in the fighting between Britain and Spain on the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Gulf Coast</a> and up the Mississippi River—mostly on the British side. Thousands of Creeks, <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>s, and <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>s fought in major battles such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Charlotte">Battle of Fort Charlotte</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mobile%20%281781%29">Battle of Mobile</a>, and the <a href="Siege%20of%20Pensacola">Siege of Pensacola</a>.

Pybus (2005) estimates that about 20,000 slaves defected to or were captured by the British, of whom about 8,000 died from disease or wounds or were recaptured by the Patriots. The British took some 12,000 at the end of the war; of these 8000 remained in slavery. Including those who left during the war, a total of about 8000 to 10,000 slaves gained freedom. About 4000 freed slaves went to Nova Scotia and 1200 blacks remained slaves.

Baller (2006) examines family dynamics and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored <a href="egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a>.

McDonnell (2006) shows a grave complication in Virginia's mobilization of troops was the conflicting interests of distinct social classes, which tended to undercut a unified commitment to the Patriot cause. The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, <a href="Plain%20Folk%20of%20the%20Old%20South">the middling yeomen</a> (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.

These are some of the standard works about the war in general that are not listed above; books about specific campaigns, battles, units, and individuals can be found in those articles.

Ampere

The ampere (symbol: A), often <a href="Clipping%20%28morphology%29">shortened</a> to "amp", is the <a href="SI%20base%20unit">base unit</a> of <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a> in the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI). It is named after <a href="Andr%C3%A9-Marie%20Amp%C3%A8re">André-Marie Ampère</a> (1775–1836), French mathematician and physicist, considered the father of <a href="electrodynamics">electrodynamics</a>.

SI defines the ampere in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current. The earlier <a href="Centimetre%20gram%20second%20system%20of%20units%23Derivation%20of%20CGS%20units%20in%20electromagnetism">CGS measurement system</a> had two different definitions of current, one essentially the same as the SI's and the other using <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a> as the base unit, with the unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates. The ampere was then defined as one <a href="coulomb">coulomb</a> of charge per second. In SI, the unit of charge, the coulomb, is defined as the charge carried by one ampere during one second. 

In the future, the SI definition may shift back to charge as the base unit, with the coulomb defined in terms of the <a href="elementary%20charge">elementary charge</a> on electrons and protons (one coulomb equals the charge of roughly protons).

SI defines ampere as follows:

The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one <a href="metre">metre</a> apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to <a href="newton%20%28unit%29">newtons</a> per metre of length.
<a href="Amp%C3%A8re%27s%20force%20law">Ampère's force law</a> states that there is an attractive or repulsive force between two parallel wires carrying an electric current. This force is used in the formal definition of the ampere.

The SI unit of charge, the <a href="coulomb">coulomb</a>, "is the quantity of electricity carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere". Conversely, a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second:
In general, charge "Q" is determined by steady current "I" flowing for a time "t" as .

Constant, instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes (as in "the charging current is 1.2 A") and the charge accumulated, or passed through a circuit over a period of time is expressed in coulombs (as in "the <a href="battery%20%28electricity%29">battery</a> charge is "). The relation of the ampere (C/s) to the coulomb is the same as that of the <a href="watt">watt</a> (J/s) to the <a href="joule">joule</a>.

The ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the unit of <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a> in the <a href="centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second%20system%20of%20units">centimetre–gram–second system of units</a>. That unit, now known as the <a href="abampere">abampere</a>, was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two <a href="dyne">dyne</a>s per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart. The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the <a href="MKS%20system%20of%20units">MKSA</a> system would be conveniently sized.

The "international ampere" was an early realization of the ampere, defined as the current that would deposit of silver per second from a <a href="silver%20nitrate">silver nitrate</a> solution. Later, more accurate measurements revealed that this current is .

The standard ampere is most accurately realized using a <a href="watt%20balance">watt balance</a>, but is in practice maintained via <a href="Ohm%27s%20law">Ohm's law</a> from the units of <a href="electromotive%20force">electromotive force</a> and <a href="electrical%20resistance">resistance</a>, the <a href="volt">volt</a> and the <a href="ohm">ohm</a>, since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the <a href="Josephson%20junction">Josephson junction</a> and the <a href="quantum%20Hall%20effect">quantum Hall effect</a>, respectively.

At present, techniques to establish the realization of an ampere have a <a href="relative%20uncertainty">relative uncertainty</a> of approximately a few parts in 10, and involve realizations of the watt, the ohm and the volt.

Rather than a definition in terms of the force between two current-carrying wires, it has been proposed that the ampere should be defined in terms of the rate of flow of elementary charges. Since a <a href="coulomb">coulomb</a> is approximately equal to <a href="elementary%20charge">elementary charge</a>s (such as those carried by <a href="proton">proton</a>s, or the negative of those carried by <a href="electron">electron</a>s), one ampere is approximately equivalent to elementary charges moving past a boundary in one second. ( is the reciprocal of the value of the elementary charge in coulombs.) The proposed change would define 1 A as being the current in the direction of flow of a particular number of elementary charges per second. In 2005, the <a href="International%20Committee%20for%20Weights%20and%20Measures">International Committee for Weights and Measures</a> (CIPM) agreed to study the proposed change. The <a href="New%20SI%20definitions">new definition</a> was discussed at the 25th <a href="General%20Conference%20on%20Weights%20and%20Measures">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> (CGPM) in 2014 but for the time being was not adopted.

The current drawn by typical constant-voltage energy distribution systems is usually dictated by the power (<a href="watt">watt</a>) consumed by the system and the operating voltage. For this reason the examples given below are grouped by voltage level.



A typical motor vehicle has a 12 V battery. The various accessories that are powered by the battery might include:

Most Canada, Mexico and United States domestic power suppliers run at 120 V.

Household <a href="circuit%20breaker">circuit breaker</a>s typically provide a maximum of 15 A or 20 A of current to a given set of outlets.

Most European domestic power supplies run at 230 V, and most <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> domestic power supplies run at 240 V. For the same amount of power (in watts), the current drawn by a particular European or Commonwealth appliance (in Europe or a Commonwealth country) will be less than for an equivalent North American appliance. Typical circuit breakers will provide 16 A.

The current drawn by a number of typical appliances are:

Algorithm

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, an algorithm ( ) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform <a href="calculation">calculation</a>, <a href="data%20processing">data processing</a> and <a href="automated%20reasoning">automated reasoning</a> tasks.

An algorithm is an <a href="effective%20method">effective method</a> that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a <a href="Function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a>. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps <a href="Empty%20string">empty</a>), the instructions describe a <a href="computation">computation</a> that, when <a href="Execution%20%28computing%29">executed</a>, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily <a href="deterministic">deterministic</a>; some algorithms, known as <a href="randomized%20algorithms">randomized algorithms</a>, incorporate random input.

The concept of "algorithm" has existed for centuries; however, a partial formalization of what would become the modern "algorithm" began with attempts to solve the <a href="Entscheidungsproblem">Entscheidungsproblem</a> (the "decision problem") posed by <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define "<a href="effective%20calculability">effective calculability</a>" or "effective method"; those formalizations included the <a href="Kurt%20G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a>–<a href="Jacques%20Herbrand">Herbrand</a>–<a href="Stephen%20Cole%20Kleene">Kleene</a> <a href="Recursion%20%28computer%20science%29">recursive functions</a> of 1930, 1934 and 1935, <a href="Alonzo%20Church">Alonzo Church</a>'s <a href="lambda%20calculus">lambda calculus</a> of 1936, <a href="Emil%20Post">Emil Post</a>'s "<a href="Formulation%201">Formulation 1</a>" of 1936, and <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>'s <a href="Turing%20machines">Turing machines</a> of 1936–7 and 1939. Giving a formal definition of algorithms, corresponding to the intuitive notion, remains a challenging problem.

Etymologically, the word 'algorithm' is a combination of the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "algorismus", named after <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Musa%20al-Khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</a>, a 9th-century Persian mathematician, and the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word "arithmos", i.e. αριθμός, meaning "number". In <a href="English%20language">English</a>, it was first used in about 1230 and then by <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Chaucer</a> in 1391. English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that "algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.

Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled "Carmen de Algorismo" composed by <a href="Alexander%20of%20Villedieu">Alexandre de Villedieu</a>. It begins thus:
which translates as:
The poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals.

An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations." which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations. Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.

A prototypical example of an algorithm is the <a href="Euclidean%20algorithm">Euclidean algorithm</a> to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the <a href="flow%20chart">flow chart</a> above and as an example in a later section.

No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give "explicit instructions for determining the nth member of the set", for arbitrary finite "n". Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which "they could be followed by a computing machine", or by a "human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols."

An "enumerably infinite set" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from an "arbitrary" "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as "y = m + n" – two arbitrary "input variables" "m" and "n" that produce an output "y". But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):

The concept of "algorithm" is also used to define the notion of <a href="decidability%20%28logic%29">decidability</a>. That notion is central for explaining how <a href="formal%20system">formal system</a>s come into being starting from a small set of <a href="axiom">axiom</a>s and rules. In <a href="logic">logic</a>, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of "algorithm" that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.

Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a <a href="Turing%20reduction">Turing-complete</a> system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):

Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an output device and stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a>s.

For some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).

Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting "from the top" and going "down to the bottom", an idea that is described more formally by "<a href="control%20flow">flow of control</a>".

So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of <a href="imperative%20programming">imperative programming</a>. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the <a href="assignment%20operation">assignment operation</a>, setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of "<a href="memory">memory</a>" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.

For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see <a href="functional%20programming">functional programming</a> and <a href="logic%20programming">logic programming</a>.

Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including <a href="natural%20language">natural language</a>s, <a href="pseudocode">pseudocode</a>, <a href="flowchart">flowchart</a>s, <a href="DRAKON">drakon-charts</a>, <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>s or <a href="control%20table">control table</a>s (processed by <a href="Interpreter%20%28computing%29">interpreters</a>). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, <a href="DRAKON">drakon-charts</a> and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.

There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a> program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at <a href="finite-state%20machine">finite-state machine</a>, <a href="state%20transition%20table">state transition table</a> and <a href="control%20table">control table</a>), as flowcharts and <a href="DRAKON">drakon-charts</a> (see more at <a href="state%20diagram">state diagram</a>), or as a form of rudimentary <a href="machine%20code">machine code</a> or <a href="assembly%20code">assembly code</a> called "sets of quadruples" (see more at <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a>).

Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:

For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see <a href="Algorithm%23Examples">Algorithm#Examples</a>.

Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as <a href="computer%20programs">computer programs</a>. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological <a href="neural%20network">neural network</a> (for example, the <a href="human%20brain">human brain</a> implementing <a href="arithmetic">arithmetic</a> or an insect looking for food), in an <a href="electrical%20circuit">electrical circuit</a>, or in a mechanical device.

In <a href="computer%20systems">computer systems</a>, an algorithm is basically an instance of <a href="logic">logic</a> written in software by software developers to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce "output" from given (perhaps null) "input". An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher <a href="time%20complexity">time complexity</a>) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.

""Elegant" (compact) programs, "good" (fast) programs ": The notion of "simplicity and elegance" appears informally in Knuth and precisely in Chaitin:

Chaitin prefaces his definition with: "I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'"—such a proof would solve the <a href="Halting%20problem">Halting problem</a> (ibid).

"Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm": For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that "It is . . . important to distinguish between the notion of "algorithm", i.e. procedure and the notion of "function computable by algorithm", i.e. mapping yielded by procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms".

Unfortunately there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.

"Computers (and computors), models of computation": A computer (or human "computor") is a restricted type of machine, a "discrete deterministic mechanical device" that blindly follows its instructions. Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable "locations", (ii) discrete, indistinguishable "counters" (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are "effective" relative to the capability of the agent.

Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's "abacus" model in his "Very Simple Bases for <a href="Computability">Computability</a>". <a href="Minsky%20machine">Minsky's machine</a> proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three "assignment" (replacement, substitution) operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L ← L − 1). Rarely must a programmer write "code" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is <a href="Turing%20complete">Turing complete</a> with only four general "types" of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.

"Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language": Knuth advises the reader that "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example". But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can "effectively" execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.

This means that the programmer must know a "language" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).

But what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes "even if we base <a href="Computational%20complexity%20theory">complexity theory</a> on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of "simulation" enters". When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a "<a href="modular%20arithmetic">modulus</a>" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's "decrement").

"Structured programming, canonical structures": Per the <a href="Church%E2%80%93Turing%20thesis">Church–Turing thesis</a>, any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be <a href="Turing%20complete">Turing complete</a>, and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while "undisciplined" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in "<a href="spaghetti%20code">spaghetti code</a>", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand "it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language". Tausworthe augments the three <a href="Structured%20program%20theorem">Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures</a>: SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE. An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to <a href="proof%20of%20correctness">proofs of correctness</a> using <a href="mathematical%20induction">mathematical induction</a>.

"Canonical flowchart symbols": The graphical aide called a <a href="flowchart">flowchart</a> offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The Böhm–Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can "nest" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols, and their use to build the canonical structures, are shown in the diagram.

One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description English prose, as:

"High-level description:"

"(Quasi-)formal description:"
Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in <a href="pseudocode">pseudocode</a> or <a href="pidgin%20code">pidgin code</a>:

<a href="Euclid">Euclid</a>'s algorithm to compute the <a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">greatest common divisor</a> (GCD) to two numbers appears as Proposition II in pageRank.Book VII ("Elementary Number Theory") of his "<a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Elements</a>". Euclid poses the problem thus: "Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure". He defines "A number [to be] a multitude composed of units": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero. To "measure" is to place a shorter measuring length "s" successively ("q" times) along longer length "l" until the remaining portion "r" is less than the shorter length "s". In modern words, remainder "r" = "l" − "q"×"s", "q" being the quotient, or remainder "r" is the "modulus", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.

For Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).

Euclid's original proof adds a third requirement: the two lengths must not be prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a <a href="reductio%20ad%20absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the "greatest". While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number "1" for their common measure. So, to be precise, the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.

Only a few instruction "types" are required to execute Euclid's algorithm—some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.

The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's four-step version of Euclid's and Nicomachus', but, rather than using division to find the remainder, it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length "s" from the remaining length "r" until "r" is less than "s". The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2–4:

INPUT:

E0: [Ensure "r" ≥ "s".]

E1: [Find remainder]: Until the remaining length "r" in R is less than the shorter length "s" in S, repeatedly subtract the measuring number "s" in S from the remaining length "r" in R.

E2: [Is the remainder zero?]: EITHER (i) the last measure was exact, the remainder in R is zero, and the program can halt, OR (ii) the algorithm must continue: the last measure left a remainder in R less than measuring number in S.

E3: [Interchange "s" and "r"]: The nut of Euclid's algorithm. Use remainder "r" to measure what was previously smaller number "s"; L serves as a temporary location.

OUTPUT:

DONE:

The following version of Euclid's algorithm requires only six core instructions to do what thirteen are required to do by "Inelegant"; worse, "Inelegant" requires more "types" of instructions. The flowchart of "Elegant" can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language, the steps are numbered, and the instruction is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←.

The following version can be used with Object Oriented languages:

"How "Elegant" works": In place of an outer "Euclid loop", "Elegant" shifts back and forth between two "co-loops", an A > B loop that computes A ← A − B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend − Subtrahend), the minuend can become "s" (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new "r" (the length to be measured); in other words the "sense" of the subtraction reverses.

Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually suffice to confirm core functionality. One source uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two <a href="relatively%20prime">relatively prime</a> numbers 14157 and 5950.

But exceptional cases must be identified and tested. Will "Inelegant" perform properly when R > S, S > R, R = S? Ditto for "Elegant": B > A, A > B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? ("Inelegant" computes forever in all cases; "Elegant" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if "negative" numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the <a href="domain%20%28mathematics%29">domain</a> of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that <a href="instance%20%28computer%20science%29">instantiates</a> it) is a <a href="partial%20function">partial function</a> rather than a <a href="total%20function">total function</a>. A notable failure due to exceptions is the <a href="Ariane%205%20Flight%20501">Ariane 5 Flight 501</a> rocket failure (June 4, 1996).

"Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction": Knuth demonstrates the application of <a href="mathematical%20induction">mathematical induction</a> to an "extended" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes "a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm". Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.

"Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed)": With only six core instructions, "Elegant" is the clear winner, compared to "Inelegant" at thirteen instructions. However, "Inelegant" is "faster" (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). <a href="Algorithm%20analysis">Algorithm analysis</a> indicates why this is the case: "Elegant" does "two" conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas "Inelegant" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, "on average" much time is wasted doing a "B = 0?" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.

"Can the algorithms be improved?": Once the programmer judges a program "fit" and "effective"—that is, it computes the function intended by its author—then the question becomes, can it be improved?

The compactness of "Inelegant" can be improved by the elimination of five steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm; rather, it can only be done <a href="heuristic">heuristic</a>ally; i.e., by exhaustive search (examples to be found at <a href="Busy%20beaver">Busy beaver</a>), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of <a href="inductive%20reasoning">inductive reasoning</a>, etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with "Elegant" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it "more elegant" than "Elegant", at nine steps.

The speed of "Elegant" can be improved by moving the "B=0?" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now "Elegant" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B and R, S would require a detailed analysis.

It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the <a href="analysis%20of%20algorithms">analysis of algorithms</a> to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O("n"), using the <a href="big%20O%20notation">big O notation</a> with "n" as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of "O(1)", if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O("n") if it is counted.

Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or '<a href="algorithmic%20efficiency">effort</a>' than others. For example, a <a href="binary%20search">binary search</a> algorithm (with cost O(log n) ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O(n) ) when used for <a href="lookup%20table">table lookups</a> on sorted lists or arrays.

The <a href="analysis%20of%20algorithms">analysis and study of algorithms</a> is a discipline of <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a> or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually <a href="pseudocode">pseudocode</a> is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware / software platforms and their <a href="algorithmic%20efficiency">algorithmic efficiency</a> is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a "one off" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.

Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. <a href="Benchmark%20%28computing%29">Benchmarks</a> may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.

To illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to <a href="Fast%20Fourier%20transform">FFT</a> algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging. In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications. Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.

There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.

One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.


Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories include many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:


For <a href="optimization%20problem">optimization problem</a>s there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:


Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are <a href="search%20algorithm">search algorithm</a>s, <a href="sorting%20algorithm">sorting algorithm</a>s, <a href="merge%20algorithm">merge algorithm</a>s, <a href="numerical%20analysis">numerical algorithms</a>, <a href="graph%20theory">graph algorithms</a>, <a href="string%20algorithms">string algorithms</a>, <a href="computational%20geometry">computational geometric algorithms</a>, <a href="combinatorial">combinatorial algorithms</a>, <a href="medical%20algorithm">medical algorithm</a>s, <a href="machine%20learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="cryptography">cryptography</a>, <a href="data%20compression">data compression</a> algorithms and <a href="parsing">parsing techniques</a>.

Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry, but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.

Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:


Some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.

The adjective "continuous" when applied to the word "algorithm" can mean:

Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute "processes" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in <a href="Gottschalk%20v.%20Benson">Gottschalk v. Benson</a>). However, practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in <a href="Diamond%20v.%20Diehr">Diamond v. Diehr</a>, the application of a simple <a href="feedback">feedback</a> algorithm to aid in the curing of <a href="synthetic%20rubber">synthetic rubber</a> was deemed patentable. The <a href="Software%20patent%20debate">patenting of software</a> is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially <a href="data%20compression">data compression</a> algorithms, such as <a href="Unisys">Unisys</a>' <a href="Graphics%20Interchange%20Format%23Unisys%20and%20LZW%20patent%20enforcement">LZW patent</a>.

Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see <a href="export%20of%20cryptography">export of cryptography</a>).

Researcher, <a href="Andrew%20Tutt">Andrew Tutt</a>, argues that algorithms should be overseen by a specialist regulatory agency, similar to FDA. His academic work emphasizes that the rise of increasingly complex algorithms calls for the need to think about the effects of algorithms today. Due to the nature and complexity of algorithms, it will prove to be difficult to hold algorithms accountable under criminal law. Tutt recognizes that while some algorithms will be beneficial to help meet technological demand, others should not be used or sold if they fail to meet safety requirements. Thus, for Tutt, algorithms will require "closer forms of federal uniformity, expert judgment, political independence, and pre-market review to prevent the introduction of unacceptably dangerous algorithms into the market".

The words 'algorithm' and '<a href="algorism">algorism</a>' come from the name al-Khwārizmī. <a href="Al-Khw%C4%81rizm%C4%AB">Al-Khwārizmī</a> (, c. 780–850) was a <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> mathematician, <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a>, <a href="geographer">geographer</a>, and scholar in the <a href="House%20of%20Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a> in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, whose name means 'the native of <a href="Khwarezm">Khwarezm</a>', a region that was part of <a href="Greater%20Iran">Greater Iran</a> and is now in <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>. About 825, he wrote a treatise in the Arabic language, which was translated into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> in the 12th century under the title "Algoritmi de numero Indorum". This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name. Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through his other book, the <a href="Al-Jabr">Algebra</a>. In late medieval Latin, "algorismus", English '<a href="algorism">algorism</a>', the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system". In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός 'number' ("cf." 'arithmetic'), the Latin word was altered to "algorithmus", and the corresponding English term 'algorithm' is first attested in the 17th century; the modern sense was introduced in the 19th century.

Algorithms were used in ancient Greece. Two examples are the <a href="Sieve%20of%20Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>, which was described in <a href="Introduction%20to%20Arithmetic">Introduction to Arithmetic</a> by <a href="Nicomachus">Nicomachus</a>, and the <a href="Euclidean%20algorithm">Euclidean algorithm</a>, which was first described in <a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Euclid's Elements</a> (c. 300 BC). <a href="Babylonian%20astronomy">Babylonian clay tablets</a> describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.

Tally-marks: To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks, or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numerals</a> and the <a href="abacus">abacus</a> evolved (Dilson, p. 16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in <a href="unary%20numeral%20system">unary numeral system</a> arithmetic used in <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a> and <a href="Post%E2%80%93Turing%20machine">Post–Turing machine</a> computations.

The work of the ancient <a href="Greek%20mathematics">Greek geometers</a> (<a href="Euclidean%20algorithm">Euclidean algorithm</a>), the <a href="List%20of%20Indian%20mathematicians">Indian mathematician</a> <a href="Brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</a>, and the <a href="Islamic%20mathematics">Islamic mathematics</a> <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20M%C5%ABs%C4%81%20al-Khw%C4%81rizm%C4%AB">Al-Khwarizmi</a> (from whose name the terms "<a href="algorism">algorism</a>" and "algorithm" are derived), and Western European mathematicians culminated in <a href="Gottfried%20Leibniz">Leibniz</a>'s notion of the <a href="calculus%20ratiocinator">calculus ratiocinator</a> (ca 1680):
"The clock": Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven <a href="clock">clock</a> as "The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]", in particular the <a href="verge%20escapement">verge escapement</a> that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. "The accurate automatic machine" led immediately to "mechanical <a href="automata%20theory">automata</a>" beginning in the 13th century and finally to "computational machines"—the <a href="difference%20engine">difference engine</a> and <a href="analytical%20engine">analytical engine</a>s of <a href="Charles%20Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> and Countess <a href="Ada%20Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>, mid-19th century. Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer – Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a real <a href="Turing-complete">Turing-complete</a> computer instead of just a <a href="calculator">calculator</a> – and is sometimes called "history's first programmer" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.

"Logical machines 1870—<a href="Stanley%20Jevons">Stanley Jevons</a>' "logical abacus" and "logical machine"": The technical problem was to reduce <a href="Boolean%20equation">Boolean equation</a>s when presented in a form similar to what are now known as <a href="Karnaugh%20map">Karnaugh map</a>s. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple "abacus" of "slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically . . . More recently however I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a "Logical Machine"" His machine came equipped with "certain moveable wooden rods" and "at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] . . .". With this machine he could analyze a "<a href="syllogism">syllogism</a> or any other simple logical argument".

This machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society. Another logician <a href="John%20Venn">John Venn</a>, however, in his 1881 "Symbolic Logic", turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: "I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at <a href="Algorithm%20characterizations">Algorithm characterizations</a>. But not to be outdone he too presented "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's "abacus" ... [And] [a]gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine".

"Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony—the electromechanical relay": Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the <a href="Jacquard%20loom">Jacquard loom</a> (1801), precursor to <a href="Hollerith%20cards">Hollerith cards</a> (punch cards, 1887), and "telephone switching technologies" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers. By the mid-19th century the <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a>, the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as "dots and dashes" a common sound. By the late 19th century the <a href="ticker%20tape">ticker tape</a> (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a> (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of <a href="Baudot%20code">Baudot code</a> on tape.

"Telephone-switching networks" of electromechanical <a href="relay">relay</a>s (invented 1835) was behind the work of <a href="George%20Stibitz">George Stibitz</a> (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the "burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. "He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device".

Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two "binary states" "open" and "closed"):

"Symbols and rules": In rapid succession the mathematics of <a href="George%20Boole">George Boole</a> (1847, 1854), <a href="Gottlob%20Frege">Gottlob Frege</a> (1879), and <a href="Giuseppe%20Peano">Giuseppe Peano</a> (1888–1889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's "The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method" (1888) was "the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language".

But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is "perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a " 'formula language', that is a "lingua characterica", a language written with special symbols, "for pure thought", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules". The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a> and <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> in their <a href="Principia%20Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a> (1910–1913).

"The paradoxes": At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular the <a href="Burali-Forti%20paradox">Burali-Forti paradox</a> (1897), the <a href="Russell%20paradox">Russell paradox</a> (1902–03), and the <a href="Richard%20Paradox">Richard Paradox</a>. The resultant considerations led to <a href="Kurt%20G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a>'s paper (1931)—he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of <a href="recursion">recursion</a> to numbers.

"Effective calculability": In an effort to solve the <a href="Entscheidungsproblem">Entscheidungsproblem</a> defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an "effective method" or "effective calculation" or "effective calculability" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: <a href="Alonzo%20Church">Alonzo Church</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Kleene">Stephen Kleene</a> and <a href="J.B.%20Rosser">J.B. Rosser</a>'s <a href="%CE%BB-calculus">λ-calculus</a> a finely honed definition of "general recursion" from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of <a href="Jacques%20Herbrand">Jacques Herbrand</a> (cf. Gödel's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene. Church's proof that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, <a href="Emil%20Post">Emil Post</a>'s definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction. Alan Turing's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his "a- [automatic-] machine"—in effect almost identical to Post's "formulation", <a href="J.%20Barkley%20Rosser">J. Barkley Rosser</a>'s definition of "effective method" in terms of "a machine". <a href="S.%20C.%20Kleene">S. C. Kleene</a>'s proposal of a precursor to "<a href="Church%20thesis">Church thesis</a>" that he called "Thesis I", and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis "Church's Thesis" and proposing "Turing's Thesis".

Here is a remarkable coincidence of two men not knowing each other but describing a process of men-as-computers working on computations—and they yield virtually identical definitions.

<a href="Emil%20Post">Emil Post</a> (1936) described the actions of a "computer" (human being) as follows:

His symbol space would be

<a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>'s work preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'". Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we might conjecture that all were influences.

Turing—his model of computation is now called a <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a>—begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and "states of mind". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.

Turing's reduction yields the following:
"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must therefore be taken to be one of the following:

A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:

"<a href="J.%20Barkley%20Rosser">J. Barkley Rosser</a>" defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):

Rosser's footnote No. 5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his "An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory" (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paper "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I" (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–37) in their mechanism-models of computation.

"<a href="Stephen%20C.%20Kleene">Stephen C. Kleene</a>" defined as his now-famous "Thesis I" known as the <a href="Church%E2%80%93Turing%20thesis">Church–Turing thesis</a>. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):

A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of "algorithm", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, <a href="foundations%20of%20mathematics">foundations of mathematics</a> (especially the <a href="Church%E2%80%93Turing%20thesis">Church–Turing thesis</a>) and <a href="philosophy%20of%20mind">philosophy of mind</a> (especially arguments about <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>).

Annual plant

An annual plant is a plant that completes its life cycle, from <a href="germination">germination</a> to the production of seed, within one year, and then dies. Summer annuals germinate during spring or early summer and mature by autumn of the same year. Winter annuals germinate during the autumn and mature during the spring or summer of the following calendar year.

One seed-to-seed life cycle for an annual can occur in as little as a month in some species, though most last several months. <a href="Brassica%20rapa">Oilseed rapa</a> can go from seed-to-seed in about five weeks under a bank of <a href="fluorescent%20lamp">fluorescent lamp</a>s. This style of growing is often used in classrooms for education. Many desert annuals are <a href="therophyte">therophyte</a>s, because their seed-to-seed life cycle is only weeks and they spend most of the year as seeds to survive dry conditions.
In cultivation, many food plants are, or are grown as, annuals, including virtually all domesticated <a href="Cereal">grain</a>s. Some <a href="perennial%20plant">perennials</a> and <a href="biennial%20plant">biennials</a> are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience, particularly if they are not considered <a href="hardiness%20%28plants%29">cold hardy</a> for the local climate. <a href="Carrot">Carrot</a>, <a href="celery">celery</a> and <a href="parsley">parsley</a> are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their edible roots, petioles and leaves, respectively. <a href="Tomato">Tomato</a>, <a href="sweet%20potato">sweet potato</a> and <a href="bell%20pepper">bell pepper</a> are tender perennials usually grown as annuals. Ornamental perennials commonly grown as annuals are <a href="impatiens">impatiens</a>, <a href="begonia">wax begonia</a>, <a href="Antirrhinum">snapdragon</a>, "<a href="Pelargonium">Pelargonium</a>", <a href="coleus">coleus</a> and <a href="petunia">petunia</a>. Examples of true annuals include <a href="maize">corn</a>, <a href="wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="rice">rice</a>, <a href="lettuce">lettuce</a>, <a href="pea">pea</a>s, <a href="watermelon">watermelon</a>, <a href="bean">bean</a>s, <a href="zinnia">zinnia</a> and <a href="Tagetes">marigold</a>.

Summer annuals sprout, flower, produce seed, and die, during the warmer months of the year.

The lawn weed <a href="crabgrass">crabgrass</a> is a summer annual.

Winter annuals germinate in autumn or winter, live through the winter, then bloom in winter or spring.

The plants grow and bloom during the cool season when most other plants are dormant or other annuals are in seed form waiting for warmer weather to germinate. Winter annuals die after flowering and setting seed. The seeds germinate in the autumn or winter when the soil temperature is cool.

Winter annuals typically grow low to the ground, where they are usually sheltered from the coldest nights by snow cover, and make use of warm periods in winter for growth when the snow melts. Some common winter annuals include <a href="Lamium%20amplexicaule">henbit</a>, <a href="deadnettle">deadnettle</a>, <a href="chickweed">chickweed</a>, and <a href="winter%20cress">winter cress</a>.<a href="dandelion">dandelion</a>.

Winter annuals are important ecologically, as they provide vegetative cover that prevents soil erosion during winter and early spring when no other cover exists and they provide fresh vegetation for animals and birds that feed on them. Although they are often considered to be weeds in gardens, this viewpoint is not always necessary, as most of them die when the soil temperature warms up again in early to late spring when other plants are still dormant and have not yet leafed out.

Even though they do not compete directly with cultivated plants, sometimes winter annuals are considered a pest in commercial agriculture, because they can be hosts for insect pests or fungal diseases (ovary smut – Microbotryum sp) which attack crops being cultivated. Ironically, the property that they prevent the soil from drying out can also be problematic for commercial agriculture.

In 2008, it was discovered that the inactivation of only two genes in one species of annual plant leads to the conversion into a <a href="perennial%20plant">perennial plant</a>. Researchers deactivated the SOC1 and FUL genes in "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>", which control flowering time. This switch established <a href="phenotypes">phenotypes</a> common in perennial plants, such as wood formation.

Anthophyta

The anthophytes were thought to be a <a href="clade">clade</a> comprising plants bearing flower-like structures. The group contained the <a href="Flowering%20plant">angiosperms</a> - the extant flowering plants, such as <a href="Rosaceae">roses</a> and <a href="Poaceae">grasses</a> - as well as the <a href="Gnetales">Gnetales</a> and the extinct <a href="Bennettitales">Bennettitales</a>.

Detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic, with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel. This makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around .

Some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of fossils (<a href="Glossopteris">glossopterids</a>, "<a href="Pentoxylon">Pentoxylon</a>", <a href="Bennettitales">Bennettitales</a>, and "<a href="Caytonia">Caytonia</a>"), but not the Gnetales.

Mouthwash

Mouthwash, mouth rinse, oral rinse or mouth bath, is a liquid which is held in the mouth passively or swilled around the mouth by contraction of the perioral muscles and/or movement of the head, and may be <a href="gargling">gargled</a>, where the head is tilted back and the liquid bubbled at the back of the mouth.

Usually mouthwashes are <a href="antiseptic">antiseptic</a> solutions intended to reduce the microbial load in the oral cavity, although other mouthwashes might be given for other reasons such as for their <a href="analgesic">analgesic</a>, <a href="anti-inflammatory">anti-inflammatory</a> or <a href="anti-fungal%20medication">anti-fungal</a> action. Additionally, some rinses act as saliva substitutes to neutralize acid and keep the mouth moist in <a href="xerostomia">xerostomia</a> (dry mouth). Cosmetic mouthrinses temporarily control or reduce bad breath and leave the mouth with a pleasant taste.

Common use involves rinsing the mouth with about 20 <a href="milliliter">ml</a> (2/3 <a href="fluid%20ounce">fl oz</a>) of mouthwash. The wash is typically swished or gargled for about half a minute and then spat out. Most companies suggest not drinking water immediately after using mouthwash. In some brands, the <a href="expectorate">expectorate</a> is stained, so that one can see the bacteria and debris.

Gargling is where the head is tilted back, allowing the mouthwash to sit in the back of the mouth while exhaling, causing the liquid to bubble. Gargling is practiced in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> for perceived prevention of viral infection. One commonly used way is with <a href="infusion">infusion</a>s or <a href="tea">tea</a>. In some cultures, gargling is usually done in private, typically in a <a href="bathroom">bathroom</a> at a sink so the liquid can be rinsed away.

The most common use of mouthwash is commercial antiseptics, which are used at home as part of an <a href="oral%20hygiene">oral hygiene</a> routine. Examples of commercial mouthwashes companies include <a href="C%C4%93pacol">Cēpacol</a>, <a href="Colgate%20%28toothpaste%29">Colgate</a>, <a href="Corsodyl">Corsodyl</a>, <a href="Dentyl%20pH">Dentyl pH</a>, <a href="Listerine">Listerine</a>, , <a href="Oral-B">Oral-B</a>, <a href="Sarakan">Sarakan</a>, <a href="Scope%20%28mouthwash%29">Scope</a>, <a href="Tantum%20verde">Tantum verde</a>, and <a href="Biotene">Biotene</a>. Mouthwashes combine ingredients to treat a variety of oral conditions. Variations are common, and mouthwash has no standard formulation so its use and recommendation involves concerns about <a href="patient%20safety">patient safety</a>. Some manufacturers of mouthwash state that antiseptic and anti-plaque mouth rinse kill the <a href="Dental%20plaque">bacterial plaque</a> that causes <a href="Dental%20caries">cavities</a>, <a href="gingivitis">gingivitis</a>, and <a href="bad%20breath">bad breath</a>. It is, however, generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both <a href="toothbrush">brushing</a> and <a href="flossing">flossing</a>. The <a href="American%20Dental%20Association">American Dental Association</a> asserts that regular brushing and proper flossing are enough in most cases, in addition to regular dental check-ups, although they approve many mouthwashes.
For many patients, however, the mechanical methods could be tedious and time-consuming and additionally some local conditions may render them especially difficult. Chemotherapeutic agents, including mouthrinses, could have a key role as adjuncts to daily home care, preventing and controlling supragingival plaque, gingivitis and oral malodor.

Minor and transient side effects of mouthwashes are very common, such as <a href="Dysgeusia">taste disturbance</a>, tooth staining, <a href="xerostomia">sensation of a dry mouth</a>, etc. Alcohol-containing mouthwashes may make dry mouth and halitosis worse since it dries out the mouth. Soreness, ulceration and redness may sometimes occur (e.g. <a href="aphthous%20stomatitis">aphthous stomatitis</a>, <a href="allergic%20contact%20stomatitis">allergic contact stomatitis</a>) if the person is allergic or sensitive to mouthwash ingredients such as preservatives, coloring, flavors and fragrances. Such effects might be reduced or eliminated by diluting the mouthwash with water, using a different mouthwash (e.g. salt water), or foregoing mouthwash entirely.

Prescription mouthwashes are used prior to and after oral surgery procedures such as <a href="tooth%20extraction">tooth extraction</a> or to treat the pain associated with <a href="mucositis">mucositis</a> caused by <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a> or <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>. They are also prescribed for <a href="aphthous%20ulcer">aphthous ulcer</a>s, other <a href="oral%20ulcer">oral ulcer</a>s, and other mouth pain. Magic mouthwashes are prescription mouthwashes <a href="Compounding">compounded</a> in a <a href="pharmacy">pharmacy</a> from a list of ingredients specified by a doctor. Despite a lack of evidence that prescription mouthwashes are more effective in decreasing the pain of oral <a href="lesion">lesion</a>s, many patients and prescribers continue to use them. There has been only one <a href="Controlled%20experiment">controlled study</a> to evaluate the <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a> of magic mouthwash; it shows no difference in efficacy among the most common formulation and commercial mouthwashes such as <a href="chlorhexidine">chlorhexidine</a> or a <a href="Saline%20%28medicine%29">saline</a>/<a href="baking%20soda">baking soda</a> solution. Current guidelines suggest that saline solution is just as effective as magic mouthwash in pain relief or shortening of healing time of oral mucositis from cancer therapies.

The first known references to mouth rinsing is in <a href="Ayurveda">Ayurveda</a> and <a href="Chinese%20medicine">Chinese medicine</a>, about 2700 BC, for treatment of gingivitis. Later, in the <a href="ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> periods, mouth rinsing following mechanical cleansing became common among the upper classes, and <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> recommended a mixture of salt, <a href="alum">alum</a>, and vinegar. The Jewish <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>, dating back about 1,800 years, suggests a cure for gum ailments containing "dough water" and olive oil.

Before Europeans came to the Americas, Native North American and Mesoamerican cultures used mouthwashes, often made from plants such as "<a href="Coptis%20trifolia">Coptis trifolia</a>". Indeed, <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> dentistry was more advanced than European dentistry of the age. Peoples of the Americas used salt water mouthwashes for sore throats, and other mouthwashes for problems such as <a href="teething">teething</a> and mouth ulcers.

<a href="Anton%20van%20Leeuwenhoek">Anton van Leeuwenhoek</a>, the famous 17th century <a href="microscopist">microscopist</a>, discovered living organisms (living, because they were mobile) in deposits on the teeth (what we now call <a href="dental%20plaque">dental plaque</a>). He also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in Delft. He experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water. Next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a mouthwash containing vinegar or brandy and found that living organisms remained in the dental plaque. He concluded—correctly—that the mouthwash either did not reach, or was not present long enough, to kill the plaque organisms.
In 1892, German <a href="Richard%20Seifert%20%28inventor%29">Richard Seifert</a> invented mouthwash product <a href="Odol">Odol</a>, which was produced by company founder <a href="Karl%20August%20Lingner">Karl August Lingner</a> (1861–1916) in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>.

That remained the state of affairs until the late 1960s when Harald Loe (at the time a professor at the <a href="Aarhus%20University">Royal Dental College</a> in <a href="Aarhus">Aarhus</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>) demonstrated that a <a href="chlorhexidine">chlorhexidine</a> compound could prevent the build-up of dental plaque. The reason for chlorhexidine effectiveness is that it strongly adheres to surfaces in the mouth and thus remains present in effective concentrations for many hours.

Since then commercial interest in mouthwashes has been intense and several newer products claim effectiveness in reducing the build-up in dental plaque and the associated severity of gingivitis, in addition to fighting bad breath. Many of these solutions aim to control the Volatile Sulfur Compound (VSC)-creating anaerobic bacteria that live in the mouth and excrete substances that lead to bad breath and unpleasant mouth taste. For example, the number of mouthwash variants in the United States of America has grown from 15 (1970) to 66 (1998) to 113 (2012).

Research in the field of <a href="Microbiota%20%28microbiology%29">microbiota</a>s shows that only a limited set of microbes cause tooth decay, with most of the bacteria in the human mouth being harmless. Focused attention on cavity-causing bacteria such as "<a href="Streptococcus%20mutans">Streptococcus mutans</a>" has led research into new mouthwash treatments that prevent these bacteria from initially growing. While current mouthwash treatments must be used with a degree of frequency to prevent this bacteria from regrowing, future treatments could provide a viable long term solution.

Alcohol is added to mouthwash not to destroy bacteria but to act as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients such as menthol, eucalyptol and thymol which help to penetrate plaque. Sometimes a significant amount of <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a> (up to 27% vol) is added, as a carrier for the <a href="flavor">flavor</a>, to provide "bite". Because of the alcohol content, it is possible to fail a <a href="breathalyzer">breathalyzer</a> test after rinsing although breath alcohol levels return to normal after 10 minutes. In addition, alcohol is a <a href="astringent">drying agent</a>, which encourages bacterial activity in the mouth, releasing more malodorous volatile sulfur compounds. Therefore, alcohol-containing mouthwash may temporarily worsen halitosis in those who already have it, or indeed be the sole cause of halitosis in other individuals.

It is hypothesized that alcohol mouthwashes acts as a <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a> (cancer-inducing). Generally, there is no scientific consensus about this. One review stated:

The same researchers also state that the risk of acquiring oral cancer rises almost five times for users of alcohol-containing mouthwash who neither smoke nor drink (with a higher rate of increase for those who do). In addition, the authors highlight side effects from several mainstream mouthwashes that included <a href="dental%20erosion">dental erosion</a> and accidental poisoning of children. The review garnered media attention and conflicting opinions from other researchers. Yinka Ebo of <a href="Cancer%20Research%20UK">Cancer Research UK</a> disputed the findings, concluding that "there is still not enough evidence to suggest that using mouthwash that contains alcohol will increase the risk of mouth cancer". Studies conducted in 1985, 1995, 2003, and 2012 did not support an association between alcohol-containing mouth rinses and oral cancer. Andrew Penman, chief executive of <a href="The%20Cancer%20Council%20New%20South%20Wales">The Cancer Council New South Wales</a>, called for further research on the matter. In a March 2009 brief, the American Dental Association said "the available evidence does not support a connection between oral cancer and alcohol-containing mouthrinse". Many newer brands of mouthwash are alcohol free, not just in response to consumer concerns about oral cancer, but also to cater for religious groups who abstain from alcohol consumption.

In painful oral conditions such as <a href="aphthous%20stomatitis">aphthous stomatitis</a>, analgesic mouthrinses (e.g. <a href="benzydamine">benzydamine</a> mouthwash, or "Difflam") are sometimes used to ease pain, commonly used before meals to reduce discomfort while eating.

Acts as a buffer

<a href="Betamethasone">Betamethasone</a> is sometimes used as an anti-inflammatory, corticosteroid mouthwash. It may be used for severe inflammatory conditions of the oral mucosa such as the severe forms of aphthous stomatitis.

<a href="Cetylpyridinium%20chloride">Cetylpyridinium chloride</a> containing mouthwash (e.g. 0.05%) is used in some specialized mouthwashes for halitosis. Cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash has less anti-plaque effect than chlorhexidine and may cause staining of teeth, or sometimes an oral burning sensation or <a href="mouth%20ulcer">ulceration</a>.

<a href="Chlorhexidine%23Dental%20use">Chlorhexidine digluconate</a> is a chemical antiseptic and is used in a 0.12-0.2% solution as a mouthwash. It has significant anti-plaque action, but also some anti-fungal action. It is especially effective against <a href="Gram-negative%20bacteria">Gram-negative</a> <a href="Bacterial%20cellular%20morphologies%23Bacillus">rod</a>s. It is sometimes used as an adjunct to prevent dental caries and to treat periodontal disease, although it does not penetrate into periodontal pockets well. Chlorhexidine mouthwash alone is unable to prevent plaque, so it is not a substitute for regular toothbrushing and flossing. In the short term, if toothbrushing is impossible due to pain, as may occur in <a href="primary%20herpetic%20gingivostomatitis">primary herpetic gingivostomatitis</a>, chlorhexidine is used as temporary substitute for other oral hygiene measures. It is not suited for use in <a href="acute%20necrotizing%20ulcerative%20gingivitis">acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis</a> however. Rinsing with <a href="chlorhexidine">chlorhexidine</a> mouthwash before a tooth extraction reduces the risk of <a href="dry%20socket">dry socket</a>, a painful condition where the blood clot is lost from an extraction socket and bone is exposed to the oral cavity. Other uses of chlorhexidine mouthwash include prevention of oral candidiasis in <a href="Immunocompetence">immunocompromise</a>d persons, treatment of <a href="denture-related%20stomatitis">denture-related stomatitis</a>, and many other uses.

Chlorhexidine has good "substantivity" (the ability of a mouthwash to bind to hard and soft tissues in the mouth). However, chlorhexidine binds to <a href="tannin">tannin</a>s, meaning that prolonged use in persons who consume coffee, tea or red wine is associated with extrinsic staining (i.e. removable staining) of teeth. Chlorhexidine is rarely associated with other issues like overgrowth of enterobacteria in persons with <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a>, desquamation and irritation of oral mucosa, salivary gland pain and swelling, and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis.

<a href="Hexetidine">Hexetidine</a> also has anti-plaque, analgesic, astringent and anti-malodor properties but is considered as an inferior alternative to <a href="Chlorhexidine">Chlorhexidine</a>.

<a href="antihistamine">antihistamine</a>

In traditional <a href="Ayurvedic%20medicine">Ayurvedic medicine</a>, the use of oil mouthwashes is called "Kavala" ("oil swishing") or "Gandusha", and this practice has more recently been re-marketed by the <a href="complimentary%20and%20alternative%20medicine">complimentary and alternative medicine</a> industry as "<a href="oil%20pulling">oil pulling</a>". Its promoters claim it works by "pulling out" "toxins", which are known as <a href="ama%20%28ayurveda%29">ama</a> in Ayurvedic medicine, and thereby reducing <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>. Ayurvedic literature suggests oil pulling is capable of improving oral and systemic health, including a benefit in conditions such as <a href="headache">headache</a>s, <a href="migraine">migraine</a>s, <a href="diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes mellitus</a>, <a href="asthma">asthma</a>, and <a href="acne%20vulgaris">acne</a>, as well as <a href="Tooth%20whitening">whitening teeth</a>.

Oil pulling has received little study and there is little evidence to support claims made by the technique's advocates. When compared with chlorhexidine in one small study, it was found to be less effective at reducing oral bacterial load, otherwise the health claims of oil pulling have failed scientific verification or have not been investigated. There is a report of <a href="lipid%20pneumonia">lipid pneumonia</a> caused by accidental inhalation of the oil during oil pulling.

The mouth is rinsed with approximately one tablespoon of oil for 10–20 minutes then spat out. <a href="Sesame%20oil">Sesame oil</a>, <a href="coconut%20oil">coconut oil</a> and <a href="ghee">ghee</a> are traditionally used, but newer oils such as <a href="sunflower%20oil">sunflower oil</a> are also used.

<a href="Phenols">phenolic compounds</a> include <a href="essential%20oil">essential oil</a> constituents that have some antibacterial properties, like <a href="phenol">phenol</a>, <a href="thymol">thymol</a>, <a href="eugenol">eugenol</a>, <a href="eucalyptol">eucalyptol</a> or <a href="menthol">menthol</a>. 
<a href="Essential%20oil">Essential oil</a>s are oils which have been extracted from plants. Mouthwashes based on <a href="essential%20oil">essential oil</a>s could be more effective than traditional mouthcare - for <a href="Gingivitis%23Treatment">anti-gingival</a> treatments.

Anti-cavity mouth rinses use <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> to protect against <a href="tooth%20decay">tooth decay</a>. Most people using <a href="Fluoride%20therapy%23Toothpaste">fluoridated toothpastes</a> do not require fluoride-containing mouth rinses, rather fluoride mouthwashes are sometimes used in individuals who are at high risk of dental decay, due to <a href="Dental%20caries%23Other%20measures">dental caries</a> or people with <a href="xerostomia">xerostomia</a>.

<a href="Flavoring%20agent">Flavoring agent</a>s include sweeteners such as <a href="sorbitol">sorbitol</a>, <a href="sucralose">sucralose</a>, <a href="Saccharin">sodium saccharin</a>, and <a href="xylitol">xylitol</a>, which stimulate salivary function due to their sweetness and taste and helps restore the mouth to a neutral level of acidity.

Xylitol rinses double as a bacterial inhibitor and have been used as substitute for Alcohol to avoid dryness of mouth associated with Alcohol.

<a href="Hydrogen%20peroxide">Hydrogen peroxide</a> can be used as an oxidizing mouthwash (e.g. Peroxyl, 1.5%). It kills anaerobic bacteria, and also has a mechanical cleansing action when it froths as it comes into contact with debris in mouth. It is often used in the short term to treat <a href="acute%20necrotising%20ulcerative%20gingivitis">acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis</a>. Side effects with prolonged use might occur, including <a href="hypertrophy">hypertrophy</a> of the <a href="lingual%20papilla">lingual papilla</a>e.

<a href="Enzyme">Enzyme</a>s and proteins such as <a href="Lactoperoxidase%23Oral%20care">Lactoperoxidase</a>, <a href="Lysozyme">Lysozyme</a>, <a href="Lactoferrin">Lactoferrin</a> have been used in mouthrinses (e.g. <a href="Biotene%23Ingredients">Biotene</a>) to reduce oral bacteria and hence the acid produced by bacteria.

A 2005 study found that gargling three times a day with simple water or with a <a href="Povidone-iodine">Povidone-iodine</a> solution (although with less effectiveness) was effective in preventing <a href="upper%20respiratory%20infection">upper respiratory infection</a> and decreasing the severity of symptoms if contracted. A later study found that the same procedure did not prevent <a href="influenza">influenza</a>-like illnesses. Other sources attribute the benefit to a simple placebo effect.

<a href="Sanguinarine">Sanguinarine</a>-containing mouthwashes are marketed as anti-plaque and anti-malodor. It is a toxic alkaloid herbal extract, obtained from plants such as "<a href="Sanguinaria%20canadensis">Sanguinaria canadensis</a>" (Bloodroot), "<a href="Argemone%20mexicana">Argemone mexicana</a>" (Mexican Prickly Poppy) and others. However, its use is strongly associated with development of <a href="leukoplakia">leukoplakia</a> (a white patch in the mouth), usually in the buccal sulcus. This type of leukoplakia has been termed "sanguinaria-associated keratosis" and more than 80% of people with leukoplakia in the <a href="vestibule%20of%20the%20mouth">vestibule of the mouth</a> have used this substance. Upon stopping contact with the causative substance, the lesions may persist for years. Although this type of leukoplakia may show <a href="dysplasia">dysplasia</a>, the potential for <a href="malignancy">malignant</a> transformation is unknown. Ironically, elements within the complimentary and alternative medicine industry promote the use of sanguinaria as a therapy for cancer.

<a href="Sodium%20bicarbonate">Sodium bicarbonate</a> is sometimes combined with salt to make a simple homemade mouthwash, indicated for any of the reasons that a salt water mouthwash might be used. Pre-mixed mouthwashes of 1% sodium bicarbonate and 1.5% sodium chloride in <a href="aqueous%20solution">aqueous solution</a> are marketed, although pharmacists will easily be able to produce such a formulation from the base ingredients when required. Sodium bicarbonate mouthwash is sometimes used to remove viscous saliva and to aid visualization of the oral tissues during examination of the mouth.

Salt water mouth wash is made by dissolving 0.5–1 teaspoon of table salt into a cup of water, which is as hot as possible without causing discomfort in the mouth. Saline has a mechanical cleansing action and an antiseptic action as it is a <a href="hypertonic">hypertonic</a> solution in relation to bacteria, which undergo <a href="lysis">lysis</a>. The heat of the solution produces a therapeutic increase in blood flow (<a href="hyperemia">hyperemia</a>) to the surgical site, promoting healing. Hot salt water mouthwashes also encourage the draining of <a href="pus">pus</a> from <a href="dental%20abscess">dental abscess</a>es. Conversely, if heat is applied on the side of the face (e.g., hot water bottle) rather than inside the mouth, it may cause a dental abscess to drain extra-orally, which is later associated with an area of <a href="fibrosis">fibrosis</a> on the face (see <a href="cutaneous%20sinus%20of%20dental%20origin">cutaneous sinus of dental origin</a>). Gargling with salt water is said to reduce the symptoms of a sore throat.

Hot salt water mouth baths (or hot salt water mouth washes, sometimes abbreviated to "HSWMW") are also routinely used after oral surgery, to keep food debris out of healing wounds and to prevent infection. Some oral surgeons consider salt water mouthwashes the mainstay of wound cleanliness after surgery. In dental extractions, hot salt water mouthbaths should start about 24 hours after a dental extraction. The term "mouth bath" implies that the liquid is passively held in the mouth rather than vigorously swilled around, which could dislodge a blood clot. Once the blood clot has stabilized, the mouth wash can be used more vigorously. These mouthwashes tend to be advised about 6 times per day, especially after meals to remove food from the socket.

<a href="Sodium%20lauryl%20sulfate">Sodium lauryl sulfate</a> (SLS) is user as a foaming agent in many oral hygiene products including many mouthwashes. Some may suggest that it is probably advisable to use mouthwash at least an hour after brushing with toothpaste when the toothpaste contains SLS, since the anionic compounds in the SLS <a href="toothpaste">toothpaste</a> can deactivate cationic agents present in the mouthrinse. However, many of the popular mouthwashes also contain SLS as an ingredient (e.g., Listerine Total Care).

coating agent

<a href="Tetracycline">Tetracycline</a> is an antibiotic which may sometimes be used as a mouthwash in adults (it causes red staining of teeth in children). It is sometimes use for herpetiforme ulceration (an uncommon type of aphthous stomatitis), but prolonged use may lead to oral candidiasis as the fungal population of the mouth overgrows in the absence of enough competing bacteria. <a href="Erythromycin">Erythromycin</a> is similar.

4.8% <a href="tranexamic%20acid">tranexamic acid</a> solution is sometimes used as an <a href="antifibrinolytic">antifibrinolytic</a> mouthwash to prevent bleeding during and after oral surgery in persons with <a href="coagulopathy">coagulopathies</a> (clotting disorders) or who are taking <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a>s (blood thinners such as <a href="warfarin">warfarin</a>).

Triclosan is a non-ionic chlorinate bisphenol antiseptic found in some mouthwashes. When used in mouthwash (e.g. 0.03%), there is moderate substantivity, broad spectrum anti-bacterial action, some anti-fungal action and significant anti-plaque effect, especially when combined with <a href="copolymer">copolymer</a> or <a href="zinc%20citrate">zinc citrate</a>. Triclosan does not cause staining of the teeth. The safety of triclosan has been questioned.

<a href="Astringents">Astringents</a> like zinc chloride provide a pleasant-tasting sensation and shrink tissues. <a href="Zinc%23Topical%20use">Zinc</a> when used in combination with other anti-septic agents can limit the build-up of <a href="Calculus%20%28dental%29%23Prevention">tartar</a>

Alexander the Great

Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (, "<a href="Alexander">Aléxandros</a> ho Mégas" ), was a king ("<a href="basileus">basileus</a>") of the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek</a> kingdom of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedon</a> and a member of the <a href="Argead%20dynasty">Argead dynasty</a>. He was born in <a href="Pella">Pella</a> in 356 BC and succeeded his father <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II</a> to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented <a href="military%20campaign">military campaign</a> through Asia and northeast Africa, and he created one of the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20empires">largest empires</a> of the ancient world by the age of thirty, stretching from <a href="Greece">Greece</a> to northwestern <a href="India">India</a>. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.

During his youth, Alexander was tutored by <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> until age 16. After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the <a href="League%20of%20Corinth">generalship of Greece</a> and used this authority to launch his father's Panhellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of <a href="Persia">Persia</a>. In 334 BC, he invaded the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> (Persian Empire) and began a <a href="Wars%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">series of campaigns</a> that lasted ten years. Following the conquest of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Issus">Issus</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaugamela">Gaugamela</a>. He subsequently overthrew Persian King <a href="Darius%20III">Darius III</a> and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> to the <a href="Indus%20River">Indus River</a>.

He endeavored to reach the "ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea" and <a href="Indian%20campaign%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">invaded India</a> in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the <a href="Pauravas">Pauravas</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Hydaspes">Battle of the Hydaspes</a>. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops. Alexander died in <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabia</a>. In the years following his death, a <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Diadochi">series of civil wars</a> tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the <a href="Diadochi">Diadochi</a>, Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.

Alexander's legacy includes the <a href="cultural%20diffusion">cultural diffusion</a> and <a href="syncretism">syncretism</a> which his conquests engendered, such as <a href="Greco-Buddhism">Greco-Buddhism</a>. He founded some <a href="Alexandria%20%28disambiguation%29%23Other%20places%20founded%20or%20renamed%20Alexandria%20by%20Alexander%20the%20Great">twenty cities that bore his name</a>, most notably <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of <a href="Culture%20of%20Greece">Greek culture</a> in the east resulted in a new <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic civilization</a>, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of <a href="Cappadocian%20Greeks">Greek speakers in central</a> and <a href="Pontic%20Greeks">far eastern Anatolia</a> until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and <a href="Military%20academy">military academies</a> throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history.

Alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of <a href="Hekatombaion">Hekatombaion</a>, which probably corresponds to 20July 356 BC, although the exact date is disputed, in <a href="Pella">Pella</a>, the capital of the <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Kingdom of Macedon</a>. He was the son of the king of Macedon, <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II</a>, and his fourth wife, <a href="Olympias">Olympias</a>, the daughter of <a href="Neoptolemus%20I%20of%20Epirus">Neoptolemus I</a>, king of <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">Epirus</a>. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.
Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood. According to the ancient Greek biographer <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt that caused a flame to spread "far and wide" before dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a <a href="Seal%20%28emblem%29">seal</a> engraved with a lion's image. Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.

On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a <a href="siege">siege</a> on the city of <a href="Potidea">Potidea</a> on the peninsula of <a href="Chalcidice">Chalcidice</a>. That same day, Philip received news that his general <a href="Parmenion">Parmenion</a> had defeated the combined <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>n and <a href="Paeonian">Paeonian</a> armies, and that his horses had won at the <a href="Ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>. It was also said that on this day, the <a href="Temple%20of%20Artemis">Temple of Artemis</a> in <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, one of the <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">Seven Wonders of the World</a>, burnt down. This led <a href="Hegesias%20of%20Magnesia">Hegesias of Magnesia</a> to say that it had burnt down because <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his own instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.

In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, <a href="Lanike">Lanike</a>, sister of Alexander's future general <a href="Cleitus%20the%20Black">Cleitus the Black</a>. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict <a href="Leonidas%20of%20Epirus">Leonidas</a>, a relative of his mother, and by <a href="Lysimachus%20of%20Acarnania">Lysimachus of Acarnania</a>. Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the <a href="lyre">lyre</a>, ride, fight, and hunt.

When Alexander was ten years old, a trader from <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen <a href="Attic%20talent">talents</a>. The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip ordered it away. Alexander however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed. Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: "My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you", and bought the horse for him. Alexander named it <a href="Bucephalas">Bucephalas</a>, meaning "ox-head". Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as <a href="India">India</a>. When the animal died (because of old age, according to Plutarch, at age thirty), Alexander named a city after him, <a href="Alexandria%20Bucephalous">Bucephala</a>.

When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a <a href="tutor">tutor</a>, and considered such academics as <a href="Isocrates">Isocrates</a> and <a href="Speusippus">Speusippus</a>, the latter offering to resign to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at <a href="Mieza%2C%20Macedonia">Mieza</a> as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of <a href="Stageira">Stageira</a>, which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.

Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy</a>, <a href="Hephaistion">Hephaistion</a>, and <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a>. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, and in particular the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>"; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.

At age 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip waged war against <a href="Byzantium">Byzantion</a>, leaving Alexander in charge as <a href="regent">regent</a> and <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>. During Philip's absence, the <a href="Thracians">Thracian</a> <a href="Maedi">Maedi</a> revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly, driving them from their territory. He colonized it with Greeks, and founded a city named <a href="Alexandropolis%20Maedica">Alexandropolis</a>.

Upon Philip's return, he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. Campaigning against the Greek city of <a href="Perinthus">Perinthus</a>, Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of <a href="Amphissa%20%28city%29">Amphissa</a> began to work lands that were sacred to <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> near <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.

Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through <a href="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a>, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of <a href="Elatea">Elatea</a>, only a few days' march from both <a href="Athens">Athens</a> and <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>. The Athenians, led by <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favour, but Athens won the contest. Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of the <a href="Amphictyonic%20League">Amphictyonic League</a>), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.
As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near <a href="Chaeronea">Chaeronea</a>, <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>. During the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Chaeronea%20%28338%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BBC%29">Battle of Chaeronea</a>, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian <a href="hoplites">hoplites</a> to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.

After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, they were refused, but did not resort to war. At <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a>, Philip established a "Hellenic Alliance" (modelled on the old <a href="Second%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece%23Hellenic%20alliance">anti-Persian alliance</a> of the <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a>), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named "<a href="Hegemon">Hegemon</a>" (often translated as "Supreme Commander") of this league (known by modern scholars as the <a href="League%20of%20Corinth">League of Corinth</a>), and announced his plans to attack the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian Empire</a>.

When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married <a href="Cleopatra%20Eurydice%20of%20Macedon">Cleopatra Eurydice</a>, the niece of his general <a href="Attalus%20%28general%29">Attalus</a>. The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian. During the <a href="Banquet">wedding banquet</a>, a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.

Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Epirus">Alexander I of Epirus</a> in <a href="Dodona">Dodona</a>, capital of the <a href="Molossians">Molossians</a>. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, <a href="Demaratus%20%28hetairos%29">Demaratus</a>, who mediated between the two parties.

In the following year, the Persian <a href="satrap">satrap</a> (governor) of <a href="Caria">Caria</a>, <a href="Pixodarus%20of%20Caria">Pixodarus</a>, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, <a href="Philip%20Arrhidaeus">Philip Arrhidaeus</a>. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, <a href="Thessalus%20%28actor%29">Thessalus</a> of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, <a href="Harpalus">Harpalus</a>, <a href="Nearchus">Nearchus</a>, Ptolemy and <a href="Erigyius">Erigyius</a>, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.

In summer 336 BC, while at <a href="Vergina">Aegae</a> attending the wedding of his daughter <a href="Cleopatra%20of%20Macedon">Cleopatra</a> to Olympias's brother, <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Epirus">Alexander I of Epirus</a>, Philip was assassinated by the captain of his <a href="Somatophylax">bodyguards</a>, <a href="Pausanias%20of%20Orestis">Pausanias</a>. As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, <a href="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a> and <a href="Leonnatus">Leonnatus</a>. Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and <a href="Ancient%20Macedonian%20military">army</a> at the age of 20.

Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former <a href="Amyntas%20IV%20of%20Macedon">Amyntas IV</a>, executed. He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of <a href="Lyncestis">Lyncestis</a> killed, but spared a third, <a href="Alexander%20Lyncestes">Alexander Lyncestes</a>. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle.

Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive. Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.

News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> and <a href="Mount%20Ossa%20%28Greece%29">Mount Ossa</a>, and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>.

Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous <a href="Diogenes%20and%20Alexander">encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic</a> occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight. This reply apparently delighted Alexander, who is reported to have said "But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes." At Corinth, Alexander took the title of "Hegemon" ("leader") and, like Philip, was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.

Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a>, he travelled east into the country of the "Independent Thracians"; and at <a href="Haemus%20Mons">Mount Haemus</a>, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the <a href="Triballi">Triballi</a>, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a <a href="List%20of%20tributaries%20of%20the%20Danube">tributary of the Danube</a>). Alexander then marched for three days to the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, encountering the <a href="Getae">Getae</a> tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry <a href="skirmish">skirmish</a>.

News then reached Alexander that <a href="Cleitus%20%28Dardania%29">Cleitus</a>, King of Illyria, and <a href="King%20Glaukias">King Glaukias</a> of the <a href="Taulanti">Taulanti</a> were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.

While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace. Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving <a href="Antipater">Antipater</a> as regent.

Alexander's army crossed the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a> in 334 BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000, drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, <a href="Paionia">Paionia</a>, and <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>. He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.

After an initial victory against Persian forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Granicus">Battle of the Granicus</a>, Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of <a href="Sardis">Sardis</a>; he then proceeded along the <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>n coast, granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with Persian naval forces nearby. Further south, at <a href="Halicarnassus">Halicarnassus</a>, in <a href="Caria">Caria</a>, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale <a href="siege">siege</a>, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain <a href="Memnon%20of%20Rhodes">Memnon of Rhodes</a> and the Persian <a href="satrap">satrap</a> of Caria, <a href="Orontobates">Orontobates</a>, to withdraw by sea. Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the Hecatomnid dynasty, <a href="Ada%20of%20Caria">Ada</a>, who adopted Alexander.

From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a> and the <a href="Pamphylia">Pamphylia</a>n plain, asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At <a href="Termessos">Termessos</a>, Alexander humbled but did not storm the <a href="Pisidia">Pisidia</a>n city. At the ancient Phrygian capital of <a href="Gordium">Gordium</a>, Alexander "undid" the hitherto unsolvable <a href="Gordian%20Knot">Gordian Knot</a>, a feat said to await the future "king of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia</a>". According to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword.

In spring 333 BC, Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia. After a long pause due to illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' significantly larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother <a href="Sisygambis">Sisygambis</a>, and a fabulous treasure. He offered a <a href="peace%20treaty">peace treaty</a> that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 <a href="Attic%20talent">talents</a> for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.

Alexander proceeded to take possession of <a href="Ancient%20Syria">Syria</a>, and most of the coast of the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. In the following year, 332 BC, he was forced to attack <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a>, which he captured after a long and difficult <a href="Siege%20of%20Tyre%20%28332%20BC%29">siege</a>. The men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into <a href="slavery">slavery</a>.

When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> quickly capitulated. However, Alexander met with resistance at <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a>. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When "his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible… this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt". After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.

Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity <a href="Amun">Amun</a> at the <a href="Oracle">Oracle</a> of <a href="Siwa%20Oasis">Siwa Oasis</a> in the <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libyan</a> desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to <a href="Zeus-Ammon">Zeus-Ammon</a> as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity. During his stay in Egypt, he founded <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria-by-Egypt</a>, which would become the prosperous capital of the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a> after his death.

Leaving Egypt in 331 BC, Alexander marched eastward into <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (now northern <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>) and again defeated Darius, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaugamela">Battle of Gaugamela</a>. Darius once more fled the field, and Alexander chased him as far as <a href="Arbil">Arbela</a>. Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two. Darius fled over the mountains to <a href="Ecbatana">Ecbatana</a> (modern <a href="Hamedan">Hamedan</a>), while Alexander captured <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>.

From Babylon, Alexander went to <a href="Susa">Susa</a>, one of the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid</a> capitals, and captured its treasury. He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of <a href="Persepolis">Persepolis</a> via the Persian <a href="Royal%20Road">Royal Road</a>. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the <a href="Persian%20Gates">Persian Gates</a> (in the modern <a href="Zagros%20Mountains">Zagros Mountains</a>) which had been blocked by a Persian army under <a href="Ariobarzanes%20%28satrap%20of%20Persis%29">Ariobarzanes</a> and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.

On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days. Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months. During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of <a href="Xerxes%20I">Xerxes I</a> and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the <a href="Acropolis%20of%20Athens">Acropolis of Athens</a> during the <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars">Second Persian War</a> by Xerxes. Years later upon revisiting the city he had burnt, Alexander regretted the burning of Persepolis. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of Xerxes as if it were a live person:

Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by <a href="Bessus">Bessus</a>, his <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a>n satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla</a> campaign against Alexander. Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.

Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a> in Afghanistan, and <a href="Alexandria%20Eschate">Alexandria Eschate</a> ("The Furthest") in modern <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>. The campaign took Alexander through <a href="Media%20%28region%29">Media</a>, <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>, <a href="Aria%20%28satrapy%29">Aria</a> (West Afghanistan), <a href="Drangiana">Drangiana</a>, <a href="Arachosia">Arachosia</a> (South and Central Afghanistan), <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a> (North and Central Afghanistan), and <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>.

<a href="Spitamenes">Spitamenes</a>, who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, in 329 BC betrayed Bessus to <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy</a>, one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed. However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the <a href="Syr%20Darya">Jaxartes</a> dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jaxartes">Battle of Jaxartes</a> and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai. After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.

During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of "<a href="proskynesis">proskynesis</a>", either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of <a href="deities">deities</a> and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.

A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, <a href="Philotas">Philotas</a>, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus <a href="Parmenion">Parmenion</a>, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at <a href="Ecbatana">Ecbatana</a>, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, <a href="Cleitus%20the%20Black">Cleitus the Black</a>, during a violent drunken altercation at <a href="Maracanda">Maracanda</a> (modern day <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a> in <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.

Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal <a href="page%20%28servant%29">pages</a>. His official historian, <a href="Callisthenes">Callisthenes</a> of <a href="Olynthus">Olynthus</a>, was implicated in the plot, and in the "<a href="Anabasis%20of%20Alexander">Anabasis of Alexander</a>", <a href="Arrian">Arrian</a> states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the <a href="rack%20%28torture%29">rack</a> as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.

When Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general <a href="Antipater">Antipater</a>, an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip II's "Old Guard", in charge of Macedon. Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence. The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king <a href="Agis%20III">Agis III</a> in 331 BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in the <a href="battle%20of%20Megalopolis">battle of Megalopolis</a>. Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander, who chose to pardon them. There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and each complained to Alexander about the other.

In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the <a href="Third%20Macedonian%20War">Third Macedonian War</a> (171–168 BC).

After the death of <a href="Spitamenes">Spitamenes</a> and his marriage to Roxana (Raoxshna in <a href="Old%20Iranian">Old Iranian</a>) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>. He invited the <a href="tribal%20chief">chieftains</a> of the former satrapy of <a href="Gandhara">Gandhara</a> (a region presently straddling eastern <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and northern <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>), to come to him and submit to his authority. <a href="Omphis">Omphis</a> (Indian name <a href="Ambhi">Ambhi</a>), the ruler of <a href="Taxila">Taxila</a>, whose kingdom extended from the <a href="Indus">Indus</a> to the <a href="Jhelum%20River">Hydaspes (Jhelum)</a>, complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the <a href="Aspasioi">Aspasioi</a> and <a href="Assakenoi">Assakenoi</a> sections of the <a href="Kambojas">Kambojas</a> (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. <a href="Ambhi">Ambhi</a> hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of "Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted <a href="Hephaestion">Hephaestion</a> and <a href="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a> in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.

On the subsequent advance of the <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the <a href="battle%20of%20the%20Hydaspes%20River">battle of the Hydaspes River</a>. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of <a href="Philip%20%28son%20of%20Machatas%29">Philip</a>, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at <a href="Treaty%20of%20Triparadisus">Triparadisus</a>, 321 BC.

In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of <a href="Kunar%20Valley">Kunar</a> <a href="valley">valley</a>s, the Guraeans of the <a href="Panjkora">Guraeus</a> valley, and the Assakenoi of the <a href="Swat%20%28Pakistan%29">Swat</a> and <a href="Buner%20Valley">Buner</a> valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and <a href="Aornos">Aornos</a>.

The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to <a href="Quintus%20Curtius%20Rufus">Curtius</a>, "Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble." A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of <a href="Aornos">Aornos</a>. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

After Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against <a href="Porus">King Porus</a>, who ruled a region lying between the <a href="Hydaspes">Hydaspes</a> and the Acesines (<a href="Chenab">Chenab</a>), in what is now the <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab</a>, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Hydaspes">Battle of the Hydaspes</a> in 326 BC. Alexander was impressed by Porus' bravery, and made him an ally. He appointed Porus as satrap, and added to Porus' territory land that he did not previously own, towards the south-east, up to the Hyphasis (<a href="Beas">Beas</a>). Choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece. Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the <a href="Jhelum%20River">Hydaspes</a> river, naming one <a href="Alexandria%20Bucephalous">Bucephala</a>, in honour of his horse, who died around this time. The other was <a href="Nicaea%20%28Punjab%29">Nicaea</a> (Victory), thought to be located at the site of modern-day <a href="Mong%2C%20Punjab">Mong, Punjab</a>.

East of Porus' kingdom, near the <a href="Ganges%20River">Ganges River</a>, were the <a href="Nanda%20dynasty">Nanda Empire</a> of <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a> and further east the <a href="Gangaridai">Gangaridai Empire</a> (of the modern-day <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> region of the Indian subcontinent). Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the <a href="Beas%20River">Hyphasis River (Beas)</a>, refusing to march farther east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.
Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his general <a href="Coenus%20%28general%29">Coenus</a> pleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men, he said, "longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland". Alexander eventually agreed and turned south, marching along the <a href="Indus%20river">Indus</a>. Along the way his army conquered the <a href="Malhi">Malhi</a> (in modern-day <a href="Multan">Multan</a>) and other Indian tribes and Alexander sustained an injury during the siege.

Alexander sent much of his army to <a href="Kerman%20province">Carmania</a> (modern southern <a href="Iran">Iran</a>) with general <a href="Craterus">Craterus</a>, and commissioned a fleet to explore the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> shore under his admiral <a href="Nearchus">Nearchus</a>, while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the <a href="Gedrosia">Gedrosian Desert</a> and <a href="Makran">Makran</a>. Alexander reached Susa in 324 BC, but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.

Discovering that many of his <a href="satrap">satrap</a>s and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to <a href="Susa">Susa</a>. As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of <a href="Opis">Opis</a>. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.

After three days, unable to persuade his men to back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together. In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander <a href="Susa%20weddings">held a mass marriage</a> of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the <a href="tomb%20of%20Cyrus%20the%20Great">tomb of Cyrus the Great</a> in <a href="Pasargadae">Pasargadae</a> had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them. Alexander admired <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a>, from an early age reading Xenophon's "<a href="Cyropaedia">Cyropaedia</a>", which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect <a href="Aristobulus%20of%20Cassandreia">Aristobulus</a> to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus' tomb.

Afterwards, Alexander travelled to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure. There, his closest friend and possible lover, <a href="Hephaestion">Hephaestion</a>, died of illness or poisoning. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander, and he ordered the preparation of an expensive <a href="funeral%20pyre">funeral pyre</a> in Babylon, as well as a decree for public mourning. Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize them, as he died shortly thereafter.

On either 10 or 11 June 323 BC, Alexander died in the palace of <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a>, in <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, at age 32. There are two different versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s account is that roughly 14  days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral <a href="Nearchus">Nearchus</a>, and spent the night and next day drinking with <a href="Medius%20of%20Larissa">Medius of Larissa</a>. He developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus</a> recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. <a href="Arrian">Arrian</a> also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.

Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness. The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.

The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available. However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore ("<a href="Veratrum%20album">Veratrum album</a>"), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander. In a 2014 manuscript in the journal <a href="Clinical%20Toxicology">Clinical Toxicology</a>, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with "Veratrum album", and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the "<a href="Alexander%20Romance">Alexander Romance</a>". "Veratrum album" poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, "Veratrum album" offers the most plausible cause. Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-day <a href="Mavroneri">Mavroneri</a> in Arcadia, Greece) that contained <a href="calicheamicin">calicheamicin</a>, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.

Several <a href="natural%20causes">natural causes</a> (diseases) have been suggested, including <a href="malaria">malaria</a> and <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>. A 1998 article in the "<a href="New%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine">New England Journal of Medicine</a>" attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by <a href="bowel%20perforation">bowel perforation</a> and ascending <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a>. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) <a href="spondylitis">spondylitis</a> or <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including <a href="acute%20pancreatitis">acute pancreatitis</a> and <a href="West%20Nile%20virus">West Nile virus</a>. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after <a href="Hephaestion">Hephaestion</a>'s death may also have contributed to his declining health.

Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket. According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest "would be happy and unvanquishable forever". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a <a href="royal%20prerogative">royal prerogative</a>.

While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, <a href="Ptolemy%20II%20Philadelphus">Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a>, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least <a href="late%20Antiquity">late Antiquity</a>. <a href="Ptolemy%20IX%20Lathyros">Ptolemy IX Lathyros</a>, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an <a href="Kasta%20Tomb">enormous tomb</a> in northern Greece, at <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a>, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege.

<a href="Pompey">Pompey</a>, <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a> was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a> closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a>, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.

The so-called "<a href="Alexander%20Sarcophagus">Alexander Sarcophagus</a>", discovered near <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a> and now in the <a href="Istanbul%20Archaeology%20Museum">Istanbul Archaeology Museum</a>, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of <a href="Abdalonymus">Abdalonymus</a> (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the <a href="battle%20of%20Issus">battle of Issus</a> in 331. However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.

Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed. Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was "tôi kratistôi"—"to the strongest".

Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his <a href="Seal%20%28device%29">signet ring</a> to <a href="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a>, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.

Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, <a href="Craterus">Craterus</a>, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of <a href="Meleager%20%28general%29">Meleager</a>, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only.

Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the <a href="Partition%20of%20Babylon">Partition of Babylon</a> became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between "The Successors" ("Diadochi") ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic</a> Egypt, <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> Mesopotamia and Central Asia, <a href="Attalid%20dynasty">Attalid</a> Anatolia, and <a href="Antigonid%20dynasty">Antigonid</a> Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.

<a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus</a> stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death. Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant. Nevertheless, Perdiccas read Alexander's <a href="Will%20and%20testament">will</a> to his troops.

Alexander's will called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. It included:

Alexander earned the epithet "the Great" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander. He never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. This was due to use of terrain, <a href="phalanx">phalanx</a> and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops. The <a href="Macedonian%20phalanx">Macedonian phalanx</a>, armed with the <a href="sarissa">sarissa</a>, a spear long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces. Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army, which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle, in the manner of a Macedonian king.

In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about . By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persian's <a href="scimitars">scimitars</a> and <a href="javelins">javelins</a>. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.

At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.

When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a> and <a href="Sogdiana">Sogdiana</a>, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.

Greek biographer <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> (c. 45–120 AD) describes Alexander's appearance as:
Greek historian <a href="Arrian">Arrian</a> (Lucius Flavius Arrianus 'Xenophon' c. 86–160) described Alexander as:

The semi-legendary "<a href="Alexander%20Romance">Alexander Romance</a>" also suggests that Alexander suffered from <a href="heterochromia%20iridum">heterochromia iridum</a>: that one eye was dark and the other light.

British historian <a href="Peter%20Green%20%28historian%29">Peter Green</a> provided a description of Alexander's appearance, based on his review of statues and some ancient documents:
Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by <a href="Lysippos">Lysippos</a> that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image. Lysippos had often used the <a href="contrapposto">contrapposto</a> sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as <a href="Apoxyomenos">Apoxyomenos</a>, <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> and <a href="Eros">Eros</a>. Lysippos' sculpture, famous for its naturalism, as opposed to a stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.

Some of Alexander's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents. His mother had huge ambitions, and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire. Olympias' influence instilled a sense of destiny in him, and Plutarch tells us that his ambition "kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years". However, his father Philip was Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds. Alexander's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to out-do his father, illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle. While Alexander worried that his father would leave him "no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world", he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions.
According to Plutarch, among Alexander's traits were a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature, which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions. Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate. He had a calmer side—perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader. This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general. He had great self-restraint in "pleasures of the body", in contrast with his lack of <a href="self-control">self-control</a> with alcohol.

Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences. However, he had little interest in sports or the <a href="Ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic games</a> (unlike his father), seeking only the <a href="Homeric">Homeric</a> ideals of honour ("timê") and glory ("kudos"). He had great <a href="charisma">charisma</a> and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death – only Alexander had the ability to do so.

During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of <a href="megalomania">megalomania</a> and <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a>. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His <a href="delusions%20of%20grandeur">delusions of grandeur</a> are readily visible in his <a href="%23Will">will</a> and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having "boundless ambition", an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.

He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at <a href="Siwa%20Oasis">Siwa</a>. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably "<a href="proskynesis">proskynesis</a>", a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.

Alexander married three times: <a href="Roxana">Roxana</a>, daughter of the <a href="Sogdia">Sogdia</a>n nobleman <a href="Oxyartes">Oxyartes</a> of <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a>, out of love; and the Persian princesses <a href="Stateira%20II">Stateira II</a> and <a href="Parysatis%20II">Parysatis II</a>, the former a daughter of <a href="Darius%20III">Darius III</a> and latter a daughter of <a href="Artaxerxes%20III">Artaxerxes III</a>, for political reasons. He apparently had two sons, <a href="Alexander%20IV%20of%20Macedon">Alexander IV of Macedon</a> by Roxana and, possibly, <a href="Heracles%20of%20Macedon">Heracles of Macedon</a> from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.

Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard <a href="Hephaestion">Hephaestion</a>, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached <a href="mental%20health">mental state</a> during his final months.

Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to <a href="Troy">Troy</a> where "Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles." Noting that the word "<a href="eromenos">eromenos</a>" (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been <a href="bisexuality">bisexual</a>, which in his time was not controversial.

Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly, showing great self-control in "pleasures of the body". Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her. Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including <a href="Ada%20of%20Caria">Ada of Caria</a>, who adopted him, and even Darius' mother <a href="Sisygambis">Sisygambis</a>, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.

Alexander's legacy extended beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.

Alexander's most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At the time of his death, Alexander's empire covered some , and was the largest state of its time. Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200–300 years. The <a href="Hellenistic%20period%23The%20successors">successor states</a> that emerged were, at least initially, dominant forces, and these 300 years are often referred to as the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a>.
The eastern borders of Alexander's empire began to collapse even during his lifetime. However, the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history, the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Maurya Empire</a>. Taking advantage of this power vacuum, <a href="Chandragupta%20Maurya">Chandragupta Maurya</a> (referred to in Greek sources as "Sandrokottos"), of relatively humble origin, took control of the <a href="Punjab">Punjab</a>, and with that power base proceeded to conquer the <a href="Nanda%20Empire">Nanda Empire</a>.

Over the course of his conquests, Alexander founded some <a href="Alexandria%20%28disambiguation%29">twenty cities that bore his name</a>, most of them east of the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a>. The first, and greatest, was <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities. The cities' locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first, the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons. Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece. However, a century or so after Alexander's death, many of the Alexandrias were thriving, with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples.

"Hellenization" was coined by the German historian <a href="Johann%20Gustav%20Droysen">Johann Gustav Droysen</a> to denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and can be seen in the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> and <a href="Seleucia">Seleucia</a> (south of modern <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>). Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into <a href="Culture%20of%20Iran">Persian culture</a> and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.

The core of the Hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially <a href="Athenian">Athenian</a>. The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largely <a href="Attic%20Greek">Attic</a>-based "<a href="koine">koine</a>", or "common" Greek dialect. Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of Hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of <a href="modern%20Greek">modern Greek</a>. Furthermore, <a href="Urban%20planning">town planning</a>, education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic. Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century.
Some of the most pronounced effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-rising <a href="Greco-Bactrian%20Kingdom">Greco-Bactrian Kingdom</a> (250–125 BC) (in modern <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>) and the <a href="Indo-Greeks">Indo-Greek Kingdom</a> (180 BC – 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> culture. The resulting <a href="syncretism">syncretism</a> known as <a href="Greco-Buddhism">Greco-Buddhism</a> heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of <a href="Greco-Buddhist%20art">Greco-Buddhist art</a>. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, and the Mediterranean (<a href="Greco-Buddhist%20monasticism">Greco-Buddhist monasticism</a>). Some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Buddha</a> appeared at this time, perhaps modeled on Greek statues of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> in the Greco-Buddhist style. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the <a href="ancient%20Greek%20religion">ancient Greek religion</a>: the concept of <a href="Boddhisatvas">Boddhisatvas</a> is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some <a href="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> <a href="Offering%20%28Buddhism%29">ceremonial practices</a> (burning <a href="incense">incense</a>, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. One Greek king, <a href="Menander%20I">Menander I</a>, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in <a href="Buddhist%20texts">Buddhist literature</a> as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the <a href="Greco-Bactrian">Greco-Bactrian</a> city of <a href="Ai%20Khanoum">Ai Khanoum</a> in modern-day <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, while the Greek concept of a <a href="spherical%20earth">spherical earth</a> surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower. The <a href="Yavanajataka">Yavanajataka</a> (lit. Greek astronomical treatise) and <a href="Paulisa%20Siddhanta">Paulisa Siddhanta</a> texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy.

Following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the east, <a href="Hellenistic%20influence%20on%20Indian%20art">Hellenistic influence on Indian art</a> was far-ranging. In the area of <a href="architecture">architecture</a>, a few examples of the <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic order</a> can be found as far as <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> with the <a href="Jandial">Jandial temple</a> near <a href="Taxila">Taxila</a>. Several examples of <a href="capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> displaying Ionic influences can be seen as far as <a href="Patna">Patna</a>, especially with the <a href="Pataliputra%20capital">Pataliputra capital</a>, dated to the 3rd century BC. The <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian order</a> is also heavily represented in the <a href="Greco-Buddhist%20art">art of Gandhara</a>, especially through <a href="Indo-Corinthian%20capital">Indo-Corinthian capital</a>s.

Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans, especially generals, who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements. <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> began his "<a href="The%20Histories%20%28Polybius%29">Histories</a>" by reminding Romans of Alexander's achievements, and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model. <a href="Pompey%20the%20Great">Pompey the Great</a> adopted the epithet "Magnus" and even Alexander's anastole-type haircut, and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which he then wore as a sign of greatness. <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> dedicated a <a href="Lysippus">Lysippean</a> <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian</a> <a href="bronze">bronze</a> statue but replaced Alexander's head with his own, while <a href="Octavian">Octavian</a> visited Alexander's tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a> to Alexander's profile. The emperor <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> also admired Alexander, as did <a href="Nero">Nero</a> and <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a>. The Macriani, a Roman family that in the person of <a href="Macrinus">Macrinus</a> briefly ascended to the imperial throne, kept images of Alexander on their persons, either on jewelry, or embroidered into their clothes.

On the other hand, some Roman writers, particularly Republican figures, used Alexander as a cautionary tale of how <a href="autocratic">autocratic</a> tendencies can be kept in check by <a href="Roman%20republic">republican</a> values. Alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as "amicita" (friendship) and "clementia" (clemency), but also "iracundia" (anger) and "cupiditas gloriae" (over-desire for glory).

Legendary accounts surround the life of Alexander the Great, many deriving from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself. His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a> as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing shortly after Alexander's death, another participant, <a href="Onesicritus">Onesicritus</a>, invented a <a href="Courtship">tryst</a> between Alexander and <a href="Thalestris">Thalestris</a>, queen of the mythical <a href="Amazons">Amazons</a>. When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King <a href="Lysimachus">Lysimachus</a> reportedly quipped, "I wonder where I was at the time."

In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the "<a href="Alexander%20Romance">Alexander Romance</a>", later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as "Pseudo-Callisthenes". This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, containing many dubious stories, and was translated into numerous languages.

Alexander the Great's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures. Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day. The "Alexander Romance", in particular, has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures, from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek.

Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more so than any other ancient figure. The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek ("O Megalexandros") is a household name, and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the <a href="Karagiozis">Karagiozis</a> shadow play. One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary <a href="mermaid">mermaid</a> who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain "Is King Alexander alive?" The correct answer is "He is alive and well and rules the world!" causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm. Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea, all hands aboard.

In pre-Islamic <a href="Middle%20Persian%20language">Middle Persian</a> (<a href="Zoroastrian">Zoroastrian</a>) literature, Alexander is referred to by the epithet "gujastak", meaning "accursed", and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. In Sunni Islamic Persia, under the influence of the "<a href="Alexander%20Romance">Alexander Romance</a>" (in "<a href="Iskandarnamah">Iskandarnamah</a>"), a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges. <a href="Firdausi">Firdausi</a>'s "<a href="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</a>" ("The pageRank.Book of Kings") includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Persian <a href="shah">shah</a>s, a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the <a href="Fountain%20of%20Youth">Fountain of Youth</a>. Later Persian writers associate him with philosophy, portraying him at a symposium with figures such as <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, <a href="Plato">Plato</a> and Aristotle, in search of immortality.
The figure of <a href="Dhul-Qarnayn">Dhul-Qarnayn</a> (literally "the Two-Horned One") mentioned in the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> is believed by some scholars to represent Alexander, due to parallels with the "Alexander Romance". In this tradition, he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of <a href="Gog%20and%20Magog">Gog and Magog</a>. He then travelled the known world in search of the Water of Life and Immortality, eventually becoming a prophet.

The <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> version of the "Alexander Romance" portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to "the one true God". In Egypt, Alexander was portrayed as the son of <a href="Nectanebo%20II">Nectanebo II</a>, the last <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a> before the Persian conquest. His defeat of Darius was depicted as Egypt's salvation, "proving" Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian.

According to <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>, Alexander was shown the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Daniel">pageRank.Book of Daniel</a> when he entered Jerusalem, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. This is cited as a reason for sparing Jerusalem.

In <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> and <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>, the name "Sikandar", derived from Persian, denotes a rising young talent. In <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval Europe</a> he was made a member of the <a href="Nine%20Worthies">Nine Worthies</a>, a group of heroes who encapsulated all the ideal qualities of <a href="chivalry">chivalry</a>.

Irish playwright <a href="Aubrey%20Thomas%20de%20Vere">Aubrey Thomas de Vere</a> wrote "<a href="Alexander%20the%20Great%2C%20a%20Dramatic%20Poem">Alexander the Great, a Dramatic Poem</a>".

Apart from a few inscriptions and fragments, texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and <a href="Nearchus">Nearchus</a>; <a href="Aristobulus%20of%20Cassandreia">Aristobulus</a>, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these <a href="primary%20source">original sources</a> have survived. The earliest of these is <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally <a href="Justin%20%28historian%29">Justin</a>, whose work dated as late as the 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.

Alfred Korzybski

Alfred Habdank Skarbek Korzybski (; July 3, 1879 – March 1, 1950) was a Polish-American independent scholar who developed a field called <a href="general%20semantics">general semantics</a>, which he viewed as both distinct from, and more encompassing than, the field of <a href="semantics">semantics</a>. He argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed, and thus no one can have direct access to reality, given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brain's responses to reality. His best known dictum is "<a href="Map%E2%80%93territory%20relation">The map is not the territory</a>".

Korzybski was born in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> which at that time was part of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. He was part of an <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocratic</a> Polish family whose members had worked as <a href="Mathematics">mathematicians</a>, <a href="Science">scientists</a>, and <a href="Engineering">engineers</a> for generations. He learned the <a href="Polish%20language">Polish language</a> at home and the <a href="Russian%20language">Russian language</a> in schools; and having a <a href="France">French</a> <a href="governess">governess</a> and a <a href="Germany">German</a> governess, he became fluent in these four languages as a child.

Korzybski was educated at the <a href="Warsaw%20University%20of%20Technology">Warsaw University of Technology</a> in engineering. During the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> Korzybski served as an <a href="Military%20intelligence">intelligence officer</a> in the <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n Army. After being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries, he moved to North America in 1916 (first to Canada, then the United States) to coordinate the shipment of <a href="artillery">artillery</a> to Russia. He also lectured to Polish-American audiences about the conflict, promoting the sale of <a href="war%20bonds">war bonds</a>. After the War, he decided to remain in the United States, becoming a <a href="Naturalization">naturalized citizen</a> in 1940. He met Mira Edgerly, a painter of portraits on ivory, shortly after the Armistice, and married her in January 1919. Their marriage lasted until his death.

His first book, "Manhood of Humanity", was published in 1921. In the book, he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind: mankind as a "<a href="General%20semantics%23The%20major%20premises">time-binding</a>" class of life (humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which are accreted in cultures).

Korzybski's work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named <a href="general%20semantics">general semantics</a> (GS). This should not be confused with <a href="semantics">semantics</a>. The basic principles of general semantics, which include time-binding, are described in the publication "Science and Sanity", published in 1933. In 1938 Korzybski founded the <a href="Institute%20of%20General%20Semantics">Institute of General Semantics</a> in Chicago. The post-World War II housing shortage in Chicago cost him the Institute's building lease, so in 1946, he moved the Institute to <a href="Lakeville%20%28Salisbury%2C%20Connecticut%29">Lakeville, Connecticut</a>, U.S., where he directed it until his death in 1950.

Korzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by (1) the structure of their nervous systems, and (2) the <a href="structure">structure</a> of their languages. Humans cannot experience the world directly, but only through their "abstractions" (nonverbal impressions or "gleanings" derived from the nervous system, and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language). These sometimes mislead us about what is the case. Our understanding sometimes lacks "similarity of structure" with what is actually happening.

He sought to train our awareness of abstracting, using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science. He called this awareness, this goal of his system, "consciousness of abstracting". His system included the promotion of attitudes such as "I don't know; let's see," in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science. Another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet, an experience he termed, "silence on the objective levels".

Many devotees and critics of Korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form "is" of the more general verb "to be." His system, however, is based primarily on such terminology as the different "orders of abstraction," and formulations such as "consciousness of abstracting." It is often said that Korzybski "opposed" the use of the verb "to be." This is a profound exaggeration (see "criticisms" below).

He thought that "certain uses" of the verb "to be", called the "is of identity" and the "is of <a href="E-Prime%23Different%20functions%20of%20%26quot%3Bto%20be%26quot%3B">predication</a>", were faulty in structure, e.g., a statement such as, "Elizabeth is a fool" (said of a person named "Elizabeth" who has done something that we regard as foolish). In Korzybski's system, one's assessment of Elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than Elizabeth herself. Korzybski's remedy was to "deny" identity; in this example, to be aware continually that "Elizabeth" is "not" what we "call" her. We find Elizabeth not in the verbal domain, the world of words, but the nonverbal domain (the two, he said, amount to different orders of abstraction). This was expressed by Korzybski's most famous premise, "<a href="Map-territory%20relation">the map is not the territory</a>". Note that this premise uses the phrase "is not", a form of "to be"; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon "to be" as such. In fact, he said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb "to be" when used as an <a href="E-prime%23The%20different%20functions%20of%20%27to%20be%27">auxiliary verb</a> or when used to state existence or location. It was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb "to be," as long as one was aware of their structural limitations.

One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. "Nice biscuit, don't you think," said Korzybski, while he took a second one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words "Dog Cookies." The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. "You see," Korzybski remarked, "I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter."

<a href="William%20Burroughs">William Burroughs</a> went to a Korzybski workshop in the Autumn of 1939. He was 25 years old, and paid $40. His fellow students—there were 38 in all—included young <a href="Samuel%20I.%20Hayakawa">Samuel I. Hayakawa</a> (later to become a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> member of the <a href="U.S.%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>), Ralph Moriarty deBit (later to become the spiritual teacher <a href="Vitvan">Vitvan</a>) and <a href="Wendell%20Johnson">Wendell Johnson</a> (founder of the <a href="Monster%20Study">Monster Study</a>).

Korzybski was well received in numerous disciplines, as evidenced by the positive reactions from leading figures in the sciences and humanities in the 1940s and 1950s.

As reported in the third edition of "Science and Sanity", in World War II the <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a> used Korzybski's system to treat <a href="Combat%20stress%20reaction">battle fatigue</a> in Europe, under the supervision of Dr. <a href="Douglas%20Kelley">Douglas M. Kelley</a>, who went on to become the psychiatrist in charge of recuperating the Jewish prisoners at <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg</a>.

Some of the General Semantics tradition was continued by <a href="Samuel%20I.%20Hayakawa">Samuel I. Hayakawa</a>.

Asteroids (video game)

Asteroids is an arcade space shooter released in November 1979 by <a href="Atari%2C%20Inc.">Atari, Inc.</a> and designed by <a href="Lyle%20Rains">Lyle Rains</a>, <a href="Ed%20Logg">Ed Logg</a>, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> field which is periodically traversed by <a href="flying%20saucer">flying saucer</a>s. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.

"Asteroids" was one of the first major hits of the <a href="Golden%20age%20of%20video%20arcade%20games">golden age of arcade games</a>. The game sold over 70,000 <a href="Video%20game%20arcade%20cabinet">arcade cabinets</a> and proved both popular with players and influential with developers. It has since been ported to multiple platforms. "Asteroids" was widely imitated and directly influenced "<a href="Defender%20%28video%20game%29">Defender</a>", "<a href="Gravitar">Gravitar</a>", and many other video games.

"Asteroids" was conceived during a meeting between Logg and Rains and used hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used for "<a href="Lunar%20Lander%20%28arcade%20game%29">Lunar Lander</a>". Based on an unfinished game titled "Cosmos" and inspired by "<a href="Spacewar%20%28video%20game%29">Spacewar!</a>", "<a href="Computer%20Space">Computer Space</a>", and "<a href="Space%20Invaders">Space Invaders</a>", "Asteroids" physics model, control scheme and gameplay theme were derived from these earlier games and refined through trial and error. The game is rendered on a <a href="vector%20display">vector display</a> in a two-dimensional view that wraps around in both screen axes.

The objective of "Asteroids" is to destroy asteroids and saucers. The player controls a triangular <a href="spacecraft">ship</a> that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into <a href="hyperspace%20%28science%20fiction%29">hyperspace</a>, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.

Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. Objects <a href="Wraparound%20%28video%20games%29">wrap around screen edges</a> – for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the "big saucer" shoots randomly and poorly, while the "small saucer" fires frequently at the ship. After reaching a score of 40,000, only the small saucer appears. As the player's score increases, the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately. Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers, a new set of large asteroids appears, thus starting the next level. The game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches a range between 40,000 and 60,000. The player starts with 3 lives after a coin is inserted and gains an extra life per 10,000 points. When the player loses all their lives, the game ends.

"Asteroids" contains several <a href="Software%20bug">bugs</a>. The game slows down as the player gains 50-100 lives, due to a programming error in that there is no limit for the permitted number of lives. The player can "lose" the game after more than 250 lives are collected.
"Asteroids" was conceived by Lyle Rains and programmed by Ed Logg with collaborations from other Atari staff. Logg was impressed with the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a> (then known as "Atari Video Computer System") and joined Atari's coin-op division and worked on "Dirt Bike", which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test. He developed "<a href="Super%20Breakout">Super Breakout</a>" after hearing that <a href="Nolan%20Bushnell">Nolan Bushnell</a>, founder of Atari, wanted "<a href="Breakout%20%28video%20game%29">Breakout</a>" updated. Paul Mancuso joined the development team as "Asteroids" technician and engineer Howard Delman contributed to the hardware. During a meeting in April 1979, Rains discussed "Planet Grab", a multiplayer arcade game later renamed to "Cosmos". Logg did not know the name of the game, thinking "Computer Space" as "the inspiration for the two-dimensional approach". Rains conceived of "Asteroids" as a mixture of "Computer Space" and "<a href="Space%20Invaders">Space Invaders</a>", combining the two-dimensional approach of "Computer Space" with "Space Invaders" addictive gameplay of "completion" and "eliminate all threats". The unfinished game featured a giant, indestructible asteroid, so Rains asked Logg: "Well, why don’t we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up?" In response, Logg described a similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces. Both agreed on the concept.

"Asteroids" was implemented on hardware developed by Delman and is a <a href="vector%20game">vector game</a>, in which the graphics are composed of lines drawn on a vector monitor. Rains initially wanted the game done in <a href="raster%20graphics">raster graphics</a>, but Logg, experienced in <a href="vector%20graphics">vector graphics</a>, suggested an XY monitor because the high image quality would permit precise aiming. The hardware is chiefly a <a href="MOS%206502">MOS 6502</a> executing the game program, and QuadraScan, a high-resolution vector graphics processor developed by Atari and referred to as an "XY display system" and the "Digital Vector Generator (DVG)".

The original design concepts for QuadraScan came out of Cyan Engineering, Atari's off-campus research lab in <a href="Grass%20Valley%2C%20California">Grass Valley, California</a>, in 1978. Cyan gave it to Delman, who finished the design and first used it for "Lunar Lander". Logg received Delman's modified board with five buttons, 13 sound effects, and additional RAM, and used it to develop "Asteroids". The size of the board was 4 by 4 inches, and it was "linked up" to a monitor.

Logg modeled the player's ship, the five-button control scheme, and the game physics after "Spacewar!", which he had played as a student at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, but made several changes to improve playability. The ship was programmed into the hardware and rendered by the monitor, and was configured to move with thrust and inertia. The hyperspace button was not placed near Logg's right thumb, which he was dissatisfied with, as he had a problem "tak[ing] his hand off the thrust button". Drawings of asteroids in various shapes were incorporated into the game. Logg copied the idea of a high score table with initials from Exidy's "<a href="Star%20Fire">Star Fire</a>".

The two saucers were formulated to be different from each other. A steadily decreasing timer that shortens intervals between saucer attacks was employed to keep the player from not shooting asteroids and saucers. The minimalist soundtrack features a "heartbeat" sound effect, which quickens as the game progresses. The game did not have a sound chip, so Delman created a hardware circuit for 13 sound effects by hand which was wired onto the board.

A prototype of "Asteroids" was well received by several Atari staff and engineers, who would "wander between labs, passing comment and 
stopping to play as they went". Logg was often asked when he would be leaving by employees eager to play the prototype, so he created a second prototype specifically for staff to play. Atari went to Sacramento, California for testing, setting up prototypes of the game in local arcades to measure its potential success. The company also observed veteran players and younger players during focus group sessions at Atari itself. A group of old players familiar with "Spacewar!" struggled to maintain grip on the thrust button and requested a joystick, whereas younger players accustomed to "<a href="Space%20Invaders">Space Invaders</a>" noted they get no break in the game. Logg and other Atari engineers observed proceedings and documented comments in four pages.
"Asteroids" was immediately successful upon release. It displaced "<a href="Space%20Invaders">Space Invaders</a>" by popularity in the United States and became Atari's best selling arcade game of all time, with over 70,000 units sold. Atari earned an estimated $150 million in sales from the game, and arcade operators earned a further $500 million from coin drops. Atari had been in the process of manufacturing another vector game, "Lunar Lander", but demand for "Asteroids" was so high "that several hundred "Asteroids" games were shipped in "Lunar Lander" cabinets". "Asteroids" was so popular that some <a href="video%20arcade">video arcade</a> operators had to install large boxes to hold the number of coins spent by players.

The saucer in the original game design was supposed to take a shot as soon as it appeared. This action was altered so there would be a delay before the saucer shoots, leading to "lurking" from players. Lurking is a strategy in which the player uses thrust to keep the ship in motion, leaves 1 or 2 asteroids undamaged, and hunts for saucers, allowing the player to pick off as many 1,000-point UFOs as possible and play indefinitely on a single credit. Since the saucer could only shoot directly at the player's position on the screen, the player could "hide" at the opposite end of the screen and shoot across the screen boundary, while remaining relatively safe. Complaints from operators losing revenue due to lurking led to the creation of an <a href="EPROM">EPROM</a> restricting such chances. Usage of the names of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" characters "Mr. Bill" and "Sluggo" to refer to the saucers in an "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>" article about the game led to Logg receiving a <a href="cease%20and%20desist">cease and desist</a> letter from a lawyer with the "Mr. Bill Trademark."

"Asteroids" received positive reviews from video game critics and has been regarded as Logg's magnum opus. Brett Alan Weiss, writing for <a href="Allgame">Allgame</a>, likened the monochrome vector graphics to minimalism and viewed its sound effects as memorable. Weiss found its overall design to be near-perfect and cites the intensity and controls as elements that make the game addicting. He admitted the game is easily understandable and "holds up extremely well over time". William Cassidy, writing for <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s "Classic Gaming", noticed its innovations, including being one of the first video games to track initials and allow players to enter their initials for appearing in the top 10 high scores, and commented, "the vector graphics fit the futuristic outer space theme very well." In 1996, "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" listed it as number 39 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", particularly lauding the control dynamics which require "the constant juggling of speed, positioning, and direction." "Asteroids" was ranked fourth on "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>"s list of "Top 25 Arcade Games"; the "Retro Gamer" staff cited its simplicity and the lack of a proper ending as allowances of revisiting the game. In 2012, "Asteroids" was listed on <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>'s All-TIME 100 greatest video games list. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" named "Asteroids" one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. It was added to the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>'s collection of video games. By contrast, in March 1983 the Atari 8-bit port won sixth place in "<a href="Softline%20%28magazine%29">Softline</a>"s Dog of the Year awards "for badness in computer games", Atari division, based on reader submissions.

The gameplay in "Asteroids" was imitated by many games that followed, mostly ""Asteroid" clones". By December 1981 "<a href="BYTE">BYTE</a>" observed that "If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then [Atari's Asteroids has] a lot to be proud of ... Its popularity has inspired numerous imitations", including eight for personal computers. The <a href="Mattel">Mattel</a> <a href="Intellivision">Intellivision</a> title "<a href="Astrosmash">Astrosmash</a>" was conceived as "Avalanche!" after "Meteor!" did not take up the cartridge's entire ROM space. "Meteor!", an "Asteroids" clone, was cancelled to avoid a lawsuit and "Avalanche!" was released as "Astrosmash". The resultant game borrows elements from "Asteroids" and "Space Invaders", both which also influenced "Defender" and "Gravitar", two popular and often cloned arcade games. <a href="Quality%20Software">Quality Software</a>'s "Asteroids in Space" (1980), another "Asteroids" clone, was one of the best selling games for the Apple II and was voted one of the most popular software titles of 1978-80 by "<a href="Softalk">Softalk</a>" magazine. Others include <a href="Acornsoft">Acornsoft</a>'s "Meteors", "Moons of Jupiter" for the <a href="Commodore%20VIC-20">Commodore VIC-20</a>, and "<a href="MineStorm">MineStorm</a>" for the <a href="Vectrex">Vectrex</a>.

Released in 1981, "<a href="Asteroids%20Deluxe">Asteroids Deluxe</a>" is the first sequel to "Asteroids". Dave Shepperd edited the code and made enhancements to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen objects were tinted blue, and hyperspace was replaced by a shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added "killer satellite" enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game is much harder than the original and does not allow saucers to be hunted—a common strategy for "Asteroids" high scores.

It was followed by Owen Rubin's "<a href="Space%20Duel">Space Duel</a>" in 1982, featuring colorful geometric shapes and co-op multiplayer gameplay.

In 1987's "<a href="Blasteroids">Blasteroids</a>", Ed Rotberg added "power-ups, ship morphing, branching levels, bosses, and the ability to dock your ships in multiplayer for added firepower". "Blasteroids" uses raster graphics instead of vectors.

"Asteroids" has been ported to multiple platforms, including much of Atari's hardware (<a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a> and <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">8-bit computers</a> in 1981, <a href="Atari%207800">Atari 7800</a> in 1987, <a href="Atari%20Lynx">Atari Lynx</a> in 1994) and many other platforms. Released in 1981, the 2600 port was the first game to use <a href="bank%20switching">bank switching</a>, a technique developed by Carl Nielsen's group of engineers that increased available ROM space from 4 KB to 8 KB. Brad Stewart, the programmer tasked to work on the port, used bank switching to complete the game. A port for the <a href="Atari%205200">Atari 5200</a>, identical to the Atari 8-bit computer version, was in development in 1982, but was not published.

The Atari 7800 version was a launch title and features co-operative play. The asteroids receive colorful textures, and the "heartbeat" sound effect remains intact. The game was included as part of the Atari Lynx title "<a href="Super%20Asteroids%20%26amp%3B%20Missile%20Command">Super Asteroids & Missile Command</a>", and featured in the original "<a href="Microsoft%20Arcade">Microsoft Arcade</a>" compilation in 1993, the latter with four other Atari video games: "<a href="Missile%20Command">Missile Command</a>", "Tempest", "<a href="Centipede%20%28video%20game%29">Centipede</a>", and "<a href="Battlezone%20%281980%20video%20game%29">Battlezone</a>".

<a href="Activision">Activision</a> made an enhanced version of "Asteroids" for <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>, <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Color">Game Boy Color</a> in 1998. Doug Perry, writing for entertainment and video game journalism website <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, praised the high-end graphics – with realistic space object models, backgrounds, and special effects – for making "Asteroids" "a pleasure to look at" while being a homage to the original arcade version. The <a href="Atari%20Flashback">Atari Flashback</a> series of dedicated video game consoles have included both the 2600 the arcade versions of "Asteroids".

Published by <a href="Crave%20Entertainment">Crave Entertainment</a> on December 14, 1999, "Asteroids Hyper 64" is the Nintendo 64 port of "Asteroids". The game's graphics were upgraded to 3D, with both the ship and asteroids receiving polygon models along static backgrounds, and it was supplemented with weapons and a multiplayer mode. IGN writer <a href="Matt%20Casamassina">Matt Casamassina</a> was pleased that the gameplay was faithful to the original but felt the minor additions and constant "repetition" was not enough to make the port "warrant a $50 purchase". He was disappointed about the lack of music and found the sound effects to be of poor quality.

In 2001, Infogrames released "<a href="Atari%20Anniversary%20Edition">Atari Anniversary Edition</a>" for the Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation, and PC compatibles. Developed by <a href="Digital%20Eclipse">Digital Eclipse</a>, it included emulated versions of Asteroids and other old Atari games. Jeff Gerstmann of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> criticized the Dreamcast version for its limitations, such as the presentation of vector graphics on a low resolution television set, which obscures the copyright text in "Asteroids". The arcade and Atari 2600 versions of "Asteroids", along with "Asteroids Deluxe", were included in "<a href="Atari%20Anthology">Atari Anthology</a>" for both <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> and <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>.

Released on November 28, 2007, the Xbox Live Arcade port of "Asteroids" has revamped HD graphics along with an added intense "throttle monkey" mode. Both "Asteroids" in its arcade and 2600 versions and "Asteroids Deluxe" were ported to <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>s "<a href="Game%20Room">Game Room</a>" download service in 2010. <a href="Glu%20Mobile">Glu Mobile</a> released a mobile phone port of the game with supplementary features as well as the original arcade version.

"Asteroids" was included on "<a href="Atari%20Greatest%20Hits">Atari Greatest Hits</a> Volume 1" for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a>. Craig Harris, writing for IGN, noted that the Nintendo DS's small screen can not properly display details of games with vector graphics.

On November 13, 1982, 15-year-old <a href="Scott%20Safran">Scott Safran</a> of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, set a <a href="world%20record">world record</a> of 41,336,440 points on the arcade game "Asteroids", beating the 40,101,910 point score set by Leo Daniels of Carolina Beach on February 6, 1982. In 1998, to congratulate Safran on his accomplishment, the <a href="Twin%20Galaxies">Twin Galaxies</a> Intergalactic Scoreboard searched for him for four years until 2002, when it was discovered that he had died in an accident in 1989. In a ceremony in Philadelphia on April 27, 2002, Walter Day of Twin Galaxies presented an award to the surviving members of Safran's family, commemorating the Asteroid Champion's achievement. On April 6, 2010, John McAllister broke Safran's record with a high score of 41,338,740 in a 58-hour Internet livestream.

Asparagales

Asparagales (asparagoid lilies) is an <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of plants in modern classification systems such as the <a href="Angiosperm%20Phylogeny%20Group">Angiosperm Phylogeny Group</a> (APG) and the <a href="Angiosperm%20Phylogeny%20Web">Angiosperm Phylogeny Web</a>. The order takes its name from the <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Asparagaceae">Asparagaceae</a> and is placed in the <a href="monocots">monocots</a> amongst the <a href="lilioid%20monocots">lilioid monocots</a>. The order has only recently been recognized in classification systems. It was first put forward by <a href="herbert%20Huber">Huber</a> in 1977 and later taken up in the <a href="Dahlgren%20system">Dahlgren system</a> of 1985 and then the APG in 1998, 2003 and 2009. Before this, many of its families were assigned to the old order <a href="Liliales">Liliales</a>, a very large order containing almost all monocots with colourful <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s and lacking <a href="starch">starch</a> in their <a href="endosperm">endosperm</a>. <a href="DNA%20sequencing">DNA sequence analysis</a> indicated that many of the taxa previously included in Liliales should actually be redistributed over three orders, Liliales, Asparagales and <a href="Dioscoreales">Dioscoreales</a>. The boundaries of the Asparagales and of its families have undergone a series of changes in recent years; future research may lead to further changes and ultimately greater stability. In the APG <a href="circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscription</a>, Asparagales is the largest order of monocots with 14 families, 1,122 <a href="Genus">genera</a>, and about 36,000 <a href="species">species</a>.

The order is clearly <a href="circumscribed">circumscribed</a> on the basis of <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a>, but is difficult to define <a href="plant%20morphology">morphologically</a>, since its members are structurally diverse. Most species of Asparagales are <a href="herbaceous">herbaceous</a> <a href="perennial">perennial</a>s, although some are <a href="vines">climbers</a> and some are tree-like. The order also contains many <a href="geophyte">geophyte</a>s (bulbs, corms and various kinds of tuber). According to <a href="Telomere">telomere sequence</a>, at least two evolutionary switch-points happened within the order. Basal sequence is formed by TTTAGGG like in majority of higher plants. Basal motif was changed to vertebrate-like TTAGGG and finally the most divergent motif CTCGGTTATGGG appears in "Allium". One of the defining characteristics (<a href="Synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a>) of the order is the presence of <a href="phytomelanin">phytomelanin</a>, a black pigment present in the seed coat, creating a dark crust. Phytomelanin is found in most families of the Asparagales (although not in <a href="Orchidaceae">Orchidaceae</a>, thought to be a sister to the rest of the group).

The <a href="Leaf">leaves</a> of almost all species form a tight <a href="rosette%20%28botany%29">rosette</a>, either at the base of the plant or at the end of the <a href="plant%20stem">stem</a>, but occasionally along the stem. The <a href="flower">flower</a>s are not particularly distinctive, being 'lily type', with six <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s and up to six <a href="stamen">stamina</a>.

The order is thought to have first <a href="genetic%20divergence">diverged</a> from other related monocots some 120–130 million years ago (early in the <a href="Cretaceous%20period">Cretaceous period</a>), although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved, estimates are likely to be uncertain.

From an economic point of view, the order Asparagales is second in importance within the monocots to the order <a href="Poales">Poales</a> (which includes <a href="grass">grass</a>es and <a href="cereal">cereal</a>s). Species are used as food and flavourings (e.g. <a href="onion">onion</a>, <a href="garlic">garlic</a>, <a href="leek">leek</a>, <a href="asparagus">asparagus</a>, <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a>), as <a href="cut%20flowers">cut flowers</a> (e.g. <a href="freesia">freesia</a>, <a href="gladiolus">gladiolus</a>, <a href="iris%20%28plant%29">iris</a>, <a href="orchid">orchid</a>s), and as garden <a href="Ornamental%20plant">ornamentals</a> (e.g. <a href="Hemerocallis">day lilies</a>, <a href="Convallaria">lily of the valley</a>, "<a href="Agapanthus">Agapanthus</a>").

Thus although most species in the order are <a href="herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a>, some no more than 15 cm high, there are a number of <a href="vines">climbers</a> ("e.g.", some species of "<a href="Asparagus%20%28genus%29">Asparagus</a>"), as well as several genera forming <a href="trees">trees</a> (e.g. "<a href="Agave">Agave</a>", "<a href="Cordyline">Cordyline</a>", "<a href="Yucca">Yucca</a>", "<a href="Dracaena%20%28plant%29">Dracaena</a>", "<a href="Aloe">Aloe</a>" ), which can exceed 10 m in height. <a href="Succulent">Succulent</a> genera occur in several families (e.g. "Aloe").

Almost all species have a tight cluster of <a href="Leaf">leaves</a> (a <a href="rosette%20%28botany%29">rosette</a>), either at the base of the plant or at the end of a more-or-less woody <a href="plant%20stem">stem</a> as with "<a href="Yucca">Yucca</a>". In some cases the leaves are produced along the stem. The <a href="flower">flower</a>s are in the main not particularly distinctive, being of a general 'lily type', with six <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, either free or fused from the base and up to six <a href="stamen">stamina</a>. They are frequently clustered at the end of the plant stem.

The Asparagales are generally distinguished from the <a href="Liliales">Liliales</a> by the lack of markings on the tepals, the presence of <a href="septal%20nectaries">septal nectaries</a> in the <a href="ovary%20%28botany%29">ovaries</a>, rather than the bases of the tepals or stamen filaments, and the presence of <a href="secondary%20growth">secondary growth</a>. They are generally <a href="geophytes">geophytes</a>, but with linear leaves, and a lack of fine <a href="reticular%20venation">reticular venation</a>.

The <a href="seed">seed</a>s characteristically have the external epidermis either obliterated (in most species bearing fleshy fruit), or if present, have a layer of black carbonaceous <a href="phytomelanin">phytomelanin</a> in species with dry fruits (nuts). The inner part of the seed coat is generally collapsed, in contrast to Liliales whose seeds have a well developed outer epidermis, lack phytomelanin, and usually display a cellular inner layer.

The orders which have been separated from the old Liliales are difficult to characterize. No single morphological character appears to be diagnostic of the order Asparagales.

As <a href="circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscribed</a> within the <a href="Angiosperm%20Phylogeny%20Group">Angiosperm Phylogeny Group</a> system Asparagales is the largest <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> within the <a href="monocotyledons">monocotyledons</a>, with 14 families, 1,122 <a href="Genus">genera</a> and about 25,000–42,000 <a href="species">species</a>, thus accounting for about 50% of all monocots and 10–15% of the <a href="flowering%20plants">flowering plants</a> (angiosperms). The attribution of botanical authority for the name Asparagales belongs to <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Friedrich%20Link">Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link</a> (1767 – 1851) who coined the word 'Asparaginae' in 1829 for a higher order taxon that included "<a href="Asparagus">Asparagus</a>" although Adanson and Jussieau had also done so earlier (see History). Earlier circumscriptions of Asparagales attributed the name to <a href="Edward%20Bromhead">Bromhead</a> (1838), who had been the first to use the term 'Asparagales'.

The <a href="type%20genus">type genus</a>, "<a href="Asparagus">Asparagus</a>", from which the name of the order is derived, was described by Carl <a href="Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in 1753, with ten species. He placed "Asparagus" within the "Hexandria Monogynia" (six <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s, one <a href="carpel">carpel</a>) in his <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">sexual classification</a> in the "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>". The majority of <a href="taxa">taxa</a> now considered to constitute Asparagales have historically been placed within the very large and diverse family, <a href="Liliaceae">Liliaceae</a>. The Liliaceae family was first described by <a href="Michel%20Adanson">Michel Adanson</a> in 1763, and in <a href="Adanson%20system">his taxonomic scheme</a> he created eight sections within it, including the Asparagi with "Asparagus" and three other genera. The system of organising genera into families is generally credited to <a href="Antoine%20Laurent%20de%20Jussieu">Antoine Laurent de Jussieu</a> who formally described both the Liliaceae and the type family of Asparagales, the <a href="Asparagaceae">Asparagaceae</a>, as Lilia and Asparagi, respectively, in 1789. Jussieu established the <a href="hierarchical">hierarchical</a> system of <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> (<a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a>), placing "Asparagus" and related genera within a <a href="Phylum">division</a> of <a href="Monocotyledons">Monocotyledons</a>, a <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">class</a> (III) of "Stamina Perigynia" and 'order' Asparagi, divided into three subfamilies. The use of the term "Ordo" (order) at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. In creating <a href="De%20Jussieu%20system">his scheme</a> he used a modified form of Linnaeus' sexual classification but using the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers. While De Jussieu's "Stamina Perigynia" also included a number of 'orders' that would eventually form families within the Asparagales such as the Asphodeli (<a href="Xanthorrhoeaceae">Xanthorrhoeaceae</a>), Narcissi (<a href="Amaryllidaceae">Amaryllidaceae</a>) and Irides (<a href="Iridaceae">Iridaceae</a>), the remainder are now allocated to other orders. Jussieu's Asparagi soon came to be referred to as "Asparagacées" in the French literature (Latin: Asparagaceae). Meanwhile, the 'Narcissi' had been renamed as the 'Amaryllidées' (Amaryllideae) in 1805, by <a href="Jean%20Henri%20Jaume%20Saint-Hilaire">Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire</a>, using "<a href="Amaryllis">Amaryllis</a>" as the type species rather than "<a href="Narcissus%20%28plant%29">Narcissus</a>", and thus has the authority attribution for <a href="Amaryllidaceae">Amaryllidaceae</a>. In 1810 <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Brown</a> proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of the <a href="Ovary%20%28botany%29">ovaries</a> and be referred to as Amaryllideae and in 1813 <a href="de%20Candolle">de Candolle</a> described Liliacées Juss. and Amaryllidées Brown as two quite separate families.

The literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the English language with <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a>'s "A natural arrangement of British plants" (1821). Gray used a combination of Linnaeus' sexual classification and Jussieu's natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens, a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid, but did not use formal names for these higher ranks. Within the grouping he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed. He treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families, such as Amaryllideae, Liliaceae, Asphodeleae and Asparageae.
The <a href="Circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscription</a> of Asparagales has been a source of difficulty for many botanists from the time of <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a> (1846), the other important British taxonomist of the early nineteenth century. In his <a href="Lindley%20system">first taxonomic work</a>, "An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany" (1830) he partly followed Jussieu by describing a subclass he called Endogenae, or Monocotyledonous Plants (preserving de Candolle's "Endogenæ phanerogamæ") divided into two tribes, the <a href="Petaloidea">Petaloidea</a> and <a href="Glumaceae">Glumaceae</a>. He divided the former, often referred to as petaloid monocots, into 32 orders, including the Liliaceae (defined narrowly), but also most of the families considered to make up the Asparagales today, including the <a href="Amaryllideae">Amaryllideae</a>.

By 1846, in his final scheme Lindley had greatly expanded and refined the treatment of the monocots, introducing both an intermediate ranking (Alliances) and tribes within orders ("i.e." families). Lindley placed the Liliaceae within the <a href="Liliales">Liliales</a>, but saw it as a <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> ("catch-all") family, being all Liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. The order Liliales was very large and had become a used to include almost all monocotyledons with colourful tepals and without starch in their endosperm (the <a href="lilioid%20monocot">lilioid monocot</a>s). The Liliales was difficult to divide into families because morphological characters were not present in patterns that clearly demarcated groups. This kept the Liliaceae separate from the Amaryllidaceae (Narcissales). Of these Liliaceae was divided into eleven tribes (with 133 genera) and Amaryllidaceae into four tribes (with 68 genera), yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each other's contemporary orders (Liliales and Asparagales respectively). The Liliaceae would be reduced to a small 'core' represented by the Tulipae tribe, while large groups such <a href="Scilleae">Scilleae</a> and <a href="Asparagaceae">Asparagae</a> would become part of Asparagales either as part of the Amaryllidaceae or as separate families. While of the Amaryllidaceae, the <a href="Agavaceae">Agaveae</a> would be part of Asparagaceae but the <a href="Alstroemeriaceae">Alstroemeriae</a> would become a family within the <a href="Liliales">Liliales</a>.

The number of known genera (and species) continued to grow and by the time of the next major British classification, that of <a href="Bentham%20and%20Hooker">Bentham and Hooker</a> in 1883 (published in Latin) several of Lindley's other families had been absorbed into the Liliaceae. They used the term 'series' to indicate suprafamilial rank, with seven series of monocotyledons (including Glumaceae), but did not use Lindley's terms for these. However they did place the Liliaceous and Amaryllidaceous genera into separate series. The Liliaceae were placed in series Coronariae, while the Amaryllideae were placed in series Epigynae. The Liliaceae now consisted of twenty tribes (including Tulipeae, Scilleae and Asparageae), and the Amaryllideae of five (including Agaveae and Alstroemerieae). An important addition to the treatment of the Liliaceae was the recognition of the <a href="Allieae">Allieae</a> as a distinct tribe that would eventually find its way to the Asparagales as the <a href="Allioideae">Allioideae</a> subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae.

The appearance of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s <a href="Origin%20of%20Species">Origin of Species</a> in 1859 changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata. The <a href="Darwinian">Darwinian</a> approach led to the concept of <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> (tree-like structure) in assembling classification systems, starting with <a href="Eichler%20system">Eichler</a>. <a href="August%20Eichler">Eichler</a>, having established a <a href="hierarchical">hierarchical</a> system in which the flowering plants (<a href="angiosperms">angiosperms</a>) were divided into <a href="monocotyledons">monocotyledons</a> and <a href="dicotyledons">dicotyledons</a>, further divided into former into seven orders. Within the <a href="Liliiflorae">Liliiflorae</a> were seven families, including Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae. Liliaceae included "<a href="Allium">Allium</a>" and "<a href="Ornithogalum">Ornithogalum</a>" (modern <a href="Allioideae">Allioideae</a>) and "<a href="Asparagus">Asparagus</a>".

<a href="Adolf%20Engler">Engler</a>, in his <a href="Engler%20system">system</a> developed Eichler's ideas into a much more elaborate scheme which he treated in a number of works including "<a href="Die%20Nat%C3%BCrlichen%20Pflanzenfamilien">Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien</a>" (Engler and <a href="Karl%20Anton%20Prantl">Prantl</a> 1888) and "<a href="Syllabus%20der%20Pflanzenfamilien">Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien</a>" (1892–1924). In his treatment of Liliiflorae the Liliineae were a suborder which included both Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae families. The Liliaceae had eight subfamilies and the Amaryllidaceae four. In this rearrangement of Liliaceae, with fewer subdivisions, the core Liliales were represented as subfamily <a href="Lilioideae">Lilioideae</a> (with Tulipae and Scilleae as tribes), the Asparagae were represented as Asparagoideae and the <a href="Allioideae">Allioideae</a> was preserved, representing the alliaceous genera. <a href="Allieae">Allieae</a>, <a href="Agapantheae">Agapantheae</a> and <a href="Gilliesieae">Gilliesieae</a> were the three tribes within this subfamily. In the Amaryllidacea, there was little change from Bentham and Hooker. A similar approach was adopted by <a href="Richard%20Wettstein">Wettstein</a>.

In the twentieth century the <a href="Wettstein%20system">Wettstein system</a> (1901–1935) placed many of the taxa in an order called 'Liliiflorae'. Next <a href="Johannes%20Paulus%20Lotsy">Johannes Paulus Lotsy</a> (1911) proposed dividing the <a href="Liliiflorae">Liliiflorae</a> into a number of smaller families including <a href="Asparagaceae">Asparagaceae</a>. Then <a href="Herbert%20Huber%20%28botanist%29">Herbert Huber</a> (1969, 1977), following Lotsy's example, proposed that the Liliiflorae be split into four groups including the 'Asparagoid' <a href="Liliiflorae">Liliiflorae</a>.
The widely used <a href="Cronquist%20system">Cronquist system</a> (1968–1988) used the very broadly defined order Liliales.

These various proposals to separate small groups of genera into more homogeneous families, made little impact till that of <a href="Dahlgren%20system">Dahlgren</a> (1985) incorporating new information including <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphy</a>. Dahlgren developed Huber's ideas further and popularised them, with a major deconstruction of existing families into smaller units. They created a new <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a>, calling it Asparagales. This was one of five orders within the superorder Liliiflorae. Where Cronquist saw one family, Dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders (predominantly <a href="Liliales">Liliales</a> and Asparagales).
Over the 1980s, in the context of a more general review of the classification of <a href="angiosperms">angiosperms</a>, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. By the end of that decade, the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%20at%20Kew">Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew</a>, the <a href="British%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">British Museum of Natural History</a> and the <a href="Edinburgh%20Botanical%20Gardens">Edinburgh Botanical Gardens</a> formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family at least for the organization of their <a href="herbaria">herbaria</a>. That committee finally recommended that 24 new families be created in the place of the original broad Liliaceae, largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families.

The order Asparagales as currently <a href="circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscribed</a> has only recently been recognized in classification systems, through the advent of <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetics</a>. The 1990s saw considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory, enabling a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants. The establishment of major new clades necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as Cronquist and Thorne based largely on morphology rather than genetic data. This complicated discussion about plant evolution and necessitated a major restructuring. "rbc"L gene sequencing and cladistic analysis of monocots had redefined the <a href="Liliales">Liliales</a> in 1995. from four morphological orders "sensu" <a href="Rolf%20Dahlgren">Dahlgren</a>. The largest clade representing the Liliaceae, all previously included in Liliales, but including both the Calochortaceae and Liliaceae "sensu" Tamura. This redefined family, that became referred to as core Liliales, but corresponded to the emerging circumscription of the <a href="Angiosperm%20Phylogeny%20Group">Angiosperm Phylogeny Group</a> (1998).

The 2009 revision of the <a href="Angiosperm%20Phylogeny%20Group">Angiosperm Phylogeny Group</a> system, <a href="APG%20III%20system">APG III</a>, places the order in the clade <a href="Monocotyledon">monocots</a>.

From the <a href="Dahlgren%20system">Dahlgren system</a> of 1985 onwards, studies based mainly on morphology had identified the Asparagales as a distinct group, but had also included groups now located in Liliales, Pandanales and Zingiberales. Research in the 21st century has supported the <a href="monophyly">monophyly</a> of Asparagales, based on morphology, 18S rDNA, and other DNA sequences, although some phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data have suggested that Asparagales may be paraphyletic, with Orchidaceae separated from the rest. Within the monocots, Asparagales is the <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> of the <a href="commelinid">commelinid</a> clade.

This <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the placement of Asparagales within the orders of <a href="Lilianae">Lilianae</a> "<a href="sensu">sensu</a>" Chase & Reveal (monocots) based on molecular phylogenetic evidence. The <a href="lilioid%20monocot">lilioid monocot</a> orders are bracketed, namely <a href="Petrosaviales">Petrosaviales</a>, <a href="Dioscoreales">Dioscoreales</a>, <a href="Pandanales">Pandanales</a>, <a href="Liliales">Liliales</a> and Asparagales. These constitute a <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> assemblage, that is groups with a common ancestor that do not include all direct descendants (in this case commelinids as the sister group to Asparagales); to form a clade, all the groups joined by thick lines would need to be included. While Acorales and Alismatales have been collectively referred to as "<a href="alismatid%20monocots">alismatid monocots</a>" (basal or early branching monocots), the remaining clades (lilioid and <a href="commelinid">commelinid</a> monocots) have been referred to as the "core monocots". The relationship between the orders (with the exception of the two sister orders) is <a href="wikt%3Apectinate">pectinate</a>, that is diverging in succession from the line that leads to the commelinids. Numbers indicate <a href="crown%20group">crown group</a> (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) divergence times in <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a> (million years ago).

A <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">phylogenetic tree</a> for the Asparagales, including those families that were reduced to subfamilies, is shown below. Of these, the two largest families are Amaryllidaceae and Asparagaceae.

The tree shown above can be divided into a basal paraphyletic group, the 'lower Asparagales (asparagoids)', from Orchidaceae to Xanthorrhoeaceae "sensu lato", and a well-supported monophyletic group of 'core Asparagales' (higher asparagoids), comprising the two largest families, Amaryllidaceae "sensu lato" and Asparagaceae "sensu lato".

Two differences between these two groups (although with exceptions) are: the mode of <a href="microsporogenesis">microsporogenesis</a> and the position of the ovary. The 'lower Asparagales' typically have simultaneous microsporogenesis (i.e. cell walls develop only after both <a href="meiosis">meiotic</a> divisions), which appears to be an <a href="apomorphy">apomorphy</a> within the monocots, whereas the 'core Asparagales' have reverted to successive microsporogenesis (i.e. cell walls develop after each division). The 'lower Asparagales' typically have an <a href="inferior%20ovary">inferior ovary</a>, whereas the 'core Asparagales' have reverted to a <a href="superior%20ovary">superior ovary</a>. A 2002 morphological study by Rudall treated possessing an inferior ovary as a <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphy</a> of the Asparagales, stating that reversions to a superior ovary in the 'core Asparagales' could be associated with the presence of nectaries below the ovaries. However, Stevens notes that superior ovaries are distributed among the 'lower Asparagales' in such a way that it is not clear where to place the evolution of different ovary morphologies. The position of the ovary seems a much more flexible character (here and in other <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a>s) than previously thought.

The <a href="APG%20III%20system">APG III system</a> when it was published in 2009, greatly expanded the families <a href="Xanthorrhoeaceae">Xanthorrhoeaceae</a>, <a href="Amaryllidaceae">Amaryllidaceae</a>, and <a href="Asparagaceae">Asparagaceae</a>. Thirteen of the families of the earlier <a href="APG%20II%20system">APG II system</a> were thereby reduced to subfamilies within these three families. The APG II families (left) and their equivalent APG III subfamilies (right) are as follows:

<a href="Orchidaceae">Orchidaceae</a> is the largest family of all <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a>s and hence by far the largest in the order. The <a href="Dahlgren%20system">Dahlgren system</a> recognized three families of orchids, but DNA sequence analysis later showed that these families are <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a> and so should be combined. Several studies suggest (with high bootstrap support) that Orchidaceae is the sister of the rest of the Asparagales. Other studies have placed the orchids differently in the phylogenetic tree, generally among the <a href="Boryaceae">Boryaceae</a>-<a href="Hypoxidaceae">Hypoxidaceae</a> clade. The position of Orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis, but cannot be taken as confirmed.

Orchids have simultaneous microsporogenesis and inferior ovaries, two characters that are typical of the 'lower Asparagales'. However, their nectaries are rarely in the septa of the ovaries, and most orchids have dust-like seeds, atypical of the rest of the order. (Some members of <a href="Vanilloideae">Vanilloideae</a> and <a href="Cypripedioideae">Cypripedioideae</a> have crustose seeds, probably associated with dispersal by birds and mammals that are attracted by fermenting fleshy fruit releasing fragrant compounds, e.g. <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a>.)

In terms of the number of species, Orchidaceae diversification is remarkable. However, although the other Asparagales may be less rich in species, they are more variable morphologically, including tree-like forms.

The four families excluding <a href="Boryaceae">Boryaceae</a> form a well-supported clade in studies based on DNA sequence analysis. All four contain relatively few species, and it has been suggested that they be combined into one family under the name Hypoxidaceae "sensu lato". The relationship between Boryaceae (which includes only two genera, "<a href="Borya">Borya</a>" and "<a href="Alania%20%28plant%29">Alania</a>"), and other Asparagales has remained unclear for a long time. The Boryaceae are <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l, but not in the same way as orchids. Morphological studies have suggested a close relationship between Boryaceae and Blandfordiaceae. There is relatively low support for the position of Boryaceae in the tree shown above.

The relationship shown between <a href="Ixioliriaceae">Ixioliriaceae</a> and <a href="Tecophilaeaceae">Tecophilaeaceae</a> is still unclear. Some studies have supported a clade of these two families, others have not. The position of <a href="Doryanthaceae">Doryanthaceae</a> has also varied, with support for the position shown above, but also support for other positions.

The clade from <a href="Iridaceae">Iridaceae</a> upwards appears to have stronger support. All have some genetic characteristics in common, having lost Arabidopsis-type <a href="telomere">telomere</a>s. Iridaceae is distinctive among the Asparagales in the unique structure of the <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> (a ripidium), the combination of an inferior ovary and three stamens, and the common occurrence of <a href="unifacial%20leaf">unifacial leaves</a> whereas bifacial leaves are the norm in other Asparagales.

Members of the clade from <a href="Iridaceae">Iridaceae</a> upwards have infra-locular septal nectaries, which Rudall interpreted as a driver towards secondarily superior ovaries.

The next node in the tree (Xanthorrhoeaceae "sensu lato" + the 'core Asparagales') has strong support. 'Anomalous' secondary thickening occurs among this clade, e.g. in "<a href="Xanthorrhoea">Xanthorrhoea</a>" (family Xanthorrhoeaceae "sensu lato") and "<a href="Dracaena%20%28plant%29">Dracaena</a>" (family Asparagaceae "sensu lato"), with species reaching tree-like proportions.

The 'core Asparagales', comprising Amaryllidaceae "sensu lato" and Asparagaceae "sensu lato", are a strongly supported clade, as are clades for each of the families. Relationships within these broadly defined families appear less clear, particularly within the Asparagaceae "sensu lato". Stevens notes that most of its subfamilies are difficult to recognize, and that significantly different divisions have been used in the past, so that the use of a broadly defined family to refer to the entire clade is justified. Thus the relationships among subfamilies shown above, based on <a href="APWeb">APWeb</a> , is somewhat uncertain.

Several studies have attempted to date the evolution of the Asparagales, based on phylogenetic evidence. Earlier studies generally give younger dates than more recent studies, which have been preferred in the table below.

A 2009 study suggests that the Asparagales have the highest diversification rate in the monocots, about the same as the order <a href="Poales">Poales</a>, although in both orders the rate is little over half that of the <a href="eudicot">eudicot</a> order <a href="Lamiales">Lamiales</a>, the clade with the highest rate.

The taxonomic diversity of the monocotyledons is described in detail by Kubitzki. Up-to-date information on the Asparagales can be found on the <a href="Angiosperm%20Phylogeny%20Website">Angiosperm Phylogeny Website</a>.

The APG III system's family circumscriptions are being used as the basis of the Kew-hosted "World Checklist of Selected Plant Families". With this circumscription, the order consists of 14 families (Dahlgren had 31) with approximately 1120 genera and 26000 species.

Order Asparagales Link

The earlier 2003 version, <a href="APG%20II%20system">APG II</a>, allowed 'bracketed' families, i.e. families which could either be segregated from more comprehensive families or could be included in them. These are the families given under "including" in the list above. APG III does not allow bracketed families, requiring the use of the more comprehensive family; otherwise the circumscription of the Asparagales is unchanged. A separate paper accompanying the publication of the 2009 APG III system provided subfamilies to accommodate the families which were discontinued. The first APG system of <a href="APG%20system">1998</a> contained some extra families, included in square brackets in the list above.

Two older systems which use the order Asparagales are the <a href="Dahlgren%20system">Dahlgren system</a> and the <a href="Kubitzki%20system">Kubitzki system</a>. The families included in the circumscriptions of the order in these two systems are shown in the first and second columns of the table below. The equivalent family in the modern APG III system (see below) is shown in the third column. Note that although these systems may use the same name for a family, the genera which it includes may be different, so the equivalence between systems is only approximate in some cases.

The Asparagales include many important <a href="crop%20plants">crop plants</a> and <a href="ornamental%20plants">ornamental plants</a>. Crops include <a href="Allium">Allium</a>, <a href="Asparagus">Asparagus</a> and <a href="Vanilla%20%28genus%29">Vanilla</a>, while ornamentals include <a href="iris%20%28plant%29">irises</a>, <a href="hyacinths">hyacinths</a> and <a href="orchids">orchids</a>.

Alismatales

The Alismatales (alismatids) are an order of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s including about 4500 species. Plants assigned to this order are mostly tropical or aquatic. Some grow in fresh water, some in marine habitats.

The Alismatales comprise <a href="herbaceous">herbaceous</a> flowering plants of aquatic and marshy habitats, and the only monocots known to have green <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s other than the <a href="Amaryllidaceae">Amaryllidaceae</a>. They also include the only marine angiosperms. The <a href="flower">flower</a>s are usually arranged in <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, and the mature seeds lack <a href="endosperm">endosperm</a>.

Both marine and freshwater forms include those with staminate flowers that detach from the parent plant and float to the surface where they become pollinated. In others, pollination occurs underwater, where pollen may form elongated strands, increasing chance of success. Most aquatic species have a totally submerged juvenile phase, and flowers are either floating or emergent. Vegetation may be totally submersed, have floating leaves, or protrude from the water. Collectively, they are commonly known as "water plantain".

The Alismatales contain about 165 genera in 13 families, with a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a>. <a href="Phylogenetically">Phylogenetically</a>, they are <a href="basal%20monocot">basal monocot</a>s, diverging early in evolution relative to the <a href="lilioid">lilioid</a> and <a href="commelinid">commelinid</a> <a href="monocot">monocot</a> lineages. Together with the <a href="Acorales">Acorales</a>, the Alismatales are referred to informally as the alismatid monocots.

The <a href="Cronquist%20system">Cronquist system</a> (1981) places the Alismatales in subclass <a href="Alismatidae">Alismatidae</a>, class <a href="Liliopsida">Liliopsida</a> [= monocotyledons] and includes only three families as shown:
Cronquist's subclass Alismatidae conformed fairly closely to the order Alismatales as defined by APG, minus the Araceae.

The <a href="Dahlgren%20system">Dahlgren system</a> places the Alismatales in the superorder <a href="Alismatanae">Alismatanae</a> in the subclass <a href="Liliidae">Liliidae</a> [= monocotyledons] in the class <a href="Magnoliopsida">Magnoliopsida</a> [= angiosperms] with the following families included:

In Tahktajan's classification (1997), the order Alismatales contains only the Alismataceae and Limnocharitaceae, making it equivalent to the Alismataceae as revised in APG-III. Other families included in the Alismatates as currently defined are here distributed among 10 additional orders, all of which are assigned, with the following exception, to the Subclass Alismatidae. Araceae in Tahktajan 1997 is assigned to the <a href="Arales">Arales</a> and placed in the Subclass Aridae; Tofieldiaceae to the <a href="Melanthiales">Melanthiales</a> and placed in the <a href="Liliidae">Liliidae</a>.

The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system (<a href="APG%20system">APG</a>) of 1998 and <a href="APG%20II%20system">APG II</a> (2003) assigned the Alismatales to the monocots, which may be thought of as an unranked clade containing the families listed below. The biggest departure from <a href="list%20of%20systems%20of%20plant%20taxonomy">earlier systems</a> (see below) is the inclusion of family Araceae. By its inclusion, the order has grown enormously in number of species. The family Araceae alone accounts for about a hundred genera, totaling over two thousand species. The rest of the families together contain only about five hundred species, many of which are in very small families.

The <a href="APG%20III%20system">APG III system</a> (2009) differs only in that the <a href="Limnocharitaceae">Limnocharitaceae</a> are combined with the Alismataceae; it was also suggested that the genus "<a href="Maundia">Maundia</a>" (of the <a href="Juncaginaceae">Juncaginaceae</a>) could be separated into a monogeneric family, the <a href="Maundiaceae">Maundiaceae</a>, but the authors noted that more study was necessary before the Maundiaceae could be recognized.


In <a href="APG%20IV">APG IV</a> (2016), it was decided that evidence was sufficient to elevate "<a href="Maundia">Maundia</a>" to family level as the <a href="monogeneric">monogeneric</a> Maundiaceae. The authors considered including a number of the smaller orders within the Juncaginaceae, but an online survey of botanists and other users found little support for this "<a href="lumping">lumping</a>" approach. Consequently, the family structure for APG IV is:

The order Apiales is placed within the <a href="asterid">asterid</a> group of <a href="eudicots">eudicots</a> as circumscribed by the APG III system. Within the asterids, Apiales belongs to an <a href="Taxonomic%20rank">unranked</a> group called the <a href="campanulids">campanulids</a>, and within the campanulids, it belongs to a <a href="clade">clade</a> known in <a href="phylogenetic%20nomenclature">phylogenetic nomenclature</a> as <a href="Apiidae">Apiidae</a>. In 2010, a <a href="subclade">subclade</a> of Apiidae named <a href="Dipsapiidae">Dipsapiidae</a> was defined to consist of the three orders: Apiales, <a href="Paracryphiales">Paracryphiales</a>, and <a href="Dipsacales">Dipsacales</a>.

Under the <a href="Cronquist%20system">Cronquist system</a>, only the Apiaceae and Araliaceae were included here, and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids. The <a href="Pittosporaceae">Pittosporaceae</a> were placed within the <a href="Rosales">Rosales</a>, and many of the other forms within the family <a href="Cornaceae">Cornaceae</a>. "<a href="Pennantia">Pennantia</a>" was in the family <a href="Icacinaceae">Icacinaceae</a>. In the classification system of <a href="Rolf%20Dahlgren">Dahlgren</a> the Apiaceae and Araliaceae families were placed in the order Ariales, in the <a href="superorder">superorder</a> Araliiflorae (also called Aralianae).

The present understanding of the Apiales is fairly recent and is based upon comparison of <a href="DNA%20sequences">DNA sequences</a> by <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> methods. The <a href="Circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscriptions</a> of some of the families have changed. In 2009, one of the subfamilies of Araliaceae was shown to be <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>.

The largest and obviously closely related families of Apiales are <a href="Araliaceae">Araliaceae</a>, <a href="Myodocarpaceae">Myodocarpaceae</a> and
<a href="Apiaceae">Apiaceae</a>, which resemble each other in the structure of their <a href="gynoecium">gynoecia</a>. In this respect however, the <a href="Pittosporaceae">Pittosporaceae</a> is notably distinct from them.

Typical syncarpous gynoecia exhibit four vertical zones, determined by the extent of fusion of the carpels. In most plants the synascidiate (i.e. "united bottle-shaped") and symplicate zones are fertile and bear the ovules. Each of the first three families possess mainly bi- or multilocular ovaries in a gynoecium with a long synascidiate, but very short symplicate zone, where the ovules are inserted at their transition, the so-called cross-zone (or "Querzone").

In gynoecia of the Pittosporaceae, the symplicate is much longer than the synascidiate zone, and the ovules are arranged along the first. Members of the latter family consequently have unilocular ovaries with a single cavity between adjacent carpels.

Asterales

Asterales is an <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of <a href="dicotyledon">dicotyledon</a>ous <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s that includes the large <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a> (or Compositae) known for composite flowers made of <a href="Floret%23floret">florets</a>, and ten families related to the Asteraceae.

The order is a <a href="Cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolite</a> (plants found throughout most of the world including desert and frigid zones), and includes mostly <a href="Herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a> species, although a small number of trees (such as the <a href="Lobelia%20deckenii">giant Lobelia</a> and the <a href="Dendrosenecio">giant Senecio</a>) and <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s are also present.

Asterales are organisms that seem to have evolved from one common <a href="ancestor">ancestor</a>. Asterales share characteristics on <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> and biochemical levels. <a href="Synapomorphies">Synapomorphies</a> (a character that is shared by two or more groups through evolutionary development) include the presence in the plants of <a href="oligosaccharide">oligosaccharide</a> <a href="inulin">inulin</a>, a nutrient storage molecule used instead of <a href="starch">starch</a>; and unique <a href="stamen">stamen</a> morphology. The stamens are usually found around the <a href="Gynoecium">style</a>, either aggregated densely or fused into a tube, probably an <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a> in association with the plunger (brush; or secondary) <a href="pollination">pollination</a> that is common among the families of the order, wherein pollen is collected and stored on the length of the pistil.

The name and order Asterales is botanically venerable, dating back to at least 1926 in the <a href="Hutchinson%20system">Hutchinson system of plant taxonomy</a> when it contained only five families, of which only two are retained in the APG III classification. Under the <a href="Cronquist%20system">Cronquist system</a> of taxonomic classification of flowering plants, <a href="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a> was the only family in the group, but newer systems (such as <a href="APG%20II%20system">APG II</a> and <a href="APG%20III%20system">APG III</a>) have expanded it to 11. In the classification system of <a href="Rolf%20Dahlgren">Dahlgren</a> the Asterales were in the <a href="superorder">superorder</a> Asteriflorae (also called Asteranae). 

The order Asterales currently includes 11 families, the largest of which are the <a href="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a>, with about 25,000 species, and the <a href="Campanulaceae">Campanulaceae</a> ("bellflowers"), with about 2,000 species. The remaining families count together for less than 500 species. The two large families are cosmopolitan, with many of their species found in the Northern Hemisphere, and the smaller families are usually confined to Australia and the adjacent areas, or sometimes South America.

Only the Asteraceae have composite flower heads; the other families do not, but share other characteristics such as storage of inulin that define the 11 families as more closely related to each other than to other plant families or orders such as the <a href="rosids">rosids</a>.

The phylogenetic tree according to APG III for the Campanulid clade is as below.

The core Asterales are Stylidiaceae (six <a href="Genus">genera</a>), APA <a href="clade">clade</a> (Alseuosmiaceae, Phellinaceae and Argophyllaceae, together 7 genera), MGCA clade (Menyanthaceae, Goodeniaceae, Calyceraceae, in total twenty genera), and Asteraceae (about sixteen hundred genera). Other Asterales are Rousseaceae (four genera), Campanulaceae (eighty four genera) and Pentaphragmataceae (one genus).

All Asterales families are represented in the Southern Hemisphere; however, Asteraceae and Campanulaceae are cosmopolitan and Menyanthaceae nearly so.

Although most extant species of Asteraceae are herbaceous, the examination of the basal members in the family suggests that the common ancestor of the family was an arborescent plant, a tree or shrub, perhaps adapted to dry conditions, radiating from South America. Less can be said about the Asterales themselves with certainty, although since several families in Asterales contain trees, the ancestral member is most likely to have been a tree or shrub.

Because all clades are represented in the southern hemisphere but many not in the northern hemisphere, it is natural to conjecture that there is a common southern origin to them. Asterales are <a href="angiosperms">angiosperms</a>, flowering plants that appeared about 140 million years ago. The Asterales order probably originated in the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> (145 – 66 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29%23Symbols%20y%20and%20yr">Mya</a>) on the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> which broke up from 184 – 80 Mya, forming the area that is now Australia, South America, Africa, India and Antarctica.

Asterales contain about 14% of <a href="eudicot">eudicot</a> diversity. From an analysis of relationships and diversities within the Asterales and with their superorders, estimates of the age of the beginning of the Asterales have been made, which range from 116 Mya to 82Mya. However few fossils have been found, of the Menyanthaceae-Asteraceae clade in the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, about 29 Mya.

Fossil evidence of the Asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epochs, so the precise estimation of the order's age is quite difficult. An Oligocene (34 – 23 Mya) pollen is known for Asteraceae and Goodeniaceae, and seeds from Oligocene and <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> (23 – 5.3 Mya) are known for Menyanthaceae and Campanulaceae respectively.

The Asterales, by dint of being a super-set of the family Asteraceae, include some species grown for food, including the <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a> ("Helianthus annuus"), lettuce ("Lactuca sativa") and <a href="chicory">chicory</a> ("Cichorium"). Many are also used as spices and traditional medicines.

Asterales are common plants and have many known uses. For example, <a href="pyrethrum">pyrethrum</a> (derived from Old World members of the genus "Chrysanthemum") is a natural insecticide with minimal environmental impact. <a href="Artemisia%20%28genus%29">Wormwood</a>, derived from a genus that includes the <a href="sagebrush">sagebrush</a>, is used as a source of flavoring for <a href="absinthe">absinthe</a>, a bitter classical liquor of European origin.

Despite the large number of species in order Asterales, they do not compare in economic benefit for mankind to the <a href="Poales">Poales</a> or to the <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a>. The Asteraceae include many invasive plant species in North America.

Asteroid

Asteroids are <a href="minor%20planet">minor planet</a>s, especially those of the <a href="Solar%20System%23Inner%20Solar%20System">inner Solar System</a>. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active <a href="comet">comet</a>. As <a href="Distant%20minor%20planet">minor planets in the outer Solar System</a> were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>. In this article, the term "asteroid" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>.

There are millions of asteroids, many thought to be the shattered remnants of <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s, bodies within the young Sun's <a href="solar%20nebula">solar nebula</a> that never grew large enough to become <a href="planet">planet</a>s. The large majority of known asteroids orbit in the asteroid belt between the orbits of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and Jupiter, or are co-orbital with Jupiter (the <a href="Jupiter%20trojan">Jupiter trojan</a>s). However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the <a href="near-Earth%20object">near-Earth object</a>s. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic <a href="Emission%20spectrum">spectra</a>, with the majority falling into three main groups: <a href="C-type%20asteroid">C-type</a>, <a href="M-type%20asteroid">M-type</a>, and <a href="S-type%20asteroid">S-type</a>. These were named after and are generally identified with <a href="Carbon">carbon-rich</a>, <a href="metal">metal</a>lic, and <a href="silicate">silicate</a> (stony) compositions, respectively. The size of asteroids varies greatly, some reaching as much as across.

Asteroids are differentiated from <a href="comet">comet</a>s and <a href="meteoroid">meteoroid</a>s. In the case of comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock, comets are composed of dust and ice. In addition, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of the aforementioned cometary ice. The difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of less than one meter, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter. Finally, meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials.

Only one asteroid, <a href="4%20Vesta">4 Vesta</a>, which has a relatively reflective surface, is normally visible to the naked eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short time. As of March 2016, the <a href="Minor%20Planet%20Center">Minor Planet Center</a> had data on more than 1.3 million objects in the inner and outer Solar System, of which 750,000 had enough information to be given numbered designations.

The <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> declared June 30 as International <a href="Asteroid%20Day">Asteroid Day</a> to educate the public about asteroids. The date of International <a href="Asteroid%20Day">Asteroid Day</a> commemorates the anniversary of the <a href="Tunguska%20asteroid%20impact%20over%20Siberia">Tunguska asteroid impact over Siberia</a>, Russian Federation, on 30 June 1908.

The first asteroid to be discovered, <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a>, was found in 1801 by <a href="Giuseppe%20Piazzi">Giuseppe Piazzi</a>, and was originally considered to be a new planet. This was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies, which, with the equipment of the time, appeared to be points of light, like stars, showing little or no planetary disc, though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions. This prompted the astronomer <a href="William%20Herschel">Sir William Herschel</a> to propose the term "asteroid", coined in Greek as ἀστεροειδής, or "asteroeidēs", meaning 'star-like, star-shaped', and derived from the Ancient Greek "astēr" 'star, planet'. In the early second half of the nineteenth century, the terms "asteroid" and "planet" (not always qualified as "minor") were still used interchangeably. 

Asteroid discovery methods have dramatically improved over the past two centuries.

In the last years of the 18th century, Baron <a href="Franz%20Xaver%20von%20Zach">Franz Xaver von Zach</a> organized a group of 24 astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about 2.8 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> from the Sun by the <a href="Titius-Bode%20law">Titius-Bode law</a>, partly because of the discovery, by Sir <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> in 1781, of the planet <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> at the distance predicted by the law. This task required that hand-drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a>al band down to an agreed-upon limit of faintness. On subsequent nights, the sky would be charted again and any moving object would, hopefully, be spotted. The expected motion of the missing planet was about 30 seconds of arc per hour, readily discernible by observers.

The first object, <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a>, was not discovered by a member of the group, but rather by accident in 1801 by <a href="Giuseppe%20Piazzi">Giuseppe Piazzi</a>, director of the observatory of <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. He discovered a new star-like object in <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a> and followed the displacement of this object during several nights. Later that year, <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> used these observations to calculate the orbit of this unknown object, which was found to be between the planets <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. Piazzi named it after <a href="Ceres%20%28Roman%20mythology%29">Ceres</a>, the Roman goddess of agriculture.

Three other asteroids (<a href="2%20Pallas">2 Pallas</a>, <a href="3%20Juno">3 Juno</a>, and <a href="4%20Vesta">4 Vesta</a>) were discovered over the next few years, with Vesta found in 1807. After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.

However, <a href="Karl%20Ludwig%20Hencke">Karl Ludwig Hencke</a> persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found <a href="5%20Astraea">5 Astraea</a>, the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found <a href="6%20Hebe">6 Hebe</a> less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime year 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were <a href="John%20Russell%20Hind">J. R. Hind</a>, <a href="Annibale%20de%20Gasparis">Annibale de Gasparis</a>, <a href="Karl%20Theodor%20Robert%20Luther">Robert Luther</a>, <a href="Hermann%20Mayer%20Salomon%20Goldschmidt">H. M. S. Goldschmidt</a>, <a href="Jean%20Chacornac">Jean Chacornac</a>, <a href="James%20Ferguson%20%28astronomer%29">James Ferguson</a>, <a href="Norman%20Robert%20Pogson">Norman Robert Pogson</a>, <a href="Ernst%20Wilhelm%20Leberecht%20Tempel">E. W. Tempel</a>, <a href="James%20Craig%20Watson">J. C. Watson</a>, <a href="Christian%20Heinrich%20Friedrich%20Peters">C. H. F. Peters</a>, <a href="Alphonse%20Louis%20Nicolas%20Borrelly">A. Borrelly</a>, <a href="Johann%20Palisa">J. Palisa</a>, the <a href="Paul%20Henry%20and%20Prosper%20Henry">Henry brothers</a> and <a href="Auguste%20Charlois">Auguste Charlois</a>.

In 1891, <a href="Maximilian%20Franz%20Joseph%20Cornelius%20Wolf">Max Wolf</a> pioneered the use of <a href="astrophotography">astrophotography</a> to detect asteroids, which appeared as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates. This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with <a href="323%20Brucia">323 Brucia</a>, whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point. It was known that there were many more, but most astronomers did not bother with them, calling them "vermin of the skies", a phrase variously attributed to <a href="Eduard%20Suess">Eduard Suess</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Weiss">Edmund Weiss</a>. Even a century later, only a few thousand asteroids were identified, numbered and named.

Until 1998, asteroids were discovered by a four-step process. First, a region of the sky was <a href="Astrophotography">photographed</a> by a wide-field <a href="telescope">telescope</a>, or <a href="astrograph">astrograph</a>. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two films or <a href="photographic%20plate">plates</a> of the same region were viewed under a <a href="stereoscope">stereoscope</a>. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations.

These first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a <a href="provisional%20designation%20in%20astronomy">provisional designation</a>, made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: ).

The last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the <a href="Minor%20Planet%20Center">Minor Planet Center</a>, where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a>.

There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth "(see <a href="List%20of%20Earth-crossing%20minor%20planets">Earth-crosser asteroids</a>)". The three most important groups of <a href="near-Earth%20asteroid">near-Earth asteroid</a>s are the <a href="Apollo%20asteroid">Apollos</a>, <a href="Amor%20asteroid">Amors</a>, and <a href="Aten%20asteroid">Atens</a>. Various <a href="asteroid%20deflection%20strategies">asteroid deflection strategies</a> have been proposed, as early as the 1960s.

The <a href="near-Earth%20object">near-Earth</a> asteroid <a href="433%20Eros">433 Eros</a> had been discovered as long ago as 1898, and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: <a href="1221%20Amor">1221 Amor</a>, <a href="1862%20Apollo">1862 Apollo</a>, <a href="2101%20Adonis">2101 Adonis</a>, and finally <a href="69230%20Hermes">69230 Hermes</a>, which approached within 0.005 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> of <a href="Earth">Earth</a> in 1937. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.

Two events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of the <a href="Alvarez%20hypothesis">Alvarez hypothesis</a> that an <a href="impact%20event">impact event</a> resulted in the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction</a>, and the 1994 observation of <a href="Comet%20Shoemaker-Levy%209">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> crashing into <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its <a href="military%20satellite">military satellite</a>s, built to <a href="detect%20nuclear%20explosions">detect nuclear explosions</a>, had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to 10 metres across.

All these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys that consist of charge-coupled device (<a href="Charge-coupled%20device">CCD</a>) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. As of spring 2011, it was estimated that 89% to 96% of near-Earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered. A list of teams using such systems includes:

The LINEAR system alone has discovered 138,393 asteroids, as of 20 September 2013. Among all the surveys, 4711 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered including over 600 more than in diameter.

Traditionally, small bodies orbiting the Sun were classified as <a href="comet">comet</a>s, asteroids, or <a href="meteoroid">meteoroid</a>s, with anything smaller than 10 meters across being called a meteoroid (such as in Beech and Steel's 1995 paper). The term "asteroid", from the Greek word for "star-like", never had a formal definition, with the broader term <a href="minor%20planet">minor planet</a> being preferred by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a>.

However, following the discovery of asteroids below 10 meters in size, Rubin and Grossman in a 2010 paper revised the previous definition of meteoroid to objects between 10 <a href="micrometer">µm</a> and 1 meter in size in order to maintain the distinction between asteroids and meteoroids. The smallest asteroids discovered (based on <a href="Absolute%20magnitude%23Solar%20System%20bodies%20%28H%29">absolute magnitude</a> "H") are with "H" = 33.2 and with "H" = 32.1 both with an estimated size of about 1 meter.

In 2006, the term "<a href="small%20Solar%20System%20body">small Solar System body</a>" was also introduced to cover both most minor planets and comets. Other languages prefer "planetoid" (Greek for "planet-like"), and this term is occasionally used in English especially for larger minor planets such as the <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a>s as well as an alternative for asteroids since they are not star-like. The word "<a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>" has a similar meaning, but refers specifically to the small building blocks of the planets that existed when the Solar System was forming. The term "planetule" was coined by the geologist <a href="William%20Daniel%20Conybeare">William Daniel Conybeare</a> to describe minor planets, but is not in common use. The three largest objects in the asteroid belt, <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a>, <a href="2%20Pallas">Pallas</a>, and <a href="4%20Vesta">Vesta</a>, grew to the stage of <a href="protoplanet">protoplanet</a>s. Ceres is a <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a>, the only one in the inner Solar System.

When found, asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets, and there was no unified term for the two until "small Solar System body" was coined in 2006. The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to <a href="Outgassing">sublimation</a> of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface <a href="volatiles">volatile ices</a> and become asteroid-like. A further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids; most "asteroids" with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets.

For almost two centuries, from the discovery of <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a> in 1801 until the discovery of the first <a href="centaur%20%28minor%20planet%29">centaur</a>, <a href="2060%20Chiron">Chiron</a>, in 1977, all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of Jupiter, though a few such as <a href="944%20Hidalgo">Hidalgo</a> ventured far beyond Jupiter for part of their orbit. When astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than Jupiter, now called <a href="centaur%20%28minor%20planet%29">centaurs</a>, they numbered them among the traditional asteroids, though there was debate over whether they should be considered asteroids or as a new type of object. Then, when the first <a href="trans-Neptunian%20object">trans-Neptunian object</a> (other than <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a>), , was discovered in 1992, and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up, new terms were invented to sidestep the issue: <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper-belt object</a>, <a href="trans-Neptunian%20object">trans-Neptunian object</a>, <a href="scattered-disc%20object">scattered-disc object</a>, and so on. These inhabit the cold outer reaches of the Solar System where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects were to venture close to the Sun, their volatile ices would sublimate, and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids.

The innermost of these are the <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper-belt objects</a>, called "objects" partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets. They are thought to be predominantly comet-like in composition, though some may be more akin to asteroids. Furthermore, most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets, and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional <a href="Comet%20nucleus">comet nuclei</a>. (The much more distant <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a> is hypothesized to be the main reservoir of dormant comets.) Other recent observations, such as the analysis of the cometary dust collected by the <a href="Stardust%20%28spacecraft%29">"Stardust"</a> probe, are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids, suggesting "a continuum between asteroids and comets" rather than a sharp dividing line.

The minor planets beyond Jupiter's orbit are sometimes also called "asteroids", especially in popular presentations.
However, it is becoming increasingly common for the term "asteroid" to be restricted to minor planets of the inner Solar System. Therefore, this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids: objects of the <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>, <a href="Jupiter%20trojan">Jupiter trojan</a>s, and <a href="near-Earth%20object">near-Earth object</a>s.

When the IAU introduced the class <a href="Small%20Solar%20System%20body">small Solar System bodies</a> in 2006 to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets, they created the class of <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a>s for the largest minor planets—those that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity. According to the IAU, "the term 'minor planet' may still be used, but generally the term 'Small Solar System Body' will be preferred." Currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt, <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a>, at about across, has been placed in the dwarf planet category.

It is thought that <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of the <a href="solar%20nebula">solar nebula</a> until Jupiter neared its current mass, at which point excitation from <a href="orbital%20resonance">orbital resonance</a>s with Jupiter ejected over 99% of planetesimals in the belt. Simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately in diameter <a href="Accretion%20%28astrophysics%29">accreted</a> during that early era, whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the Jovian disruption. Ceres and Vesta grew large enough to melt and <a href="Planetary%20differentiation">differentiate</a>, with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core, leaving rocky minerals in the crust.

In the <a href="Nice%20model">Nice model</a>, many <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper-belt objects</a> are captured in the outer asteroid belt, at distances greater than 2.6 AU. Most were later ejected by Jupiter, but those that remained may be the <a href="D-type%20asteroid">D-type asteroid</a>s, and possibly include Ceres.

Various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner Solar System. Their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the Solar System and by the <a href="Yarkovsky%20effect">Yarkovsky effect</a>. Significant populations include:

The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, generally in relatively low-<a href="orbital%20eccentricity">eccentricity</a> (i.e. not very elongated) orbits. This belt is now estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than in diameter, and millions of smaller ones. These asteroids may be remnants of the <a href="protoplanetary%20disk">protoplanetary disk</a>, and in this region the <a href="accretion%20%28astrophysics%29">accretion</a> of <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s into planets during the formative period of the Solar System was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>.

<a href="Trojan%20%28astronomy%29">Trojans</a> are populations that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon, but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two <a href="Lagrangian%20point">Lagrangian point</a>s of stability, <a href="Trojan%20points">L4 and L5</a>, which lie 60° ahead of and behind the larger body.

The most significant population of trojans are the <a href="Jupiter%20trojan">Jupiter trojan</a>s. Although fewer Jupiter trojans have been discovered as of 2010, it is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt.

A couple of trojans have also been found orbiting with <a href="Mars">Mars</a>.

Near-Earth asteroids, or NEAs, are asteroids that have orbits that pass close to that of Earth. Asteroids that actually cross Earth's orbital path are known as "Earth-crossers". , 14,464 near-Earth asteroids are known and the number over one kilometre in diameter is estimated to be 900–1,000.

Asteroids vary greatly in size, from almost for the largest down to rocks just 1 meter across. The three largest are very much like miniature planets: they are roughly spherical, have at least partly differentiated interiors, and are thought to be surviving <a href="protoplanet">protoplanet</a>s. The vast majority, however, are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either surviving <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s or fragments of larger bodies.

The <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a> <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a> is by far the largest asteroid, with a diameter of . The next largest are <a href="4%20Vesta">4 Vesta</a> and <a href="2%20Pallas">2 Pallas</a>, both with diameters of just over . Vesta is the only main-belt asteroid that can, on occasion, be visible to the naked eye. On some rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid; see <a href="99942%20Apophis">99942 Apophis</a>.

The mass of all the objects of the <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>, lying between the orbits of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, is estimated to be about 2.8–, or about 4% of the mass of the Moon. Of this, <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a> comprises , a third of the total. Adding in the next three most massive objects, <a href="4%20Vesta">Vesta</a> (9%), <a href="2%20Pallas">Pallas</a> (7%), and <a href="10%20Hygiea">Hygiea</a> (3%), brings this figure up to 51%; whereas the three after that, <a href="511%20Davida">511 Davida</a> (1.2%), <a href="704%20Interamnia">704 Interamnia</a> (1.0%), and <a href="52%20Europa">52 Europa</a> (0.9%), only add another 3% to the total mass. The number of asteroids then increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease.

The number of asteroids decreases markedly with size. Although this generally follows a <a href="power%20law">power law</a>, there are 'bumps' at and , where more asteroids than expected from a <a href="logarithmic%20distribution">logarithmic distribution</a> are found.

Although their location in the asteroid belt excludes them from planet status, the three largest objects, <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a>, <a href="4%20Vesta">Vesta</a>, and <a href="2%20Pallas">Pallas</a>, are intact <a href="protoplanet">protoplanet</a>s that share many characteristics common to planets, and are atypical compared to the majority of "potato"-shaped asteroids.

Ceres is the only asteroid with a fully ellipsoidal shape and hence the only one that is a <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a>. It has a much higher <a href="Absolute%20magnitude%23Solar%20System%20bodies%20%28H%29">absolute magnitude</a> than the other asteroids, of around 3.32, and may possess a surface layer of ice. Like the planets, Ceres is differentiated: it has a crust, a mantle and a core. No meteorites from Ceres have been found on Earth.

Vesta, too, has a differentiated interior, though it formed inside the Solar System's <a href="Frost%20line%20%28astrophysics%29">frost line</a>, and so is devoid of water; its composition is mainly of basaltic rock such as olivine. Aside from the large crater at its southern pole, <a href="Rheasilvia">Rheasilvia</a>, Vesta also has an ellipsoidal shape. Vesta is the parent body of the <a href="Vestian%20family">Vestian family</a> and other <a href="V-type%20asteroid">V-type asteroid</a>s, and is the source of the <a href="HED%20meteorite">HED meteorite</a>s, which constitute 5% of all meteorites on Earth.

Pallas is unusual in that, like <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a>, it rotates on its side, with its axis of rotation tilted at high angles to its orbital plane. Its composition is similar to that of Ceres: high in carbon and silicon, and perhaps partially differentiated. Pallas is the parent body of the <a href="Palladian%20family">Palladian family</a> of asteroids.

The fourth-most-massive asteroid, <a href="10%20Hygiea">Hygiea</a>, is the largest carbonaceous asteroid and, unlike the other largest asteroids, lies relatively close to the <a href="plane%20of%20the%20ecliptic">plane of the ecliptic</a>. It is the largest member and presumed parent body of the <a href="Hygiean%20family">Hygiean family</a> of asteroids. Between them, the four largest asteroids constitute half the mass of the asteroid belt.

Measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the asteroid belt show that there is an upper limit. No asteroid with a diameter larger than 100 meters has a rotation period smaller than 2.2 hours. For asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate, the inertial force at the surface is greater than the gravitational force, so any loose surface material would be flung out. However, a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly. This suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 meters are <a href="rubble%20pile">rubble pile</a>s formed through accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids.

The physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood. Ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle, where Vesta is thought to have a <a href="nickel-iron">nickel-iron</a> core, <a href="olivine">olivine</a> mantle, and basaltic crust. <a href="10%20Hygiea">10 Hygiea</a>, however, which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of <a href="carbonaceous%20chondrite">carbonaceous chondrite</a>, is thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid. Most of the smaller asteroids are thought to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity, though the largest are probably solid. Some asteroids have <a href="Asteroid%20moon">moons</a> or are co-orbiting <a href="binary%20asteroid">binaries</a>: Rubble piles, moons, binaries, and scattered <a href="asteroid%20family">asteroid families</a> are thought to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid.

Asteroids contain traces of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s and other organic compounds, and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early Earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life, or may have even brought life itself to Earth "(also see <a href="panspermia">panspermia</a>)". In August 2011, a report, based on <a href="NASA">NASA</a> studies with <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s found on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, was published suggesting <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="RNA">RNA</a> components (<a href="adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="guanine">guanine</a> and related <a href="organic%20molecules">organic molecules</a>) may have been formed on asteroids and <a href="comet">comet</a>s in <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a>.

Composition is calculated from three primary sources: <a href="albedo">albedo</a>, surface spectrum, and density. The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280 km in diameter, and include <a href="121%20Hermione">121 Hermione</a> (268×186×183 km), and <a href="87%20Sylvia">87 Sylvia</a> (384×262×232 km). Only half a dozen asteroids are <a href="List%20of%20notable%20asteroids%23Largest%20by%20diameter">larger than 87 Sylvia</a>, though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed <a href="511%20Davida">511 Davida</a>, the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.

On 7 October 2009, the presence of <a href="ice">water ice</a> was confirmed on the surface of <a href="24%20Themis">24 Themis</a> using <a href="NASA">NASA</a>’s <a href="Infrared%20Telescope%20Facility">Infrared Telescope Facility</a>. The surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice. As this <a href="ice">ice</a> layer is <a href="Sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimated</a>, it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface. Organic compounds were also detected on the surface. Scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to <a href="Earth">Earth</a> was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. The presence of ice on 24 Themis supports this theory.

In October 2013, water was detected on an extrasolar body for the first time, on an asteroid orbiting the <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> <a href="GD%2061">GD 61</a>. On 22 January 2014, <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a> (ESA) scientists reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of <a href="water%20vapor">water vapor</a> on <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a>, the largest object in the asteroid belt. The detection was made by using the <a href="Far-infrared%20astronomy">far-infrared abilities</a> of the <a href="Herschel%20Space%20Observatory">Herschel Space Observatory</a>. The finding is unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to "sprout jets and plumes". According to one of the scientists, "The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids." In May 2016, significant asteroid data arising from the <a href="Wide-field%20Infrared%20Survey%20Explorer">Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</a> and <a href="Wide-field%20Infrared%20Survey%20Explorer%23NEOWISE">NEOWISE</a> missions have been questioned, but the criticism has yet to undergo peer review.

Most asteroids outside the "<a href="List%20of%20exceptional%20asteroids%23Largest%20by%20mass">big four</a>" (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Hygiea) are likely to be broadly similar in appearance, if irregular in shape. 50-km (31-mi) <a href="253%20Mathilde">253 Mathilde</a> is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroid's radius, and Earth-based observations of 300-km (186-mi) <a href="511%20Davida">511 Davida</a>, one of the largest asteroids after the big four, reveal a similarly angular profile, suggesting it is also saturated with radius-size craters. Medium-sized asteroids such as Mathilde and <a href="243%20Ida">243 Ida</a> that have been observed up close also reveal a deep <a href="regolith">regolith</a> covering the surface. Of the big four, Pallas and Hygiea are practically unknown. Vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius-size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a <a href="spheroid">spheroid</a>. Ceres seems quite different in the glimpses Hubble has provided, with surface features that are unlikely to be due to simple craters and impact basins, but details will be expanded with the "<a href="Dawn%20%28spacecraft%29">Dawn</a>" spacecraft, which entered Ceres orbit on 6 March 2015.

Asteroids become darker and redder with age due to <a href="space%20weathering">space weathering</a>. However evidence suggests most of the color change occurs rapidly, in the first hundred thousands years, limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids.

Asteroids are commonly classified according to two criteria: the characteristics of their orbits, and features of their reflectance <a href="visible%20spectrum">spectrum</a>.

Many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Apart from the broadest divisions, it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past. Families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt, but several small families have been reported among the <a href="Jupiter%20trojan">Jupiter trojan</a>s. Main belt families were first recognized by <a href="Kiyotsugu%20Hirayama">Kiyotsugu Hirayama</a> in 1918 and are often called <a href="Hirayama%20families">Hirayama families</a> in his honor.

About 30–35% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids. A family has also been associated with the plutoid <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a> .

Some asteroids have unusual <a href="horseshoe%20orbit">horseshoe orbit</a>s that are co-orbital with <a href="Earth">Earth</a> or some other planet. Examples are <a href="3753%20Cruithne">3753 Cruithne</a> and . The first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>'s moons <a href="Epimetheus%20%28moon%29">Epimetheus</a> and <a href="Janus%20%28moon%29">Janus</a>.

Sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become <a href="quasi-satellite">quasi-satellite</a>s for a few decades or a few hundred years, before returning to their earlier status. Both Earth and <a href="Venus">Venus</a> are known to have quasi-satellites.

Such objects, if associated with Earth or Venus or even hypothetically <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>, are a special class of <a href="Aten%20asteroid">Aten asteroid</a>s. However, such objects could be associated with outer planets as well.

In 1975, an asteroid <a href="Taxonomy%20%28general%29">taxonomic</a> system based on <a href="color">color</a>, <a href="albedo">albedo</a>, and <a href="spectral%20line">spectral shape</a> was developed by <a href="Clark%20R.%20Chapman">Clark R. Chapman</a>, <a href="David%20Morrison%20%28astrophysicist%29">David Morrison</a>, and <a href="Ben%20Zellner">Ben Zellner</a>. These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. The original classification system had three categories: <a href="C-type%20asteroid">C-types</a> for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids), <a href="S-type%20asteroid">S-types</a> for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.

The two most widely used taxonomies now used are the <a href="Tholen%20classification">Tholen classification</a> and <a href="SMASS%20classification">SMASS classification</a>. The former was proposed in 1984 by <a href="David%20J.%20Tholen">David J. Tholen</a>, and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 asteroid categories. In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the <a href="M-type%20asteroid">M-type</a>. There are also several smaller classes.

The proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.

Originally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition. However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion. Although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.

A newly discovered asteroid is given a <a href="Provisional%20designation%20in%20astronomy">provisional designation</a> (such as ) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the <a href="half-month">half-month</a> of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. <a href="433%20Eros">433 Eros</a>). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. (433) Eros), but dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text. In addition, names can be proposed by the asteroid's discoverer, within guidelines established by the International Astronomical Union.

The first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets. By 1855 there were two dozen asteroid symbols, which often occurred in multiple variants.

In 1851, after the fifteenth asteroid (<a href="15%20Eunomia">Eunomia</a>) had been discovered, <a href="Johann%20Franz%20Encke">Johann Franz Encke</a> made a major change in the upcoming 1854 edition of the "<a href="Berliner%20Astronomisches%20Jahrbuch">Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch</a>" (BAJ, "Berlin Astronomical Yearbook"). He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned ① to the fifth, <a href="5%20Astraea">Astraea</a>, while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers, and the next asteroid to be discovered (<a href="16%20Psyche">16 Psyche</a>, in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery. However, Psyche was given an iconic symbol as well, as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above). <a href="20%20Massalia">20 Massalia</a> was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol, and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of <a href="37%20Fides">37 Fides</a>. That year Astraea's number was increased to ⑤, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.

Until the age of <a href="Spaceflight">space travel</a>, objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their <a href="light%20curve">light curve</a>s (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). <a href="Radar">Radar</a> imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of <a href="delta-v">delta-v</a> and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.

The first close-up photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in 1971, when the "<a href="Mariner%209">Mariner 9</a>" probe imaged <a href="Phobos%20%28moon%29">Phobos</a> and <a href="Deimos%20%28moon%29">Deimos</a>, the two small moons of <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, which are probably captured asteroids. These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the <a href="Voyager%20program">Voyager</a> probes of the small moons of the <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a>s.

The first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was <a href="951%20Gaspra">951 Gaspra</a> in 1991, followed in 1993 by <a href="243%20Ida">243 Ida</a> and its moon <a href="Dactyl%20%28asteroid%29">Dactyl</a>, all of which were imaged by the <a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">"Galileo" probe</a> en route to <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>.

The first dedicated asteroid probe was "<a href="NEAR%20Shoemaker">NEAR Shoemaker</a>", which photographed <a href="253%20Mathilde">253 Mathilde</a> in 1997, before entering into orbit around <a href="433%20Eros">433 Eros</a>, finally landing on its surface in 2001.

Other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include <a href="9969%20Braille">9969 Braille</a> (by "<a href="Deep%20Space%201">Deep Space 1</a>" in 1999), and <a href="5535%20Annefrank">5535 Annefrank</a> (by "<a href="Stardust%20%28spacecraft%29">Stardust</a>" in 2002).

In September 2005, the Japanese "<a href="Hayabusa%20%28spacecraft%29">Hayabusa</a>" probe started studying <a href="25143%20Itokawa">25143 Itokawa</a> in detail and was plagued with difficulties, but <a href="Sample%20return%20mission">returned samples</a> of its surface to Earth on 13 June 2010.

The European <a href="Rosetta%20%28spacecraft%29">"Rosetta" probe</a> (launched in 2004) flew by <a href="2867%20%C5%A0teins">2867 Šteins</a> in 2008 and <a href="21%20Lutetia">21 Lutetia</a>, the third-largest asteroid visited to date, in 2010.

In September 2007, <a href="NASA">NASA</a> launched the <a href="Dawn%20%28spacecraft%29">"Dawn" spacecraft</a>, which orbited <a href="4%20Vesta">4 Vesta</a> from July 2011 to September 2012, and has been orbiting the dwarf planet <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">1 Ceres</a> since 2015. 4 Vesta is the second-largest asteroid visited to date.

On 13 December 2012, China's lunar orbiter "<a href="Chang%27e%202">Chang'e 2</a>" flew within of the asteroid <a href="4179%20Toutatis">4179 Toutatis</a> on an extended mission.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the "<a href="Hayabusa%202">Hayabusa 2</a>" probe in December 2014, and plans to return samples from <a href="162173%20Ryugu">162173 Ryugu</a> in December 2020.

In May 2011, NASA selected the <a href="OSIRIS-REx">OSIRIS-REx</a> sample return mission to asteroid <a href="101955%20Bennu">101955 Bennu</a>; it launched on September 8, 2016.

In early 2013, NASA announced the planning stages of a mission to capture a near-Earth asteroid and move it into lunar orbit where it could possibly be visited by astronauts and later impacted into the Moon. On 19 June 2014, NASA reported that asteroid <a href="2011%20MD">2011 MD</a> was a prime candidate for capture by a robotic mission, perhaps in the early 2020s.

It has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on Earth (<a href="asteroid%20mining">asteroid mining</a>), or materials for constructing <a href="space%20habitat">space habitat</a>s "(see <a href="Colonization%20of%20the%20asteroids">Colonization of the asteroids</a>)". Materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from Earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for <a href="space%20manufacturing">space manufacturing</a> and construction.

In the U.S. <a href="Discovery%20program">Discovery program</a> the <a href="Psyche%20%28spacecraft%29">"Psyche" spacecraft</a> proposal to <a href="16%20Psyche">16 Psyche</a> and <a href="Lucy%20%28spacecraft%29">"Lucy" spacecraft</a> to <a href="Jupiter%20trojan">Jupiter trojan</a>s made it to the semifinalist stage of mission selection.

Asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories. Asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction: as places human beings might colonize, resources for extracting minerals, hazards encountered by spacecraft traveling between two other points, and as a threat to life on Earth or other inhabited planets, dwarf planets and natural satellites by potential impact.

An allocution allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient. In <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a>s, an allocution may be required of the defendant. The defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail the actions and their reasons in exchange for a reduced sentence.

In principle, that removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant's guilt in the matter.

The term "allocution" is used generally only in jurisdictions in the United States, but there are vaguely similar processes in other <a href="common%20law%20countries">common law countries</a>. In many other jurisdictions, it is for the defense lawyer to mitigate on his client's behalf, and the defendant rarely has the opportunity to speak.

The right of victims to speak at sentencing is also sometimes referred to as allocution.

In <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, the term "allocutus" is used by the Clerk of Arraigns or another formal associate of the Court. It is generally phrased as, "Prisoner at the Bar, you have been found Guilty by a jury of your peers of the offense of XYZ. Do you have anything to say as to why the sentence of this Court should not now be passed upon you?" The defense counsel will then make a "plea in mitigation" (also called "submissions on penalty") in an attempt to mitigate the relative seriousness of the offense and heavily refer to and rely upon the defendant's previous good character and good works, if any.

The right to make a plea in mitigation is absolute. If a judge or magistrate refused to hear such a plea or obviously did not properly consider it, the sentence could be overturned on appeal.

In most of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, defendants are allowed the opportunity to allocute before a sentence is passed. Some jurisdictions hold that as an absolute right. In its absence, a sentence but not the conviction may be overturned, resulting in the need for a new sentencing hearing. In the federal system, <a href="Federal%20Rule%20of%20Criminal%20Procedure">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure</a> 32(i)(4) provides that the court must "address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence."

The <a href="Federal%20Public%20Defender">Federal Public Defender</a> recommends that defendants speak in terms of how a lenient sentence will be sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory directives set forth in .

Affidavit

An affidavit ( ) is a written <a href="Oath">sworn statement of fact</a> voluntarily made by an "affiant" or "deponent" under an oath or affirmation administered by a person authorized to do so by law. Such statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiant's <a href="signature">signature</a> by a taker of oaths, such as a <a href="notary%20public">notary public</a> or commissioner of oaths. The name is <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> for "he/she has declared upon oath". An affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing, or in other words, it contains a verification, meaning it is under oath or penalty of perjury, and this serves as evidence to its veracity and is required for court proceedings.
It is done with the help of court, with a stamp paper.
Affidavits may be written in the first or third person, depending on who drafted the document. If in the first person, the document's component parts are typically as follows:

If an affidavit is notarized or authenticated, it will also include a caption with a venue and title in reference to judicial proceedings. In some cases, an introductory clause, called a "preamble", is added attesting that the affiant personally appeared before the authenticating authority.

On 2 March 2016, the High Court of Australia held that the ACT Uniform Evidence Legislation is neutral in the way sworn evidence and unsworn evidence is treated as being of equal weight.

In Indian law, although an affidavit may be taken as proof of the facts stated therein, the Courts have no jurisdiction to admit evidence by way of affidavit. Affidavit is treated as "evidence" within the meaning of Section 3 of the Evidence Act. However, it was held by the Supreme Court that an affidavit can be used as evidence only if the Court so orders for sufficient reasons, namely, the right of the opposite party to have the deponent produced for cross-examination (Khandesh Spg & Wvg Mills CO. Ltd. Vs Rashtriya Girni Kamgar Sangh, citation 1960 AIR571, 1960 SCR(2) 841). Therefore, an affidavit cannot ordinarily be used as evidence in absence of a specific order of the Court.

Affidavits are made in a similar way as to England and Wales, although "make oath" is sometimes omitted. A declaration may be substituted for an affidavit in most cases for those opposed to swearing oaths. The person making the affidavit is known as the deponent but does not sign the affidavit. The affidavit concludes in the standard format "sworn (declared) before me, [name of commissioner for oaths/solicitor], a commissioner for oaths (solicitor), on the [date] at [location] in the county/city of [county/city], and I know the deponent (declarant)", and it is signed and stamped by the commissioner for oaths.

In American <a href="jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a>, under the rules for <a href="Hearsay%20in%20United%20States%20law">hearsay</a>, admission of an unsupported affidavit as evidence is unusual (especially if the affiant is not available for <a href="cross-examination">cross-examination</a>) with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar. Affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated, or who cannot be located or made to appear, may be accepted by the court, but usually only in the presence of <a href="corroborating%20evidence">corroborating evidence</a>. An affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witness's recollection. Materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence. If the affiant is a party in the case, the affiant's opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence, as statements by a party-opponent are admissible through an exception to the hearsay rule.

Affidavits are typically included in the response to <a href="interrogatories">interrogatories</a>. <a href="Requests%20for%20admissions">Requests for admissions</a> under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36, however, are not required to be sworn.

Some types of motions will not be accepted by the court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence, in support of the need for the motion. In such a case, a court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion, as certain assumptions are made, to wit: The affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes <a href="judicial%20economy">judicial economy</a>. The lawyer is an <a href="officer%20of%20the%20court">officer of the court</a> and knows that a false swearing by him, if found out, could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including <a href="disbarment">disbarment</a>. The lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit. 

The acceptance of an affidavit by one society does not confirm its acceptance as a legal document in other jurisdictions. Equally, the acceptance that a lawyer is an officer of the court (for swearing the affidavit) is not a given. This matter is addressed by the use of the apostille, a means of certifying the legalization of a document for international use under the terms of the <a href="Apostille%20Convention">1961 Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents</a>. Documents which have been notarized by a notary public, and certain other documents, and then certified with a conformant apostille, are accepted for legal use in all the nations that have signed the Hague Convention. Thus most affidavits now require to be apostilled if used for cross border issues.

Aries (constellation)

Aries is one of the <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s of the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a>. It is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between <a href="Pisces%20%28constellation%29">Pisces</a> to the west and <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a> to the east. The name Aries is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for <a href="sheep">ram</a>, and its symbol is (Unicode ♈), representing a ram's horns. It is one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is a mid-sized constellation, ranking 39th overall size, with an area of 441 square degrees (1.1% of the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>).

Although Aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the <a href="Golden%20Fleece">Golden Fleece</a> of <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20mythology">Ancient Greek mythology</a>, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, the stars of Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: <a href="Hamal">Hamal</a> (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), <a href="Sheratan">Sheratan</a> (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), <a href="Mesarthim">Mesarthim</a> (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and <a href="41%20Arietis">41 Arietis</a> (also fourth magnitude). The few <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a>s appear to radiate from Aries, including the <a href="Daytime%20Arietids">Daytime Arietids</a> and the <a href="Epsilon%20Arietids">Epsilon Arietids</a>.

Aries is now recognized as an official constellation, albeit as a specific region of the sky, by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a>. It was originally defined in ancient texts as a specific pattern of stars, and has remained a constellation since ancient times; it now includes the ancient pattern as well as the surrounding stars. In the description of the <a href="Babylonian%20zodiac">Babylonian zodiac</a> given in the clay tablets known as the <a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a>, the constellation now known as Aries was the final station along the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>. The MUL.APIN was a comprehensive table of the risings and settings of stars, which likely served as an agricultural calendar. Modern-day Aries was known as , "The Agrarian Worker" or "The Hired Man". Although likely compiled in the 12th or 11th century BC, the MUL.APIN reflects a tradition which marks the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a> as the <a href="vernal%20equinox">vernal equinox</a>, which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the <a href="Middle%20Bronze%20Age">Middle Bronze Age</a>. The earliest identifiable reference to Aries as a distinct constellation comes from the <a href="boundary%20stone">boundary stone</a>s that date from 1350 to 1000 BC. On several boundary stones, a zodiacal ram figure is distinct from the other characters present. The shift in identification from the constellation as the Agrarian Worker to the Ram likely occurred in later Babylonian tradition because of its growing association with <a href="Dumuzi%20the%20Shepherd">Dumuzi the Shepherd</a>. By the time the MUL.APIN was created—by 1000 BC—modern Aries was identified with both Dumuzi's ram and a hired laborer. The exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to the lack of images of Aries or other ram figures.

In <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20astronomy">ancient Egyptian astronomy</a>, Aries was associated with the god <a href="Amon-Ra">Amon-Ra</a>, who was depicted as a man with a ram's head and represented fertility and creativity. Because it was the location of the vernal equinox, it was called the "Indicator of the Reborn Sun". During the times of the year when Aries was prominent, priests would process statues of Amon-Ra to temples, a practice that was modified by <a href="Persian%20astronomy">Persian astronomers</a> centuries later. Aries acquired the title of "Lord of the Head" in Egypt, referring to its symbolic and mythological importance.

Aries was not fully accepted as a constellation until classical times. In <a href="Hellenistic%20astrology">Hellenistic astrology</a>, the constellation of Aries is associated with the golden ram of <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> that rescued <a href="Phrixos">Phrixos</a> and <a href="Helle%20%28mythology%29">Helle</a> on orders from <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, taking Phrixos to the land of <a href="Colchis">Colchis</a>. Phrixos and Helle were the son and daughter of King <a href="Athamas">Athamas</a> and his first wife <a href="Nephele">Nephele</a>. The king's second wife, <a href="Ino%20%28Greek%20mythology%29">Ino</a>, was jealous and wished to kill his children. To accomplish this, she induced a famine in <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>, then falsified a message from the <a href="Oracle%20of%20Delphi">Oracle of Delphi</a> that said Phrixos must be sacrificed to end the famine. Athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop <a href="Mount%20Laphystium">Mount Laphystium</a> when Aries, sent by Nephele, arrived. Helle fell off of Aries's back in flight and drowned in the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>, also called the Hellespont in her honor. After arriving, Phrixos sacrificed the ram to <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and gave the Fleece to <a href="Ae%C3%ABtes">Aeëtes</a> of <a href="Colchis">Colchis</a>, who rewarded him with an engagement to his daughter <a href="Chalciope">Chalciope</a>. Aeëtes hung its skin in a sacred place where it became known as the <a href="Golden%20Fleece">Golden Fleece</a> and was guarded by a dragon. In a later myth, this Golden Fleece was stolen by <a href="Jason">Jason</a> and the <a href="Argonauts">Argonauts</a>.

Historically, Aries has been depicted as a crouched, wingless ram with its head turned towards Taurus. <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> asserted in his "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>" that <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a> depicted <a href="Alpha%20Arietis">Alpha Arietis</a> as the ram's muzzle, though Ptolemy did not include it in his constellation figure. Instead, it was listed as an "unformed star", and denoted as "the star over the head". <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a>, in his "<a href="Atlas%20Coelestis">Atlas Coelestis</a>", followed Ptolemy's description by mapping it above the figure's head. Flamsteed followed the general convention of maps by depicting Aries lying down. Astrologically, Aries has been associated with the head and its <a href="humorism">humors</a>. It was strongly associated with <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, both the planet and the god. It was considered to govern Western Europe and Syria, and to indicate a strong temper in a person.

The <a href="First%20Point%20of%20Aries">First Point of Aries</a>, the location of the <a href="vernal%20equinox">vernal equinox</a>, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the <a href="celestial%20equator">celestial equator</a> from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of <a href="Gamma%20Arietis">Gamma Arietis</a>. Because of the <a href="precession%20of%20the%20equinoxes">precession of the equinoxes</a>, the First Point of Aries has since moved into <a href="Pisces%20%28constellation%29">Pisces</a> and will move into <a href="Aquarius%20%28constellation%29">Aquarius</a> by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.

<a href="Islamic%20astronomy">Medieval Muslim astronomers</a> depicted Aries in various ways. Astronomers like <a href="al-Sufi">al-Sufi</a> saw the constellation as a ram, modeled on the precedent of Ptolemy. However, some Islamic celestial globes depicted Aries as a nondescript four-legged animal with what may be antlers instead of horns. Some early <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> observers saw a ram elsewhere in the sky; this constellation featured the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a> as the ram's tail. The generally accepted Arabic formation of Aries consisted of thirteen stars in a figure along with five "unformed" stars, four of which were over the animal's hindquarters and one of which was the disputed star over Aries's head. Al-Sufi's depiction differed from both other Arab astronomers' and Flamsteed's, in that his Aries was running and looking behind itself.

The <a href="obsolete%20constellations">obsolete constellations</a> introduced in Aries (<a href="Musca%20Borealis">Musca Borealis</a>, <a href="Lilium%20%28constellation%29">Lilium</a>, <a href="Vespa%20%28constellation%29">Vespa</a>, and <a href="Apes%20%28constellation%29">Apes</a>) have all been composed of the northern stars. Musca Borealis was created from the stars <a href="33%20Arietis">33 Arietis</a>, <a href="35%20Arietis">35 Arietis</a>, <a href="39%20Arietis">39 Arietis</a>, and <a href="41%20Arietis">41 Arietis</a>. In 1612, <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> introduced Apes, a constellation representing a bee. In 1624, the same stars were used by <a href="Jakob%20Bartsch">Jakob Bartsch</a> to create a constellation called Vespa, representing a wasp. In 1679 <a href="Augustin%20Royer">Augustin Royer</a> used these stars for his constellation Lilium, representing the <a href="fleur-de-lis">fleur-de-lis</a>. None of these constellation became widely accepted. <a href="Johann%20Hevelius">Johann Hevelius</a> renamed the constellation "Musca" in 1690 in his "<a href="Firmamentum%20Sobiescianum">Firmamentum Sobiescianum</a>". To differentiate it from <a href="Musca">Musca</a>, the southern fly, it was later renamed Musca Borealis but it did not gain acceptance and its stars were ultimately officially reabsorbed into Aries.

In 1922, the International Astronomical Union defined its recommended three-letter abbreviation, "Ari". The official boundaries of Aries were defined in 1930 by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> as a polygon of 12 segments. Its <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> is between 1 46.4 and 3 29.4 and its <a href="declination">declination</a> is between 10.36° and 31.22° in the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>.

In traditional <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, stars from Aries were used in several constellations. The brightest stars—Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis—formed a constellation called "Lou", variously translated as "bond", "lasso", and "sickle", which was associated with the ritual sacrifice of cattle. This name was shared by the <a href="Twenty-eight%20mansions">16th lunar mansion</a>, the location of the full moon closest to the <a href="autumnal%20equinox">autumnal equinox</a>. The lunar mansion represented the area where animals were gathered before sacrifice around that time. This constellation has also been associated with harvest-time as it could represent a woman carrying a basket of food on her head. <a href="35%20Arietis">35</a>, <a href="39%20Arietis">39</a>, and <a href="41%20Arietis">41 Arietis</a> were part of a constellation called "Wei", which represented a fat abdomen and was the namesake of the 17th lunar mansion, which represented <a href="granary">granaries</a>. <a href="Delta%20Arietis">Delta</a> and <a href="Zeta%20Arietis">Zeta Arietis</a> were a part of the constellation "Tianyin", thought to represent the Emperor's hunting partner. "Zuogeng" ("Tso-kang"), a constellation depicting a marsh and pond inspector, was composed of <a href="Mu%20Arietis">Mu</a>, <a href="Nu%20Arietis">Nu</a>, <a href="Omicron%20Arietis">Omicron</a>, <a href="Pi%20Arietis">Pi</a>, and <a href="Sigma%20Arietis">Sigma Arietis</a>. He was accompanied by "Yeou-kang", a constellation depicting an official in charge of pasture distribution.

In a similar system to the Chinese, the first lunar mansion in <a href="Hindu%20astronomy">Hindu astronomy</a> was called "Aswini", after the traditional names for Beta and Gamma Arietis, the <a href="Ashvins">Aswins</a>. Because the Hindu new year began with the vernal equinox, the <a href="Rig%20Veda">Rig Veda</a> contains over 50 new-year's related hymns to the twins, making them some of the most prominent characters in the work. Aries itself was known as ""Aja"" and ""Mesha"". In <a href="Hebrew%20astronomy">Hebrew astronomy</a> Aries was named ""Teli""; it signified either <a href="Tribe%20of%20Simeon">Simeon</a> or <a href="Tribe%20of%20Gad">Gad</a>, and generally symbolizes the "Lamb of the World". The neighboring <a href="Syria">Syria</a>ns named the constellation "Amru", and the bordering Turks named it "Kuzi". Half a world away, in the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a>, several stars from Aries were incorporated into a constellation depicting a <a href="porpoise">porpoise</a>, along with stars from <a href="Cassiopeia%20%28constellation%29">Cassiopeia</a>, <a href="Andromeda%20%28constellation%29">Andromeda</a>, and <a href="Triangulum">Triangulum</a>. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis formed the head of the porpoise, while stars from Andromeda formed the body and the bright stars of Cassiopeia formed the tail. Other <a href="Polynesian%20people">Polynesian people</a>s recognized Aries as a constellation. The <a href="Marquesas">Marquesas</a> islanders called it "Na-pai-ka"; the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> constellation "Pipiri" may correspond to modern Aries as well. In indigenous Peruvian astronomy, a constellation with most of the same stars as Aries existed. It was called the "Market Moon" and the "Kneeling Terrace", as a reminder for when to hold the annual harvest festival, <a href="Ayri%20Huay">Ayri Huay</a>.

Aries has three prominent stars forming an <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a>, designated Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>. All three are commonly used for navigation. There is also one other star above the fourth magnitude, 41 Arietis. <a href="Alpha%20Arietis">α Arietis</a>, called Hamal, is the brightest <a href="star">star</a> in Aries. Its traditional name is derived from the Arabic word for "lamb" or "head of the ram" ("ras al-hamal"), which references Aries's mythological background. With a <a href="spectral%20class">spectral class</a> of K2 and a <a href="luminosity%20class">luminosity class</a> of III, it is an <a href="orange%20giant">orange giant</a> with an <a href="apparent%20visual%20magnitude">apparent visual magnitude</a> of 2.00, which lies 66 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth. Hamal has a <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of and its <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> is −0.1.

<a href="Beta%20Arietis">β Arietis</a>, also known as Sheratan, is a blue-white star with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.64. Its traditional name is derived from ""sharatayn"", the Arabic word for "the two signs", referring to both Beta and Gamma Arietis in their position as heralds of the vernal equinox. The two stars were known to the <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> as ""qarna al-hamal"", "horns of the ram". It is 59 light-years from Earth. It has a luminosity of and its absolute magnitude is 2.1. It is a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> star, one in which the companion star is only known through <a href="spectroscopy">analysis of the spectra</a>. The spectral class of the primary is A5. <a href="Hermann%20Carl%20Vogel">Hermann Carl Vogel</a> determined that Sheratan was a spectroscopic binary in 1903; its orbit was determined by <a href="Hans%20Ludendorff">Hans Ludendorff</a> in 1907. It has since been studied for its eccentric orbit.

<a href="Gamma%20Arietis">γ Arietis</a>, with a common name of Mesarthim, is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> with two white-hued components, located in a rich field of magnitude 8–12 stars. Its traditional name has conflicting derivations. It may be derived from a corruption of "al-sharatan", the Arabic word meaning "pair" or a word for "fat ram". However, it may also come from the Sanskrit for "first star of Aries" or the Hebrew for "ministerial servants", both of which are unusual languages of origin for star names. Along with Beta Arietis, it was known to the Bedouin as ""qarna al-hamal"". The primary is of magnitude 4.59 and the secondary is of magnitude 4.68. The system is 164 light-years from Earth. The two components are separated by 7.8 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s, and the system as a whole has an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 3.9. The primary has a luminosity of and the secondary has a luminosity of ; the primary is an A-type star with an absolute magnitude of 0.2 and the secondary is a B9-type star with an absolute magnitude of 0.4. The angle between the two components is 1°. Mesarthim was discovered to be a double star by <a href="Robert%20Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> in 1664, one of the earliest such telescopic discoveries. The primary, γ Arietis, is an <a href="Alpha%C2%B2%20Canum%20Venaticorum%20variable">Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable</a> star that has a range of 0.02 magnitudes and a period of 2.607 days. It is unusual because of its strong <a href="silicon">silicon</a> <a href="emission%20lines">emission lines</a>.

The constellation is home to several double stars, including Epsilon, Lambda, and Pi Arietis. <a href="Epsilon%20Arietis">ε Arietis</a> is a binary star with two white components. The primary is of magnitude 5.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 5.5. The system is 290 light-years from Earth. Its overall magnitude is 4.63, and the primary has an absolute magnitude of 1.4. Its spectral class is A2. The two components are separated by 1.5 arcseconds. <a href="Lambda%20Arietis">λ Arietis</a> is a wide double star with a white-hued primary and a yellow-hued secondary. The primary is of magnitude 4.8 and the secondary is of magnitude 7.3. The primary is 129 light-years from Earth. It has an absolute magnitude of 1.7 and a spectral class of F0. The two components are separated by 36 arcseconds at an angle of 50°; the two stars are located 0.5° east of <a href="7%20Arietis">7 Arietis</a>. <a href="Pi%20Arietis">π Arietis</a> is a close binary star with a blue-white primary and a white secondary. The primary is of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is of magnitude 8.5. The primary is 776 light-years from Earth. The primary itself is a wide double star with a separation of 25.2 arcseconds; the tertiary has a magnitude of 10.8. The primary and secondary are separated by 3.2 arcseconds.

Most of the other stars in Aries visible to the naked eye have magnitudes between 3 and 5. <a href="Delta%20Arietis">δ Ari</a>, called Boteïn, is a star of magnitude 4.35, 170 light-years away. It has an absolute magnitude of −0.1 and a spectral class of K2. <a href="Zeta%20Arietis">ζ Arietis</a> is a star of magnitude 4.89, 263 light-years away. Its spectral class is A0 and its absolute magnitude is 0.0. <a href="14%20Arietis">14 Arietis</a> is a star of magnitude 4.98, 288 light-years away. Its spectral class is F2 and its absolute magnitude is 0.6. <a href="39%20Arietis">39 Arietis</a> is a similar star of magnitude 4.51, 172 light-years away. Its spectral class is K1 and its absolute magnitude is 0.0. <a href="35%20Arietis">35 Arietis</a> is a dim star of magnitude 4.55, 343 light-years away. Its spectral class is B3 and its absolute magnitude is −1.7. <a href="41%20Arietis">41 Arietis</a>, known both as c Arietis and Nair al Butain, is a brighter star of magnitude 3.63, 165 light-years away. Its spectral class is B8 and it has a luminosity of . Its absolute magnitude is −0.2. <a href="53%20Arietis">53 Arietis</a> is a <a href="runaway%20star">runaway star</a> of magnitude 6.09, 815 light-years away. Its spectral class is B2. It was likely ejected from the <a href="Orion%20Nebula">Orion Nebula</a> approximately five million years ago, possibly due to <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e. Finally, <a href="Teegarden%27s%20Star">Teegarden's Star</a> is the closest star to Earth in Aries. It is a <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> of magnitude 15.14 and spectral class M6.5V. With a proper motion of 5.1 arcseconds per year, it is the 24th closest star to Earth overall.

Aries has its share of variable stars, including R and U Arietis, Mira-type variable stars, and T Arietis, a semi-regular variable star. <a href="R%20Arietis">R Arietis</a> is a <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira variable</a> star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.7 to a maximum of 7.4 with a period of 186.8 days. It is 4,080 light-years away. <a href="U%20Arietis">U Arietis</a> is another Mira variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 15.2 to a maximum of 7.2 with a period of 371.1 days. <a href="T%20Arietis">T Arietis</a> is a <a href="semiregular%20variable%20star">semiregular variable star</a> that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 11.3 to a maximum of 7.5 with a period of 317 days. It is 1,630 light-years away. One particularly interesting variable in Aries is <a href="SX%20Arietis">SX Arietis</a>, a rotating variable star considered to be the prototype of its class, <a href="helium%20variable">helium variable</a> stars. SX Arietis stars have very prominent emission lines of Helium I and Silicon III. They are normally main-sequence B0p—B9p stars, and their variations are not usually visible to the naked eye. Therefore, they are observed photometrically, usually having periods that fit in the course of one night. Similar to <a href="Alpha%C2%B2%20Canum%20Venaticorum%20variable">Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable</a>s, SX Arietis stars have periodic changes in their light and magnetic field, which correspond to the periodic rotation; they differ from the Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variables in their higher temperature. There are between 39 and 49 SX Arietis variable stars currently known; ten are noted as being "uncertain" in the <a href="General%20Catalog%20of%20Variable%20Stars">General Catalog of Variable Stars</a>.

The few <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s in Aries are very dim. Nevertheless, several scientifically interesting galaxies lie within its borders; it has <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral</a>, <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical</a>, and <a href="interacting%20galaxies">interacting galaxies</a>.

<a href="NGC%20772">NGC 772</a> is a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> with an <a href="integrated%20magnitude">integrated magnitude</a> of 10.3, located southeast of β Arietis and 15 arcminutes west of <a href="15%20Arietis">15 Arietis</a>. It is a relatively bright galaxy and shows obvious nebulosity and ellipticity in an amateur telescope. It is 7.2 by 4.2 arcminutes, meaning that its <a href="surface%20brightness">surface brightness</a>, magnitude 13.6, is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude. NGC 772 is a <a href="galaxy%20morphological%20classification">class SA(s)b galaxy</a>, which means that it is an unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent <a href="bulge%20%28astronomy%29">bulge</a> and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly. The main arm, on the northwest side of the galaxy, is home to many <a href="star%20formation">star forming regions</a>; this is due to previous <a href="galaxy%20merger">gravitational interactions</a> with other galaxies. NGC 772 has a small companion galaxy, <a href="NGC%20770">NGC 770</a>, that is about 113,000 light-years away from the larger galaxy. The two galaxies together are also classified as Arp 78 in the <a href="Arp%20number">Arp peculiar galaxy catalog</a>. NGC 772 has a diameter of 240,000 light-years and the system is 114 million light-years from Earth. Another spiral galaxy in Aries is <a href="NGC%20673">NGC 673</a>, a face-on class SAB(s)c galaxy. It is a weakly <a href="barred%20spiral%20galaxy">barred spiral galaxy</a> with loosely wound arms. It has no ring and a faint bulge and is 2.5 by 1.9 arcminutes. It has two primary arms with fragments located farther from the core. 171,000 light-years in diameter, NGC 673 is 235 million light-years from Earth.

<a href="NGC%20678">NGC 678</a> and <a href="NGC%20680">NGC 680</a> are a pair of galaxies in Aries that are only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the <a href="NGC%20691">NGC 691</a> group of galaxies, both are at a distance of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a> with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at a diameter of 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has a diameter of 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent <a href="dust%20lane">dust lane</a>. NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight. It has multiple spiral arms and a bright core. Because it is so diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has a diameter of 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away. <a href="NGC%20877">NGC 877</a> is the brightest member of an 8-galaxy group that also includes NGC 870, NGC 871, and NGC 876, with a magnitude of 12.53. It is 2.4 by 1.8 arcminutes and is 178 million light-years away with a diameter of 124,000 light-years. Its companion is NGC 876, which is about 103,000 light-years from the core of NGC 877. They are interacting gravitationally, as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust. <a href="Arp%20276">Arp 276</a> is a different pair of interacting galaxies in Aries, consisting of NGC 935 and IC 1801.

NGC 821 is an E6 elliptical galaxy. It is unusual because it has hints of an early spiral structure, which is normally only found in <a href="lenticular%20galaxy">lenticular</a> and spiral galaxies. NGC 821 is 2.6 by 2.0 arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of 11.3. Its diameter is 61,000 light-years and it is 80 million light-years away. Another unusual galaxy in Aries is <a href="Segue%202%20%28dwarf%20galaxy%29">Segue 2</a>. Segue 2 is a <a href="dwarf%20galaxy">dwarf galaxy</a> that is a <a href="List%20of%20Milky%20Way%27s%20satellite%20galaxies">satellite galaxy of the Milky Way</a>, recently discovered to be a potential relic of the <a href="epoch%20of%20reionization">epoch of reionization</a>.

Aries is home to several <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a>s. The <a href="Daytime%20Arietid">Daytime Arietid</a> meteor shower is one of the strongest meteor showers that occurs during the day, lasting from 22 May to 2 July. It is an annual shower associated with the Marsden group of <a href="comet">comet</a>s that peaks on 7 June with a maximum <a href="zenithal%20hourly%20rate">zenithal hourly rate</a> of 54 meteors. Its parent body may be the asteroid <a href="1566%20Icarus">Icarus</a>. The meteors are sometimes visible before dawn, because the <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> is 32 degrees away from the Sun. They usually appear at a rate of 1–2 per hour as "earthgrazers", meteors that last several seconds and often begin at the horizon. Because most of the Daytime Arietids are not visible to the naked eye, they are observed in the <a href="radio%20spectrum">radio spectrum</a>. This is possible because of the ionized gas they leave in their wake. Other meteor showers radiate from Aries during the day; these include the Daytime Epsilon Arietids and the Northern and Southern Daytime May Arietids. The <a href="Jodrell%20Bank%20Observatory">Jodrell Bank Observatory</a> discovered the Daytime Arietids in 1947 when James Hey and G. S. Stewart adapted the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%23Control%20systems">World War II-era radar systems</a> for meteor observations.

The <a href="Delta%20Arietids">Delta Arietids</a> are another meteor shower radiating from Aries. Peaking on 9 December with a low peak rate, the shower lasts from 8 December to 14 January, with the highest rates visible from 8 to 14 December. The average Delta Aquarid meteor is very slow, with an average velocity of per second. However, this shower sometimes produces bright <a href="Fireball%20%28meteor%29">fireball</a>s. This meteor shower has northern and southern components, both of which are likely associated with <a href="1990%20HA">1990 HA</a>, a <a href="near-Earth%20asteroid">near-Earth asteroid</a>.

The <a href="Autumn%20Arietids">Autumn Arietids</a> also radiate from Aries. The shower lasts from 7 September to 27 October and peaks on 9 October. Its peak rate is low. The <a href="Epsilon%20Arietids">Epsilon Arietids</a> appear from 12 to 23 October. Other meteor showers radiating from Aries include the October Delta Arietids, <a href="Daytime%20Epsilon%20Arietids">Daytime Epsilon Arietids</a>, <a href="Daytime%20May%20Arietids">Daytime May Arietids</a>, <a href="Sigma%20Arietids">Sigma Arietids</a>, <a href="Nu%20Arietids">Nu Arietids</a>, and <a href="Beta%20Arietids">Beta Arietids</a>. The Sigma Arietids, a class IV meteor shower, are visible from 12 to 19 October, with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of less than two meteors per hour on 19 October.

Aries contains several stars with <a href="extrasolar%20planets">extrasolar planets</a>. <a href="HIP%2014810">HIP 14810</a>, a G5 type star, is orbited by three <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s (those more than ten times the <a href="mass%20of%20Earth">mass of Earth</a>). <a href="HD%2012661">HD 12661</a>, like HIP 14810, is a G-type main sequence star, slightly larger than the Sun, with two orbiting planets. One planet is 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter, and the other is 1.57 times the mass of Jupiter. <a href="HD%2020367">HD 20367</a> is a G0 type star, approximately the size of the Sun, with one orbiting planet. The planet, discovered in 2002, has a mass 1.07 times that of Jupiter and orbits every 500 days.

Aquarius (constellation)

Aquarius is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a>, situated between <a href="Capricornus">Capricornus</a> and <a href="Pisces%20%28constellation%29">Pisces</a>. Its name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier", and its symbol is (Unicode ♒), a representation of water. Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a> (the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>'s apparent path). It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is found in a region often called the <a href="Sea%20%28astronomy%29">Sea</a> due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as <a href="Cetus">Cetus</a> the <a href="whale">whale</a>, <a href="Pisces%20%28constellation%29">Pisces</a> the <a href="fish">fish</a>, and <a href="Eridanus%20%28constellation%29">Eridanus</a> the <a href="river">river</a>.

At <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 2.9, <a href="Beta%20Aquarii">Beta Aquarii</a> is the brightest star in the constellation.

Aquarius is identified as "The Great One" in the <a href="Babylonian%20star%20catalogues">Babylonian star catalogues</a> and represents the god <a href="Ea%20%28god%29">Ea</a> himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase. The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and <a href="cylinder%20seals">cylinder seals</a> from the <a href="2nd%20millennium%20BC">second millennium</a>. It contained the <a href="winter%20solstice">winter solstice</a> in the Early Bronze Age. In <a href="Old%20Babylonian%20astronomy">Old Babylonian astronomy</a>, Ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun's path, the "Way of Ea", corresponding to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice. Aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the Babylonians regularly experienced, and thus was negatively connoted. In <a href="Egyptian%20astronomy%23Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt astronomy</a>, Aquarius was associated with the annual <a href="flood%20of%20the%20Nile">flood of the Nile</a>; the banks were said to flood when Aquarius put his jar into the river, beginning spring.

In the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20astronomy">Greek tradition</a>, the constellation came to be represented simply as a single vase from which a stream poured down to <a href="Piscis%20Austrinus">Piscis Austrinus</a>. The name in the <a href="Hindu%20zodiac">Hindu zodiac</a> is likewise "kumbha" "water-pitcher".

In Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with <a href="Deucalion">Deucalion</a>, the son of <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a> who built a ship with his wife <a href="Pyrrha">Pyrrha</a> to survive an imminent flood. They sailed for nine days before washing ashore on <a href="Mount%20Parnassus">Mount Parnassus</a>. Aquarius is also sometimes identified with beautiful <a href="Ganymede%20%28mythology%29">Ganymede</a>, a youth in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> and the son of <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> king <a href="Tros%20%28mythology%29">Tros</a>, who was taken to <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> by <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> to act as cup-carrier to the <a href="Greek%20pantheon">gods</a>. Neighboring <a href="Aquila%20%28constellation%29">Aquila</a> represents the eagle, under Zeus' command, that snatched the young boy; some versions of the myth indicate that the eagle was in fact Zeus transformed. An alternative version of the tale recounts Ganymede's kidnapping by the goddess of the dawn, <a href="Eos">Eos</a>, motivated by her affection for young men; Zeus then stole him from Eos and employed him as cup-bearer. Yet another figure associated with the water bearer is <a href="Cecrops%20I">Cecrops I</a>, a king of <a href="Athens">Athens</a> who <a href="sacrifice">sacrifice</a>d water instead of <a href="wine">wine</a> to the gods.

In the first century, <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>" established the common Western depiction of Aquarius. His water jar, an asterism itself, consists of Gamma, Pi, Eta, and <a href="Zeta%20Aquarii">Zeta Aquarii</a>; it pours water in a stream of more than 20 stars terminating with <a href="Fomalhaut">Fomalhaut</a>, now assigned solely to <a href="Piscis%20Austrinus">Piscis Austrinus</a>. The water bearer's head is represented by 5th magnitude <a href="25%20Aquarii">25 Aquarii</a> while his left shoulder is <a href="Beta%20Aquarii">Beta Aquarii</a>; his right shoulder and forearm are represented by <a href="Alpha%20Aquarii">Alpha</a> and <a href="Gamma%20Aquarii">Gamma Aquarii</a> respectively.

In <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, the stream of water flowing from the Water Jar was depicted as the "Army of Yu-Lin" ("Yu-lin-kiun" or "Yulinjun"). The name "Yu-lin" means "feathers and forests", referring to the numerous light-footed soldiers from the northern reaches of the empire represented by these faint stars. The constellation's stars were the most numerous of any Chinese constellation, numbering 45, the majority of which were located in modern Aquarius. The celestial army was protected by the wall "Leibizhen", which counted Iota, Lambda, Phi, and Sigma Aquarii among its 12 stars. 88, 89, and 98 Aquarii represent "Fou-youe", the axes used as weapons and for hostage executions. Also in Aquarius is "Loui-pi-tchin", the ramparts that stretch from 29 and 27 Piscium and 33 and 30 Aquarii through Phi, Lambda, Sigma, and Iota Aquarii to Delta, Gamma, Kappa, and Epsilon Capricorni.

Near the border with <a href="Cetus">Cetus</a>, the axe "Fuyue" was represented by three stars; its position is disputed and may have instead been located in <a href="Sculptor%20%28constellation%29">Sculptor</a>. "Tienliecheng" also has a disputed position; the 13-star castle replete with ramparts may have possessed Nu and Xi Aquarii but may instead have been located south in Piscis Austrinus. The Water Jar asterism was seen to the ancient Chinese as the tomb, "Fenmu". Nearby, the emperors' <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a> "Xiuliang" stood, demarcated by Kappa Aquarii and three other collinear stars. "Ku" ("crying") and "Qi" ("weeping"), each composed of two stars, were located in the same region.

Three of the Chinese <a href="lunar%20mansion">lunar mansion</a>s shared their name with constellations. "Nu", also the name for the 10th lunar mansion, was a <a href="handmaiden">handmaiden</a> represented by Epsilon, Mu, 3, and 4 Aquarii. The 11th lunar mansion shared its name with the constellation "Xu" ("emptiness"), formed by Beta Aquarii and Alpha Equulei; it represented a bleak place associated with death and funerals. "Wei", the rooftop and 12th lunar mansion, was a V-shaped constellation formed by Alpha Aquarii, Theta Pegasi, and Epsilon Pegasi; it shared its name with two other Chinese constellations, in modern-day <a href="Scorpius%20%28constellation%29">Scorpius</a> and <a href="Aries%20%28constellation%29">Aries</a>.

Despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size, Aquarius has no particularly bright stars, its four brightest stars being less than magnitude 2. However, recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess <a href="extrasolar%20planet">planetary systems</a>.

The two brightest stars, <a href="Alpha%20Aquarii">Alpha</a> and <a href="Beta%20Aquarii">Beta Aquarii</a>, are luminous yellow supergiants, of spectral types G0Ib and G2Ib respectively, that were once hot blue-white B-class main sequence stars 5 to 9 times as massive as the Sun. The two are also moving through space perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way. Just shading Alpha, Beta Aquarii is the brightest star in Aquarius with an apparent magnitude of 2.91. It also has the proper name of Sadalsuud. Having cooled and swollen to around 50 times the Sun's diameter, it is around 2200 times as luminous as the Sun. It is around 6.4 times as massive as the Sun and around 56 million years old. Sadalsuud is 540 ± 20 light-years from Earth. Alpha Aquarii, also known as Sadalmelik, has an apparent magnitude of 2.94. It is 520 ± 20 light-years distant from Earth, and is around 6.5 times as massive as the Sun and 3000 times as luminous. It is 53 million years old.

<a href="Gamma%20Aquarii">Gamma Aquarii</a>, also called Sadachbia, is a white main sequence star of spectral type star of spectral type A0V that is between 158 and 315 million years old and is around two and a half times the Sun's mass, and double its radius. Of magnitude 3.85, it is 164 ± 9 light years away. It has a luminosity of . The name Sadachbia comes from the Arabic for "lucky stars of the tents", "sa'd al-akhbiya".

<a href="delta%20Aquarii">δ Aquarii</a>, also known as Scheat or Skat, is a blue-white A2 spectral type star of magnitude 3.27 and luminosity of .

<a href="epsilon%20Aquarii">ε Aquarii</a>, also known as Albali, is a blue-white A1 spectral type star with an apparent magnitude of 3.77, an absolute magnitude of 1.2, and a luminosity of .

<a href="zeta%20Aquarii">ζ Aquarii</a> is an F2 spectral type <a href="double%20star">double star</a>; both stars are white. Overall, it appears to be of magnitude 3.6 and luminosity of . The primary has a magnitude of 4.53 and the secondary a magnitude of 4.31, but both have an absolute magnitude of 0.6. Its orbital period is 760 years; the two components are currently moving farther apart.

<a href="theta%20Aquarii">θ Aquarii</a>, sometimes called Ancha, is a G8 spectral type star with an apparent magnitude of 4.16 and an absolute magnitude of 1.4.

<a href="lambda%20Aquarii">λ Aquarii</a>, also called Hudoor or Ekchusis, is an <a href="M-type%20star">M2 spectral type star</a> of magnitude 3.74 and luminosity of .

<a href="xi%20Aquarii">ξ Aquarii</a>, also called Bunda, is an <a href="A-type%20star">A7 spectral type star</a> with an apparent magnitude of 4.69 and an absolute magnitude of 2.4.

<a href="pi%20Aquarii">π Aquarii</a>, also called Seat, is a <a href="B-type%20star">B0 spectral type star</a> with an apparent magnitude of 4.66 and an absolute magnitude of -4.1.

Twelve exoplanet systems have been found in Aquarius as of 2013. <a href="Gliese%20876">Gliese 876</a>, one of the nearest stars to Earth at a distance of 15 light-years, was the first <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> star to be found to possess a <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a>. It is orbited by four planets, including one <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a> 6.6 times the mass of Earth. The planets vary in orbital period from 2 days to 124 days. <a href="91%20Aquarii">91 Aquarii</a> is an <a href="orange%20giant">orange giant</a> star orbited by one planet, <a href="91%20Aquarii%20b">91 Aquarii b</a>. The planet's mass is 2.9 times the mass of Jupiter, and its orbital period is 182 days. <a href="Gliese%20849">Gliese 849</a> is a red dwarf star orbited by the first known long-period Jupiter-like planet, <a href="Gliese%20849%20b">Gliese 849 b</a>. The planet's mass is 0.99 times that of Jupiter and its orbital period is 1,852 days.

There are also less-prominent systems in Aquarius. <a href="WASP-6">WASP-6</a>, a type G8 star of magnitude 12.4, is host to one exoplanet, <a href="WASP-6%20b">WASP-6 b</a>. The star is 307 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s from Earth and has a mass of 0.888 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es and a radius of 0.87 <a href="solar%20radius">solar radii</a>. WASP-6 b was discovered in 2008 by the <a href="transit%20method">transit method</a>. It orbits its parent star every 3.36 days at a distance of 0.042 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU). It is 0.503 <a href="Jupiter%20mass">Jupiter mass</a>es but has a proportionally larger radius of 1.224 <a href="Jupiter%20radius">Jupiter radii</a>. <a href="HD%20206610">HD 206610</a>, a K0 star located 194 parsecs from Earth, is host to one planet, <a href="HD%20206610%20b">HD 206610 b</a>. The host star is larger than the Sun; more massive at 1.56 solar masses and larger at 6.1 solar radii. The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method in 2010 and has a mass of 2.2 Jupiter masses. It orbits every 610 days at a distance of 1.68 AU. Much closer to its sun is <a href="WASP-47%20b">WASP-47 b</a>, which orbits every 4.15 days only 0.052 AU from its sun, yellow dwarf (G9V) <a href="WASP-47">WASP-47</a>. WASP-47 is close in size to the Sun, having a radius of 1.15 solar radii and a mass even closer at 1.08 solar masses. WASP-47 b was discovered in 2011 by the transit method, like WASP-6 b. It is slightly larger than Jupiter with a mass of 1.14 Jupiter masses and a radius of 1.15 Jupiter masses.

There are several more single-planet systems in Aquarius. <a href="HD%20210277">HD 210277</a>, a magnitude 6.63 yellow star located 21.29 parsecs from Earth, is host to one known planet: <a href="HD%20210277%20b">HD 210277 b</a>. The 1.23 Jupiter mass planet orbits at nearly the same distance as Earth orbits the Sun - 1.1 AU, though its orbital period is significantly longer at around 442 days. HD 210277 b was discovered earlier than most of the other planets in Aquarius, detected by the radial velocity method in 1998. The star it orbits resembles the Sun beyond their similar <a href="spectral%20class">spectral class</a>; it has a radius of 1.1 solar radii and a mass of 1.09 solar masses. <a href="HD%20212771%20b">HD 212771 b</a>, a larger planet at 2.3 Jupiter masses, orbits host star <a href="HD%20212771">HD 212771</a> at a distance of 1.22 AU. The star itself, barely below the threshold of naked-eye visibility at magnitude 7.6, is a G8IV (yellow subgiant) star located 131 parsecs from Earth. Though it has a similar mass to the Sun - 1.15 solar masses - it is significantly less dense with its radius of 5 solar radii. Its lone planet was discovered in 2010 by the radial velocity method, like several other exoplanets in the constellation.

As of 2013, there were only two known multiple-planet systems within the bounds of Aquarius: the Gliese 876 and <a href="HD%20215152">HD 215152</a> systems. The former is quite prominent; the latter has only two planets and has a host star farther away at 21.5 parsecs. The HD 215152 system consists of the planets <a href="HD%20215152%20b">HD 215152 b</a> and <a href="HD%20215152%20c">HD 215152 c</a> orbiting their K0-type, magnitude 8.13 sun. Both discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method, the two tiny planets orbit very close to their host star. HD 215152 c is the larger at 0.0097 Jupiter masses (still significantly larger than the Earth, which weighs in at 0.00315 Jupiter masses); its smaller sibling is barely smaller at 0.0087 Jupiter masses. The <a href="error">error</a> in the mass measurements (0.0032 and respectively) is large enough to make this discrepancy statistically insignificant. HD 215152 c also orbits further from the star than HD 215152 b, 0.0852 AU compared to 0.0652.

On 23 February 2017, NASA announced that <a href="Ultra-cool%20dwarf">ultracool dwarf star</a> <a href="TRAPPIST-1">TRAPPIST-1</a> in Aquarius has seven <a href="Exoplanet">Earth-like rocky planets</a>. Of these, three are in the system's habitable zone, and may contain water. The discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system is seen by astronomers as a significant step toward finding life beyond Earth.

Because of its position away from the galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae. Aquarius contains three <a href="deep%20sky%20object">deep sky object</a>s that are in the <a href="Messier%20object">Messier catalog</a>: the globular clusters <a href="Messier%202">Messier 2</a>, <a href="Messier%2072">Messier 72</a>, and the open cluster <a href="Messier%2073">Messier 73</a>. Two well-known <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a>e are also located in Aquarius: the <a href="Saturn%20Nebula">Saturn Nebula</a> (NGC 7009), to the southeast of <a href="Mu%20Aquarii">μ Aquarii</a>; and the famous <a href="Helix%20Nebula">Helix Nebula</a> (NGC 7293), southwest of <a href="%CE%B4%20Aquarii">δ Aquarii</a>.

M2, also catalogued as NGC 7089, is a rich globular cluster located approximately 37,000 light-years from Earth. At magnitude 6.5, it is viewable in small-<a href="aperture">aperture</a> instruments, but a 100 mm aperture <a href="telescope">telescope</a> is needed to resolve any stars. M72, also catalogued as NGC 6981, is a small 9th magnitude globular cluster located approximately 56,000 light-years from Earth. M73, also catalogued as NGC 6994, is an open cluster with highly disputed status.

Aquarius is also home to several planetary nebulae. <a href="NGC%207009">NGC 7009</a>, also known as the Saturn Nebula, is an 8th magnitude planetary nebula located 3,000 light-years from Earth. It was given its moniker by the 19th century astronomer <a href="Lord%20Rosse">Lord Rosse</a> for its resemblance to the planet <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> in a telescope; it has faint protrusions on either side that resemble <a href="Saturn%27s%20rings">Saturn's rings</a>. It appears blue-green in a telescope and has a central star of magnitude 11.3. Compared to the Helix Nebula, another planetary nebula in Aquarius, it is quite small. <a href="NGC%207293">NGC 7293</a>, also known as the Helix Nebula, is the closest planetary nebula to Earth at a distance of 650 light-years. It covers 0.25 square degrees, making it also the largest planetary nebula as seen from Earth. However, because it is so large, it is only viewable as a very faint object, though it has a fairly high <a href="integrated%20magnitude">integrated magnitude</a> of 6.0.

One of the visible galaxies in Aquarius is <a href="NGC%207727">NGC 7727</a>, of particular interest for amateur astronomers who wish to discover or observe <a href="supernovae">supernovae</a>. A <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> (<a href="galaxy%20morphological%20classification">type S</a>), it has an <a href="integrated%20magnitude">integrated magnitude</a> of 10.7 and is 3 by 3 arcseconds. <a href="NGC%207252">NGC 7252</a> is a tangle of stars resulting from the collision of two large galaxies and is known as the Atoms-for-Peace galaxy because of its resemblance to a cartoon atom.

There are three major meteor showers with <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a>s in Aquarius: the <a href="Eta%20Aquariids">Eta Aquariids</a>, the <a href="Delta%20Aquariids">Delta Aquariids</a>, and the Iota Aquariids.

The Eta Aquariids are the strongest meteor shower radiating from Aquarius. It peaks between 5 and 6 May with a rate of approximately 35 meteors per hour. Originally discovered by Chinese astronomers in 401, Eta Aquariids can be seen coming from the Water Jar beginning on April 21 and as late as May 12. The <a href="parent%20body">parent body</a> of the shower is <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a>, a <a href="periodic%20comet">periodic comet</a>. <a href="Meteoroid%23Fireball">Fireball</a>s are common shortly after the peak, approximately between May 9 and May 11. The normal meteors appear to have yellow trails.

The Delta Aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on 29 July and second on 6 August. The first radiant is located in the south of the constellation, while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of Pisces asterism. The southern radiant's peak rate is about 20 meteors per hour, while the northern radiant's peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour.

The Iota Aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on 6 August, with a rate of approximately 8 meteors per hour.

, the Sun appears in the constellation Aquarius from 16 February to 11 March. In <a href="tropical%20astrology">tropical astrology</a>, the Sun is considered to be in the sign <a href="Aquarius%20%28astrology%29">Aquarius</a> from 20 January to 19 February, and in <a href="sidereal%20astrology">sidereal astrology</a>, from 15 February to 14 March.

Aquarius is also associated with the <a href="Age%20of%20Aquarius">Age of Aquarius</a>, a concept popular in <a href="1960s%20counterculture">1960s counterculture</a>. Despite this prominence, the Age of Aquarius will not dawn until the year 2597, as an astrological age does not begin until the Sun is in a particular constellation on the <a href="vernal%20equinox">vernal equinox</a>.

Anime

The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of <a href="Osamu%20Tezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a> and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by way of television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.

Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. It consists of an ideal story-telling mechanism, combining graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides an ideal path for escapism that audiences can immerse themselves into with relative ease. Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large emotive or realistically sized eyes.

The anime industry consists of over 430 production studios, including major names like <a href="Studio%20Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a>, <a href="Gainax">Gainax</a>, and <a href="Toei%20Animation">Toei Animation</a>. Despite comprising only a fraction of Japan's domestic film market, anime makes up a majority of Japanese <a href="DVD">DVD</a> sales. It has also seen international success after the rise of English-<a href="dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dubbed</a> programming. This rise in international popularity has resulted in non-Japanese productions using the anime art style, but these works are usually described as <a href="anime-influenced%20animation">anime-influenced animation</a> rather than anime proper.

Anime is an art form, specifically animation, that includes all <a href="genre">genre</a>s found in cinema, but it can be mistakenly classified as a genre. In <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>, the term "anime" refers to all forms of animation from around the world. In <a href="English%20language">English</a>, "anime" () is more restrictively used to denote a "Japanese-style animated film or television entertainment" or as "a style of animation created in Japan".

The etymology of the word "anime" is disputed. The English term "animation" is written in Japanese "<a href="katakana">katakana</a>" as ("animēshon", pronounced ) and is ("anime") in its shortened form. Some sources claim that "anime" derives from the French term for animation "dessin animé", but others believe this to be a myth derived from the French popularity of the medium in the late 1970s and 1980s. In English, "anime"—when used as a common <a href="noun">noun</a>—normally functions as a <a href="mass%20noun">mass noun</a>. (For example: "Do you watch anime?" or "How much anime have you collected?") Prior to the widespread use of "anime", the term "Japanimation" was prevalent throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the mid-1980s, the term "anime" began to supplant "Japanimation". In general, the latter term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation.

The word "anime" has also been criticised, e.g. in 1987, when <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> stated that he despised the truncated word "anime" because to him it represented the desolation of the Japanese animation industry. He equated the desolation with animators lacking motivation and with mass-produced, overly expressionistic products relying upon a fixed iconography of facial expressions and protracted and exaggerated action scenes but lacking depth and sophistication in that they do not attempt to convey emotion or thought.

The first format of anime was theatrical viewing which originally began with commercial productions in 1917. Originally the animated flips were crude and required played musical components before adding sound and vocal components to the production. On July 14, 1958, <a href="Nippon%20Television">Nippon Television</a> aired "Mogura no Abanchūru" ("<a href="Mole%27s%20Adventure">Mole's Adventure</a>"), both the first televised and first color anime to debut. It wasn't until the 1960s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since. Works released in a direct to video format are called "<a href="original%20video%20animation">original video animation</a>" (OVA) or "original animation video" (OAV); and are typically not released theatrically or televised prior to home media release. The emergence of the Internet has led some animators to distribute works online in a format called "<a href="original%20net%20animation">original net anime</a>" (ONA).

The home distribution of anime releases were popularized in the 1980s with the VHS and <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> formats. The VHS <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> video format used in both Japan and the United States is credited as aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990s. The Laser Disc and VHS formats were transcended by the DVD format which offered the unique advantages; including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc. The DVD format also has its drawbacks in the its usage of <a href="DVD%20region%20code">region coding</a>; adopted by the industry to solve licensing, piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the DVD player. The <a href="Video%20CD">Video CD</a> (VCD) format was popular in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but became only a minor format in the United States that was closely associated with <a href="counterfeit">bootleg</a> copies.

Japanese animation began in the early 20th century, when Japanese <a href="Film%20director">filmmakers</a> experimented with the animation techniques also pioneered in France, Germany, the United States and Russia. A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is "<a href="Katsud%C5%8D%20Shashin">Katsudō Shashin</a>", an undated and private work by an unknown creator. In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear. Animators such as <a href="%C5%8Cten%20Shimokawa">Ōten Shimokawa</a> and <a href="Seitarou%20Kitayama">Seitarou Kitayama</a> produced numerous works, with the oldest surviving film being Kouchi's "<a href="Namakura%20Gatana">Namakura Gatana</a>", a two-minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target only to suffer defeat. The <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">1923 Great Kantō earthquake</a> resulted in widespread destruction to Japan's infrastructure and the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse, destroying most of these early works.

By the 1930s animation was well established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators, <a href="Nobur%C5%8D%20%C5%8Cfuji">Noburō Ōfuji</a> and <a href="Yasuji%20Murata">Yasuji Murata</a>, who still worked in cheaper <a href="cutout%20animation">cutout animation</a> rather than <a href="cel%20animation">cel animation</a>. Other creators, <a href="Kenz%C5%8D%20Masaoka">Kenzō Masaoka</a> and <a href="Mitsuyo%20Seo">Mitsuyo Seo</a>, nonetheless made great strides in animation technique; they benefited from the patronage of the government, which employed animators to produce educational shorts and <a href="Japanese%20propaganda%20during%20World%20War%20II">propaganda</a>. The first <a href="talkie">talkie</a> anime was "<a href="Chikara%20to%20Onna%20no%20Yo%20no%20Naka">Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka</a>", produced by Masaoka in 1933. By 1940, numerous anime artists' organizations had risen, including the Shin Mangaha Shudan and Shin Nippon Mangaka. The first feature-length animated film was "<a href="Momotaro%27s%20Divine%20Sea%20Warriors">Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors</a>" directed by Seo in 1944 with sponsorship by the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>.

The success of <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>'s 1937 feature film "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>" profoundly influenced many Japanese animators. In the 1960s, manga artist and animator <a href="Osamu%20Tezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a> adapted and simplified many Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and to limit the number of frames in productions. He intended this as a temporary measure to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced animation staff. "<a href="Three%20Tales%20%28anime%29">Three Tales</a>", aired in 1960, was the first anime shown on television. The first anime television series was "<a href="Otogi%20Manga%20Calendar">Otogi Manga Calendar</a>", aired from 1961 to 1964.

The 1970s saw a surge of growth in the popularity of "<a href="manga">manga</a>", Japanese <a href="comics">comic books</a> and <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>s, many of which were later animated. The work of Osamu Tezuka drew particular attention: he has been called a "legend" and the "god of manga". His work—and that of other pioneers in the field—inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. The giant <a href="robot">robot</a> genre (known as "<a href="mecha">mecha</a>" outside Japan), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the <a href="Super%20Robot">Super Robot</a> genre under <a href="Go%20Nagai">Go Nagai</a> and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by <a href="Yoshiyuki%20Tomino">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a> who developed the <a href="Real%20Robot">Real Robot</a> genre. Robot anime like the "<a href="Gundam">Gundam</a>" and "<a href="The%20Super%20Dimension%20Fortress%20Macross">The Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a>" series became instant classics in the 1980s, and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today. In the 1980s, anime became more accepted in the <a href="Mainstream%20%28terminology%29">mainstream</a> in Japan (although less than <a href="manga">manga</a>), and experienced a boom in production. Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s, anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more at the turn of the 21st century. In 2002, "<a href="Spirited%20Away">Spirited Away</a>", a <a href="Studio%20Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> production directed by <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> won the <a href="Golden%20Bear">Golden Bear</a> at the <a href="Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">Berlin International Film Festival</a> and in 2003 at the <a href="75th%20Academy%20Awards">75th Academy Awards</a> it won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Feature">Academy Award for Best Animated Feature</a>. 

Anime are often classified by target demographic, including "<a href="Children%27s%20anime%20and%20manga">kodomo</a>" (children's), "<a href="Sh%C5%8Djo%20manga">shōjo</a>" (girls'), "<a href="Sh%C5%8Dnen%20manga">shōnen</a>" (boys') and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience. Shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an attempt to gain crossover appeal. Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences typically find unappealing, as well as adult themes and situations. A subset of adult anime works feature pornographic elements and are labeled "R18" in Japan, but internationally these works are grouped together under the term "<a href="hentai">hentai</a>" (Japanese for "pervert"). By contrast, a variety of anime subgenres across demographic groups incorporate "<a href="ecchi">ecchi</a>", sexual themes or undertones without depictions of <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>, as typified in the comedic or <a href="Harem%20%28genre%29">harem</a> genres; due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts, incorporation of ecchi elements in anime is considered a form of <a href="fan%20service">fan service</a>.

Anime's genre classification is different from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple identity. <a href="Gilles%20Poitras">Gilles Poitras</a> compared the labeling "<a href="Gundam%200080">Gundam 0080</a>" and its complex depiction of war as a "giant robot" anime akin to simply labeling "<a href="War%20and%20Peace">War and Peace</a>" a "war novel". <a href="Science%20fiction%20genre">Science fiction</a> is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like Tezuka's "<a href="Astro%20Boy">Astro Boy</a>" and <a href="Mitsuteru%20Yokoyama">Yokoyama</a>'s "<a href="Tetsujin%2028-go">Tetsujin 28-go</a>". A major subgenre of science fiction is <a href="mecha">mecha</a>, with the "Gundam" <a href="metaseries">metaseries</a> being iconic. The diverse <a href="fantasy%20genre">fantasy genre</a> includes works based on Asian and Western traditions and folklore; examples include the Japanese feudal fairytale "<a href="InuYasha">InuYasha</a>", and the depiction of Scandinavian goddesses who move to Japan to maintain a computer called <a href="Yggdrasil">Yggdrasil</a> in "<a href="Oh%20My%20Goddess%21">Ah! My Goddess</a>". Genre crossing in anime is also prevalent, such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in "<a href="Dragon%20Half">Dragon Half</a>", and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime "<a href="Castle%20of%20Cagliostro">Castle of Cagliostro</a>". Other subgenres found in anime include <a href="magical%20girl">magical girl</a>, harem, sports, martial arts, literary adaptations, <a href="medievalism">medievalism</a>, and war.

Genres have emerged that explore homosexual romances. While originally pornographic in terminology, "<a href="yaoi">yaoi</a>" (male homosexuality) and "<a href="yuri%20%28genre%29">yuri</a>" (female homosexuality) are broad terms used internationally to describe any focus on the themes or development of romantic homosexual relationships. Prior to 2000, homosexual characters were typically used for comedic effect, but some works portrayed these characters seriously or sympathetically.

Anime differs greatly from other forms of animation by its diverse art styles, methods of animation, its production, and its process. Visually, anime is a diverse art form that contains a wide variety of art styles, differing from one creator, artist, and studio. While no one art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design.

Anime follows the typical production of animation, including <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>ing, <a href="voice%20acting">voice acting</a>, <a href="Character%20creation">character design</a>, and <a href="cel%20animation">cel production</a> ("<a href="Shirobako">Shirobako</a>", itself a series, highlights many of the aspects involved in anime production). Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used <a href="computer%20animation">computer animation</a> to improve the efficiency of the production process. Artists like <a href="Nobur%C5%8D%20%C5%8Cfuji">Noburō Ōfuji</a> pioneered the earliest anime works, which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a> animation of paper cutouts, and <a href="silhouette%20animation">silhouette animation</a>. Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent <a href="Short%20subject">short films</a>, including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by <a href="Tadahito%20Mochinaga">Tadahito Mochinaga</a>, <a href="Kihachir%C5%8D%20Kawamoto">Kihachirō Kawamoto</a> and Tomoyasu Murata. Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as "<a href="Ghost%20in%20the%20Shell%20%281995%20film%29">Ghost in the Shell</a>" and "<a href="Princess%20Mononoke">Princess Mononoke</a>" mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. <a href="Fujifilm">Fuji Film</a>, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.

Prior to the digital era, anime was produced with <a href="traditional%20animation">traditional animation</a> methods using a pose to pose approach. The majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive <a href="key%20frame">key frame</a>s and more <a href="Inbetweening">in-between</a> animation.

Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many <a href="limited%20animation">limited animation</a> techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. Unlike <a href="Disney">Disney</a> animation, where the emphasis is on the movement, anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement. Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices. Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work. The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in "<a href="Howl%27s%20Moving%20Castle%20%28film%29">Howl's Moving Castle</a>" and "<a href="The%20Melancholy%20of%20Haruhi%20Suzumiya%20%28anime%29">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</a>". Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking "tremendously impressive".

The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation. Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality. In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first; this can cause <a href="lip%20sync">lip sync</a> errors in the Japanese version.

Body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall. Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce <a href="super%20deformed">super deformed</a> characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. Some anime works like "<a href="Crayon%20Shin-chan">Crayon Shin-chan</a>" completely disregard these proportions, such that they resemble Western cartoons.

A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size. The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as <a href="Betty%20Boop">Betty Boop</a>, who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes. Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes. The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used. Cultural anthropologist <a href="Matt%20Thorn">Matt Thorn</a> argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign. However, not all anime have large eyes. For example, the works of <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.

Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled. The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and "hair action" is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect. Poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga, where eye-catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for children's manga. Despite being produced for a domestic market, anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined, and this is often a deliberate decision, such as in the "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28anime%29">Pokémon</a>" animated series.

Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts. These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation, and they include a fixed <a href="manga%20iconography">iconography</a> that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods. For example, a male character may develop a <a href="nosebleed">nosebleed</a> when aroused. A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweat drops to depict nervousness, visible blushing for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare.

The opening and credits sequences of most anime television episodes are accompanied by <a href="J-pop">Japanese pop</a> or <a href="Japanese%20rock">rock</a> songs, often by reputed bands. They may be written with the series in mind, but are also aimed at the general music market, and therefore often allude only vaguely or not at all to the themes or plot of the series. Pop and rock songs are also sometimes used as incidental music ("insert songs") in an episode, often to highlight particularly important scenes.

The animation industry consists of more than 430 production companies with some of the major studios including <a href="Toei%20Animation">Toei Animation</a>, <a href="Gainax">Gainax</a>, <a href="Madhouse%20%28company%29">Madhouse</a>, <a href="Gonzo%20%28company%29">Gonzo</a>, <a href="Sunrise%20%28company%29">Sunrise</a>, <a href="Bones%20%28studio%29">Bones</a>, <a href="TMS%20Entertainment">TMS Entertainment</a>, <a href="Nippon%20Animation">Nippon Animation</a>, <a href="P.A.Works">P.A.Works</a>, <a href="Studio%20Pierrot">Studio Pierrot</a> and <a href="Studio%20Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a>. Many of the studios are organized into a <a href="trade%20association">trade association</a>, <a href="The%20Association%20of%20Japanese%20Animations">The Association of Japanese Animations</a>. There is also a labor union for workers in the industry, the <a href="Japanese%20Animation%20Creators%20Association">Japanese Animation Creators Association</a>. Studios will often work together to produce more complex and costly projects, as done with Studio Ghibli's "<a href="Spirited%20Away">Spirited Away</a>". An anime episode can cost between <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>100,000 and US$300,000 to produce. In 2001, animation accounted for 7% of the Japanese film market, above the 4.6% market share for live-action works. The popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the DVD market, contributing nearly 70% of total sales. According to a 2016 article on Nikkei Asian Review, Japanese television stations have bought over worth of anime from production companies "over the past few years", compared with under from overseas. There has been a rise in sales of shows to television stations in Japan, caused by <a href="late%20night%20anime">late night anime</a> with <a href="adult%20animation">adults as the target demographic</a>. This type of anime is less popular outside Japan, being considered "more of a <a href="niche%20market">niche product</a>". "<a href="Spirited%20Away">Spirited Away</a>" (2001) is the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films%20in%20Japan">all-time highest-grossing film in Japan</a>.

Anime films represent a large part of the highest-grossing Japanese films yearly in Japan, with 6 out of the top 10 <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20films%20of%202014%23Highest-grossing%20films">in 2014</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20films%20of%202015%23Highest-grossing%20films">in 2015</a> and also in <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20films%20of%202016%23Highest-grossing%20films">2016</a>.

Anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released. While anime has been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside Japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became well-established in the United States in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such TV series as "<a href="Gatchaman">Gatchaman</a>" and "<a href="Captain%20Harlock">Captain Harlock</a>" were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for distribution in the US market. The trend towards American distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as "<a href="Voltron">Voltron</a>" and the 'creation' of new series such as "<a href="Robotech">Robotech</a>" through use of source material from several original series.

In the early 1990s, several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children-oriented material. Some, such as <a href="A.D.%20Vision">A.D. Vision</a>, and <a href="Central%20Park%20Media">Central Park Media</a> and its imprints, achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative American anime market. Others, such as <a href="AnimEigo">AnimEigo</a>, achieved limited success. Many companies created directly by Japanese parent companies did not do as well, most releasing only one or two titles before completing their American operations.

Licenses are expensive, often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie. The prices vary widely; for example, "" cost only $91,000 to license while "<a href="Kurau%20Phantom%20Memory">Kurau Phantom Memory</a>" cost $960,000. Simulcast Internet streaming rights can be less expensive, with prices around $1,000-$2,000 an episode, but can also be more expensive, with some series costing more than per episode.

The anime market for the United States was worth approximately $2.74 billion in 2009. Dubbed animation began airing in the United States in 2000 on networks like <a href="The%20WB%20Television%20Network">The WB</a> and <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a>'s <a href="Adult%20Swim">Adult Swim</a>. In 2005, this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on Cartoon Network. As a part of localization, some <a href="Editing%20of%20anime%20in%20American%20distribution">editing</a> of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-Japanese culture. The cost of English localization averages US $10,000 per episode.

The industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for <a href="fansubs">fansubs</a>, the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films. Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s. Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed. They also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in English, although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks. Even so, the laid back regulations of the Japanese animation industry tends to overlook these issues, allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing the popularity until there is a demand for official high quality releases for animation companies. This has led to an increase in global popularity with Japanese animations, reaching $40 million in sales in 2004.

Legal international availability of anime on the Internet has changed in recent years, with <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a>s of series available on websites like <a href="Crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</a>.

The anime industry has several annual awards which honor the year's best works. Major annual awards in Japan include the <a href="%C5%8Cfuji%20Nobur%C5%8D%20Award">Ōfuji Noburō Award</a>, the <a href="Mainichi%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animation%20Film">Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film</a>, the <a href="Animation%20Kobe">Animation Kobe</a> Awards, the <a href="Japan%20Media%20Arts%20Festival">Japan Media Arts Festival</a> animation awards, the <a href="Tokyo%20Anime%20Award">Tokyo Anime Award</a> and the <a href="Japan%20Academy%20Prize%20for%20Animation%20of%20the%20Year">Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year</a>. In the United States, anime films compete in the ICv2.com Anime Awards There were also the <a href="American%20Anime%20Awards">American Anime Awards</a>, which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry, and were held only once in 2006. Anime productions have also been nominated and won awards not exclusively for anime, like the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Feature">Academy Award for Best Animated Feature</a> or the <a href="Golden%20Bear">Golden Bear</a>.

Anime has become commercially profitable in <a href="Western%20world">Western countries</a>, as demonstrated by early commercially successful Western adaptations of anime, such as "<a href="Astro%20Boy%20%281963%20TV%20series%29">Astro Boy</a>" and "<a href="Speed%20Racer">Speed Racer</a>". Early American adaptions in the 1960s made Japan expand into the continental European market, first with productions aimed at European and Japanese children, such as <a href="Heidi%2C%20Girl%20of%20the%20Alps">"Heidi"</a>, <a href="Vicky%20the%20Viking">"Vicky the Vicking"</a> and "<a href="Barbapapa">Barbapapa</a>", which aired in various countries. Particularly Italy, Spain and France grew an interest into Japan's output, due to its cheap selling price and productive output. In fact, Italy imported the most anime outside of Japan. These mass imports influenced anime popularity in South American, Arabic and German markets.

The beginning of 1980 saw the introduction of Japanese anime series into the American culture. In the 1990s, Japanese animation slowly gained popularity in America. Media companies such as Viz and Mixx began publishing and releasing animation into the American market. The growth of the Internet provided Western audiences an easy way to access Japanese content. This is especially the case with net services such as <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> and <a href="Crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</a>. As a direct result, various interests surrounding <a href="Japanophile">Japan</a> has increased.

<a href="Anime%20club">Anime club</a>s gave rise to <a href="anime%20convention">anime convention</a>s in the 1990s with the "anime boom", a period marked by increased popularity of anime. These conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a> contests and industry talk panels. Cosplay, a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> for "costume play", is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions. Japanese culture and words have entered English usage through the popularity of the medium, including "<a href="otaku">otaku</a>", a derogatory Japanese term commonly used in English to denote a fan of anime and manga. Another word that has arisen describing fans in the United States is "wapanese" meaning White individuals who desire to be Japanese, or later known as <a href="Japanophile">"weeaboo"</a> for individuals who demonstrate a strong interest in Japanese anime subculture, which is a term that originated from abusive content posted on the popular bulletin board website <a href="4chan.org">4chan.org</a>. Anime enthusiasts have produced <a href="fan%20fiction">fan fiction</a> and <a href="fan%20art">fan art</a>, including computer wallpaper and <a href="anime%20music%20video">anime music video</a>s.

One of the key points that made anime different from popular Western animation is the emotional content. Once the expectation that the aspects of visual intrigue or animation being just for children is put aside, the audience can realize that many emotions such as suffering, death, pain, struggle, and joy can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime as much as other types of media. However, as anime itself became increasingly popular, anime styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions. "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>"s "<a href="Chinpokomon">Chinpokomon</a>" and "<a href="Good%20Times%20with%20Weapons">Good Times with Weapons</a>" episodes, <a href="Adult%20Swim">Adult Swim</a>'s "<a href="Perfect%20Hair%20Forever">Perfect Hair Forever</a>", and <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>'s "<a href="Kappa%20Mikey">Kappa Mikey</a>" are examples of satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime. Some works have sparked debate for blurring the lines between satire and serious "anime style" productions, such as the American anime style production "". These anime styled works have become defined as <a href="anime-influenced%20animation">anime-influenced animation</a>, in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non-Japanese origin. Some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration and like the French production team for "<a href="%C5%8Cban%20Star-Racers">Ōban Star-Racers</a>" moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team. When anime is defined as a "style" rather than as a national product it leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries. A <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">U.A.E.</a>-<a href="Philippines">Filipino</a> produced TV series called "Torkaizer" is dubbed as the "Middle East's First Anime Show", and is currently in production, which is currently looking for funding. The web-based series "<a href="RWBY">RWBY</a>" is produced using an anime art style and has been declared to be anime. In addition, the series will be released in Japan, under the label of "anime" per the Japanese definition of the term and referenced as an "American-made anime". Netflix declared the company's intention to produce anime. In doing so, the company is offering a more accessible channel for distribution to Western markets. Defining anime as style has been contentious amongst fans, with John Oppliger stating, "The insistence on referring to original American art as Japanese "anime" or "manga" robs the work of its cultural identity."

Ankara

Ankara ( ;  ), formerly known as Ancyra () and Angora, is the <a href="list%20of%20national%20capitals">capital</a> of the <a href="Turkey">Republic of Turkey</a>. With a population of 4,587,558 in the urban center and 5,150,072 in <a href="Ankara%20Province">its province</a> , it is Turkey's <a href="List%20of%20largest%20cities%20and%20second%20largest%20cities%20by%20country">second largest</a> <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20Turkey">city</a> after former imperial capital <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, having overtaken <a href="%C4%B0zmir">İzmir</a>. The former Metropolitan archbishopric remains a triple <a href="titular%20see">titular see</a> (Latin, Armenian Catholic and Orthodox).

Ankara was <a href="Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk">Atatürk</a>'s headquarters from 1920 and has been the capital of the Republic since the latter's founding in 1923, replacing Istanbul (once the Byzantine capital <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>) following the <a href="Defeat%20and%20dissolution%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">fall of the Ottoman Empire</a>. The <a href="Government%20of%20Turkey">government</a> is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city, located at the center of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the <a href="Angora%20wool">Angora wool</a> shorn from <a href="Angora%20rabbit">Angora rabbit</a>s, the long-haired <a href="Angora%20goat">Angora goat</a> (the source of <a href="mohair">mohair</a>), and the <a href="Turkish%20Angora">Angora cat</a>. The area is also known for its pears, honey and <a href="muscat%20%28grape%20and%20wine%29">muscat</a> grapes. Although situated in one of the driest places of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery, Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, at per head.

Ankara is a very old city with various <a href="Hittites">Hittite</a>, <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>n, <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic</a>, <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a>, <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a>, and <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> <a href="archaeological%20site">archaeological site</a>s. The historical center of town is a rocky hill rising over the left bank of the Ankara Çayı, a tributary of the <a href="Sakarya%20River">Sakarya River</a>, the classical Sangarius. The hill remains crowned by the ruins of the old citadel. Although few of its outworks have survived, there are well-preserved examples of <a href="Roman%20architecture">Roman</a> and <a href="Ottoman%20architecture">Ottoman architecture</a> throughout the city, the most remarkable being the 20  <a href="Augusteum">Temple of Augustus and Rome</a> that boasts the <a href="Monumentum%20Ancyranum">Monumentum Ancyranum</a>, the inscription recording the "<a href="Res%20Gestae%20Divi%20Augusti">Res Gestae Divi Augusti</a>".

As with many ancient cities, Ankara has gone by several names over the ages. It has been identified with the <a href="Hittites">Hittite</a> cult center "Ankuwaš", although this remains a matter of debate. In classical antiquity and during the medieval period, the city was known as "Ánkyra" (,  "<a href="anchor">anchor</a>") in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> and "Ancyra" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>; the <a href="Galatian%20language">Galatian Celtic</a> name was probably a similar variant. Following its annexation by the <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turks</a> in 1073, the city became known in many European languages as "Angora"; it was also known in <a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish</a> as "Engürü". The form "Angora" is preserved in the names of breeds of many different kinds of animals, and in the names of several locations in the US (see <a href="Angora%20%28disambiguation%29">Angora</a>).

The region's history can be traced back to the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> <a href="Hattians">Hattic</a> <a href="Hattic%20language">civilization</a>, which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a>, in the 10th century BC by the <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>ns, and later by the <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>ns, <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persia</a>ns, <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a>, <a href="Galatia">Galatia</a>ns, <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a>, <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a>, and <a href="Turkish%20people">Turks</a> (the <a href="Great%20Seljuq%20Empire">Seljuk</a> <a href="Sultanate%20of%20R%C3%BBm">Sultanate of Rûm</a>, the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and finally republican <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>).

The oldest settlements in and around the city center of Ankara belonged to the <a href="Hattians">Hattic</a> <a href="Hattic%20language">civilization</a> which existed during the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> and was gradually absorbed c. 2000–1700 BC by the <a href="Hittite%20language">Indo-European</a> <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a>. The city grew significantly in size and importance under the <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>ns starting around 1000 BC, and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from <a href="Gordium">Gordion</a>, (the capital of <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>), after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time. In Phrygian tradition, King <a href="Midas">Midas</a> was venerated as the founder of Ancyra, but <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> mentions that the city was actually far older, which accords with present archaeological knowledge.

Phrygian rule was succeeded first by <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>n and later by <a href="Iran">Persia</a>n rule, though the strongly Phrygian character of the peasantry remained, as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later Roman period. Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> who conquered the city in 333 BC. Alexander came from <a href="Gordium">Gordion</a> to Ankara and stayed in the city for a short period. After his death at <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> in 323 BC and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of <a href="Antigonus%20I%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus</a>.

Another important expansion took place under the Greeks of <a href="Pontus%20%28region%29">Pontos</a> who came there around 300 BC and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> ports and Crimea to the north; Assyria, Cyprus, and Lebanon to the south; and Georgia, Armenia and Persia to the east. By that time the city also took its name ("Ánkyra", meaning "<a href="anchor">anchor</a>" in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>) which, in slightly modified form, provides the modern name of "Ankara".

In 278 BC, the city, along with the rest of central Anatolia, was occupied by a <a href="Celts">Celt</a>ic group, the <a href="Galatia">Galatia</a>ns, who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centers, the headquarters of the <a href="Tectosages">Tectosages</a> tribe. Other centers were <a href="Pessinus">Pessinos</a>, today's "Balhisar", for the <a href="Trocmi">Trocmi</a> tribe, and <a href="Tavium">Tavium</a>, to the east of Ankara, for the "Tolstibogii" tribe. The city was then known as "Ancyra". The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over Phrygian-speaking peasants. However, the Celtic language continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries. At the end of the 4th century, <a href="Jerome">St. Jerome</a>, a native of Dalmatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near <a href="Trier">Trier</a>.

The city was subsequently passed under the control of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. In 25 BC, Emperor <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> raised it to the status of a "<a href="polis">polis</a>" and made it the capital city of the Roman province of <a href="Galatia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Galatia</a>. Ankara is famous for the "<a href="Monumentum%20Ancyranum">Monumentum Ancyranum</a>" ("Temple of Augustus and Rome") which contains the official record of the "Acts of Augustus", known as the "<a href="Res%20Gestae%20Divi%20Augusti">Res Gestae Divi Augusti</a>", an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple. The ruins of Ancyra still furnish today valuable <a href="relief">bas-relief</a>s, inscriptions and other architectural fragments. Two other Galatian tribal centers, <a href="Tavium">Tavium</a> near <a href="Yozgat">Yozgat</a>, and <a href="Pessinus">Pessinus</a> (Balhisar) to the west, near Sivrihisar, continued to be reasonably important settlements in the Roman period, but it was Ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis.

An estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century. A small river, the <a href="Ankara%20River">Ankara Çayı</a>, ran through the center of the Roman town. It has now been covered and diverted, but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. Çankaya, the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center, stood well outside the Roman city, but may have been a summer resort. In the 19th century, the remains of at least one <a href="Roman%20villa">Roman villa</a> or large house were still standing not far from where the Çankaya Presidential Residence stands today. To the west, the Roman city extended until the area of the Gençlik Park and Railway Station, while on the southern side of the hill, it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by <a href="Hacettepe%20University">Hacettepe University</a>. It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> or <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a>.

Ancyra's importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern Anatolia running north-south and east-west intersected, giving it major strategic importance for Rome's eastern frontier. The great imperial road running east passed through Ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way. They were not the only ones to use the Roman highway network, which was equally convenient for invaders. In the second half of the 3rd century, Ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the <a href="Goths">Goths</a> coming from the west (who rode far into the heart of <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>, taking slaves and pillaging) and later by the <a href="Arab%20people">Arab</a>s. For about a decade, the town was one of the western outposts of one of Palmyrean empress <a href="Zenobia">Zenobia</a> in the <a href="Syrian%20Desert">Syrian Desert</a>, who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the Roman Empire to set up a short-lived state of her own.

The town was reincorporated into the Roman Empire under Emperor <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a> in 272. The <a href="tetrarchy">tetrarchy</a>, a system of multiple (up to four) emperors introduced by <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> (284–305), seems to have engaged in a substantial programme of rebuilding and of road construction from Ankara westwards to Germe and <a href="Dorylaeum">Dorylaeum</a> (now <a href="Eski%C5%9Fehir">Eskişehir</a>).

In its heyday, Roman Ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital, where a high official ruled from the city's Praetorium, a large administrative palace or office. During the 3rd century, life in Ancyra, as in other Anatolian towns, seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town.

The city is well known during the 4th century as a centre of Christian activity (see also <a href="%23Ecclesiastical%20history">below</a>), due to frequent imperial visits, and through the letters of the pagan scholar <a href="Libanius">Libanius</a>. Bishop <a href="Marcellus%20of%20Ancyra">Marcellus of Ancyra</a> and <a href="Basil%20of%20Ancyra">Basil of Ancyra</a> were active in the theological controversies of their day, and the city was the site of no less than three church synods in <a href="Synod%20of%20Ancyra">314</a>, in <a href="Synod%20of%20Ancyra%20%28358%29">358</a>, and in <a href="Synod%20of%20Ancyra%20%28375%29">375</a>, the latter two in favour of <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a>. The city was visited by Emperor <a href="Constans%20I">Constans I</a> () in 347 and 350, <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian</a> () during his Persian campaign in 362, and Julian's successor <a href="Jovian%20%28emperor%29">Jovian</a> () in winter 363/364 (he entered his <a href="Roman%20consul">consulship</a> while in the city). After Jovian's death soon after, <a href="Valentinian%20I">Valentinian I</a>() was acclaimed emperor at Ancyra, and in the next year his brother <a href="Valens">Valens</a>() used Ancyra as his base against the usurper <a href="Procopius%20%28usurper%29">Procopius</a>. When the province of Galatia was divided sometime in 396/99, Ancyra remained the civil capital of Galatia I, as well as its ecclesiastical centre (<a href="metropolitan%20see">metropolitan see</a>). Emperor <a href="Arcadius">Arcadius</a> () frequently used the city as his summer residence, and some information about the ecclesiastical affairs of the city during the early 5th century is found in the works of <a href="Palladius%20of%20Galatia">Palladius of Galatia</a> and <a href="Nilus%20of%20Galatia">Nilus of Galatia</a>.

In 479, the rebel <a href="Marcian%20%28usurper%29">Marcian</a> attacked the city, without being able to capture it. In 610/11, <a href="Comentiolus%20%28brother%20of%20Phocas%29">Comentiolus</a>, brother of Emperor <a href="Phocas">Phocas</a> (), launched his own unsuccessful rebellion in the city against <a href="Heraclius">Heraclius</a> (). Ten years later, in 620 or more likely 622, it was captured by the <a href="Sassanid%20Persia">Sassanid Persia</a>ns during the <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Sassanid%20War%20of%20602%E2%80%93628">Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628</a>. Although the city returned to Byzantine hands after the end of the war, the Persian presence left traces in the city's archaeology, and likely began the process of its transformation from a <a href="late%20antique">late antique</a> city to a medieval fortified settlement.

In 654, the city was captured for the first time by the <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> of the <a href="Rashidun%20Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate</a>, under <a href="Muawiyah">Muawiyah</a>, the future founder of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a>. At about the same time, the <a href="theme%20%28Byzantine%20district%29">theme</a>s were established in Anatolia, and Ancyra became capital of the <a href="Opsician%20Theme">Opsician Theme</a>, which was the largest and most important theme until it was split up under Emperor <a href="Constantine%20V">Constantine V</a> (); Ancyra then became the capital of the new <a href="Bucellarian%20Theme">Bucellarian Theme</a>. The city was attacked without success by <a href="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> forces in 776 and in 798/99. In 805, Emperor <a href="Nikephoros%20I">Nikephoros I</a> () strengthened its fortifications, a fact which probably saved it from sack during the <a href="Abbasid%20invasion%20of%20Asia%20Minor%20%28806%29">large-scale invasion</a> of Anatolia by Caliph <a href="Harun%20al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a> in the next year. Arab sources report that Harun and his successor <a href="al-Ma%27mun">al-Ma'mun</a> () took the city, but this information is later invention. In 838, however, during the <a href="Sack%20of%20Amorium">Amorium campaign</a>, the armies of Caliph <a href="al-Mu%27tasim">al-Mu'tasim</a> () converged and met at the city; abandoned by its inhabitants, Ancara was razed to the ground, before the Arab armies went on to besiege and destroy <a href="Amorium">Amorium</a>. In 859, Emperor <a href="Michael%20III">Michael III</a> () came to the city during a campaign against the Arabs, and ordered its fortifications restored. In 872, the city was menaced, but not taken, by the <a href="Paulicians">Paulicians</a> under <a href="Chrysocheir">Chrysocheir</a>. The last Arab raid to reach the city was undertaken in 931, by the Abbasid governor of <a href="Tarsus%20%28city%29">Tarsus</a>, <a href="Thamal%20al-Dulafi">Thamal al-Dulafi</a>, but the city again was not captured.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert</a> in 1071, the <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turks</a> overran much of Anatolia. By 1073, the Turkish settlers had reached the vicinity of Ancyra, and the city was captured shortly after, at the latest by the time of the rebellion of <a href="Nikephoros%20Melissenos">Nikephoros Melissenos</a> in 1081. In 1101, when the <a href="Crusade%20of%201101">Crusade</a> under <a href="Raymond%20IV%20of%20Toulouse">Raymond IV of Toulouse</a> arrived, the city had been under <a href="Danishmend">Danishmend</a> control for some time. The Crusaders captured the city, and handed it over to the Byzantine emperor <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> (). Byzantine rule did not last long, and the city was captured by the Seljuk <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Rum">Sultanate of Rum</a> at some unknown point; in 1127, it returned to Danishmend control until 1143, when the Seljuks of Rum retook it.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%B6se%20Da%C4%9F">Battle of Köse Dağ</a> in 1243, in which the <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongols</a> defeated the Seljuks, most of Anatolia became part of the dominion of the Mongols. Taking advantage of Seljuk decline, a semi-religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named "<a href="Ahis">Ahiler</a>" chose Ankara as their independent city-state in 1290. <a href="Orhan%20I">Orhan I</a>, the second <a href="Bey">Bey</a> of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, captured the city in 1356. <a href="Timur">Timur</a> defeated <a href="Bayezid%20I">Bayezid I</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ankara">Battle of Ankara</a> in 1402 and took the city, but in 1403 Ankara was again under Ottoman control.

The <a href="Levant%20Company">Levant Company</a> maintained a factory in the town from 1639 to 1768. In the 19th century, its population was estimated at 20,000 to 60,000. It was sacked by <a href="Khedivate%20of%20Egypt">Egyptian</a>s under <a href="Ibrahim%20Pasha%20of%20Egypt">Ibrahim Pasha</a> in 1832. Prior to <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the town had a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">British</a> <a href="consul%20%28representative%29">consulate</a> and a population of around 28,000, roughly ⅓ of whom were Christian.

Following the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> defeat at <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the Ottoman capital <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> (modern Istanbul) and much of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> were occupied by the Allies, who planned to share these lands between <a href="First%20Republic%20of%20Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">France</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, leaving for the Turks the core piece of land in central Anatolia. In response, the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, <a href="Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk">Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</a>, established the headquarters of his <a href="Turkish%20National%20Movement">resistance movement</a> in Ankara in 1920. After the <a href="Turkish%20War%20of%20Independence">Turkish War of Independence</a> was won and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20S%C3%A8vres">Treaty of Sèvres</a> was superseded by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lausanne">Treaty of Lausanne</a>, the Turkish nationalists replaced the Ottoman Empire with the <a href="Republic%20of%20Turkey">Republic of Turkey</a> on 29 October 1923. A few days earlier, Ankara had officially replaced Constantinople as the new Turkish capital city, on 13 October 1923.

After Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called "Ulus", and a new section, called "Yenişehir". Ancient buildings reflecting Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section. The new section, now centered on <a href="K%C4%B1z%C4%B1lay%20Meydan%C4%B1">Kızılay Square</a>, has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section. Ankara has experienced a phenomenal growth since it was made Turkey's capital in 1923, when it was "a small town of no importance". In 1924, the year after the government had moved there, Ankara had about 35,000 residents. By 1927 there were 44,553 residents and by 1950 the population had grown to 286,781. Ankara continued to grow rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century and eventually outranked <a href="Izmir">Izmir</a> as Turkey's second largest city, after <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. Ankara's urban population reached 4,587,558 in 2014, while the population of <a href="Ankara%20Province">Ankara Province</a> reached 5,150,072 in 2015.

Early Christian martyrs of Ancyra, about whom little is known, included Proklos and Hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown nearby village of Kallippi, and suffered repression under the emperor <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> (98–117). In the 280s we hear of Philumenos, a Christian corn merchant from southern Anatolia, being captured and martyred in Ankara, and Eustathius.
As in other Roman towns, the reign of <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> marked the culmination of the persecution of the Christians. In 303, Ancyra was one of the towns where the co-Emperors Diocletian and his deputy <a href="Galerius">Galerius</a> launched their anti-Christian persecution. In Ancyra, their first target was the 38-year-old Bishop of the town, whose name was Clement. Clement's life describes how he was taken to Rome, then sent back, and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he, and his brother, and various companions were put to death. The remains of the church of <a href="Clement%20of%20Ancyra">St. Clement</a> can be found today in a building just off Işıklar Caddesi in the Ulus district. Quite possibly this marks the site where Clement was originally buried. Four years later, a doctor of the town named Plato and his brother Antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under Galerius. <a href="Theodotus%20of%20Ancyra%20%28martyr%29">Theodotus of Ancyra</a> is also venerated as a saint.

However, the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 Ancyra was the center of <a href="Synod%20of%20Ancyra">an important council</a> of the <a href="Early%20Christianity">early church</a>; its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the <a href="Confession%20%28religion%29">Sacrament of Penance</a>. The synod also considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the <a href="Christian%20Church">Christian Church</a> after the persecutions, and in particular the treatment of "<a href="Lapsi%20%28Christianity%29">lapsi</a>"—Christians who had given in to forced <a href="paganism">paganism</a> (sacrifices) to avoid <a href="martyrdom">martyrdom</a> during these persecutions.
Though paganism was probably tottering in Ancyra in Clement's day, it may still have been the majority religion. Twenty years later, Christianity and <a href="monotheism">monotheism</a> had taken its place. Ancyra quickly turned into a Christian city, with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes. The town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead. During the middle of the 4th century, Ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of Christ, and a form of <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a> seems to have originated there.

In 362–363, the Emperor Julian passed through Ancyra on his way to an ill-fated campaign against the Persians, and according to Christian sources, engaged in a persecution of various holy men. The stone base for a statue, with an inscription describing Julian as "Lord of the whole world from the British Ocean to the barbarian nations", can still be seen, built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of Ankara Castle. The Column of Julian which was erected in honor of the emperor's visit to the city in 362 still stands today. In 375, Arian bishops met at Ancyra and deposed several bishops, among them <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nyssa">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>.

In the late 4th century, Ancyra became something of an imperial <a href="resort">holiday resort</a>. After <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> became the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">East Roman</a> capital, emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosporus</a> to the drier mountain atmosphere of Ancyra. <a href="Theodosius%20II">Theodosius II</a> (408–450) kept his court in Ancyra in the summers. Laws issued in Ancyra testify to the time they spent there. 

The <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Ancyra">Metropolis of Ancyra</a> continued to be a residential <a href="episcopal%20see">see</a> of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> until the 20th century, with about 40,000 faithful, mostly Turkish-speaking, but that situation ended as a result of the 1923 <a href="Convention%20Concerning%20the%20Exchange%20of%20Greek%20and%20Turkish%20Populations">Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations</a>. The earlier <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> put an end to the residential eparchy of Ancyra of the <a href="Armenian%20Catholic%20Church">Armenian Catholic Church</a>, which had been established in 1850. It is also a titular metropolis of the <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarchate%20of%20Constantinople">Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople</a>.
Both the Ancient Byzantine Metropolitan archbishopric and the 'modern' Armenian eparchy are now listed by the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> as <a href="titular%20see">titular see</a>s, with separate <a href="apostolic%20succession">apostolic succession</a>s.

In 1735 an <a href="Armenian%20Catholic">Armenian Catholic</a> diocese was established (Curiate Italian: "Ancira degli Ameni"). Having fallen into disuse, on 1850.04.30 it was restored.

The 1915–1918 <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> put an effective end to the residential diocese, which was only formally suppressed in 1972 and instantly transformed into an Armenian Catholic <a href="titular%20bishopric">titular bishopric</a>. The titular see has had a single occupant:

No later than 1696, the Catholic Church also established a <a href="Latin%20Rite">Latin Rite</a> <a href="Ancyra%20%28Catholic%20titular%20see%29">titular archbishopric of Ancyra</a>. The last incumbent died in 1976.

Ankara had a population of 75,000 in 1927. In 2013, Ankara Province had a population of 5,045,083.

When Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called <a href="gecekondu">gecekondu</a> were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.

Nevertheless, many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of <a href="tower%20block">tower block</a>s such as Elvankent, <a href="Eryaman%2C%20Etimesgut">Eryaman</a> and <a href="G%C3%BCzelkent%2C%20Etimesgut">Güzelkent</a>; and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation. Although many gecekondus still remain, they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds, as empty land plots in the city of Ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to find.

The city has exported <a href="mohair">mohair</a> (from the <a href="Angora%20goat">Angora goat</a>) and <a href="Angora%20wool">Angora wool</a> (from the <a href="Angora%20rabbit">Angora rabbit</a>) internationally for centuries. In the 19th century, the city also exported substantial amounts of <a href="Goatskin%20%28material%29">goat</a> and <a href="catskin">cat skin</a>s, <a href="gum%20arabic">gum</a>, <a href="beeswax">wax</a>, <a href="honey">honey</a>, berries, and <a href="madder%20root">madder root</a>. It was connected to <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> by railway before the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, continuing to export mohair, wool, berries, and <a href="grain">grain</a>.

The <a href="Central%20Anatolia%20Region">Central Anatolia Region</a> is one of the primary locations of grape and <a href="Turkish%20wine">wine production in Turkey</a>, and Ankara is particularly famous for its <a href="Kalecik%20Karas%C4%B1">Kalecik Karası</a> and <a href="Muscat%20%28grape%20and%20wine%29">Muscat grapes</a>; and its <a href="Kavakl%C4%B1dere%20%28winery%29">Kavaklıdere wine</a>, which is produced in the <a href="Kavakl%C4%B1dere%2C%20Ankara">Kavaklıdere</a> neighbourhood within the <a href="%C3%87ankaya%2C%20Ankara">Çankaya</a> district of the city. Ankara is also famous for its pears. Another renowned natural product of Ankara is its indigenous type of <a href="honey">honey</a> ("Ankara Balı") which is known for its light color and is mostly produced by the <a href="Atat%C3%BCrk%20Forest%20Farm%20and%20Zoo">Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo</a> in the Gazi district, and by other facilities in the Elmadağ, Çubuk and Beypazarı districts.

Ankara is the center of the state-owned and private Turkish <a href="Arms%20industry">defence</a> and <a href="Aerospace%20manufacturer">aerospace</a> companies, where the industrial plants and headquarters of the <a href="Turkish%20Aerospace%20Industries">Turkish Aerospace Industries</a>, <a href="Mechanical%20and%20Chemical%20Industry%20Corporation%20%28Turkey%29">MKE</a>, <a href="ASELSAN">ASELSAN</a>, <a href="Havelsan">Havelsan</a>, <a href="Roketsan">Roketsan</a>, <a href="FNSS%20Defence%20Systems">FNSS</a>, <a href="Nurol%20Makina">Nurol Makina</a>, and numerous other firms are located. Exports to foreign countries from these defence and aerospace firms have steadily increased in the past decades. The <a href="International%20Defence%20Industry%20Fair">IDEF</a> in Ankara is one of the largest international expositions of the global <a href="arms%20industry">arms industry</a>. A number of the global <a href="automotive%20industry">automotive companies</a> also have production facilities in Ankara, such as the German bus and truck manufacturer <a href="MAN%20SE">MAN SE</a>. Ankara hosts the <a href="OSTIM%20Industrial%20Zone">OSTIM Industrial Zone</a>, Turkey's largest <a href="industrial%20park">industrial park</a>.

A large percentage of the complicated employment in Ankara is provided by the state institutions; such as the <a href="ministry%20%28government%20department%29">ministries</a>, undersecretariats, and other administrative bodies of the Turkish government. There are also many foreign citizens working as diplomats or clerks in the <a href="embassy">embassies</a> of their respective countries.

Ankara is politically a triple battleground between the ruling conservative <a href="Justice%20and%20Development%20Party%20%28Turkey%29">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP), the opposition <a href="Kemalism">Kemalist</a> centre-left <a href="Republican%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Turkey%29">Republican People's Party</a> (CHP) and the nationalist far-right <a href="Nationalist%20Movement%20Party">Nationalist Movement Party</a> (MHP). The <a href="Ankara%20Province">province of Ankara</a> is divided into 25 districts. The CHP's key and almost only political stronghold in Ankara lies within the central area of <a href="%C3%87ankaya%2C%20Ankara%20%28district%29">Çankaya</a>, which is the city's most populous district. While the CHP has always gained between 60 and 70% of the vote in Çankaya since 2002, political support elsewhere throughout Ankara is minimal. The high population within Çankaya, as well as <a href="Yenimahalle">Yenimahalle</a> to an extent, has allowed the CHP to take overall second place behind the AKP in both local and general elections, with the MHP a close third, despite the fact that the MHP is politically stronger than the CHP in almost every other district. Overall, the AKP enjoys the most support throughout the city. The electorate of Ankara thus tend to vote in favour of the political right, far more so than the other main cities of <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and <a href="%C4%B0zmir">İzmir</a>. In retrospect, the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20protests%20in%20Turkey">2013–14 protests against the AKP government</a> were particularly strong in Ankara, proving to be fatal on multiple occasions.
<a href="Melih%20G%C3%B6k%C3%A7ek">Melih Gökçek</a> has been the Metropolitan Mayor of Ankara since 1994 as a politician from the <a href="Welfare%20Party">Welfare Party</a>. He later joined the <a href="Virtue%20Party">Virtue Party</a> and then the AKP. Initially elected in the <a href="Turkish%20local%20elections%2C%201994">1994 local elections</a>, he was re-elected in <a href="Turkish%20local%20elections%2C%201999">1999</a>, <a href="Turkish%20local%20elections%2C%202004">2004</a> and <a href="Turkish%20local%20elections%2C%202009">2009</a>. In the <a href="Turkish%20local%20elections%2C%202014">2014 local election</a>, Gökçek stood for a fifth term. The MHP metropolitan mayoral candidate for the 2009 local elections, conservative politician <a href="Mansur%20Yava%C5%9F">Mansur Yavaş</a>, stood as the CHP candidate against Gökçek. In a heavily controversial election, Gökçek was declared the winner by just 1% ahead of Yavaş amid allegations of systematic electoral fraud. With the <a href="Supreme%20Electoral%20Council%20of%20Turkey">Supreme Electoral Council</a> and courts rejecting Yavaş's appeals, he has declared intention to take the irregularities to the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a>. Although Gökçek was inaugurated for a fifth term, most election observers believe that Yavaş was the winner of the election.

The city suffered from a series of terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016, most notably on <a href="2015%20Ankara%20bombings">10 October 2015</a>; <a href="February%202016%20Ankara%20bombing">17 February 2016</a>; <a href="March%202016%20Ankara%20bombing">13 March 2016</a>; and <a href="2016%20Turkish%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt">15 July 2016</a>.

The foundations of the <a href="Ankara%20Castle">Ankara castle and citadel</a> were laid by the Galatians on a prominent <a href="lava">lava</a> outcrop (), and the rest was completed by the Romans. The Byzantines and Seljuks further made restorations and additions. The area around and inside the citadel, being the oldest part of Ankara, contains many fine examples of traditional architecture. There are also recreational areas to relax. Many restored traditional Turkish houses inside the citadel area have found new life as restaurants, serving local cuisine.

The citadel was depicted in various Turkish banknotes during 1927–1952 and 1983–1989.

The remains, the stage, and the backstage of the Roman theatre can be seen outside <a href="Ankara%20Castle">the castle</a>. Roman statues that were found here are exhibited in the <a href="Museum%20of%20Anatolian%20Civilizations">Museum of Anatolian Civilizations</a>. The seating area is still under excavation.

The Augusteum, now known as the Temple of Augustus and Rome, was built 25  20  following the conquest of Central Anatolia by the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. Ancyra then formed the capital of the new <a href="Roman%20province">province</a> of <a href="Galatia">Galatia</a>. After the death of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> in  14, a copy of the text of the "<a href="Res%20Gestae%20Divi%20Augusti">Res Gestae Divi Augusti</a>" (the "<a href="Monumentum%20Ancyranum">Monumentum Ancyranum</a>") was inscribed on the interior of the temple's ' in Latin and a Greek translation on an exterior wall of the '. The temple on the ancient acropolis of Ancyra was enlarged in the 2nd century and converted into a church in the 5th century. It is located in the Ulus quarter of the city. It was subsequently publicized by the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian</a> ambassador <a href="Ogier%20Ghiselin%20de%20Busbecq">Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq</a> in the 16th century.

The <a href="Roman%20Baths%20of%20Ankara">Roman Baths of Ankara</a> have all the typical features of a classical <a href="Thermae">Roman bath complex</a>: a "<a href="frigidarium">frigidarium</a>" (cold room), a "<a href="tepidarium">tepidarium</a>" (warm room) and a "<a href="caldarium">caldarium</a>" (hot room). The baths were built during the reign of the Roman emperor <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a> in the early 3rd century to honor <a href="Asclepius">Asclepios</a>, the God of Medicine. Today, only the basement and first floors remain. It is situated in the Ulus quarter.

The <a href="Roman%20Road%20of%20Ankara">Roman Road of Ankara</a> or "Cardo Maximus" was found in 1995 by Turkish archaeologist Cevdet Bayburtluoğlu. It is long and wide. Many ancient artifacts were discovered during the excavations along the road and most of them are currently displayed at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Anatolian%20Civilizations">Museum of Anatolian Civilizations</a>.

The Column of Julian or Julianus, now in the Ulus district, was erected in honor of the Roman emperor <a href="Julian%20the%20Apostate">Julian the Apostate</a>'s visit to Ancyra in 362.

<a href="Kocatepe%20Mosque">Kocatepe Mosque</a> is the largest mosque in the city. Located in the Kocatepe quarter, it was constructed between 1967 and 1987 in classical <a href="Ottoman%20architecture">Ottoman style</a> with four minarets. Its size and prominent location have made it a landmark for the city.

Ahmet Hamdi Akseki Mosque is located near the Presidency of Religious Affairs on the <a href="Eski%C5%9Fehir">Eskişehir</a> Road. Built in the Turkish neoclassical style, it is one of the largest new mosques in the city, completed and opened in 2013. It can accommodate 6 thousand people during general prayers, and up to 30 thousand people during funeral prayers. The mosque was decorated with <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Rum">Anatolian</a> <a href="Seljuk%20architecture">Seljuk style</a> patterns.

It is the largest Ottoman mosque in Ankara and was built by the famous architect Sinan in the 16th century. The mimber (pulpit) and mihrap (prayer niche) are of white marble, and the mosque itself is of Ankara stone, an example of very fine workmanship.

This mosque, in the Ulus quarter next to the <a href="Monumentum%20Ancyranum">Temple of Augustus</a>, was built in the early 15th century in <a href="Seljuk%20architecture">Seljuk style</a> by an unknown architect. It was subsequently restored by architect <a href="Mimar%20Sinan">Mimar Sinan</a> in the 16th century, with <a href="K%C3%BCtahya">Kütahya</a> tiles being added in the 18th century. The mosque was built in honor of <a href="Hac%C4%B1%20Bayram-%C4%B1%20Veli">Hacı Bayram-ı Veli</a>, whose tomb is next to the mosque, two years before his death (1427–28). The usable space inside this mosque is on the first floor and on the second floor.

It was founded in the Ulus quarter near the Ankara Citadel and was constructed by the <a href="Ahis">Ahi fraternity</a> during the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The finely carved walnut mimber (pulpit) is of particular interest.

The Alâeddin Mosque is the oldest mosque in Ankara.

Ankara is noted, within Turkey, for the multitude of universities it is home to. These include the following, several of them being among the most reputable in the country:

Ankara is home to a world-famous domestic <a href="cat%20breed">cat breed</a> – the <a href="Turkish%20Angora">Turkish Angora</a>, called "Ankara kedisi" (Ankara cat) in Turkish. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, naturally occurring cat breeds, having originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

They mostly have a white, silky, medium to long length coat, no undercoat and a fine bone structure. There seems to be a connection between the Angora Cats and <a href="Persian%20%28cat%29">Persians</a>, and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the <a href="Turkish%20Van">Turkish Van</a>. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, currently there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in <a href="tabby%20cat">tabby</a> and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.)

Eyes may be blue, green, or amber, or even one blue and one amber or green. The W gene which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and <a href="odd-eyed%20cat">odd-eyed</a> white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors.

Ears are pointed and large, eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile. Another characteristic is the tail, which is often kept parallel to the back.

The <a href="Angora%20rabbit">Angora rabbit</a> () is a variety of domestic rabbit bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the <a href="Turkish%20Angora">Angora cat</a> and <a href="Angora%20goat">Angora goat</a>. The rabbits were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of Europe by the end of the century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long <a href="Angora%20wool">Angora wool</a>, which may be removed by <a href="sheep%20shearing">shear</a>ing, combing, or <a href="plucking%20%28hair%20removal%29">pluck</a>ing (gently pulling loose wool.)

Angoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft. They have a humorous appearance, as they oddly resemble a fur ball. Most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully. Grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit. A condition called "wool block" is common in Angora rabbits and should be treated quickly. Sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat.

The <a href="Angora%20goat">Angora goat</a> () is a breed of <a href="goat">domestic goat</a> that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

This breed was first mentioned in the time of <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, roughly in 1500 BC. The first Angora goats were brought to Europe by <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, about 1554, but, like later imports, were not very successful. Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan <a href="Abd%C3%BClmecid%20I">Abdülmecid I</a> in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton.

The <a href="Pile%20%28textile%29">fleece</a> taken from an Angora goat is called <a href="mohair">mohair</a>. A single goat produces between of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year, unlike <a href="Domestic%20sheep">sheep</a>, which are shorn only once. Angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor quality diet will curtail mohair development. The United States, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and South Africa are the top producers of mohair.

For a long period of time, Angora goats were bred for their white coat. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Today, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fiber.

Angora goats were depicted on the <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> of the Turkish 50 <a href="Turkish%20lira">lira</a> banknotes of 1938–1952.

Arabic

Arabic (, ' or ' or ) is a <a href="Central%20Semitic%20languages">Central Semitic</a> language complex that first emerged in <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> northwestern <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabia</a> and is now the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab world</a>. It is named after the <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, a term initially used to describe peoples living from <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> in the east to the <a href="Anti-Lebanon%20Mountains">Anti-Lebanon mountains</a> in the west, in northwestern Arabia, and in the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai peninsula</a>.

The modern written language (<a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a>) is derived from <a href="Classical%20Arabic">Classical Arabic</a>. It is widely taught in schools and universities, and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, government, and the media. The two formal varieties are grouped together as Literary Arabic ("fuṣḥā"), which is the official language of 26 states and the <a href="liturgical%20language">liturgical language</a> of <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. Modern Standard Arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of Classical Arabic and uses much of the same <a href="vocabulary">vocabulary</a>. However, it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties, and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties. Much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the <a href="post-classical%20era">post-classical era</a>, especially in modern times.

During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Literary Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy. As a result, many European languages have also <a href="loanword">borrowed</a> many words from it. Arabic influence, mainly in vocabulary, is seen in <a href="European%20languages">European languages</a>, mainly <a href="Arabic%20influence%20on%20the%20Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> 
and to a lesser extent Portuguese, Valencian and Catalan, owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and 800 years of Arabic culture and language in the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, referred to in Arabic as <a href="al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>. <a href="Sicilian%20dialect">Sicilian</a> has about 500 Arabic words as result of Sicily being progressively conquered by Saracens from North Africa, from the mid 9th to mid 10th centuries. Many of these words relate to agriculture and related activities (Hull and Ruffino). <a href="Balkan">Balkan</a> languages, including <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> and <a href="Bulgarian%20language">Bulgarian</a>, have also acquired a significant number of Arabic words through contact with <a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish</a>.

Arabic has influenced many languages around the globe throughout its history. Some of the most influenced languages are <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>, <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Maltese%20language">Maltese</a>, <a href="Urdu%20language">Urdu</a>, <a href="Kashmiri%20language">Kashmiri</a>, <a href="Kurdish%20language">Kurdish</a>, <a href="Bosnian%20language">Bosnian</a>, <a href="Kazakh%20language">Kazakh</a>, <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali</a>, <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>, <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>, <a href="Maldivian%20language">Maldivian</a>, <a href="Indonesian%20language">Indonesian</a>, <a href="Pashto%20language">Pashto</a>, <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi</a>, <a href="Tagalog%20language">Tagalog</a>, <a href="Sindhi%20language">Sindhi</a> and <a href="Hausa%20language">Hausa</a> and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages including Greek and Persian in <a href="medieval">medieval</a> times, and contemporary European languages such as <a href="English%20language">English</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a> in modern times.

<a href="Classical%20Arabic">Classical Arabic</a> is the <a href="Sacred%20language">liturgical language</a> of 1.7 billion <a href="Muslims">Muslims</a> and <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a> is one of six <a href="official%20languages%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">official languages of the United Nations</a>. It is spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world, making it the fifth most spoken language in the world. Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, which is an <a href="abjad">abjad</a> script and is written from <a href="right%20to%20left">right to left</a>, although the spoken varieties are sometimes <a href="Arabic%20chat%20alphabet">written in ASCII Latin</a> from <a href="left%20to%20right">left to right</a> with no standardized orthography.

Arabic is a <a href="Central%20Semitic%20languages">Central Semitic</a> language, closely related to the <a href="Northwest%20Semitic%20languages">Northwest Semitic languages</a> (<a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a>, <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Ugaritic%20language">Ugaritic</a> and <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician</a>), the Ancient South Arabian languages, and various other Semitic languages of Arabia such as <a href="Dadanitic">Dadanitic</a>. The <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic languages</a> changed a great deal between <a href="Proto-Semitic">Proto-Semitic</a> and the establishment of the <a href="Central%20Semitic%20languages">Central Semitic languages</a>, particularly in grammar. Innovations of the Central Semitic languages—all maintained in Arabic—include:
There are several features which Classical Arabic, the modern Arabic varieties, as well as the <a href="Safaitic">Safaitic</a> and <a href="Hismaic%20%28Old%20Arabic%29">Hismaic</a> inscriptions share which are unattested in any other Central Semitic language variety, including the <a href="Dadanitic">Dadanitic</a> and <a href="Taymanitic">Taymanitic</a> languages of the <a href="Hijaz">northern Hijaz</a>. These features are evidence of common descent from a <a href="Proto-language">hypothetical ancestor</a>, <a href="Proto-Arabic">Proto-Arabic</a>. The following features can be reconstructed with confidence for Proto-Arabic:

Arabia boasted a wide variety of Semitic languages in antiquity. In the southwest, various <a href="Central%20Semitic%20languages">Central Semitic languages</a> both belonging to and outside of the <a href="Old%20South%20Arabian">Ancient South Arabian</a> family (e.g. Southern Thamudic) were spoken. It is also believed that the ancestors of the <a href="Modern%20South%20Arabian%20languages">Modern South Arabian languages</a> (non-Central Semitic languages) were also spoken in southern Arabia at this time. To the north, in the oases of northern <a href="Hejaz">Hijaz</a>, <a href="Dadanitic">Dadanitic</a> and <a href="Taymanitic">Taymanitic</a> held some prestige as inscriptional languages. In <a href="Najd">Najd</a> and parts of western Arabia, a language known to scholars as Thamudic C is attested. In eastern Arabia, inscriptions in a script derived from ASA attest to a language known as <a href="Hasaitic%20dialect">Hasaitic</a>. Finally, on the northwestern frontier of Arabia, various languages known to scholars as Thamudic B, Thamudic D, <a href="Safaitic">Safaitic</a>, and <a href="Hismaic">Hismaic</a> are attested. The last two share important isoglosses with later forms of Arabic, leading scholars to theorize that Safaitic and Hismaic are in fact early forms of Arabic and that they should be considered <a href="Old%20Arabic">Old Arabic</a>.

Beginning in the 1st century CE, fragments of Northern Old Arabic are attested in the <a href="Nabataean%20alphabet">Nabataean script</a> across northern Arabia. By the 4th century CE, the Nabataean Aramaic writing system had come to express varieties of Arabic other than that of the Nabataeans.

In late pre-Islamic times, a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of Arabic emerged in the <a href="Hejaz">Hijaz</a> which continued living its parallel life after literary Arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd and 3rd century of the <a href="Islamic%20calendar">Hijra</a>, most strongly in Judeo-Christian texts, keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the "learned" tradition (Classical Arabic). This variety and both its classicizing and "lay" iterations have been termed Middle Arabic in the past, but they are thought to continue an <a href="Old%20Higazi">Old Higazi</a> register. It is clear that the orthography of the <a href="Quran">Qur'ān</a> was not developed for the standardized form of Classical Arabic; rather, it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of Old Higazi.

In the late 6th century AD, a relatively uniform intertribal "poetic koine" distinct from the <a href="Vernacular">spoken vernaculars</a> developed based on the <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> dialects of <a href="Najd">Najd</a>, probably in connection with the court of <a href="Al-Hirah">al-Ḥīra</a>. During the first Islamic century, the majority of Arabic poets and Arabic-writing persons spoke Arabic as their mother tongue. Their texts, although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts, contain traces of non-standardized <a href="Classical%20Arabic">Classical Arabic</a> elements in morphology and syntax. The standardization of Classical Arabic reached completion around the end of the 8th century. The first comprehensive description of the "ʿarabiyya" "Arabic", <a href="Sibawayh">Sībawayhi's</a> "al"-"Kitāb", is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts, in addition to Qur'ān usage and Bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the "ʿarabiyya". By the 8th century, knowledge of Classical Arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the Islamic world.

Charles Ferguson's <a href="koin%C3%A9%20language">koine</a> theory (Ferguson 1959) claims that the modern Arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the Islamic conquests; this view has been challenged in recent times. Ahmad al-Jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of Arabic on the eve of the conquests: Northern and Central (Al-Jallad 2009). The modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests. Instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines, the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features, which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories.
According to Veersteegh and Bickerton, colloquial Arabic dialects arose from pidginized Arabic formed from contact between Arabs and conquered peoples. Pidginization and subsequent creolization among Arabs and <a href="Arabization">arabized</a> peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular Arabic compared to Classical and MSA.

"Arabic" usually designates one of three main variants: <a href="Classical%20Arabic">Classical Arabic</a>, <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a> and <a href="Varieties%20of%20Arabic">"colloquial" or "dialectal" Arabic</a>. Classical Arabic is the language found in the <a href="Quran">Quran</a>, used from the period of <a href="Pre-Islamic%20Arabia">Pre-Islamic Arabia</a> to that of the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>. Theoretically, Classical Arabic is considered normative, according to the <a href="syntactic">syntactic</a> and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians (such as <a href="Sibawayh">Sibawayh</a>) and the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries (such as the <a href="Ibn_Manzur%23Lis.C4.81n_al-.CA.BFArab">Lisān al-ʻArab</a>). In practice, however, modern authors almost never write in pure Classical Arabic, instead using a <a href="literary%20language">literary language</a> with its own grammatical norms and vocabulary, commonly known as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).

MSA is the variety used in most current, printed Arabic publications, spoken by some of the <a href="Arabic%20media">Arabic media</a> across <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, and the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, and understood by most educated Arabic speakers. "Literary Arabic" and "Standard Arabic" ( ") are less strictly defined terms that may refer to Modern Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic.

Some of the differences between Classical Arabic (CA) and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) are as follows:

MSA uses much Classical vocabulary (e.g., ' 'to go') that is not present in the spoken varieties, but deletes Classical words that sound obsolete in MSA. In addition, MSA has borrowed or coined a large number of terms for concepts that did not exist in Quranic times, and MSA continues to evolve. Some words have been borrowed from other languages—notice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation (e.g., ' 'film' or " 'democracy').

However, the current preference is to avoid direct borrowings, preferring to either use <a href="loan%20translation">loan translation</a>s (e.g., ' 'branch', also used for the branch of a company or organization; ' 'wing', is also used for the wing of an airplane, building, air force, etc.), or to coin new words using forms within existing <a href="Semitic%20root">roots</a> ( ' '<a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>', using the root "m/w/t" 'death' put into the <a href="Arabic%20verbs%23Form%20X">Xth form</a>, or ' 'university', based on ' 'to gather, unite'; ' 'republic', based on ' 'multitude'). An earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse (e.g., ' 'telephone' < 'invisible caller (in Sufism)'; "" 'newspaper' < 'palm-leaf stalk').

"Colloquial" or "dialectal" Arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language and evolved from Classical Arabic. Colloquial Arabic has many regional variants; geographically distant varieties usually differ enough to be <a href="mutual%20intelligibility">mutually unintelligible</a>, and some linguists consider them distinct languages. The varieties are typically unwritten. They are often used in informal spoken media, such as <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a>s and <a href="talk%20show">talk show</a>s, as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media such as poetry and printed advertising.

The only variety of modern Arabic to have acquired official language status is <a href="Maltese%20language">Maltese</a>, which is spoken in (predominately <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>) <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and written with the <a href="Maltese%20alphabet">Latin script</a>. It is descended from Classical Arabic through <a href="Siculo-Arabic">Siculo-Arabic</a>, but is not mutually intelligible with any other variety of Arabic. Most linguists list it as a separate language rather than as a dialect of Arabic.

Even during Muhammad's lifetime, there were dialects of spoken Arabic. Muhammad spoke in the dialect of <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>, in the western <a href="Arabian%20peninsula">Arabian peninsula</a>, and it was in this dialect that the Quran was written down. However, the dialects of the eastern Arabian peninsula were considered the most prestigious at the time, so the language of the Quran was ultimately converted to follow the eastern <a href="phonology">phonology</a>. It is this phonology that underlies the modern pronunciation of Classical Arabic. The phonological differences between these two dialects account for some of the complexities of Arabic writing, most notably the writing of the <a href="glottal%20stop">glottal stop</a> or "<a href="hamzah">hamzah</a>" (which was preserved in the eastern dialects but lost in western speech) and the use of ' (representing a sound preserved in the western dialects but merged with ' in eastern speech).

The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of <a href="diglossia">diglossia</a>, which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language, usually in different social situations. In the case of Arabic, educated Arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their school-taught Standard Arabic as well as their native, mutually unintelligible "dialects"; these dialects linguistically constitute separate languages which may have dialects of their own. When educated Arabs of different dialects engage in conversation (for example, a Moroccan speaking with a Lebanese), many speakers <a href="Code-switching">code-switch</a> back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. Arabic speakers often improve their familiarity with other dialects via music or film.

The issue of whether Arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged, in the same way it is for the <a href="varieties%20of%20Chinese">varieties of Chinese</a>, <a href="Hindi%20language">Hindi</a> and <a href="Urdu%20language">Urdu</a>, <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a> and <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a>, <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> and English, etc. In contrast to speakers of Hindi and Urdu who claim they cannot understand each other even when they can, speakers of the varieties of Arabic will claim they can all understand each other even when they cannot. The issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a significant complicating factor: A single written form, significantly different from any of the spoken varieties learned natively, unites a number of sometimes divergent spoken forms. For political reasons, Arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language, despite significant issues of mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions.

From a linguistic standpoint, it is often said that the various spoken varieties of Arabic differ among each other collectively about as much as the <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a>. This is an apt comparison in a number of ways. The period of divergence from a single spoken form is similar—perhaps 1500 years for Arabic, 2000 years for the Romance languages. Also, while it is comprehensible to people from the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>, a linguistically innovative variety such as <a href="Moroccan%20Arabic">Moroccan Arabic</a> is essentially incomprehensible to Arabs from the <a href="Mashriq">Mashriq</a>, much as French is incomprehensible to Spanish or Italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them. This suggests that the spoken varieties may linguistically be considered separate languages.

The influence of Arabic has been most important in Islamic countries, because it is the language of the Islamic sacred book, the Quran. Arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as <a href="Baluchi%20language">Baluchi</a>, <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali</a>, <a href="Berber%20languages">Berber</a>, <a href="Bosnian%20language">Bosnian</a>, <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a>, <a href="Chechen%20language">Chechen</a>, <a href="Dagestani%20language">Dagestani</a>, <a href="English%20language">English</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="Gujarati%20language">Gujarati</a>, <a href="Hausa%20language">Hausa</a>, <a href="Hindustani%20language">Hindustani</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Indonesian%20language">Indonesian</a>, <a href="Kazakh%20language">Kazakh</a>, <a href="Kurdish%20language">Kurdish</a>, <a href="Kutchi%20Language">Kutchi</a>, <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>, <a href="Pashto%20language">Pashto</a>, <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>, <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi</a>, <a href="Rohingya%20language">Rohingya</a>, <a href="Saraiki%20language">Saraiki</a>, <a href="Sicilian%20language">Sicilian</a>, <a href="Sindhi%20language">Sindhi</a>, <a href="Somali%20language">Somali</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>, <a href="Tagalog%20language">Tagalog</a>, <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>, <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>, <a href="Uzbek%20language">Uzbek</a>, and <a href="Wolof%20language">Wolof</a>, as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken.

In addition, English has many Arabic loanwords, some directly, but most via other Mediterranean languages. Examples of such words include admiral, adobe, alchemy, alcohol, algebra, algorithm, alkaline, almanac, amber, arsenal, assassin, candy, carat, cipher, coffee, cotton, ghoul, hazard, jar, kismet, lemon, loofah, magazine, mattress, sherbet, sofa, sumac, tariff, and many other words. Other languages such as Maltese and <a href="Kinubi">Kinubi</a> derive ultimately from Arabic, rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rules.

Terms borrowed range from religious terminology (like Berber "taẓallit", "prayer", from "<a href="salat">salat</a>" ( "")), academic terms (like <a href="Uyghur%20language">Uyghur</a> "mentiq", "logic"), and economic items (like English "coffee") to <a href="placeholder%20name">placeholders</a> (like Spanish "fulano", "so-and-so"), everyday terms (like Hindustani "lekin", "but", or Spanish "taza" and French "tasse", meaning "cup"), and expressions (like Catalan "a betzef", "galore, in quantity"). Most Berber varieties (such as <a href="Kabyle%20language">Kabyle</a>), along with Swahili, borrow some numbers from Arabic. Most Islamic religious terms are direct borrowings from Arabic, such as ("salat"), "prayer", and ("imam"), "prayer leader."

In languages not directly in contact with the Arab world, Arabic loanwords are often transferred indirectly via other languages rather than being transferred directly from Arabic. For example, most Arabic loanwords in Hindustani and Turkish entered through Persian though Persian is an <a href="Indo-Iranian%20languages">Indo-Iranian language</a>. Older Arabic loanwords in Hausa were borrowed from <a href="Kanuri%20language">Kanuri</a>.

Some words in English and other European languages are derived from Arabic, often through other European languages, especially Spanish and Italian. Among them are commonly used words like "<a href="coffee">coffee</a>" ( "qahwah"), "<a href="cotton">cotton</a>" ( ""), and "magazine" ( "<a href="makhzen"></a>"). English words more recognizably of Arabic origin include "<a href="algebra">algebra</a>", "<a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>", "<a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>", "<a href="alkali">alkali</a>", "<a href="zenith">zenith</a>", and "<a href="nadir">nadir</a>".

Arabic words also made their way into several West African languages as Islam spread across the Sahara. Variants of Arabic words such as "kitāb" ("book") have spread to the languages of African groups who had no direct contact with Arab traders.

Since throughout the Islamic world, Arabic occupied a position similar to that of Latin in Europe, many of the Arabic concepts in the fields of science, philosophy, commerce, etc. were coined from Arabic roots by non-native Arabic speakers, notably by Aramaic and Persian translators, and then found their way into other languages. This process of using Arabic roots, especially in Kurdish and Persian, to translate foreign concepts continued through to the 18th and 19th centuries, when swaths of Arab-inhabited lands were under <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> rule.

The most important sources of borrowings into (pre-Islamic) Arabic are from the related (Semitic) languages <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a>, which used to be the principal, international language of communication throughout the ancient Near and Middle East, <a href="Ge%27ez%20language">Ethiopic</a>, and to a lesser degree Hebrew (mainly religious concepts). In addition, many cultural, religious and political terms have entered Arabic from <a href="Iranian%20languages">Iranian languages</a>, notably <a href="Middle%20Persian">Middle Persian</a>, <a href="Parthian%20language">Parthian</a>, and (Classical) Persian, and Hellenistic Greek ("kīmiyāʼ" has as origin the Greek "khymia", meaning in that language the melting of metals; see <a href="Roger%20Dachez">Roger Dachez</a>, "Histoire de la Médecine de l'Antiquité au XXe siècle", Tallandier, 2008, p. 251), "alembic" (distiller) from "ambix" (cup), "almanac" (climate) from "almenichiakon" (calendar). (For the origin of the last three borrowed words, see Alfred-Louis de Prémare, "Foundations of Islam", Seuil, L'Univers Historique, 2002.) Some Arabic borrowings from Semitic or Persian languages are, as presented in De Prémare's above-cited book:

There have been many instances of national movements to convert Arabic script into Latin script or to Romanize the language. Currently, the only Arabic language to use Latin script is <a href="Maltese%20language">Maltese</a>.

The Beirut newspaper "La Syrie" pushed for the change from Arabic script to Latin letters in 1922. The major head of this movement was <a href="Louis%20Massignon">Louis Massignon</a>, a French Orientalist, who brought his concern before the Arabic Language Academy in Damacus in 1928. Massignon's attempt at Romanization failed as the Academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the Western world to take over their country. <a href="Sa%27id%20al-Afghani">Sa'id Afghani</a>, a member of the Academy, mentioned that the movement to Romanize the script was a <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> plan to dominate Lebanon.

After the period of colonialism in Egypt, Egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and re-emphasize Egyptian culture. As a result, some Egyptians pushed for an Egyptianization of the Arabic language in which the formal Arabic and the colloquial Arabic would be combined into one language and the Latin alphabet would be used. There was also the idea of finding a way to use <a href="Hieroglyphics">Hieroglyphics</a> instead of the Latin alphabet, but this was seen as too complicated to use. A scholar, <a href="Salama%20Musa">Salama Musa</a> agreed with the idea of applying a Latin alphabet to Arabic, as he believed that would allow Egypt to have a closer relationship with the West. He also believed that Latin script was key to the success of Egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology. This change in alphabet, he believed, would solve the problems inherent with Arabic, such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words that made it difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Ahmad Lutfi As Sayid and Muhammad Azmi, two Egyptian intellectuals, agreed with Musa and supported the push for Romanization. The idea that Romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in Egypt continued with Abd Al-Aziz Fahmi in 1944. He was the chairman for the Writing and Grammar Committee for the Arabic Language Academy of Cairo. However, this effort failed as the Egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the Arabic alphabet. In particular, the older Egyptian generations believed that the Arabic alphabet had strong connections to Arab values and history, which is easy to believe due to the long history of the Arabic alphabet (Shrivtiel, 189) in Muslim societies.

The <a href="Quran">Quran</a> introduced a new way of writing to the world. People began studying applying the unique styles they learned from the Quran into not only their own writing, but also their <a href="culture">culture</a>. The deep level on which the Quran addresses the reader creates a strong bond and connection to the reader's soul. Writers studied the unique <a href="structure">structure</a> and <a href="Text%20formatting">format</a> of the Quran in order to identify and apply the figurative devices and their impact on the reader. 

The Quran inspired musicality in poetry through the internal rhythm of the verses. The arrangement of words, how certain sounds create harmony, and the agreement of rhymes create the sense of rhythm within each verse. At times, the chapters of the Quran only have the rhythm in common.

The repetition in the Quran introduced the true power and impact repetition can have in poetry. The repetition of certain words and phrases made them appear more firm and explicit in the Quran. The Quran uses constant metaphors of blindness and deafness to imply unbelief. Metaphors were not a new concept to poetry, however the strength of extended metaphors was. The explicit imagery in the Quran inspired many poets to include and focus on the feature in their own work. The poet <a href="Abdallah%20ibn%20al-Mu%27tazz">ibn al mu'tazz</a> wrote a book regarding the figures of speech inspired by his study of the Quran. OPoets such as badr Shakir al sayyab expresses his political opinion in his work through imagery inspired by the forms of more harsher imagery used in the Quran.
The Quran uses figurative devices in order to express the meaning in the most beautiful form possible. The study of the pauses in the Quran as well as other rhetoric allow it to be approached in a multiple ways.

Although the Quran is known for its <a href="fluency">fluency</a> and <a href="harmony">harmony</a>, the structure can be best described as <a href="chaotic">chaotic</a>. The <a href="suras">suras</a> also known as verses of the Quran are not placed in chronological order. The only constant in their structure is that the longest are placed first and shorter ones follow. The topics discussed in the chapter often have no relation to each other and only share their sense of <a href="rhyme">rhyme</a>. The Quran introduces to poetry the idea of abandoning order and scattering narratives throughout the text. Harmony is also present in the sound of the Quran. The elongations and accents present in the Quran create a harmonious flow within the writing. Unique sound of the Quran recited, due to the <a href="Diacritic">accents</a>, create a deeper level of understanding through a deeper emotional connection. 

The Quran is written in a language that is simple and understandable by people. The simplicity of the writing inspired later poets to write in a more clear and clear-cut style. The words of the Quran, although unchanged, are to this day understandable and frequently used in both formal and informal Arabic. The simplicity of the language makes memorizing and reciting the Quran a slightly easier task.

The writer <a href="I%27jaz">al-Khattabi</a> explains how <a href="culture">culture</a> is a required element to create a sense of art in work as well as understand it. He believes that <a href="fluency">fluency</a> and <a href="harmony">harmony</a> the Quran possess are not the only elements that make it beautiful and create a bond between the reader and the text. 
While a lot of poetry was deemed comparable to the Quran in that it is equal to or better than the composition of the Quran, a debate rose that such statements are not possible because humans are incapable of composing work comparable to the Quran.
Because the structure of the Quran made it difficult for a clear timeline to be seen, <a href="Hadith">Hadith</a> were the main source of chronological order. The Hadith were passed down from generation to generation and this tradition became a large resource for understanding the context. Poetry after the Quran began possessing this element of <a href="tradition">tradition</a> by including ambiguity and background information to be required to understand the meaning. 

After the Quran came down to the people, the tradition of memorizing the <a href="Verse%20%28poetry%29">verses</a> became present. It is believed that the larger amount of the Quran memorized is a sign of a stronger faith. As technology improved overtime, hearing <a href="Recitation">recitations</a> of Quran became more available as well as more tools to help memorize the versus. 
The tradition of Love Poetry served as a symbolic representation of a Muslim's desire for a closer contact with their Lord.

While the influence of the Quran on Arabic poetry is explained and defended by numerous writers, some writers such as <a href="Al-Baqillani">Al- Baqillani</a> believe that poetry and the Quran are in no conceivable way related due to the <a href="uniqueness">uniqueness</a> of the Quran. Poetry's imperfections prove his points that that they cannot be compared with the fluency the Quran holds.

Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the <a href="Quran">Quran</a>. At present, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Quran. Arabic is closely associated with the religion of <a href="Islam">Islam</a> because the Quran was written in Arabic, but it is nevertheless also spoken by other religious groups such as <a href="Arab%20Christians%20and%20Arabic-speaking%20Christians">Arab Christians</a>, <a href="Mizrahi%20Jews">Mizrahi Jews</a>, <a href="Druze">Druze</a> and Iraqi <a href="Mandaean">Mandaean</a>s. Most of the world's <a href="Muslims">Muslims</a> do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language, but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran. Among non-Arab Muslims, translations of the Quran are most often accompanied by the original text.

Some Muslims present a <a href="Proto-Human%20language">monogenesis</a> of languages and claim that the Arabic language was the language revealed by God for the benefit of mankind and the original language as a prototype system of symbolic communication, based upon its system of triconsonantal roots, spoken by man from which all other languages were derived, having first been corrupted. <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> has a similar account with the <a href="Tower%20of%20Babel">Tower of Babel</a>.

"Colloquial Arabic" is a collective term for the spoken dialects of Arabic used throughout the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab world</a>, which differ radically from the literary language. The main dialectal division is between the varieties within and outside of the Arabian peninsula, followed by that between <a href="Varieties%20of%20Arabic%23Sedentary%20vs.%20Bedouin">sedentary</a> varieties and the much more conservative <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> varieties. All of the varieties outside of the Arabian peninsula (which include the large majority of speakers) have a large number of features in common with each other that are not found in Classical Arabic. This has led researchers to postulate the existence of a prestige koine dialect in the one or two centuries immediately following the Arab conquest, whose features eventually spread to all of the newly conquered areas. (These features are present to varying degrees inside the Arabian peninsula. Generally, the Arabian peninsula varieties have much more diversity than the non-peninsula varieties, but have been understudied.)

Within the non-peninsula varieties, the largest difference is between the non-Egyptian <a href="Maghrebi%20Arabic">North African dialects</a> (especially Moroccan Arabic) and the others. Moroccan Arabic in particular is hardly comprehensible to Arabic speakers east of <a href="Libya">Libya</a> (although the converse is not true, in part due to the popularity of Egyptian films and other media).

One factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas, which have typically provided a significant number of new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order; however, a much more significant factor for most dialects is, as among Romance languages, retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms. Thus Iraqi "aku", Levantine "fīh" and North African "kayən" all mean 'there is', and all come from Classical Arabic forms ("yakūn", "fīhi", "kā'in" respectively), but now sound very different.

Transcription is a <a href="broad%20transcription">broad IPA transcription</a>, so minor differences were ignored for easier comparison. Also, the <a href="Arabic%20phonology">pronunciation</a> of <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a> differs significantly from region to region.

According to <a href="Charles%20A.%20Ferguson">Charles A. Ferguson</a>, the following are some of the characteristic features of the <a href="Koin%C3%A9%20language">koine</a> that underlies all of the modern dialects outside the Arabian peninsula. Although many other features are common to most or all of these varieties, Ferguson believes that these features in particular are unlikely to have evolved independently more than once or twice and together suggest the existence of the koine:


Of the 29 Proto-Semitic consonants, only one has been lost: , which merged with . But the consonant is still found in many colloquial Arabic dialects. Various other consonants have changed their sound too, but have remained distinct. An original lenited to , and - consistently attested in pre-Islamic Greek transcription of Arabic languages - became palatalized to or by the time of the Quran and , , or in MSA (see <a href="Arabic%20phonology%23Local%20variations">Arabic phonology#Local variations</a> for more detail). An original <a href="voiceless%20alveolar%20lateral%20fricative">voiceless alveolar lateral fricative</a> became . Its <a href="emphatic%20consonant">emphatic</a> counterpart was considered by Arabs to be the most unusual sound in Arabic (Hence the Classical Arabic's appellation ' or "language of the '"); for most modern dialects, it has become an emphatic stop with loss of the laterality or with complete loss of any pharyngealization or velarization, . (The classical "" pronunciation of <a href="pharyngealization">pharyngealization</a> still occurs in the <a href="Mehri%20language">Mehri language</a> and the similar sound without velarization, , exists in other <a href="Modern%20South%20Arabian%20languages">Modern South Arabian languages</a>.)

Other changes may also have happened. Classical Arabic pronunciation is not thoroughly recorded and different <a href="comparative%20method%20%28linguistics%29">reconstructions</a> of the sound system of Proto-Semitic propose different phonetic values. One example is the emphatic consonants, which are pharyngealized in modern pronunciations but may have been velarized in the eighth century and glottalized in Proto-Semitic.

Reduction of and between vowels occurs in a number of circumstances and is responsible for much of the complexity of third-weak ("defective") verbs. Early Akkadian transcriptions of Arabic names shows that this reduction had not yet occurred as of the early part of the 1st millennium BC.

The Classical Arabic language as recorded was a poetic <a href="koine">koine</a> that reflected a consciously archaizing dialect, chosen based on the tribes of the western part of the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, who spoke the most conservative variants of Arabic. Even at the time of Muhammed and before, other dialects existed with many more changes, including the loss of most glottal stops, the loss of case endings, the reduction of the diphthongs and into monophthongs , etc. Most of these changes are present in most or all modern varieties of Arabic.

An interesting feature of the writing system of the Quran (and hence of Classical Arabic) is that it contains certain features of Muhammad's native dialect of Mecca, corrected through diacritics into the forms of standard Classical Arabic. Among these features visible under the corrections are the loss of the glottal stop and a differing development of the reduction of certain final sequences containing : Evidently, final became as in the Classical language, but final became a different sound, possibly (rather than again in the Classical language). This is the apparent source of the "alif maqṣūrah" 'restricted alif' where a final is reconstructed: a letter that would normally indicate or some similar high-vowel sound, but is taken in this context to be a logical variant of "alif" and represent the sound .

The "colloquial" spoken varieties of Arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of Arabic speakers. "Formal" <a href="Literary%20Arabic">Literary Arabic</a> (usually specifically Modern Standard Arabic) is learned at school; although many speakers have a native-like command of the language, it is technically not the native language of any speakers. Both varieties can be both written and spoken, although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances, e.g., in radio broadcasts, formal lectures, parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial varieties. Even when the literary language is spoken, however, it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud. When speaking <a href="extemporaneous">extemporaneous</a>ly (i.e. making up the language on the spot, as in a normal discussion among people), speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties. In fact, there is a continuous range of "in-between" spoken varieties: from nearly pure Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), to a form that still uses MSA grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence, to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in MSA, to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the "rough edges" (the most noticeably "vulgar" or non-Classical aspects) smoothed out, to pure colloquial. The particular variant (or "<a href="Register%20%28sociolinguistics%29">register</a>") used depends on the social class and education level of the speakers involved and the level of formality of the speech situation. Often it will vary within a single encounter, e.g., moving from nearly pure MSA to a more mixed language in the process of a radio interview, as the interviewee becomes more comfortable with the interviewer. This type of variation is characteristic of the <a href="diglossia">diglossia</a> that exists throughout the Arabic-speaking world.
Although Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is a unitary language, its pronunciation varies somewhat from country to country and from region to region within a country. The variation in individual "accents" of MSA speakers tends to mirror corresponding variations in the colloquial speech of the speakers in question, but with the distinguishing characteristics moderated somewhat. Note that it is important in descriptions of "Arabic" phonology to distinguish between pronunciation of a given colloquial (spoken) dialect and the pronunciation of MSA by these same speakers. Although they are related, they are not the same. For example, the phoneme that derives from Proto-Semitic has many different pronunciations in the modern spoken varieties, e.g., . Speakers whose native variety has either or will use the same pronunciation when speaking MSA. Even speakers from <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, whose native Egyptian Arabic has , normally use when speaking MSA. The of Persian Gulf speakers is the only variant pronunciation which isn't found in MSA; is used instead.

Another example: Many colloquial varieties are known for a type of <a href="vowel%20harmony">vowel harmony</a> in which the presence of an "emphatic consonant" triggers backed <a href="allophone">allophone</a>s of nearby vowels (especially of the low vowels , which are backed to in these circumstances and very often fronted to in all other circumstances). In many spoken varieties, the backed or "emphatic" vowel allophones spread a fair distance in both directions from the triggering consonant; in some varieties (most notably Egyptian Arabic), the "emphatic" allophones spread throughout the entire word, usually including prefixes and suffixes, even at a distance of several syllables from the triggering consonant. Speakers of colloquial varieties with this vowel harmony tend to introduce it into their MSA pronunciation as well, but usually with a lesser degree of spreading than in the colloquial varieties. (For example, speakers of colloquial varieties with extremely long-distance harmony may allow a moderate, but not extreme, amount of spreading of the harmonic allophones in their MSA speech, while speakers of colloquial varieties with moderate-distance harmony may only harmonize immediately adjacent vowels in MSA.)

Modern Standard Arabic has six pure <a href="vowel">vowel</a>s, with short and corresponding long vowels . There are also two <a href="diphthongs">diphthongs</a>: and .

The pronunciation of the vowels differs from speaker to speaker, in a way that tends to reflect the pronunciation of the corresponding colloquial variety. Nonetheless, there are some common trends. Most noticeable is the differing pronunciation of and , which tend towards fronted , or in most situations, but a back in the neighborhood of <a href="emphatic%20consonant">emphatic consonant</a>s. Some accents and dialects, such as those of the <a href="Hijaz">Hijaz</a>, have central in all situations. The vowel varies towards too. Listen to the final vowel in the recording of " at the beginning of this article, for example. The point is, Arabic has only three short vowel phonemes, so those phonemes can have a very wide range of allophones. The vowels and are often affected somewhat in emphatic neighborhoods as well, with generally more back or centralized <a href="allophone">allophone</a>s, but the differences are less great than for the low vowels. The pronunciation of short and tends towards and , respectively, in many dialects.

The definition of both "emphatic" and "neighborhood" vary in ways that reflect (to some extent) corresponding variations in the spoken dialects. Generally, the consonants triggering "emphatic" allophones are the <a href="pharyngealization">pharyngealized</a> consonants ; ; and , if not followed immediately by . Frequently, the <a href="fricative">fricative</a>s also trigger emphatic allophones; occasionally also the <a href="pharyngeal%20consonant">pharyngeal consonant</a>s (the former more than the latter). Many dialects have multiple emphatic allophones of each vowel, depending on the particular nearby consonants. In most MSA accents, emphatic coloring of vowels is limited to vowels immediately adjacent to a triggering consonant, although in some it spreads a bit farther: e.g., ' 'time'; ' 'homeland'; " 'downtown' (sometimes or similar).

In a non-emphatic environment, the vowel in the diphthong tends to be fronted even more than elsewhere, often pronounced or : hence ' 'sword' but ' 'summer'. However, in accents with no emphatic allophones of (e.g., in the <a href="Hijaz">Hijaz</a>), the pronunciation occurs in all situations.

The phoneme is represented by the Arabic letter ' () and has many standard pronunciations. is characteristic of north Algeria, Iraq, also in most of the Arabian peninsula but with an allophonic in some positions; occurs in most of the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> and most North Africa; and is used in most of Egypt and some regions in Yemen and Oman. Generally this corresponds with the pronunciation in the colloquial dialects. In some regions in Sudan and Yemen, as well as in some Sudanese and Yemeni dialects, it may be either or , representing the original pronunciation of Classical Arabic. Foreign words containing may be transcribed with , , , , , or , mainly depending on the regional spoken variety of Arabic or the commonly diacriticized Arabic letter. Note also that in northern Egypt, where the Arabic letter ' () is normally pronounced , a separate phoneme , which may be transcribed with , occurs in a small number of mostly non-Arabic loanwords, e.g., 'jacket'.

In many varieties, () are actually <a href="epiglottal%20consonant">epiglottal</a> (despite what is reported in many earlier works).

The emphatic consonant was actually pronounced , or possibly —either way, a highly unusual sound. The medieval Arabs actually termed their language " 'the language of the <a href="%E1%B8%8C%C4%81d">Ḍād</a>' (the name of the letter used for this sound), since they thought the sound was unique to their language. (In fact, it also exists in a few other minority Semitic languages, e.g., Mehri.)

Arabic has consonants traditionally termed "emphatic" (), which exhibit simultaneous <a href="pharyngealization">pharyngealization</a> as well as varying degrees of <a href="velarization">velarization</a> , so they may be written with the "Velarized or pharyngealized" diacritic () as: . This simultaneous articulation is described as "Retracted Tongue Root" by phonologists. In some transcription systems, emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter, for example, is written ; in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it, for example, .

Vowels and consonants can be phonologically short or long. Long (<a href="gemination">geminate</a>) consonants are normally written doubled in Latin transcription (i.e. bb, dd, etc.), reflecting the presence of the <a href="Arabic%20diacritics">Arabic diacritic</a> mark ', which indicates doubled consonants. In actual pronunciation, doubled consonants are held twice as long as short consonants. This consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive: ' 'he accepted' vs. " 'he kissed'.

Arabic has two kinds of syllables: open syllables (CV) and (CVV)—and closed syllables (CVC), (CVVC) and (CVCC). The syllable types with two <a href="morae">morae</a> (units of time), i.e. CVC and CVV, are termed "<a href="heavy%20syllable">heavy syllable</a>s", while those with three morae, i.e. CVVC and CVCC, are "<a href="superheavy%20syllable">superheavy syllable</a>s". Superheavy syllables in Classical Arabic occur in only two places: at the end of the sentence (due to <a href="pausa">pausa</a>l pronunciation) and in words such as ' 'hot', ' 'stuff, substance', ' 'they disputed with each other', where a long ' occurs before two identical consonants (a former short vowel between the consonants has been lost). (In less formal pronunciations of Modern Standard Arabic, superheavy syllables are common at the end of words or before <a href="clitic">clitic</a> suffixes such as "" 'us, our', due to the deletion of final short vowels.)

In surface pronunciation, every vowel must be preceded by a consonant (which may include the <a href="glottal%20stop">glottal stop</a> ). There are no cases of <a href="hiatus%20%28linguistics%29">hiatus</a> within a word (where two vowels occur next to each other, without an intervening consonant). Some words do have an underlying vowel at the beginning, such as the definite article "al-" or words such as ' 'he bought', ' 'meeting'. When actually pronounced, one of three things happens:

Word stress is not phonemically contrastive in Standard Arabic. It bears a strong relationship to vowel length. The basic rules for Modern Standard Arabic are:

Examples:' 'book', ' 'writer', ' 'desk', ' 'desks', ' 'library' (but ' 'library' in short pronunciation), ' (Modern Standard Arabic) 'they wrote' = ' (dialect), ' (Modern Standard Arabic) 'they wrote it' = ' (dialect), ' (Modern Standard Arabic) 'they (dual, fem) wrote', ' (Modern Standard Arabic) 'I wrote' = ' (short form or dialect). Doubled consonants count as two consonants: ' 'magazine', "" "place".

These rules may result in differently stressed syllables when final case endings are pronounced, vs. the normal situation where they are not pronounced, as in the above example of ' 'library' in full pronunciation, but ' 'library' in short pronunciation.

The restriction on final long vowels does not apply to the spoken dialects, where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen from loss of original final "-hu/hi".

Some dialects have different stress rules. In the Cairo (Egyptian Arabic) dialect a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word, hence ' 'school', ' 'Cairo'. This also affects the way that Modern Standard Arabic is pronounced in Egypt. In the Arabic of <a href="Sana%27a">Sanaa</a>, stress is often retracted: ' 'two houses', ' 'their table', ' 'desks', ' 'sometimes', "" 'their school'. (In this dialect, only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy; in a two-syllable word, the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light; and in longer words, the final syllable cannot be stressed.)

The final short vowels (e.g., the case endings "-a -i -u" and mood endings "-u -a") are often not pronounced in this language, despite forming part of the formal paradigm of nouns and verbs. The following levels of pronunciation exist:

This is the most formal level actually used in speech. All endings are pronounced as written, except at the end of an utterance, where the following changes occur:

This is a formal level of pronunciation sometimes seen. It is somewhat like pronouncing all words as if they were in pausal position (with influence from the <a href="varieties%20of%20Arabic">colloquial varieties</a>). The following changes occur:

This is the pronunciation used by speakers of Modern Standard Arabic in <a href="extemporaneous">extemporaneous</a> speech, i.e. when producing new sentences rather than simply reading a prepared text. It is similar to formal short pronunciation except that the rules for dropping final vowels apply "even" when a <a href="clitic">clitic</a> suffix is added. Basically, short-vowel case and mood endings are never pronounced and certain other changes occur that echo the corresponding colloquial pronunciations. Specifically:

As mentioned above, many spoken dialects have a process of "emphasis spreading", where the "emphasis" (<a href="pharyngealization">pharyngealization</a>) of <a href="emphatic%20consonant">emphatic consonant</a>s spreads forward and back through adjacent syllables, pharyngealizing all nearby consonants and triggering the back allophone in all nearby <a href="low%20vowel">low vowel</a>s. The extent of emphasis spreading varies. For example, in Moroccan Arabic, it spreads as far as the first full vowel (i.e. sound derived from a long vowel or diphthong) on either side; in many Levantine dialects, it spreads indefinitely, but is blocked by any or ; while in Egyptian Arabic, it usually spreads throughout the entire word, including prefixes and suffixes. In Moroccan Arabic, also have emphatic allophones and , respectively.

Unstressed short vowels, especially , are deleted in many contexts. Many sporadic examples of short vowel change have occurred (especially → and interchange ↔). Most Levantine dialects merge short /i u/ into in most contexts (all except directly before a single final consonant). In Moroccan Arabic, on the other hand, short triggers <a href="labialization">labialization</a> of nearby consonants (especially <a href="velar%20consonant">velar consonant</a>s and <a href="uvular%20consonant">uvular consonant</a>s), and then short /a i u/ all merge into , which is deleted in many contexts. (The labialization plus is sometimes interpreted as an underlying phoneme .) This essentially causes the wholesale loss of the short-long vowel distinction, with the original long vowels remaining as half-long , phonemically , which are used to represent "both" short and long vowels in borrowings from Literary Arabic.

Most spoken dialects have <a href="monophthongization">monophthongized</a> original to (in all circumstances, including adjacent to emphatic consonants). In Moroccan Arabic, these have subsequently merged into original .

In some dialects, there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above. For example, non-Arabic is used in the Maghrebi dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names. Semitic became extremely early on in Arabic before it was written down; a few modern Arabic dialects, such as Iraqi (influenced by Persian and <a href="Kurdish%20Language">Kurdish</a>) distinguish between and . The Iraqi Arabic also uses sounds , and uses Persian adding letters, e.g.: "" – "a plum"; " – "a truffle" and so on.

Early in the expansion of Arabic, the separate emphatic phonemes and coalesced into a single phoneme . Many dialects (such as Egyptian, Levantine, and much of the Maghreb) subsequently lost <a href="fricative">fricative</a>s, converting into . Most dialects borrow "learned" words from the Standard language using the same pronunciation as for inherited words, but some dialects without interdental fricatives (particularly in Egypt and the Levant) render original in borrowed words as .

Another key distinguishing mark of Arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular plosives , (Proto-Semitic ), and :

Pharyngealization of the emphatic consonants tends to weaken in many of the spoken varieties, and to spread from emphatic consonants to nearby sounds. In addition, the "emphatic" allophone automatically triggers pharyngealization of adjacent sounds in many dialects. As a result, it may difficult or impossible to determine whether a given <a href="coronal%20consonant">coronal consonant</a> is phonemically emphatic or not, especially in dialects with long-distance emphasis spreading. (A notable exception is the sounds vs. in Moroccan Arabic, because the former is pronounced as an <a href="affricate">affricate</a> but the latter is not.)

As in other Semitic languages, Arabic has a complex and unusual <a href="morphology%20%28linguistics%29">morphology</a> (i.e. method of constructing words from a basic <a href="root%20%28linguistics%29">root</a>). Arabic has a <a href="nonconcatenative%20morphology">nonconcatenative</a> "root-and-pattern" morphology: A root consists of a set of bare consonants (usually <a href="triliteral">three</a>), which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words. For example, the word for 'I wrote' is constructed by combining the root ' 'write' with the pattern ' 'I Xed' to form ' 'I wrote'. Other verbs meaning 'I Xed' will typically have the same pattern but with different consonants, e.g. ' 'I read', ' 'I ate', ' 'I went', although other patterns are possible (e.g. ' 'I drank', ' 'I said', ' 'I spoke', where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffix ' is always used).

From a single root , numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns:

Nouns in Literary Arabic have three grammatical <a href="noun%20case">cases</a> (<a href="nominative%20case">nominative</a>, <a href="accusative%20case">accusative</a>, and <a href="genitive%20case">genitive</a> [also used when the noun is governed by a preposition]); three <a href="grammatical%20number">numbers</a> (singular, dual and plural); two <a href="gender%20%28grammar%29">genders</a> (masculine and feminine); and three "states" (indefinite, definite, and <a href="Status%20constructus">construct</a>). The cases of singular nouns (other than those that end in long ā) are indicated by <a href="suffix">suffix</a>ed short vowels (/-u/ for nominative, /-a/ for accusative, /-i/ for genitive).

The feminine singular is often marked by /-at/, which is reduced to /-ah/ or /-a/ before a pause. Plural is indicated either through endings (the <a href="sound%20plural">sound plural</a>) or internal modification (the <a href="broken%20plural">broken plural</a>). Definite nouns include all proper nouns, all nouns in "construct state" and all nouns which are <a href="prefix">prefix</a>ed by the definite article /al-/. Indefinite singular nouns (other than those that end in long ā) add a final /-n/ to the case-marking vowels, giving /-un/, /-an/ or /-in/ (which is also referred to as <a href="nunation">nunation</a> or <a href="tanw%C4%ABn">tanwīn</a>).

<a href="Adjective">Adjective</a>s in Literary Arabic are marked for case, number, gender and state, as for nouns. However, the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective, which takes the /-ah/ or /-at/ suffix.

<a href="Pronoun">Pronoun</a>s in Literary Arabic are marked for person, number and gender. There are two varieties, independent pronouns and <a href="Enclitic%23Enclitic">enclitics</a>. Enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb, noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns. The first-person singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs (/-ni/) and for nouns or prepositions (/-ī/ after consonants, /-ya/ after vowels).

Nouns, verbs, pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects. However, non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular. Furthermore, a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun. Numerals between three and ten show "chiasmic" agreement, in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa.

Verbs in Literary Arabic are marked for person (first, second, or third), gender, and number. They are <a href="Grammatical%20conjugation">conjugated</a> in two major paradigms (<a href="past">past</a> and <a href="non-past">non-past</a>); two <a href="grammatical%20voice">voices</a> (active and passive); and six <a href="grammatical%20mood">moods</a> (<a href="indicative">indicative</a>, <a href="imperative%20mood">imperative</a>, <a href="subjunctive">subjunctive</a>, <a href="Irrealis%20mood%23Jussive">jussive</a>, shorter <a href="energetic%20mood">energetic</a> and longer energetic), the fifth and sixth moods, the energetics, exist only in Classical Arabic but not in MSA. There are also two <a href="participle">participle</a>s (active and passive) and a <a href="verbal%20noun">verbal noun</a>, but no <a href="infinitive">infinitive</a>.

The past and non-past paradigms are sometimes also termed <a href="perfective">perfective</a> and <a href="imperfective">imperfective</a>, indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of <a href="Grammatical%20tense">tense</a> and <a href="Grammatical%20aspect">aspect</a>. The moods other than the <a href="indicative">indicative</a> occur only in the non-past, and the <a href="future%20tense">future tense</a> is signaled by prefixing ' or ' onto the non-past. The past and non-past differ in the form of the stem (e.g., past ' vs. non-past '), and also use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person, number and gender: In the past, the person, number and gender are fused into a single <a href="suffix">suffix</a>al morpheme, while in the non-past, a combination of <a href="prefix">prefix</a>es (primarily encoding person) and suffixes (primarily encoding gender and number) are used. The passive voice uses the same person/number/gender affixes but changes the vowels of the stem.

The following shows a paradigm of a regular Arabic verb, "" 'to write'. Note that in Modern Standard, the energetic mood (in either long or short form, which have the same meaning) is almost never used.

Like other <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic languages</a>, and unlike most other languages, Arabic makes much more use of <a href="nonconcatenative%20morphology">nonconcatenative morphology</a> (applying a large number of templates applied roots) to <a href="Morphological%20derivation">derive</a> words than adding prefixes or suffixes to words.

For verbs, a given root can occur in many different <a href="Derived%20stem">derived verb stems</a> (of which there are about fifteen), each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and non-past stems, active and passive participles, and verbal noun. These are referred to by Western scholars as "Form I", "Form II", and so on through "Form XV" (although Forms XI to XV are rare). These stems encode grammatical functions such as the <a href="causative">causative</a>, <a href="intensive">intensive</a> and <a href="reflexive%20verb">reflexive</a>. Stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs, albeit often semantically related, and each is the basis for its own <a href="Verb%20conjugation">conjugational</a> paradigm. As a result, these derived stems are part of the system of <a href="derivational%20morphology">derivational morphology</a>, not part of the <a href="Inflection">inflectional</a> system.

Examples of the different verbs formed from the root ' 'write' (using ' 'red' for Form IX, which is limited to colors and physical defects):
Form II is sometimes used to create transitive <a href="denominative%20verb">denominative verb</a>s (verbs built from nouns); Form V is the equivalent used for intransitive denominatives.

The associated participles and verbal nouns of a verb are the primary means of forming new lexical nouns in Arabic. This is similar to the process by which, for example, the English <a href="gerund">gerund</a> "meeting" (similar to a verbal noun) has turned into a noun referring to a particular type of social, often work-related event where people gather together to have a "discussion" (another lexicalized verbal noun). Another fairly common means of forming nouns is through one of a limited number of patterns that can be applied directly to roots, such as the "nouns of location" in "ma-" (e.g. ' 'desk, office' < ' 'write', ' 'kitchen' < ' 'cook').

The only three genuine suffixes are as follows:

The spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual (it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances). They have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative, but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes (most often /bi-/ for indicative vs. unmarked subjunctive). They have also mostly lost the indefinite "nunation" and the internal passive.

The following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in Egyptian Arabic.

The Arabic alphabet derives from the Aramaic through <a href="Nabatean%20alphabet">Nabatean</a>, to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of <a href="Coptic%20alphabet">Coptic</a> or <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic script</a>s to <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek script</a>. Traditionally, there were several differences between the Western (North African) and Middle Eastern versions of the alphabet—in particular, the "faʼ" had a dot underneath and "qaf" a single dot above in the Maghreb, and the order of the letters was slightly different (at least when they were used as numerals).

However, the old Maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the Maghreb itself, and remains in use mainly in the Quranic schools (<a href="zaouia">zaouia</a>s) of West Africa. Arabic, like all other Semitic languages (except for the Latin-written Maltese, and the languages with the <a href="Ge%27ez%20script">Ge'ez script</a>), is written from right to left. There are several styles of script, notably <a href="Naskh%20%28script%29">naskh</a>, which is used in print and by computers, and <a href="Ruq%27ah">ruqʻah</a>, which is commonly used in <a href="handwriting">handwriting</a>.

After <a href="Khalil%20ibn%20Ahmad%20al%20Farahidi">Khalil ibn Ahmad al Farahidi</a> finally fixed the Arabic script around 786, many styles were developed, both for the writing down of the Quran and other books, and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration.

Arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the Western world, and is still considered by <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem. Being cursive by nature, unlike the Latin script, Arabic script is used to write down a <a href="ayah">verse</a> of the Quran, a <a href="hadith">hadith</a>, or simply a <a href="proverb">proverb</a>. The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal. One of the current masters of the genre is <a href="Hassan%20Massoudy">Hassan Massoudy</a>.

In modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written Arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language, necessary for digitized unification, will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through calligraphy.

There are a number of different standards for the <a href="romanization%20of%20Arabic">romanization of Arabic</a>, i.e. methods of accurately and efficiently representing Arabic with the Latin script. There are various conflicting motivations involved, which leads to multiple systems. Some are interested in <a href="transliteration">transliteration</a>, i.e. representing the "spelling" of Arabic, while others focus on <a href="Phonetic%20transcription">transcription</a>, i.e. representing the "pronunciation" of Arabic. (They differ in that, for example, the same letter is used to represent both a consonant, as in "you" or "yet", and a vowel, as in "me" or "eat".) Some systems, e.g. for scholarly use, are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of Arabic, generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the Arabic script. These systems are heavily reliant on <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>al marks such as "š" for the sound equivalently written "sh" in English. Other systems (e.g. the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20orthography">Bahá'í orthography</a>) are intended to help readers who are neither Arabic speakers nor linguists with intuitive pronunciation of Arabic names and phrases. These less "scientific" tend to avoid <a href="diacritics">diacritics</a> and use <a href="digraph%20%28orthography%29">digraphs</a> (like "sh" and "kh"). These are usually simpler to read, but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems, and may lead to ambiguities, e.g. whether to interpret "sh" as a single sound, as in "gash", or a combination of two sounds, as in "gashouse". The <a href="ALA-LC">ALA-LC</a> romanization solves this problem by separating the two sounds with a <a href="Prime%20%28symbol%29">prime</a> symbol ( ′ ); e.g., "as′hal" 'easier'.

During the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, Western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the Arab world, such as <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s, the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a>, <a href="email">email</a>, <a href="bulletin%20board%20system">bulletin board system</a>s, <a href="Internet%20Relay%20Chat">IRC</a>, <a href="instant%20messaging">instant messaging</a> and <a href="mobile%20phone%20text%20messaging">mobile phone text messaging</a>. Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the Latin script only, and some of them still do not have the Arabic script as an optional feature. As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text using the Latin script, sometimes known as IM Arabic.

To handle those Arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral "3" may be used to represent the Arabic letter . There is no universal name for this type of transliteration, but some have named it <a href="Arabic%20Chat%20Alphabet">Arabic Chat Alphabet</a>. Other systems of transliteration exist, such as using dots or capitalization to represent the "emphatic" counterparts of certain consonants. For instance, using capitalization, the letter , may be represented by d. Its emphatic counterpart, , may be written as D.

In most of present-day North Africa, the <a href="Western%20Arabic%20numerals">Western Arabic numerals</a> (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are used. However, in Egypt and Arabic-speaking countries to the east of it, the <a href="Eastern%20Arabic%20numerals">Eastern Arabic numerals</a> ( – – – – – – – – – ) are in use. When representing a number in Arabic, the lowest-valued <a href="positional%20notation">position</a> is placed on the right, so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right scripts. Sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right, but numbers are spoken in the traditional Arabic fashion, with units and tens reversed from the modern English usage. For example, 24 is said "four and twenty" just like in the German language ("vierundzwanzig") and <a href="Classical%20Hebrew">Classical Hebrew</a>, and 1975 is said "a thousand and nine-hundred and five and seventy" or, more eloquently, "a thousand and nine-hundred five seventy"

<a href="Academy%20of%20the%20Arabic%20Language%20%28disambiguation%29">Academy of the Arabic Language</a> is the name of a number of language-regulation bodies formed in the Arab League. The most active are in <a href="Academy%20of%20the%20Arabic%20Language%20in%20Damascus">Damascus</a> and <a href="Academy%20of%20the%20Arabic%20Language%20in%20Cairo">Cairo</a>. They review language development, monitor new words and approve inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries. They also publish old and historical Arabic manuscripts.
Arabic has been taught worldwide in many <a href="elementary%20school">elementary</a> and <a href="secondary%20school">secondary</a> schools, especially Muslim schools. Universities around the world have classes that teach Arabic as part of their <a href="Foreign%20Languages">foreign languages</a>, <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20studies">Middle Eastern studies</a>, and <a href="religious%20studies">religious studies</a> courses. <a href="Arabic%20language%20school">Arabic language school</a>s exist to assist students to learn Arabic outside the academic world. There are many Arabic <a href="language%20school">language school</a>s in the Arab world and other <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim</a> countries. Because the Quran is written in Arabic and all <a href="Glossary%20of%20Islam">Islamic terms</a> are in Arabic, millions of Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) study the language. Software and books with tapes are also important part of Arabic learning, as many of Arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or Arabic language school classes available. Radio series of Arabic language classes are also provided from some radio stations. A number of websites on the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> provide online classes for all levels as a means of distance education; most teach Modern Standard Arabic, but some teach regional varieties from numerous countries.

Historically, Arab linguists considered the Arabic language to be superior to all other languages, and took almost no interest in learning any language other than Arabic . With the sole example of Medieval linguist <a href="Abu%20Hayyan%20al-Gharnati">Abu Hayyan al-Gharnati</a> - who, while a scholar of the Arabic language, was not ethnically Arab - scholars of the Arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics, considering all other languages inferior.

In modern times, the educated upper classes in the Arab world have taken a nearly opposite view. <a href="Yasir%20Suleiman">Yasir Suleiman</a> wrote in 2011 that "studying and knowing English or French in most of the Middle East and North Africa have become a badge of sophistication and modernity and ... feigning, or asserting, weakness or lack of facility in Arabic is sometimes paraded as a sign of status, class, and perversely, even education through a mélange of code-switching practises." <a href="Arab-American">Arab-American</a> professor Franck Salamah went as far as to declare Arabic a dead language conveying dead ideas, blaming its stagnation for Arab intellectual stagnation and lamenting that great writers in Arabic are judged by their command of the language and not the merit of the ideas they express with it.

Alfred Hitchcock

Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) was an English <a href="film%20director">film director</a> and <a href="film%20producer">producer</a>, referred to as the "Master of Suspense". He pioneered many elements of the <a href="Thriller%20film">suspense</a> and <a href="psychological%20thriller">psychological thriller</a> genres. He had a successful career in <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British cinema</a> with both <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>s and early <a href="sound%20film">talkies</a> and became renowned as Britain's leading filmmaker. Hitchcock moved to <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> in 1939 and became a U.S. citizen in 1955.

Hitchcock became a highly visible public figure through interviews, film trailers, <a href="List%20of%20Alfred%20Hitchcock%20cameo%20appearances">cameo appearances</a> in his own films, and the ten years in which he hosted the television programme "<a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock%20Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>" (1955–1965). He also fashioned for himself a recognisable directorial style, and the term <a href="Hitchcockian">Hitchcockian</a> is now often used to refer to his style of filmmaking. Hitchcock's stylistic trademarks include the use of camera movement that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of <a href="voyeurism">voyeurism</a>. In addition, he framed shots to maximise anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative forms of <a href="film%20editing">film editing</a>. His work often features <a href="fugitive">fugitive</a>s on the run alongside "icy blonde" female characters.

He directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades and is often regarded as one of the most influential directors in cinematic history. His first thriller, "" (1927), helped shape the <a href="Thriller%20film">thriller</a> genre in film. His 1929 film, "<a href="Blackmail%20%281929%20film%29">Blackmail</a>", is often cited as the first British , while "<a href="Rear%20Window">Rear Window</a>" (1954), "<a href="Vertigo%20%28film%29">Vertigo</a>" (1958), "<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>" (1959) and "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>" (1960) are regularly ranked among the <a href="List%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20best">greatest films of all time</a>.

Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in <a href="Leytonstone">Leytonstone</a>, at the time part of <a href="Essex">Essex</a> (now part of the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Waltham%20Forest">London Borough of Waltham Forest</a>). He was the second son and the youngest of three children of William Hitchcock (1862–1914), a <a href="greengrocer">greengrocer</a> and <a href="Poultry%20%28office%29">poulterer</a>, and Emma Jane Hitchcock (née Whelan; 1863–1942). He was named after his father's brother. Hitchcock was raised as a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, and sent to <a href="Salesian%20College%2C%20Battersea">Salesian College, Battersea</a>, and the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a> <a href="St%20Ignatius%27%20College">St Ignatius' College</a> in <a href="Stamford%20Hill">Stamford Hill</a>, London. His parents were both of half-<a href="English%20people">English</a> and half-<a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> ancestry. He often described a lonely and sheltered childhood that was worsened by his obesity. Around age five, Hitchcock recalled that to punish him for behaving badly, his father sent him to the local police station with a note asking the officer to lock him away for five minutes. This incident implanted a lifelong fear of policemen in Hitchcock, and such harsh treatment and wrongful accusations are frequent themes in his films.

Sources vary on Hitchcock's performance in school. Gene Adair reports that by "most accounts, Alfred was only an average, or slightly above-average, student", although McGilligan writes that Hitchcock "certainly" excelled academically. When Hitchcock was 15, his father died. In that same year, he left St. Ignatius to study at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a>, London. After leaving, he became a <a href="technical%20drawing">draftsman</a> and advertising designer with an <a href="electrical%20cable">electrical cable</a> company called <a href="William%20Thomas%20Henley">Henley's</a>.

During the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, Hitchcock was called up to serve in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>; he was ultimately excused from military service with a 'C3' classification due to his size, height or an unnamed medical condition, but was nonetheless "able to stand service conditions in garrisons at home". Hitchcock joined a cadet regiment of the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> in 1917. His military stint was limited, and he mainly engaged in theoretical briefings, weekend drills, and exercises. Hitchcock would march around London's <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a> and was required to wear military <a href="puttees">puttees</a>, though he never mastered the proper wrapping of them.

While working at Henley's, Hitchcock began to dabble in creative writing. The company's in-house publication "The Henley Telegraph" was founded in 1919, and he often submitted short articles, eventually becoming one of its most prolific contributors. His first piece, "Gas" (1919), published in the first issue, tells of a young woman who imagines that she is being assaulted one night in London—only for the <a href="Plot%20twist">twist</a> to reveal that it was all just a hallucination in the dentist's chair induced by the <a href="anesthetic">anesthetic</a>.

Hitchcock's second piece was "The Woman's Part" (1919), which involves the conflicted emotions that a husband feels as he watches his actress wife perform onstage. "Sordid" (1920) surrounds an attempt to buy a sword from an antiques dealer, with another twist ending. The short story "And There Was No Rainbow" (1920) is Hitchcock's first brush with possibly censurable material. A young man goes out looking for a brothel, only to stumble into the house of his best friend's girl. "What's Who?" (1920) at first glance seems to be a precursor to <a href="Abbott%20and%20Costello">Abbott and Costello</a>'s "<a href="Who%27s%20on%20First%3F">Who's on First?</a>" routine, as it is a short dialogue piece resembling antic dialogue from a music hall skit. It captures the confusion that occurs when a group of actors decide to put together a sketch in which they will impersonate themselves. In the story’s forty sentences, confusion regarding the questions “Who’s me?” and "Who’s you?” rise to comic emotional heights. "The History of Pea Eating" (1920) is a satirical disquisition on the various attempts that people have made over the centuries to eat peas successfully. His final piece, "Fedora" (1921), is his shortest and most enigmatic contribution. It also gives a strikingly accurate description of his future wife <a href="Alma%20Reville">Alma Reville</a>, whom he had not yet met.

Hitchcock was a film fan from his teenage years, and in 1919 began his film career at the age of twenty, working as a <a href="title%20card">title card</a> designer for the London branch of the American firm <a href="Famous%20Players-Lasky">Famous Players-Lasky</a>, the production arm of <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, at <a href="Hoxton%23Victorian%20era%20and%2020th%20century">Islington Studios</a>. After Famous Players-Lasky pulled out of London in 1922, Hitchcock stayed as part of the studio staff. He was hired by a new firm run by <a href="Michael%20Balcon">Michael Balcon</a> and others after being noticed at work on the short film "<a href="Always%20Tell%20Your%20Wife">Always Tell Your Wife</a>" in early 1923. In time Balcon's company took the name <a href="Gainsborough%20Pictures">Gainsborough Pictures</a>.

His rise from title designer to film director took five years. During this period, he became an unusual combination of screenwriter, art director, and assistant director on a series of five films for Balcon and director <a href="Graham%20Cutts">Graham Cutts</a>: "<a href="Woman%20to%20Woman%20%281923%20film%29">Woman to Woman</a>" (1923), "<a href="The%20White%20Shadow%20%28film%29">The White Shadow</a>" (1924), "<a href="The%20Passionate%20Adventure">The Passionate Adventure</a>" (1924), "<a href="The%20Blackguard">The Blackguard</a>" (1925), and "<a href="The%20Prude%27s%20Fall">The Prude's Fall</a>" (1925).

Hitchcock's 1925 collaboration with Cutts, "The Blackguard" (German: "Die Prinzessin und der Geiger", 1925), was produced at the <a href="Babelsberg%20Studios">Babelsberg Studios</a> in <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>, where Hitchcock observed part of the making of <a href="F.%20W.%20Murnau">F. W. Murnau</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Last%20Laugh">The Last Laugh</a>" (1924). He was impressed with Murnau's work and later used many techniques for the set design in his own productions. In a book-length interview with <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a>, Hitchcock also said that he was influenced by <a href="Fritz%20Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s film "<a href="Destiny%20%281921%20film%29">Destiny</a>" (1921). He was likewise influenced by other foreign filmmakers whose work he absorbed as one of the earliest members of the "seminal" London Film Society, formed in 1925.
Hitchcock's first few films faced a string of bad luck. His first directing project came in 1922 with the aptly titled "<a href="Number%2013%20%28film%29">Number 13</a>", filmed in London. The production was cancelled because of financial problems; the few scenes that had been finished at that point have been lost. Michael Balcon gave Hitchcock another opportunity for a directing credit with "<a href="The%20Pleasure%20Garden%20%28film%29">The Pleasure Garden</a>" (1925), a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka, which he made at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich in the summer of 1925. The film was a commercial flop. Next, Hitchcock directed a drama called "<a href="The%20Mountain%20Eagle">The Mountain Eagle</a>" (1926), possibly released under the title "Fear o' God," in the United States. This film is lost.

Hitchcock's luck changed with his first <a href="Thriller%20film">thriller</a>, "" (1927), a suspense film about the hunt for a <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> type of <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> in London. Released in January 1927, it was a major commercial and critical success in the United Kingdom. As with many of his earlier works, this film was influenced by <a href="German%20Expressionism">Expressionist</a> techniques Hitchcock had witnessed first-hand in Germany. Some commentators regard this piece as the first truly "<a href="Hitchcockian">Hitchcockian</a>" film, incorporating such themes as the "wrong man".

Following the success of "The Lodger", Hitchcock hired a publicist to help strengthen his growing reputation. On 2 December 1926, Hitchcock married his assistant director, <a href="Alma%20Reville">Alma Reville</a>, at the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Immaculate%20Heart%20of%20Mary">Brompton Oratory</a> in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, London. Alma was to become Hitchcock's closest collaborator, but her contributions to his films (some of which were credited on screen) Hitchcock would discuss only in private, as she was keen to avoid public attention. In 1928, Hitchcock and Alma purchased a house named 'Winter's Grace', situated on Stroud Lane, <a href="Wonersh%23Shamley%20Green">Shamley Green</a>, in Surrey. The building was originally a Tudor farmhouse dating from the 16th century. The Hitchcocks lived most weekdays at 153 Cromwell Road in London, whilst spending their weekends in Shamley Green entertaining guests. Their only child, daughter <a href="Patricia%20Hitchcock">Patricia</a>, was born on 7 July of the same year.

Hitchcock began work on his tenth film, "<a href="Blackmail%20%281929%20film%29">Blackmail</a>" (1929), when its production company <a href="Associated%20British%20Picture%20Corporation">British International Pictures</a> (BIP) decided to convert its <a href="Elstree%20Studios%23Elstree%20Studios%2C%20Shenley%20Rd%2C%20Borehamwood">Elstree facility</a> to sound, and to utilise that new technology in "Blackmail". It was an early "", often cited by film historians as a landmark film, and is often considered to be the first <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="talkie">talkie</a> feature film.

"Blackmail" began the Hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as a backdrop for suspense sequences, with the climax of the film taking place on the dome of the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. It also features one of his longest <a href="List%20of%20Hitchcock%20cameo%20appearances">cameo appearances</a>, which shows him being bothered by a small boy as he reads a book on the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>. In the <a href="PBS">PBS</a> series "The Men Who Made The Movies", Hitchcock explained how he used early sound recording as a special element of the film, stressing the word "knife" in a conversation with the woman suspected of murder. During this period, Hitchcock directed segments for a BIP <a href="musical%20film">musical film</a> <a href="revue">revue</a> "<a href="Elstree%20Calling">Elstree Calling</a>" (1930) and directed a short film featuring two "Film Weekly" scholarship winners entitled "<a href="An%20Elastic%20Affair">An Elastic Affair</a>" (1930).

In 1933, Hitchcock was once again working for Michael Balcon at <a href="Gaumont%20British">Gaumont British</a>. His first film for the company "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Knew%20Too%20Much%20%281934%20film%29">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a>" (1934) was a success and his second "<a href="The%2039%20Steps%20%281935%20film%29">The 39 Steps</a>" (1935) is often considered one of the best films from his early period, with the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> ranking it the <a href="BFI%20Top%20100%20British%20films">fourth best British film of the 20th century</a>. The film was acclaimed in the UK, and it made Hitchcock a star in the US, and established the quintessential English "Hitchcock blonde" <a href="Madeleine%20Carroll">Madeleine Carroll</a> as the template for his succession of ice cold and elegant leading ladies. This film was one of the first to exploit a "<a href="MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>", a rather peripheral driver of the narrative. In "The 39 Steps", the MacGuffin is a stolen set of design plans. In 1966, Hitchcock explained to French director <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a>:There are two men sitting in a train going to Scotland and one man says to the other, "Excuse me, sir, but what is that strange parcel you have on the luggage rack above you?", "Oh", says the other, "that's a Macguffin.", "Well", says the first man, "what's a Macguffin?", The other answers, "It's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.", "But", says the first man, "there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands.", "Well", says the other, "then that's no Macguffin."

Hitchcock's next major success was "<a href="The%20Lady%20Vanishes%20%281938%20film%29">The Lady Vanishes</a>" (1938), a fast-paced film about the search for kindly old Englishwoman Miss Froy (<a href="Dame%20May%20Whitty">Dame May Whitty</a>) who disappears while on board a train in the fictional country of Bandrika. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" called the film "one of the greatest train movies from the genre's golden era", and a contender for the "title of best comedy thriller ever made". The <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">BFI</a> ranked it the 35th best British film of the 20th century. The film saw Hitchcock receive the 1939 <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Critics%20Circle%20Award">New York Film Critics Circle Award</a> for Best Director, the only time he received an award for his direction.

Hitchcock was lauded in Britain, where he was dubbed "Alfred the Great" by "<a href="Picturegoer">Picturegoer</a>" magazine. Additionally, his reputation was beginning to soar overseas by the end of the 1930s, with a "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" feature writer stating: "Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not. <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>, the <a href="Tower%20Bridge">Tower Bridge</a> and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world." "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" magazine referred to him as, "probably the best native director in England."

<a href="David%20O.%20Selznick">David O. Selznick</a> signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in March 1939, and set to end in 1946, which brought the Hitchcocks to Hollywood. The suspense and the <a href="gallows%20humour">gallows humour</a> that had become Hitchcock's trademark in his films continued to appear in his American productions. The working arrangements with Selznick were less than ideal. Selznick suffered from constant financial problems, and Hitchcock was often displeased with Selznick's creative control over his films. In a later interview, Hitchcock commented, "[Selznick] was the Big Producer. ... Producer was king, The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me—and it shows you the amount of control—he said I was the 'only director' he'd 'trust with a film'."

Selznick lent Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself. Selznick made only a few films each year, as did fellow independent producer <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a>, so he did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. Hitchcock was quickly impressed with the superior resources of the American studios compared with the financial limits that he had often faced in Britain.

The Selznick picture "<a href="Rebecca%20%281940%20film%29">Rebecca</a>" (1940) was Hitchcock's first American film, set in a Hollywood version of England's <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> and based on a novel by English novelist <a href="Daphne%20du%20Maurier">Daphne du Maurier</a>. The film stars <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> and <a href="Joan%20Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>. The story concerns a naïve (and unnamed) young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat. She goes to live in his huge <a href="English%20country%20house">English country house</a>, and struggles with the lingering reputation of his elegant and worldly first wife Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. The film won <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a> at the <a href="13th%20Academy%20Awards">13th Academy Awards</a>. The statuette was given to Selznick, as the film's producer. Hitchcock was nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a> award, his first of five such nominations, but did not win.

There were additional problems between Selznick and Hitchcock, with Selznick known to impose restrictive rules on Hitchcock. At the same time, Selznick complained about Hitchcock's "goddamn jigsaw cutting", which meant that the producer did not have nearly the leeway to create his own film as he liked, but had to follow Hitchcock's vision of the finished product.

Hitchcock's second American film was the thriller "<a href="Foreign%20Correspondent%20%28film%29">Foreign Correspondent</a>" (1940) with its plot set in Europe, based on <a href="Vincent%20Sheean">Vincent Sheean</a>'s "Personal History" and produced by <a href="Walter%20Wanger">Walter Wanger</a>. It was nominated for Best Picture that year. Hitchcock, along with many other <a href="British%20subject">British subject</a>s, felt uneasy living and working in Hollywood while their country was at war; his concern resulted in a film that overtly supported the British war effort. The movie was filmed in the first year of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and was inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe, as fictionally covered by an American newspaper reporter (portrayed by <a href="Joel%20McCrea">Joel McCrea</a>). The film mixed footage of European scenes with scenes filmed on a Hollywood backlot. It avoided direct references to <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, and <a href="German%20people">Germans</a> to comply with Hollywood's Production Code censorship at the time.

Hitchcock's films were diverse during the 1940s, ranging from the romantic comedy "<a href="Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Smith%20%281941%20film%29">Mr. & Mrs. Smith</a>" (1941), to the courtroom drama "<a href="The%20Paradine%20Case">The Paradine Case</a>" (1947), to the bleak <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> "<a href="Shadow%20of%20a%20Doubt">Shadow of a Doubt</a>" (1943). In September 1940 the Hitchcocks bought the Cornwall Ranch near <a href="Scotts%20Valley">Scotts Valley</a> in the <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Mountains">Santa Cruz Mountains</a>. The ranch became the holiday home of the Hitchcocks. Their primary residence was an English-style home in Bel Air which was purchased in 1942. "<a href="Suspicion%20%281941%20film%29">Suspicion</a>" (1941) marks Hitchcock's first film as a producer as well as director. It is set in England, and Hitchcock used the north coast of <a href="Santa%20Cruz%2C%20California">Santa Cruz</a>, California for the English coastline sequence. This film is the first of four projects on which <a href="Cary%20Grant">Cary Grant</a> worked with Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant was cast in a sinister role. Joan Fontaine won Best Actress <a href="Academy%20Award">Oscar</a> for her performance. Grant plays a penniless dishonest <a href="con-artist">con-artist</a> whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife (Fontaine). In one scene Hitchcock uses a lightbulb to illuminate what might be a fatal glass of milk that Grant is bringing to his wife. The character that Grant plays in the film is a killer in the book upon which the film was based, "<a href="Before%20the%20Fact">Before the Fact</a>" by <a href="Francis%20Iles">Francis Iles</a>, but Hitchcock and the studio felt that, among other issues, Grant's image would be tarnished by that. So Hitchcock settled for an ambiguous finale, although, as he stated to <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a>, a murder would have suited him better.

"<a href="Saboteur%20%28film%29">Saboteur</a>" (1942) is the first of two films that Hitchcock made for <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal</a> during the decade. Hitchcock was forced to use Universal contract player <a href="Robert%20Cummings">Robert Cummings</a> and <a href="Priscilla%20Lane">Priscilla Lane</a> (a freelancer who signed a one-picture deal with Universal), both known for their work in comedies and light dramas. Breaking with Hollywood conventions of the time, Hitchcock did extensive location filming, especially in New York City, and depicted a confrontation between a suspected saboteur (Cummings) and a real saboteur (<a href="Norman%20Lloyd%20%28actor%29">Norman Lloyd</a>) atop the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>. That year, he also directed "Have You Heard?", a photographic dramatisation of the <a href="Loose%20lips%20sink%20ships">dangers of rumours during wartime</a>, for "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine.

Hitchcock also wrote a mystery story for "<a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">Look</a>" magazine in 1943, "The Murder of <a href="Monty%20Woolley">Monty Woolley</a>". This was a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to inspect the pictures for clues to the murderer's identity; Hitchcock cast the performers as themselves, such as Woolley, Doris Merrick and make-up man Guy Pearce. The article was reprinted in "<a href="Games%20%28magazine%29">Games</a>" Magazine in November/December 1980. In 2012, Hitchcock featured in the <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> series "<a href="The%20New%20Elizabethans">The New Elizabethans</a>" to mark the <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II</a>. A panel of 7 academics, journalists and historians named Hitchcock among the group of people in the UK "whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character".

"<a href="Shadow%20of%20a%20Doubt">Shadow of a Doubt</a>" (1943) was Hitchcock's personal favourite of all his films and the second of the early Universal films. It is about young Charlotte "Charlie" Newton (<a href="Teresa%20Wright">Teresa Wright</a>), who suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Oakley (<a href="Joseph%20Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>) of being a serial murderer. Hitchcock again filmed extensively on location, this time in the Northern California city of <a href="Santa%20Rosa%2C%20California">Santa Rosa</a> during the summer of 1942. Working at <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>, Hitchcock adapted a script of <a href="John%20Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>'s, which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a German U-boat attack in the film "<a href="Lifeboat%20%28film%29">Lifeboat</a>" (1944). The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that <a href="William%20Bendix">William Bendix</a> is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for "Reduco-Obesity Slayer". While at Fox, Hitchcock seriously considered directing the film version of <a href="A.%20J.%20Cronin">A. J. Cronin</a>'s novel about a Catholic priest in China, "<a href="The%20Keys%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20%28film%29">The Keys of the Kingdom</a>", but the plans for this fell through. <a href="John%20M.%20Stahl">John M. Stahl</a> ended up directing the 1944 film, which was produced by <a href="Joseph%20L.%20Mankiewicz">Joseph L. Mankiewicz</a> and starred <a href="Gregory%20Peck">Gregory Peck</a>.

Hitchcock returned to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short films in French for the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Ministry of Information</a>: "<a href="Bon%20Voyage%20%281944%20film%29">Bon Voyage</a>" and "<a href="Aventure%20Malgache">Aventure Malgache</a>". The two British <a href="propaganda%20film">propaganda film</a>s made for the <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a> were the only films that Hitchcock made in the French language, and they "feature typical Hitchcockian touches". On his motivation for making the films, Hitchcock stated: "I felt the need to make a little contribution to the war effort, and I was both overweight and over-age for military service. I knew that if I did nothing, I'd regret it for the rest of my life." From late June to late July 1945, Hitchcock served as "treatment advisor" on a <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> documentary which used footage provided by the Allied Forces. It was produced by <a href="Sidney%20Bernstein%2C%20Baron%20Bernstein">Sidney Bernstein</a> of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Ministry of Information</a>, and was assembled in London. Bernstein brought his future 1948–49 production partner Hitchcock on board as a consultant for the film editing process for the British Ministry of Information and the <a href="United%20States%20Office%20of%20War%20Information">American Office of War Information</a>.

The film-makers were commissioned to provide irrefutable evidence of the Nazis' crimes, and the film recorded the <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps%23Liberation">liberation</a> of <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a>. The film was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans following <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, but the British government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to the already-shocked post-War population. Instead, it was transferred in 1952 from the <a href="British%20War%20Office">British War Office</a> film vaults to London's <a href="Imperial%20War%20Museum">Imperial War Museum</a> and remained unreleased until 1985, when an edited version was first broadcast in May 1985 as an episode of the <a href="PBS">PBS</a> network series "<a href="Frontline%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Frontline</a>" under the title which the Imperial War Museum had given it: "Memory of the Camps". The full-length version of the film "<a href="German%20Concentration%20Camps%20Factual%20Survey">German Concentration Camps Factual Survey</a>" was completed in 2014, and was restored by film scholars at the Imperial War Museum.

Hitchcock worked for Selznick again when he directed "<a href="Spellbound%20%281945%20film%29">Spellbound</a>" (1945), which explores <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> and features a dream sequence designed by <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>. <a href="Gregory%20Peck">Gregory Peck</a> plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson (<a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>), who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past. The dream sequence as it appears in the film is ten minutes shorter than was originally envisioned, having been edited by Selznick to make it "play" more effectively. Two point-of-view shots were achieved by building a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of the black-and-white film. The original musical score by <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20R%C3%B3zsa">Miklós Rózsa</a> makes use of the electronic <a href="theremin">theremin</a>, and some of it was later adapted by the composer into Rozsa's Piano Concerto Op. 31 (1967) for piano and orchestra.
"<a href="Notorious%20%281946%20film%29">Notorious</a>" (1946) followed "<a href="Spellbound%20%281945%20film%29">Spellbound</a>". Hitchcock gave a book-length interview to François Truffaut, in which he said that Selznick had sold the director, the two stars (Grant and Bergman), and the screenplay (by Ben Hecht) to RKO Radio Pictures as a "package" for $500,000 due to cost overruns on Selznick's "<a href="Duel%20in%20the%20Sun%20%28film%29">Duel in the Sun</a>" (1946). "Notorious" stars Hitchcock regulars Bergman and Grant, and features a plot about Nazis, <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. His prescient use of uranium as a plot device led to Hitchcock's being briefly under FBI surveillance. McGilligan writes that Hitchcock consulted <a href="Robert%20Millikan">Robert Millikan</a> of the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> about the development of an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. Selznick complained the notion was "science fiction", only to be confronted by the news stories of the detonation of two atomic bombs on <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> in Japan in August 1945.

Hitchcock formed an independent production company with his friend <a href="Sidney%20Bernstein%2C%20Baron%20Bernstein">Sidney Bernstein</a> called <a href="Transatlantic%20Pictures">Transatlantic Pictures</a>, through which he made two films, his first in colour and making use of long takes. With "<a href="Rope%20%28film%29">Rope</a>" (1948), Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with "<a href="Lifeboat%20%28film%29">Lifeboat</a>" (1944). The film appears to have been shot in a single take, but it was actually shot in 10 takes ranging from 4-½ to 10 minutes each, a 10-minute length of film being the maximum that a camera's film magazine could hold at the time. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place. It features <a href="James%20Stewart">James Stewart</a> in the leading role, and was the first of four films that Stewart made with Hitchcock. It was inspired by the <a href="Leopold%20and%20Loeb">Leopold and Loeb</a> case of the 1920s. "<a href="Under%20Capricorn">Under Capricorn</a>" (1949), set in 19th century Australia, also uses the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent. He again used Technicolor in this production, then returned to black-and-white films for several years. Transatlantic Pictures became inactive after these two unsuccessful films, however, Hitchcock continued to participate in the production and ownership his own films for the rest of his life.
Hitchcock filmed "<a href="Stage%20Fright%20%281950%20film%29">Stage Fright</a>" (1950) at studios in <a href="Elstree%20Studios">Elstree</a>, England where he had worked during his British International Pictures contract many years before. He matched one of <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>' most popular stars, <a href="Jane%20Wyman">Jane Wyman</a>, with the expatriate German actress <a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> and used several prominent British actors, including <a href="Michael%20Wilding%20%28actor%29">Michael Wilding</a>, <a href="Richard%20Todd">Richard Todd</a> and <a href="Alastair%20Sim">Alastair Sim</a>. This was Hitchcock's first proper production for Warner Bros., which had distributed "Rope" and "Under Capricorn", because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties.

His film "<a href="Strangers%20on%20a%20Train%20%28film%29">Strangers on a Train</a>" (1951) was based on the novel by <a href="Patricia%20Highsmith">Patricia Highsmith</a>. In it, Hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films. He approached <a href="Dashiell%20Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a> to write the dialogue, but <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a> took over, then left over disagreements with the director. In the film, two men casually meet, one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder; he suggests that two people, each wishing to do away with someone, should each perform the other's murder. <a href="Farley%20Granger">Farley Granger</a>'s role was as the innocent victim of the scheme, while <a href="Robert%20Walker%20%28actor%2C%20born%201918%29">Robert Walker</a>, previously known for "boy-next-door" roles, played the villain. "<a href="I%20Confess%20%28film%29">I Confess</a>" (1953) was set in <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec</a> with <a href="Montgomery%20Clift">Montgomery Clift</a> as a Catholic priest.

"I Confess" was followed by three popular colour films starring <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace Kelly</a>. "<a href="Dial%20M%20for%20Murder">Dial M for Murder</a>" (1954) was adapted from the stage play by <a href="Frederick%20Knott">Frederick Knott</a>. <a href="Ray%20Milland">Ray Milland</a> plays the scheming villain, an ex-tennis pro who tries to murder his unfaithful wife (Kelly) for her money. She kills the hired assassin in self-defence, so Milland manipulates the evidence to make it look like a premeditated murder by his wife. Her lover Mark Halliday (<a href="Robert%20Cummings">Robert Cummings</a>) and Police Inspector Hubbard (<a href="John%20Williams%20%28actor%29">John Williams</a>) work urgently to save her from execution. With "Dial M," Hitchcock experimented with <a href="3-D%20film">3D</a> cinematography, with the film now being available in the 3D format on Blu-ray.
Hitchcock moved to <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> and filmed "<a href="Rear%20Window">Rear Window</a>" (1954), starring James Stewart and Kelly again, as well as <a href="Thelma%20Ritter">Thelma Ritter</a> and <a href="Raymond%20Burr">Raymond Burr</a>. Stewart's character is a photographer (based on <a href="Robert%20Capa">Robert Capa</a>) who must temporarily use a wheelchair. Out of boredom, he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, and then becomes convinced that one of them (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. Stewart tries to convince both his policeman buddy (<a href="Wendell%20Corey">Wendell Corey</a>) and his glamorous model-girlfriend (Kelly, whom screenwriter <a href="John%20Michael%20Hayes">John Michael Hayes</a> based on his own wife), and eventually he succeeds. As with "Lifeboat" and "Rope", the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters, in this case to Stewart's small studio apartment overlooking a large courtyard. Hitchcock uses close-ups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions to all that he sees, "from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment".

From 1955 to 1965, Hitchcock was the host of the television series titled "<a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock%20Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>". While his films had made Hitchcock's name strongly associated with suspense, the TV series made Hitchcock a celebrity himself. His <a href="irony">irony</a>-tinged voice and signature droll delivery, gallows humour, iconic image and mannerisms became instantly recognisable and were often the subject of parody. The title-sequence of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of Hitchcock's profile (he drew it himself; it is composed of only nine strokes), which his real silhouette then filled. His introductions before the stories in his programme always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one <a href="electric%20chair">electric chair</a>, while two are now shown with a sign "Two chairs—no waiting!". He directed 18 episodes of the TV series himself, which aired from 1955 to 1965 in two versions. It became "<a href="The%20Alfred%20Hitchcock%20Hour">The Alfred Hitchcock Hour</a>" in 1962.

The series theme tune was "Funeral March of a Marionette", by the French composer <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Charles Gounod</a> (1818–1893), the composer of the 1859 opera, "<a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a>". The composer Bernard Herrmann suggested the music be used. <a href="Arthur%20Fiedler">Arthur Fiedler</a> and the <a href="Boston%20Pops%20Orchestra">Boston Pops Orchestra</a> included the piece on one of their extended play 45-rpm discs for <a href="RCA%20Victor">RCA Victor</a> during the 1950s. In the 1980s, a <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock%20Presents%20%281985%20TV%20series%29">new version of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents"</a> was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions in a <a href="Film%20colorization">colourised</a> form. Hitchcock also appears as a character in the popular juvenile detective book series, "<a href="Three%20Investigators">Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators</a>". The long-running detective series was created by <a href="Robert%20Arthur%20%28writer%29">Robert Arthur</a>, who wrote the first several books, although other authors took over after he left the series. The Three Investigators—Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshaw—were amateur detectives, slightly younger than the <a href="Hardy%20Boys">Hardy Boys</a>. In the introduction to each book, "Alfred Hitchcock" introduces the mystery, and he sometimes refers a case to the boys to solve. At the end of each book, the boys report to Hitchcock, and sometimes give him a memento of their case.

In 1955, Hitchcock became a United States citizen. His third Grace Kelly film "<a href="To%20Catch%20a%20Thief">To Catch a Thief</a>" (1955) is set in the <a href="French%20Riviera">French Riviera</a>, and pairs her with Cary Grant. He plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. A thrill-seeking American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity and tries to seduce him. "Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success." It was Hitchcock's last film with Kelly. She married <a href="Prince%20Rainier">Prince Rainier</a> of Monaco in 1956, and ended her film career. Hitchcock then remade his own <a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Knew%20Too%20Much%20%281934%20film%29">1934 film</a> "The Man Who Knew Too Much" <a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Knew%20Too%20Much%20%281956%20film%29">in 1956</a>. This time, the film starred James Stewart and <a href="Doris%20Day">Doris Day</a>, who sang the theme song "<a href="Que%20Sera%2C%20Sera%20%28Whatever%20Will%20Be%2C%20Will%20Be%29">Que Sera, Sera</a>", which won the Oscar for Best Original Song and became a big hit for her. They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination. As in the 1934 film, the climax takes place at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, London.
At the height of Hitchcock's success in 1956, he was also asked to introduce a set of books with his name attached. The series was a collection of short stories by popular short-story writers, primarily focused on suspense and thrillers. These titles included "<a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock%27s%20Anthology">Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology</a>", "Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories to be Read with the Door Locked", "Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum", "Alfred Hitchcock's Supernatural Tales of Terror and Suspense", "Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbinders in Suspense", "Alfred Hitchcock's Witch's Brew", "Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery", "Alfred Hitchcock's A Hangman's Dozen", "Alfred Hitchcock's Stories Not For the Nervous" and "Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful". Hitchcock himself was not actually involved in the reading, reviewing, editing or selection of the short stories.

In a similar manner, Hitchcock's name was licensed for a digest-sized monthly, "<a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock%27s%20Mystery%20Magazine">Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine</a>", which has been published since 1956.

"<a href="The%20Wrong%20Man">The Wrong Man</a>" (1957), Hitchcock's final film for Warner Bros., is a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of mistaken identity reported in "Life" magazine in 1953. This was the only film of Hitchcock to star <a href="Henry%20Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, playing a Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief, who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife (<a href="Vera%20Miles">Vera Miles</a>) emotionally collapses under the strain. Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes. "<a href="Vertigo%20%28film%29">Vertigo</a>" (1958) again starred James Stewart, this time with <a href="Kim%20Novak">Kim Novak</a> and <a href="Barbara%20Bel%20Geddes">Barbara Bel Geddes</a>. Stewart plays "Scottie", a former police investigator suffering from <a href="acrophobia">acrophobia</a>, who develops an obsession with a woman that he is shadowing (Novak). Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending. Some critics, including Donald Spoto and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, agree that "Vertigo" represents the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28mythology%29">Pygmalion</a>"-like obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman that he desires. "Vertigo" explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other film in his filmography. Hitchcock, and "Vertigo", were later paid homage-to in the 1977 <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a> film "<a href="High%20Anxiety">High Anxiety</a>".

"Vertigo" contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts that has been copied many times by filmmakers commonly referred to as a <a href="dolly%20zoom">dolly zoom</a>. It was premiered in the <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n%20International%20Film%20Festival">San Sebastián International Film Festival</a>, where Hitchcock won a Silver Seashell. "Vertigo" is considered a classic today, but it met with some negative reviews and poor box office receipts upon its release, and was the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock. Its critical reputation grew. In the 2002 "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" polls, it ranked just behind "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>" (1941); ten years later, in the same magazine, it was voted by critics as the best film ever made. By this time, Hitchcock had filmed in many areas of the U.S.

Hitchcock followed "Vertigo" with three more successful films, which are also recognised as among his best films: "<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>" (1959), "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>" (1960) and "<a href="The%20Birds%20%28film%29">The Birds</a>" (1963). In "North by Northwest", Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent. He is hotly pursued across the United States by enemy agents, apparently one of them being Eve Kendall (<a href="Eva%20Marie%20Saint">Eva Marie Saint</a>), who is in reality working undercover. During its opening two-week run at <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a>, the film grossed $404,056, setting a record in that theater's non-holiday gross. At that time, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine called the film "smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining." A. H. Weiler of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" made it a "Critic's Pick" and said it was the "year's most scenic, intriguing and merriest chase"; Weiler complimented the two leads: Cary Grant, a veteran member of the Hitchcock acting varsity, was never more at home than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam. He handles the grimaces, the surprised look, the quick smile ... and all the derring-do with professional aplomb and grace. In casting Eva Marie Saint as his romantic vis-à-vis, Mr. Hitchcock has plumbed some talents not shown by the actress heretofore. Although she is seemingly a hard, designing type, she also emerges both the sweet heroine and a glamorous charmer.
"<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>" is among Hitchcock's most widely seen films. Produced on a constrained budget of $800,000, it was shot in black-and-white on a spare set using crew members from his television show "<a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock%20Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>". The unprecedented violence of the shower scene, the early death of the heroine and the innocent lives extinguished by a disturbed murderer became the defining hallmarks of a new horror film genre and have been copied by many authors of subsequent films. The public loved the film, with lines stretching outside of cinemas as people had to wait for the next showing. It broke box-office records in the United Kingdom, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, the United States and <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and was a moderate success in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> for a brief period. It was the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career; Hitchcock personally earned well in excess of $15 million. He subsequently swapped his rights to "Psycho" and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of <a href="MCA%20Inc.">MCA</a>, making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc. and his own boss at Universal, in theory at least, but that did not stop them from interfering with him. Following the first film directed by Hitchcock, "Psycho" has since become an American <a href="horror%20film">horror</a> <a href="Media%20franchise">franchise</a> consisting of six films loosely based on the <a href="Psycho%20%28novel%29">"Psycho" novels</a> by <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>, namely "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>", "<a href="Psycho%20II%20%28film%29">Psycho II</a>", "<a href="Psycho%20III">Psycho III</a>", "<a href="Bates%20Motel%20%28film%29">Bates Motel</a>", "", the scene-by-scene colour <a href="Psycho%20%281998%20film%29">1998 remake</a> of the original film, and additional merchandise spanning various media.

"<a href="The%20Birds%20%28film%29">The Birds</a>" (1963), inspired by a <a href="The%20Birds%20%28story%29">short story</a> by English author <a href="Daphne%20du%20Maurier">Daphne du Maurier</a> and by a news story about a mysterious infestation of birds in <a href="Capitola%2C%20California">Capitola, California</a>, was Hitchcock's 49th film, and the location scenes were filmed in <a href="Bodega%20Bay%2C%20California">Bodega Bay</a>, California. Newcomer <a href="Tippi%20Hedren">Tippi Hedren</a> co-starred with <a href="Rod%20Taylor">Rod Taylor</a> and <a href="Suzanne%20Pleshette">Suzanne Pleshette</a>. The scenes of the birds attacking included hundreds of shots mixing live and animated sequences. The cause of the birds' attack is left unanswered. Hitchcock cast Hedren again opposite <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> in "<a href="Marnie%20%28film%29">Marnie</a>" (1964), a romantic drama and <a href="psychological%20thriller">psychological thriller</a>. Decades later, Hedren called Hitchcock a <a href="misogynist">misogynist</a> and said that Hitchcock effectively ended her career by keeping her to an exclusive contract for two years when she rebuffed his sexual advances. However, Hedren appeared in two TV shows during the two years after "Marnie". In 2012, Hedren described Hitchcock as a "sad character"; a man of "unusual genius", yet "evil, and deviant, almost to the point of dangerous, because of the effect that he could have on people that were totally unsuspecting". In response, a "Daily Telegraph" article quoted several actresses who had worked with Hitchcock, including <a href="Eva%20Marie%20Saint">Eva Marie Saint</a>, <a href="Doris%20Day">Doris Day</a> and <a href="Kim%20Novak">Kim Novak</a>, none of whom shared Hedren's opinion about him. Novak, who worked on Hitchcock's "<a href="Vertigo%20%28film%29">Vertigo</a>", told the "Telegraph" "I never saw him make a pass at anybody or act strange to anybody."

"Psycho" and "The Birds" had unconventional soundtracks: the screeching strings played in the murder scene in "Psycho" were unusually dissonant, and "The Birds" dispensed with any conventional score, instead using a <a href="The%20Birds%20%28film%29%23Soundtrack">new technique</a> of electronically produced sound effects. <a href="Bernard%20Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a> composed the former and was a consultant on the latter, also acting as composer for "Marnie".

Failing health reduced Hitchcock's output during the last two decades of his life. Biographer Stephen Rebello claimed Universal "forced" two movies on him, "<a href="Torn%20Curtain">Torn Curtain</a>" (1966) and "<a href="Topaz%20%281969%20film%29">Topaz</a>" (1969). Both were spy thrillers set with <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>-related themes. The first, "<a href="Torn%20Curtain">Torn Curtain</a>" (1966), with <a href="Paul%20Newman">Paul Newman</a> and <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>, precipitated the bitter end of the twelve-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer Bernard Herrmann. Herrmann was sacked when Hitchcock was unsatisfied with his score, and replaced with British composer <a href="John%20Addison">John Addison</a>. "<a href="Topaz%20%281969%20film%29">Topaz</a>" (1969), based on a <a href="Leon%20Uris">Leon Uris</a> novel, is partly set in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. Both received mixed reviews from critics.

Hitchcock returned to Britain to make his penultimate film "<a href="Frenzy">Frenzy</a>" (1972). After two espionage films, the plot marks a return to the murder thriller genre, and is based upon the novel "<a href="Goodbye%20Piccadilly%2C%20Farewell%20Leicester%20Square">Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square</a>". The plot centres on a serial killer in contemporary London. The basic story recycles his early film "The Lodger". Richard Blaney (<a href="Jon%20Finch">Jon Finch</a>), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the "Necktie Murders", which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk (<a href="Barry%20Foster%20%28actor%29">Barry Foster</a>). This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain kindreds, rather than opposites, as in "Strangers on a Train". Only one of them, however, has crossed the line to murder. For the first time, Hitchcock allowed nudity and profane language, which had previously been taboo, in one of his films. He also shows rare sympathy for the policeman on the case and his comic domestic life.

Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool <a href="Joseph%20Breen">Joseph Breen</a>, the longtime head of Hollywood's <a href="Production%20Code">Production Code</a>. Many times Hitchcock slipped in subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet Patrick McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such things and were actually amused as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's "inescapable inferences". Beginning with "Torn Curtain", Hitchcock was finally able to blatantly include plot elements previously forbidden in American films.

"<a href="Family%20Plot">Family Plot</a>" (1976) was Hitchcock's last film. It relates the escapades of "Madam" Blanche Tyler, played by <a href="Barbara%20Harris%20%28actress%29">Barbara Harris</a>, a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi driver lover <a href="Bruce%20Dern">Bruce Dern</a>, making a living from her phony powers. <a href="William%20Devane">William Devane</a>, <a href="Karen%20Black">Karen Black</a>, <a href="Katherine%20Helmond">Katherine Helmond</a>, and <a href="Cathleen%20Nesbitt">Cathleen Nesbitt</a> co-starred. It is the only Hitchcock film scored by <a href="John%20Williams">John Williams</a>. While "Family Plot" was based on the <a href="Victor%20Canning">Victor Canning</a> novel "The Rainbird Pattern", the novel's tone is more sinister and dark than what Hitchcock wanted for the film. Screenwriter <a href="Ernest%20Lehman">Ernest Lehman</a> originally wrote the film with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter, more comical tone by Hitchcock.

Near the end of his life, Hitchcock had worked on the script for a projected spy thriller, "<a href="The%20Short%20Night">The Short Night</a>", collaborating with <a href="James%20Costigan">James Costigan</a>, <a href="Ernest%20Lehman">Ernest Lehman</a> and <a href="David%20Freeman%20%28screenwriter%29">David Freeman</a>. Despite some preliminary work, the screenplay was never filmed. This was caused primarily by Hitchcock's seriously declining health and his concerns for his wife, Alma, who had suffered a stroke. The screenplay was eventually published in Freeman's 1999 book "The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock".

Hitchcock died aged 80 in his <a href="Bel%20Air%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Bel Air</a> home of <a href="renal%20failure">renal failure</a> on 29 April 1980. While biographer Spoto wrote that Hitchcock "rejected suggestions that he allow a priest ... to come for a visit, or celebrate a quiet, informal ritual at the house for his comfort", Jesuit priest Mark Henninger wrote that he and fellow priest Tom Sullivan celebrated Mass at the filmmaker's home; Sullivan heard Hitchcock's <a href="Sacrament%20of%20Penance">confession</a>. He was survived by his wife and their daughter. <a href="Lew%20Wasserman">Lew Wasserman</a>, board chairman and chief executive officer of MCA Inc. and previously Hitchcock’s longtime agent, stated:
I am deeply saddened by the death of my close friend and colleague, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, whose death today at his home deprives us all of a great artist and an even greater human being. Almost every tribute paid to Sir Alfred in the past by film critics and historians has emphasised his continuing influence in the world of film. It is that continuing influence, embodied in the magnificent series of films he has given the world, during the last half-century, that will preserve his great spirit, his humour and his wit, not only for us but for succeeding generations of film-goers.

Hitchcock's funeral Mass was held at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Beverly Hills on 30 April 1980, after which his body was <a href="cremated">cremated</a> and his remains were scattered over the Pacific Ocean on 10 May 1980.

Hitchcock's films sometimes feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers. In "<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>" (1959), Roger Thornhill (<a href="Cary%20Grant">Cary Grant</a>) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In "<a href="The%20Birds%20%28film%29">The Birds</a>" (1963), the <a href="Rod%20Taylor">Rod Taylor</a> character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother (<a href="Jessica%20Tandy">Jessica Tandy</a>). The killer in "<a href="Frenzy">Frenzy</a>" (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in "Strangers on a Train" hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by <a href="Marion%20Lorne">Marion Lorne</a>). Sebastian (<a href="Claude%20Rains">Claude Rains</a>) in "<a href="Notorious%20%281946%20film%29">Notorious</a>" has a clearly conflictual relationship with his mother, who is (correctly) suspicious of his new bride Alicia Huberman (<a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>). Norman Bates has troubles with his <a href="Norma%20Bates%20%28Psycho%29">mother</a> in "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>".

Hitchcock heroines tend to be blondes. The famous victims in "The Lodger" are all blondes. In "<a href="The%2039%20Steps%20%281935%20film%29">The 39 Steps</a>", Hitchcock's glamorous blonde star, <a href="Madeleine%20Carroll">Madeleine Carroll</a>, is put in handcuffs. In "<a href="Marnie%20%28film%29">Marnie</a>" (1964), the title character (played by <a href="Tippi%20Hedren">Tippi Hedren</a>) is a <a href="thief">thief</a>. In "<a href="To%20Catch%20a%20Thief">To Catch a Thief</a>" (1955), Francie (<a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace Kelly</a>) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In "<a href="Rear%20Window">Rear Window</a>", Lisa (Grace Kelly again) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. The best-known example is in "Psycho" where <a href="Janet%20Leigh">Janet Leigh</a>'s unfortunate character steals $40,000 and is murdered by a reclusive psychopath. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was <a href="Barbara%20Harris%20%28actress%29">Barbara Harris</a> as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in "<a href="Family%20Plot">Family Plot</a>" (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by <a href="Karen%20Black">Karen Black</a> could also fit that role, as she wears a long blonde wig in various scenes and becomes increasingly uncomfortable about her line of work. The English 'Hitchcock blonde' was based on his preference for the heroines to have an "indirect" sex appeal of English women, ladylike in public, but whores in the bedroom, with Hitchcock stating to Truffaut:

Hitchcock appears briefly in most of his own films. For example, he is seen struggling to get a double bass onto a train ("<a href="Strangers%20on%20a%20Train%20%28film%29">Strangers on a Train</a>"), walking dogs out of a pet shop ("<a href="The%20Birds%20%28film%29">The Birds</a>"), fixing a neighbour's clock ("<a href="Rear%20Window">Rear Window</a>"), as a shadow ("<a href="Family%20Plot">Family Plot</a>"), sitting at a table in a photograph ("<a href="Dial%20M%20for%20Murder">Dial M for Murder</a>"), and missing a bus ("<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>").

Hitchcock returned several times to cinematic devices such as suspense, the audience as <a href="voyeur">voyeur</a>, and his well-known "<a href="MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>," a plot device that is essential to the characters on the screen, but is irrelevant to the audience. Thus, the MacGuffin was always hazily described (in "North By Northwest", Leo G. Carroll describes James Mason as an "importer-exporter.") A central theme of Hitchcock's films was murder and the <a href="psychology">psychology</a> behind it. His work often features the theme of <a href="fugitive">fugitive</a>s on the run alongside "icy blonde" female characters.

In a 1963 interview with <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> journalist <a href="Oriana%20Fallaci">Oriana Fallaci</a>, Hitchcock was asked how in spite of appearing to be a pleasant, innocuous man, he seemed to enjoy making films involving suspense and terrifying crime. He responded:

Hitchcock once commented, "The writer and I plan out the entire script down to the smallest detail, and when we're finished all that's left to do is to shoot the film. Actually, it's only when one enters the studio that one enters the area of compromise. Really, the novelist has the best casting since he doesn't have to cope with the actors and all the rest." In an interview with Roger Ebert in 1969, Hitchcock elaborated further:
In "Writing with Hitchcock", a book-length study of Hitchcock's working method with his writers, author Steven DeRosa noted that, "Although he rarely did any actual 'writing', especially on his Hollywood productions, Hitchcock supervised and guided his writers through every draft, insisting on a strict attention to detail and a preference for telling the story through visual rather than verbal means. While this exasperated some writers, others admitted the director inspired them to do their very best work. Hitchcock often emphasised that he took no screen credit for the writing of his films. However, over time the work of many of his writers has been attributed solely to Hitchcock's creative genius, a misconception he rarely went out of his way to correct. Notwithstanding his technical brilliance as a director, Hitchcock relied on his writers a great deal."

According to the majority of commentators, Hitchcock's films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the <a href="viewfinder">viewfinder</a>, since he did not need to, though in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternate takes to consider. However, this view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by the book "Hitchcock at Work", written by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of "<a href="Cahiers%20du%20cin%C3%A9ma">Cahiers du cinéma</a>". Krohn, after investigating several script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock alongside inspection of storyboards, and other production material, has observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned. He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. A great example would be the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of "North by Northwest" which was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.

Even when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's extensive analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like "Notorious" reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of "The Man Who Knew Too Much," whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including "<a href="Strangers%20on%20a%20Train%20%28film%29">Strangers on a Train</a>" and "<a href="Topaz%20%281969%20film%29">Topaz</a>". While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.

Krohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternate takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he/she chooses (often under the producer's aegis). Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency of giving himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock. His fastidiousness and attention to detail also found its way into each <a href="film%20poster">film poster</a> for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as <a href="Bill%20Gold">Bill Gold</a> and <a href="Saul%20Bass">Saul Bass</a>—who would produce posters that accurately represented his films.

Hitchcock became known for his alleged observation, "Actors are cattle". He once said that he first made this remark as early as the late 1920s, in connection to stage actors who were snobbish about motion pictures. However, the actor <a href="Michael%20Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a> said that Hitchcock had made the statement during the filming of "<a href="The%20Lady%20Vanishes%20%281938%20film%29">The Lady Vanishes</a>" (1938). Later, in Hollywood, during the filming of "<a href="Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Smith%20%281941%20film%29">Mr. & Mrs. Smith</a>" (1941), <a href="Carole%20Lombard">Carole Lombard</a> brought some heifers onto the set with name tags of Lombard, <a href="Robert%20Montgomery%20%28actor%29">Robert Montgomery</a> and <a href="Gene%20Raymond">Gene Raymond</a>, the stars of the film, to surprise the director. Hitchcock said he was misquoted: "I said 'Actors should be "treated" like cattle'."

Much of Hitchcock's supposed dislike of actors has been exaggerated. Hitchcock simply did not tolerate the <a href="Method%20acting">method</a> approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. In a "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre because he has a free space to move about. But when it comes to cutting the face and what he sees and so forth, there must be some discipline'. He often used the same actors in many of his films.

During the making of "Lifeboat", <a href="Walter%20Slezak">Walter Slezak</a>, who played the German villain, stated that Hitchcock knew the mechanics of acting better than anyone he knew. Several critics have observed that despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, several actors who worked with him gave fine, often brilliant performances and these performances contribute to the film's success. As more fully discussed above, actress <a href="Dolly%20Haas">Dolly Haas</a>, who was a personal friend of Hitchcock and who acted for him in the 1953 film "<a href="I%20Confess%20%28film%29">I Confess</a>", stated that Hitchcock regarded actors as "animated props".

For Hitchcock, the actors, like the props, were part of the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:In my opinion, the chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.

Addressing his earlier statement comparing actors to cattle, Hitchcock said in an interview with François Truffaut:I'm not quite sure in what context I might have made such a statement. It may have been made ... when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays. When they had a matinee, and I suspected they were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch. And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time. I couldn't help feeling that if they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theatre, and get there in time to put on their make-up and go on stage. I had no use for that kind of actor.

In the late 1950s, <a href="French%20New%20Wave">French New Wave</a> critics, especially <a href="%C3%89ric%20Rohmer">Éric Rohmer</a>, <a href="Claude%20Chabrol">Claude Chabrol</a> and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a>, were among the first to see and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works. Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their <a href="auteur%20theory">auteur theory</a>, which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the <a href="filmmaking">filmmaking</a> process. Hitchcock's innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, producers, and actors. His influence helped start a trend for film directors to control artistic aspects of their films without answering to the film's producer.

Hitchcock was a multiple nominee and winner of a number of prestigious awards, receiving two <a href="Golden%20Globes">Golden Globes</a>, eight <a href="Laurel%20Awards">Laurel Awards</a>, five <a href="lifetime%20achievement%20awards">lifetime achievement awards</a> (including the first <a href="BAFTA%20Academy%20Fellowship%20Award">BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award</a>), as well as being nominated five times for an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Academy Award for Best Director</a> (albeit never winning). His film "<a href="Rebecca%20%281940%20film%29">Rebecca</a>" (nominated for 11 Oscars) won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture%231940s">Academy Award for Best Picture of 1940</a>—another Hitchcock film, "<a href="Foreign%20Correspondent%20%28film%29">Foreign Correspondent</a>", was also nominated that year. Hitchcock has two stars on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, receiving one for his contribution to television and another for his work in motion pictures. Following a 2007 critics' poll by Britain's "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" in which he was ranked Britain's greatest filmmaker, one scholar wrote: "Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from the audience) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else."

After refusing a CBE in 1962, Hitchcock received a <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">knighthood</a> in December 1979 when he was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Most%20Excellent%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE) by <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in the <a href="1980%20New%20Year%20Honours">1980 New Year Honours</a>. Asked by a reporter why it had taken the Queen so long, Hitchcock quipped, "I suppose it was a matter of carelessness". Prior to receiving his knighthood, critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote: "Other British directors like <a href="Carol%20Reed">Sir Carol Reed</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Sir Charlie Chaplin</a> were knighted years ago, while Hitchcock, universally considered by film students to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, was passed over". An <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a>, unveiled in 1999, marks where Hitchcock lived in London at 153 <a href="Cromwell%20Road">Cromwell Road</a>, <a href="Royal%20Borough%20of%20Kensington%20and%20Chelsea">Kensington and Chelsea</a>, SW5. In 2002, the magazine "<a href="MovieMaker%20Magazine">MovieMaker</a>" named Hitchcock the most influential filmmaker of all time. In 2012, Hitchcock was among the <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British cultural icons</a> selected by artist <a href="Peter%20Blake%20%28artist%29">Sir Peter Blake</a> to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork, the Beatles' "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>" album cover, in order to celebrate British cultural figures whom he most admires.

Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades and is often regarded as one of the most influential directors in cinematic history. In 1978, film critic John Russell Taylor described Hitchcock as "the most universally recognizable person in the world", and "a straightforward middle-class Englishman who just happened to be an artistic genius". Hitchcock has been portrayed in several films after 2010 including <a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> in the 2012 film "<a href="Hitchcock%20%28film%29">Hitchcock</a>". He was also portrayed by <a href="Toby%20Jones">Toby Jones</a> in the 2012 <a href="HBO">HBO</a> telefilm "<a href="The%20Girl%20%282012%20TV%20film%29">The Girl</a>". In June 2013, nine restored versions of Hitchcock's early silent films, including his directorial debut, "The Pleasure Garden" (1925), were shown at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Academy%20of%20Music">Brooklyn Academy of Music</a>'s Harvey Theatre. Known as "The Hitchcock 9", the travelling tribute was made possible by a $3 million programme organised by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>. <a href="Roger%20Ashton-Griffiths">Roger Ashton-Griffiths</a> portrayed Hitchcock more recently in the 2014 film "<a href="Grace%20of%20Monaco%20%28film%29">Grace of Monaco</a>".

The Alfred Hitchcock Collection is housed at the <a href="Academy%20Film%20Archive">Academy Film Archive</a> in Hollywood, California. The Hitchcock Collection includes home movies, 16mm film shot on the set of "Blackmail" (1929) and "Frenzy" (1972), and the earliest known colour footage of Hitchcock. The Academy Film Archive also preserved many of Hitchcock's home movies. Complementing the film material are the Alfred Hitchcock Papers housed at the Academy's Margaret Herrick Library. The David O. Selznick and the Ernest Lehman collections housed at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a> contain material related to Hitchcock's work on the production of "The Paradine Case", "Rebecca", "Spellbound", "North by Northwest", and "Family Plot."

Anaconda

Anacondas are a group of large <a href="snake">snake</a>s of the genus <a href="Eunectes">Eunectes</a>. They are found in tropical <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. Four species are currently recognized.

Although the name applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species in particular, the common or green anaconda ("<a href="Eunectes%20murinus">Eunectes murinus</a>") which is the largest snake in the world by weight, and the second longest.

The South American names "anacauchoa" and "anacaona" were suggested in an account by <a href="Peter%20Martyr%20d%27Anghiera">Peter Martyr d'Anghiera</a> but the idea of a South American origin was questioned by <a href="Henry%20Walter%20Bates">Henry Walter Bates</a> who, in his travels in South America, failed to find any similar name in use. The word anaconda is derived from the name of a snake from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) that <a href="John%20Ray">John Ray</a> described in Latin in his "Synopsis Methodica Animalium" (1693) as "serpens indicus bubalinus anacandaia zeylonibus, ides bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens". Ray used a catalogue of snakes from the Leyden museum supplied by Dr. <a href="Tancred%20Robinson">Tancred Robinson</a>, but the description of its habit was based on <a href="Andreas%20Cleyer">Andreas Cleyer</a> who in 1684 described a gigantic snake that crushed large animals by coiling and crushing their bones. <a href="Henry%20Yule">Henry Yule</a> in his <a href="Hobson-Jobson">Hobson-Jobson</a> notes that the word became more popular due to a piece of fiction published in 1768 in the Scots Magazine by a certain R. Edwin. Edwin described a "tiger" being crushed and killed by an anaconda when in fact tigers never occurred in Sri Lanka. Yule and <a href="Frank%20Wall">Frank Wall</a> noted that the snake was in fact a python and suggested a <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> origin "anai-kondra" meaning elephant killer. A <a href="Sinhala%20language">Sinhalese</a> origin was also suggested by Donald Ferguson who pointed out that the word "Henakandaya" ("hena" lightning/large and "kanda" stem/trunk) was used in Sri Lanka for the small whip snake ("<a href="Ahaetulla%20pulverulenta">Ahaetulla pulverulenta</a>") and somehow got misapplied to the python before myths were created.

The name commonly used for the anaconda in Brazil is "sucuri", "sucuriju" or "sucuriuba".

The term "anaconda" has been used to refer to:

Altaic languages

Altaic () is a proposed <a href="language%20family">language family</a> of central Eurasia and <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, now widely seen as discredited.

The <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic</a>, <a href="Mongolic%20languages">Mongolic</a>, and <a href="Tungusic%20languages">Tungusic</a> groups are invariably included in the family; some authors added <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a> and <a href="Japonic%20languages">Japonic languages</a>. These languages are spoken in a wide arc stretching from eastern <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, through <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> to <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> and to the <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a> and <a href="Japanese%20archipelago">Japanese archipelago</a> in <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>. The group is named after the <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai mountain range</a> in <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>.

Another view includes only Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic. This view was widespread prior to the 1960s, but has almost no supporters among specialists today. The expanded grouping, including <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a> and sometimes <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>, came to be known as "Macro-Altaic", leading to the designation of the smaller grouping as "Micro-Altaic" by <a href="retronym">retronym</a>y. Most proponents of Altaic continue to support the inclusion of Korean.

Micro-Altaic includes about 66 living languages, to which Macro-Altaic would add Korean, Japanese and the <a href="Ryukyuan%20languages">Ryukyuan languages</a>, for a total of about 74. (Depending on what is considered a language and what is considered a <a href="Language%20or%20dialect">dialect</a>. They do not include earlier states of languages, such as <a href="Middle%20Mongol%20language">Middle Mongol</a>, <a href="Old%20Korean">Old Korean</a> or <a href="Old%20Japanese">Old Japanese</a>.)

Opponents of the Altaic hypothesis maintain that the similarities are due to <a href="Language%20contact">areal interaction</a> between the language groups concerned. The inclusion of Korean and Japanese has also been criticized and disputed by other linguists.

As for Turkic, Tungusic, and Mongolic, if they were <a href="Genetic%20relationship%20%28linguistics%29">related genetically</a>, earlier forms would be closer than modern forms. This is true for all accepted linguistic families. However, an analysis of the earliest written records of Mongolic and Turkic languages shows fewer similarities rather than more, which suggests that they do not share a common ancestor, but rather have become more similar through language contact and areal effects. Because of this, most modern linguists do not accept the Altaic family.

A 2015 analysis using the <a href="Automated%20Similarity%20Judgment%20Program">Automated Similarity Judgment Program</a> resulted in the Japonic languages being grouped with the <a href="Ainu%20languages">Ainu</a> and <a href="Austroasiatic%20languages">Austroasiatic languages</a>, but showed no connection to Turkic and Mongolic. However, the similarity of Japonic and Ainu languages can be partially explained by a large amount of loanwords as a result of contact between the Ainu and Japanese peoples. 

The idea that the <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic</a>, <a href="Mongolic%20languages">Mongolic</a>, and <a href="Tungusic%20languages">Tungusic languages</a> are closely related was allegedly first published in 1730 by <a href="Philip%20Johan%20von%20Strahlenberg">Philip Johan von Strahlenberg</a>, a Swedish officer who traveled in the eastern <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> while a prisoner of war after the <a href="Great%20Northern%20War">Great Northern War</a>. However, as has been pointed out by <a href="Alexis%20Manaster%20Ramer">Alexis Manaster Ramer</a> and <a href="Paul%20Sidwell">Paul Sidwell</a> (1997), von Strahlenberg actually opposed the idea of a closer relationship among the languages that later became known as "Altaic". Von Strahlenberg's classification was the first attempt to classify a large number of languages, some of which are Altaic.

The term "Altaic", as applied to a language family, was introduced in 1844 by <a href="Matthias%20Castr%C3%A9n">Matthias Castrén</a>, a Finnish <a href="Philology">philologist</a> who made contributions to the study of the <a href="Uralic%20languages">Uralic languages</a>. As originally formulated by Castrén, Altaic included not only Turkic, Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus (=Tungusic), but also <a href="Finno-Ugric%20languages">Finno-Ugric</a> and <a href="Samoyedic%20languages">Samoyed</a>.

The original Altaic family came to be known as the <a href="Ural%E2%80%93Altaic%20languages">Ural–Altaic</a>. In the "Ural–Altaic" nomenclature, Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic are "Uralic", whereas Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic are "Altaic", as are <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a> and <a href="Classification%20of%20the%20Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> if they are included at all.

For much of the 19th and the early 20th centuries, the theory of a common Ural–Altaic family was widespread, based on such shared features as <a href="vowel%20harmony">vowel harmony</a> and <a href="Agglutinative%20language">agglutination</a>. However, while the Ural–Altaic hypothesis can still be found in encyclopedias, atlases, and similar general references, it has generally been abandoned by linguists. For instance, it was characterized by <a href="Sergei%20Starostin">Sergei Starostin</a> as "an idea now completely discarded".

In 1857, the Austrian scholar <a href="Anton%20Boller">Anton Boller</a> suggested adding <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> to the Ural–Altaic family. In the 1920s, <a href="Gustaf%20John%20Ramstedt">G.J. Ramstedt</a> and <a href="Yevgeny%20Polivanov">E.D. Polivanov</a> advocated the inclusion of Korean. However, Ramstedt's three-volume, "Einführung in die altaische Sprachwissenschaft" ('Introduction to Altaic Linguistics'), published in 1952–1966, rejected the Ural–Altaic hypothesis and again included Korean in Altaic, an inclusion followed by most leading Altaicists to date. The first volume of his work, "Lautlehre" ('Phonology'), contained the first comprehensive attempt to identify regular correspondences among the sound systems within the Altaic language families.

In 1960, Nicholas Poppe published what was in effect a heavily revised version of Ramstedt’s volume on phonology that has since set the standard in Altaic studies. Poppe considered the issue of the relationship of Korean to Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic not settled. In his view, there were three possibilities: (1) Korean did not belong with the other three genealogically, but had been influenced by an Altaic substratum; (2) Korean was related to the other three at the same level they were related to each other; (3) Korean had split off from the other three before they underwent a series of characteristic changes.

<a href="Roy%20Andrew%20Miller">Roy Andrew Miller</a>'s 1971 book "Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages" convinced most Altaicists that Japanese also belonged to Altaic. Since then, the standard set of languages included in Macro-Altaic has been Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japanese.

An alternative classification, though one with much less currency among Altaicists, was proposed by John C. Street (1962), according to which Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic forms one grouping and Korean-Japanese-<a href="Ainu%20language">Ainu</a> another, the two being linked in a common family that Street designated as "North Asiatic". The same schema was adopted by <a href="James%20Patrie">James Patrie</a> (1982) in the context of an attempt to classify the <a href="Ainu%20languages">Ainu</a> language. The Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic and Korean-Japanese-Ainu groupings were also posited by <a href="Joseph%20Greenberg">Joseph Greenberg</a> (2000–2002); however, he treated them as independent members of a larger family, which he termed <a href="Eurasiatic%20languages">Eurasiatic</a>.

Anti-Altaicists <a href="Gerard%20Clauson">Gerard Clauson</a> (1956), <a href="Gerhard%20Doerfer">Gerhard Doerfer</a> (1963), and <a href="Alexander%20Shcherbak">Alexander Shcherbak</a> argued that the words and features shared by Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages were for the most part borrowings and that the rest could be attributed to chance resemblances. They noted that there was little vocabulary shared by Turkic and Tungusic languages, though more shared with Mongolic languages. They reasoned that, if all three families had a common ancestor, we should expect losses to happen at random and not only at the geographical margins of the family; and that the observed pattern is consistent with borrowing. Furthermore, they argued that many of the <a href="Linguistic%20typology">typological</a> features of the supposed Altaic languages, such as <a href="agglutinative%20language">agglutinative</a> <a href="morphology%20%28linguistics%29">morphology</a> and <a href="subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb">subject–object–verb</a> (SOV) word order, usually simultaneously occur in languages. In sum, the idea was that Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages form a "<a href="Sprachbund">Sprachbund</a>"—the result of <a href="Language%20convergence">convergence</a> through intensive borrowing and long contact among speakers of languages that are not necessarily closely related.

Doubt was also raised about the affinities of Korean and Japanese; in particular, some authors tried to connect Japanese to the <a href="Austronesian%20languages">Austronesian languages</a>.

Starostin's (1991) lexicostatistical research claimed that the proposed Altaic groups shared about 15–20% of potential cognates within a 110-word <a href="Swadesh%20list%23Shorter%20lists">Swadesh-Yakhontov list</a> (e.g. Turkic–Mongolic 20%, Turkic–Tungusic 18%, Turkic–Korean 17%, Mongolic–Tungusic 22%, Mongolic–Korean 16%, Tungusic–Korean 21%). Altogether, Starostin concluded that the Altaic grouping was substantiated, though "older than most other language families in Eurasia, such as Indo-European or Finno-Ugric, and this is the reason why the modern Altaic languages preserve few common elements".

Unger (1990) advocates a family consisting of Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic languages but not Turkic or Mongolic; and Doerfer (1988) rejects all the genetic claims over these major groups. In 2003, Claus Schönig published a critical overview of the history of the Altaic hypothesis up to that time. He concluded:

In 2003, "An Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages" was published by Starostin, Dybo, and Mudrak. It contains 2,800 proposed <a href="cognate">cognate</a> sets, a set of sound laws based on those proposed sets, and a number of grammatical correspondences, as well as a few important changes to the reconstruction of Proto-Altaic. For example, although most of today's Altaic languages have vowel harmony, Proto-Altaic as reconstructed by Starostin "et al." lacked it; instead, various vowel assimilations between the first and second syllables of words occurred in Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic. It tries hard to distinguish loans between Turkic and Mongolic and between Mongolic and Tungusic from cognates; and it suggests words that occur in Turkic and Tungusic but not in Mongolic. All other combinations between the five branches also occur in the book. It lists 144 items of shared basic vocabulary (most of them already present in Starostin 1991), including words for such items as 'eye', 'ear', 'neck', 'bone', 'blood', 'water', 'stone', 'sun', and 'two'. This work has not changed the minds of any of the principal authors in the field, however. The debate continues unabated – e.g. S. Georg 2004, A. Vovin 2005, S. Georg 2005 (anti-Altaic); S. Starostin 2005, V. Blažek 2006, M. Robbeets 2007, A. Dybo and G. Starostin 2008 (pro-Altaic).

According to Roy Andrew Miller (1996: 98–99), the Clauson–Doerfer critique of Altaic relies exclusively on <a href="lexicon">lexicon</a>, whereas the fundamental evidence for Altaic comprises <a href="verb">verb</a>al <a href="morphology%20%28linguistics%29">morphology</a>. Lars Johanson (2010: 15–17) suggests that a resolution of the Altaic dispute may yet come from the examination of verbal morphology and calls for a muting of the polemic: "The dark age of "pro" and "contra" slogans, unfair polemics, and humiliations is not yet completely over and done with, but there seems to be some hope for a more constructive discussion" (ib. 17).

The earliest known texts in a Turkic language are the <a href="Orkhon%20inscriptions">Orkhon inscriptions</a>, 720–735 AD. They were deciphered in 1893 by the Danish linguist <a href="Vilhelm%20Thomsen">Vilhelm Thomsen</a> in a scholarly race with his rival, the German–Russian linguist <a href="Vasily%20Radlov">Wilhelm Radloff</a>. However, Radloff was the first to publish the inscriptions.

The first Tungusic language to be attested is <a href="Jurchen%20language">Jurchen</a>, the language of the ancestors of the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Manchus</a>. A writing system for it was devised in 1119 AD and an inscription using this system is known from 1185 (see <a href="List%20of%20Jurchen%20inscriptions">List of Jurchen inscriptions</a>).

The earliest <a href="Mongolic%20languages">Mongolic</a> language of which we have written evidence is known as <a href="Middle%20Mongol%20language">Middle Mongol</a>. It is first attested by an inscription dated to 1224 or 1225 AD and by the "<a href="Secret%20History%20of%20the%20Mongols">Secret History of the Mongols</a>", written in 1228 (see <a href="Mongolic%20languages">Mongolic languages</a>). The earliest Para-Mongolic text is the <a href="Memorial%20for%20Yelu%20Yanning">Memorial for Yelu Yanning</a>, written in the <a href="Khitan%20large%20script">Khitan Large Script</a> and dated to 986 AD.

The prehistory of the peoples speaking these languages is largely unknown. Whereas for certain other language families, such as the speakers of <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Indo-European</a>, <a href="Proto-Uralic%20language">Uralic</a>, and <a href="Austronesian%20languages">Austronesian</a>, we are able to frame substantial hypotheses, in the case of the proposed Altaic family much remains to be done. In the absence of written records, there are several ways to study the (pre)history of a people:


All of these methods remain to be applied to the languages attributed to Altaic with the same degree of focus and intensity with which they have been applied to the Indo-European family (e.g. Mallory 1989, Anthony 2007). Some scholars bear in mind a possible Uralic and Altaic <a href="Urheimat">Urheimat</a> in the Central Asian steppes.

Japanese is first attested in a few short inscriptions from the 5th century AD, such as the <a href="Inariyama%20Sword">Inariyama Sword</a>. The first substantial text in Japanese, however, is the <a href="Kojiki">Kojiki</a>, which dates from 712 AD. It is followed by the <a href="Nihon%20Shoki">Nihon shoki</a>, completed in 720, and that by the <a href="Man%27y%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB">Man'yōshū</a>, which dates from <a href="circa">c.</a> 771–785, but includes material that is from about 400 years earlier.

The most important text for the study of early Korean is the <a href="Hyangga">Hyangga</a>, a collection of 25 poems, of which some go back to the <a href="Three%20Kingdoms%20of%20Korea">Three Kingdoms</a> period (57 BC–668 AD), but are preserved in an <a href="orthography">orthography</a> that only goes back to the 9th century AD. Korean is copiously attested from the mid-15th century on in the phonetically precise <a href="Hangul">Hangul</a> system of writing.

According to <a href="Juha%20Janhunen">Juha Janhunen</a>, the ancestral languages of Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japanese were spoken in a relatively small area comprising present-day North Korea, Southern Manchuria, and Southeastern Mongolia. However Janhunen (1992) is skeptical about an affiliation of Japanese to Altaic, while <a href="Andr%C3%A1s%20R%C3%B3na-Tas">András Róna-Tas</a> remarked that a relationship between Altaic and Japanese, if it ever existed, must be more remote than the relationship of any two of the Indo-European languages. Ramsey stated that "the genetic relationship between Korean and Japanese, if it in fact exists, is probably more complex and distant than we can imagine on the basis of our present state of knowledge". Recent studies show no genetic relation of Japanese and Koreans to Altaic people (Turkic and Mongolian people).

Supporters of the Altaic hypothesis formerly set the date of the Proto-Altaic language at around 4000 BC, but today at around 5000 BC or 6000 BC. This would make Altaic a language family about as old as <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> (4000 to 7,000 BC according to several hypotheses) but considerably younger than <a href="Afroasiatic%20languages">Afroasiatic</a> (c. 10,000 BC or 11,000 to 16,000 BC according to different sources).

"Note: This list is limited to linguists who have worked specifically on the Altaic problem since the publication of the first volume of Ramstedt's "Einführung" in 1952. The dates given are those of works concerning Altaic. For Altaicists, the version of Altaic they favor is given at the end of the entry, if other than the prevailing one of Turkic–Mongolic–Tungusic–Korean–Japanese."




Based on the proposed correspondences listed below, the following <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> inventory has been reconstructed for the hypothetical <a href="Protolanguage">Proto</a>(-Macro)-Altaic language (taken from Blažek's [2006] summary of the newest Altaic etymological dictionary [Starostin et al. 2003] and transcribed into the ):

 This phoneme only occurred at the beginnings of words.<br>

It is not clear whether , , were <a href="monophthong">monophthong</a>s as shown here (presumably ) or <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s (); the evidence is equivocal. In any case, however, they only occurred in the first (and sometimes only) syllable of any word.

Every vowel occurred in long and short versions which were different <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>s in the first syllable. Starostin et al. (2003) treat length together with pitch as a prosodic feature.

As reconstructed by Starostin et al. (2003), Proto-Altaic was a <a href="pitch%20accent">pitch accent</a> or <a href="Tone%20%28linguistics%29">tone</a> language; at least the first and probably every syllable could have a high or a low pitch.

If a Proto(-Macro)-Altaic language really existed, it should be possible to reconstruct regular sound correspondences between that <a href="protolanguage">protolanguage</a> and its descendants; such correspondences would make it possible to distinguish <a href="cognate">cognate</a>s from <a href="loanword">loanword</a>s (in many cases). Such attempts have repeatedly been made. The latest version is reproduced here, taken from Blažek's (2006) summary of the newest Altaic etymological dictionary (Starostin et al. 2003) and transcribed into the .

When a Proto-Altaic phoneme developed differently depending on its position in a word (beginning, interior, or end), the special case (or all cases) is marked with a hyphen; for example, Proto-Altaic disappears (marked "0") or becomes at the beginning of a Turkic word and becomes elsewhere in a Turkic word.

Only single consonants are considered here. In the middle of words, clusters of two consonants were allowed in Proto-Altaic as reconstructed by Starostin et al. (2003); the correspondence table of these clusters spans almost 7 pages in their book (83–89), and most clusters are only found in one or a few of the reconstructed roots.

<a href="Vowel%20harmony">Vowel harmony</a> is pervasive in the languages attributed to Altaic: most Turkic and Mongolic as well as some Tungusic languages have it, Korean is arguably in the process of losing its traces, and it is controversially hypothesized for Old Japanese. (Vowel harmony is also typical of the neighboring <a href="Uralic%20languages">Uralic languages</a> and was often counted among the arguments for the <a href="Ural%E2%80%93Altaic%20languages">Ural–Altaic hypotheses</a>.) Nevertheless, Starostin et al. (2003) reconstruct Proto-Altaic as lacking vowel harmony. Instead, according to them, vowel harmony originated in each daughter branch as assimilation of the vowel in the first syllable to the vowel in the second syllable (which was usually modified or lost later). "The situation therefore is very close, e.g. to <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic</a> [see <a href="Germanic%20umlaut">Germanic umlaut</a>] or to the <a href="Nakh%20languages">Nakh languages</a> in the Eastern Caucasus, where the quality of non-initial vowels can now only be recovered on the basis of umlaut processes in the first syllable." (Starostin et al. 2003:91) The table below is taken from Starostin et al. (2003):

Length and pitch in the first syllable evolved as follows according to Starostin et al. (2003), with the caveat that it is not clear which pitch was high and which was low in Proto-Altaic (Starostin et al. 2003:135). For simplicity of input and display every syllable is symbolized as "a" here:

¹ "Proto-Mongolian has lost all traces of the original prosody except for voicing *p > *b in syllables with original high pitch" (Starostin et al. 2003:135).<br>
² "[...] several secondary metatonic processes happened [...] in Korean, basically in the verb subsystem: all verbs have a strong tendency towards low pitch on the first syllable." (Starostin et al. 2003:135)

Starostin et al. (2003) have reconstructed the following correspondences between the case and number <a href="suffix">suffix</a>es (or <a href="clitic">clitic</a>s) of the (Macro-)Altaic languages (taken from Blažek, 2006):

/V/ symbolizes an uncertain vowel. Suffixes reconstructed for Proto-Turkic, Proto-Mongolic, Proto-Korean, or Proto-Japonic, but not attested in Old Turkic, Classical Mongolian, Middle Korean, or Old Japanese are marked with asterisks.

This correspondences, however, have been harshly criticized for several reasons: There are significant gaps resulting in the absence of etymologies for certain initial segments: an impossible situation in the case of a genetic relationship; lack of common paradigmatic morphology; in many cases, there are ghosts, invented or polished meanings; and word-list linguistics rules supreme, as there are few if any references to texts or philology.

There are also many reconstructions proved to be totally false. For instance, regarding Korean, Starostin et al. state that Middle Korean genitive is /nʲ/, while it actually was /s/ in its honorific form, and /ój/ or /uj/ as neutral forms.

In addition, some "cognates" are visibly forced, like the comparison between Turkish instrumental and Japanese locative /ni/. A locative postposition expresses an absolutely different meaning to that of an instrumental, so it is evident that both of them are not related whatsoever. The same applies for Japanese /ga/ and Proto Tungusic /ga/. The first of those particles expresses genitive case, while the second is the partitive case, which bear no resemblance of meaning at all either. Therefore, those two are not cognates. A different kind of issue is that of the Old Turkish genitive /Xŋ/ (where "X" stands for any phoneme) and Old Japanese genitive /no/. Although they share the same consonant, the fact that the former is a vowel plus a consonant, and the second is a fixed set of the consonant /n/ plus vowel /o/ makes the fact that those two are cognates extremely unlikely.

The table below is taken (with slight modifications) from Blažek (2006) and transcribed into IPA.

As above, forms not attested in Classical Mongolian or Middle Korean but reconstructed for their ancestors are marked with an asterisk, and /V/ represents an uncertain vowel.

There are, however, several problems with this proposed list. Aside from the huge amount of non-attested, free reconstructions, some mistakes on the research carried out by altaicists must be pointed out. The first of them is that Old Japanese for the first person pronoun ("I", in English) was neither /ba/ or /a/. It was /ware/ (和禮), and sometimes it was abbreviated to /wa/ (吾). Also, it is not a Sino-Japanese word, but a native Japanese term. In addition, the second person pronoun was not /si/, but either /imasi/ (汝), or /namu/ (奈牟)　, which sometimes was shortened to /na/. Its plural was /namu tachi/ (奈牟多知).

The following table is a brief selection of further proposed <a href="cognate">cognate</a>s in basic vocabulary across the Altaic family (from Starostin et al. [2003]). Their reconstructions and equivalences are not accepted by the mainstream linguists and therefore remain very controversial.

In the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European family</a>, the <a href="Numeral%20%28linguistics%29">numerals</a> are remarkably stable. This is a rather exceptional case; especially words for higher numbers are often borrowed wholesale. (Perhaps the most famous cases are <a href="Japanese%20numerals">Japanese</a> and <a href="Korean%20numerals">Korean</a>, which have two complete sets of numerals each – one native, one <a href="Chinese%20numerals">Chinese</a>.) Indeed, the Altaic numerals are less stable than the Indo-European ones, but nevertheless Starostin et al. (2003) reconstruct them as follows. They are not accepted by the mainstream linguists and are controversial. Other reconstructions show little to no similarities in numerals of the proto-languages.

Austrian German

Austrian German (), Austrian Standard German, Standard Austrian German () or Austrian High German (), is the variety of <a href="Standard%20German">Standard German</a> written and spoken in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. It has the highest <a href="Prestige%20%28sociolinguistics%29">sociolinguistic prestige</a> locally, as it is the variation used in the media and for other formal situations.

In less formal situations, Austrians tend to use forms closer to or identical with the <a href="Bavarian%20language">Bavarian</a> and <a href="Alemannic%20German">Alemannic dialects</a>, traditionally spoken – but rarely written – in Austria.

Austrian German has its beginning in the mid-18th century, when empress <a href="Maria%20Theresa">Maria Theresa</a> and her son <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph II</a> introduced <a href="Compulsory%20education">compulsory schooling</a> (in 1774) and several reforms of administration in their multilingual <a href="Habsburg%20empire">Habsburg empire</a>. At the time, the written standard was "Oberdeutsche Schreibsprache", which was highly influenced by the <a href="Bavarian%20language">Bavarian</a> and <a href="Alemannic%20dialects">Alemannic dialects</a> of Austria. Another option was to create a new standard based on the Southern German dialects, as proposed by the linguist Janez Žiga Popovič (Johann Siegmund Popowitsch). Instead they decided for pragmatic reasons to adopt the already standardized Chancellery language of Saxony ("Sächsische Kanzleisprache" or "Meißner Kanzleideutsch"), which was based on the administrative language of the non-Austrian area of <a href="Mei%C3%9Fen">Meißen</a> and <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>. 
Thus Standard Austrian German has the same geographic origin as the <a href="Standard%20German">Standard German</a> of Germany ("Bundesdeutsches Hochdeutsch", also "Deutschländisches Deutsch") and <a href="Swiss%20High%20German">Swiss High German</a> ("Schweizer Hochdeutsch", not to be confused with the Alemannic <a href="Swiss%20German">Swiss German</a> dialects).

The process of introducing the new written standard was led by <a href="Joseph%20von%20Sonnenfels">Joseph von Sonnenfels</a>.
Since 1951 the standardized form of Austrian German for official texts and schools is defined by the "<a href="Austrian%20Dictionary">Austrian Dictionary</a>" (""), published under the authority of the Austrian <a href="Federal%20Ministry%20of%20Education%2C%20Arts%20and%20Culture">Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture</a>.

As <a href="German%20language">German</a> is a <a href="pluricentric%20language">pluricentric language</a>, Austrian German is merely one among several <a href="Variety%20%28linguistics%29">varieties</a> of Standard German. Much like the relationship between <a href="British%20English">British English</a> and <a href="American%20English">American English</a>, the German varieties differ in minor respects (e.g., spelling, word usage and grammar) but are recognizably equivalent and largely mutually intelligible.

The official Austrian dictionary, "<a href="das%20%C3%96sterreichische%20W%C3%B6rterbuch">das Österreichische Wörterbuch</a>", <a href="linguistic%20prescription">prescribe</a>s grammatical and spelling rules defining the official language. Austrian delegates participated in the international working group that drafted the <a href="German%20orthography%20reform%20of%201996%23In%20Austria">German spelling reform</a> of 1996—several conferences leading up to the reform were hosted in Vienna at the invitation of the Austrian federal government—and adopted it as a signatory, along with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, of an international memorandum of understanding (Wiener Absichtserklärung) signed in Vienna in 1996. 
The "<a href="sharp%20s">sharp s</a>" (ß) is used in Austria, as in Germany.

Because of the German language's <a href="pluricentric%20language">pluricentric</a> nature, German dialects in Austria should not be confused with the variety of <a href="Standard%20German">Standard German</a> spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of <a href="Germany">Germany</a> or <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in <a href="culinary">culinary</a> terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and <a href="Administration%20%28government%29">administrative</a> and <a href="law">legal</a> language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German <a href="nation-state">nation-state</a> in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions. A comprehensive collection of Austrian-German legal, administrative and economic terms is offered in "Markhardt, Heidemarie: Wörterbuch der österreichischen Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsterminologie" (Peter Lang, 2006).

The "former standard", used for about 300 years or more in speech in refined language, was the ', a sociolect spoken by the imperial <a href="Habsburg%20family">Habsburg family</a> and the nobility of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>. It differed from other dialects in vocabulary and pronunciation; it appears to have been spoken with a slight degree of nasality. This was not a standard in a modern technical sense, as it was just the social standard of upper-class speech.

For many years, Austria had a special form of the language for official government documents. This form is known as "", or "Austrian chancellery language". It is a very traditional form of the language, probably derived from medieval deeds and documents, and has a very complicated structure and vocabulary generally reserved for such documents. For most speakers (even native speakers), this form of the language is generally difficult to understand, as it contains many highly specialised terms for diplomatic, internal, official, and military matters. There are no regional variations, because this special written form has mainly been used by a government that has now for centuries been based in Vienna.

' is now used less and less, thanks to various administrative reforms that reduced the number of traditional civil servants ('). As a result, Standard German is replacing it in government and administrative texts.

When Austria became a member of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, the Austrian variety of the German language — limited to 23 agricultural terms — was "protected" in Protocol 10, regarding the use of Austrian-specific terms in the framework of the European Union, which forms part of the Austrian EU accession treaty. Austrian German is the only variety of a <a href="pluricentric%20language">pluricentric language</a> recognized under international law or EU primary law. All facts concerning “Protocol no. 10” are documented in Markhardt's "Das österreichische Deutsch im Rahmen der EU", Peter Lang, 2005.

In <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, as in the <a href="Languages%20of%20Switzerland%23German">German-speaking parts of Switzerland</a> and in <a href="southern%20Germany">southern Germany</a>, verbs that express a state tend to use "" as the <a href="auxiliary%20verb">auxiliary verb</a> in the <a href="perfect%20%28grammar%29">perfect</a>, as well as verbs of movement. <a href="Verbs">Verbs</a> which fall into this category include "sitzen" (to sit), "liegen" (to lie) and, in parts of <a href="Carinthia%20%28state%29">Carinthia</a>, "schlafen" (to sleep). Therefore, the perfect of these verbs would be "ich bin gesessen", "ich bin gelegen" and "ich bin geschlafen" respectively (note: "ich bin geschlafen" is a rarely used form, more commonly "ich habe geschlafen" is used).

In Germany, the words "stehen" (to stand) and "gestehen" (to confess) are identical in the present perfect: "habe gestanden". The Austrian variant avoids this potential ambiguity ("bin gestanden" from "stehen", "to stand"; and "habe gestanden" from "gestehen", "to confess", e.g. ""der Verbrecher ist vor dem Richter gestanden und hat gestanden"").

In addition, the <a href="preterite">preterite</a> (<a href="simple%20past">simple past</a>) is very rarely used in Austria, especially in the <a href="spoken%20language">spoken language</a>, with the exception of some modal verbs (i.e. "ich sollte", "ich wollte").

There are many official terms that differ in Austrian German from their usage in most parts of <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. Words primarily used in Austria are "Jänner" (January) rather than "Januar", "heuer" (this year) rather than "dieses Jahr", "Stiege" (stairs) instead of "Treppe", "Rauchfang" (chimney) instead of "Schornstein", many administrative, legal and political terms – and a whole series of foods such as: "Erdäpfel" (potatoes) German "Kartoffeln" (but Dutch "aardappel"), "Schlagobers" (whipped cream) German "Schlagsahne", "Faschiertes" (ground beef) German "Hackfleisch" (but Hungarian "fasírt", Croatian and Slovenian informal "faširano"), "Fisolen" (green beans) German "Gartenbohnen" (but Czech "fazole", Italian "fagioli", Croatian (regional) "fažol", Slovenian "fižol", Hungarian folkish "paszuly"), "Karfiol" (cauliflower) German "Blumenkohl" (but Croatian, Hungarian and Slovak "karfiol", Italian "cavolfiore"), "Kohlsprossen" (Brussels sprouts) German "Rosenkohl", "Marillen" (apricots) German "Aprikosen" (but Slovak "marhuľa", Polish "morela", Slovenian "marelice", Croatian "marelica"), "Paradeiser" ["Paradiesapfel"] (tomatoes) German "Tomaten" (but Hungarian "paradicsom", Slovak "paradajka", Slovenian "paradižnik", Serbian "paradajz"), "Palatschinken" (pancakes) German "Pfannkuchen" (but Czech "palačinky", Hungarian "palacsinta", Croatian and Slovenian "palačinke"), "Topfen" (a semi-sweet cottage cheese) German "Quark" and "Kren" (horseradish) German "Meerrettich" (but Czech "křen", Slovak "chren", Croatian and Slovenian "hren", etc.).

There are, however, some <a href="false%20friends">false friends</a> between the two regional varieties:


In addition to the standard variety, in everyday life most Austrians speak one of a number of <a href="Upper%20German%20dialects">Upper German dialects</a>.

While strong forms of the various dialects are not fully <a href="mutually%20intelligible">mutually intelligible</a> to <a href="Northern%20Germany">northern Germans</a>, communication is much easier in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, especially rural areas, where the Bavarian dialect still predominates as the mother tongue. The <a href="Central%20Austro-Bavarian">Central Austro-Bavarian</a> dialects are more intelligible to speakers of <a href="Standard%20German">Standard German</a> than the <a href="Southern%20Austro-Bavarian">Southern Austro-Bavarian</a> dialects of <a href="Tyrol%20%28state%29">Tyrol</a>.

<a href="Viennese%20language">Viennese</a>, the Austro-Bavarian dialect of <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, is seen for many in Germany as quintessentially Austrian. The people of <a href="Graz">Graz</a>, the capital of <a href="Styria">Styria</a>, speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western <a href="Styria">Styria</a>.

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and, after listening to a few spoken words, it may be possible for an Austrian to realise which <a href="dialect">dialect</a> is being spoken. However, in regard to the dialects of the deeper valleys of the <a href="Tyrol%20%28state%29">Tirol</a>, other Tyroleans are often unable to understand them. Speakers from the different <a href="states%20of%20Austria">states of Austria</a> can easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), those of <a href="Carinthia%20%28state%29">Carinthia</a>, <a href="Styria">Styria</a>, <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="Upper%20Austria">Upper Austria</a>, and the <a href="Tyrol%20%28state%29">Tyrol</a> being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking <a href="Standard%20German">Standard German</a>, can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener.

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where in the past many speakers were bilingual with <a href="Slovene%20language">Slovene</a>, and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a> period, particularly from what is today the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>. The German dialects of <a href="South%20Tyrol">South Tyrol</a> have been influenced by local <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a>, particularly noticeable with the many <a href="loanword">loanword</a>s from <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> and <a href="Ladin%20language">Ladin</a>.

Interestingly, the geographic borderlines between the different accents (<a href="isogloss">isogloss</a>es) coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border with <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the linguistic similarities.

<doc id="840" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=840" title="Axiom of choice">
Axiom of choice

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, the axiom of choice, or AC, is an <a href="axiom">axiom</a> of <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a> equivalent to the statement that "the <a href="Cartesian%20product">Cartesian product</a> of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty". It states that for every <a href="indexed%20family">indexed family</a> formula_1 of <a href="nonempty">nonempty</a> sets there exists an indexed family formula_2 of elements such that formula_3 for every formula_4. The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by <a href="Ernst%20Zermelo">Ernst Zermelo</a> in order to formalize his proof of the <a href="well-ordering%20theorem">well-ordering theorem</a>.

Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin. In many cases such a selection can be made without invoking the axiom of choice; this is in particular the case if the number of bins is finite, or if a selection rule is available: a distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one object in each bin. To give an informal example, for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate selection, but for an infinite collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), such a selection can be obtained only by invoking the axiom of choice.

Although originally controversial, the axiom of choice is now used without reservation by most mathematicians, and it is included in the standard form of <a href="axiomatic%20set%20theory">axiomatic set theory</a>, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (<a href="ZFC">ZFC</a>). One motivation for this use is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as <a href="Tychonoff%27s%20theorem">Tychonoff's theorem</a>, require the axiom of choice for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice, such as the <a href="axiom%20of%20determinacy">axiom of determinacy</a>. The axiom of choice is avoided in some varieties of <a href="Constructivism%20%28mathematics%29">constructive mathematics</a>, although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom of choice is embraced.

A <a href="choice%20function">choice function</a> is a function "f", defined on a collection "X" of nonempty sets, such that for every set "A" in "X", "f"("A") is an element of "A". With this concept, the axiom can be stated:
Formally, this may be expressed as follows:

Thus, the negation of the axiom of choice states that there exists a collection of nonempty sets that has no choice function.

Each choice function on a collection "X" of nonempty sets is an element of the <a href="Cartesian%20product%23Infinite%20products">Cartesian product</a> of the sets in "X". This is not the most general situation of a Cartesian product of a <a href="indexed%20family">family</a> of sets, where a given set can occur more than once as a factor; however, one can focus on elements of such a product that select the same element every time a given set appears as factor, and such elements correspond to an element of the Cartesian product of all "distinct" sets in the family. The axiom of choice asserts the existence of such elements; it is therefore equivalent to:

In this article and other discussions of the Axiom of Choice the following abbreviations are common:

There are many other equivalent statements of the axiom of choice. These are equivalent in the sense that, in the presence of other basic axioms of set theory, they imply the axiom of choice and are implied by it.

One variation avoids the use of choice functions by, in effect, replacing each choice function with its range.
This guarantees for any <a href="partition%20of%20a%20set">partition of a set</a> "X" the existence of a subset "C" of "X" containing exactly one element from each part of the partition.

Another equivalent axiom only considers collections "X" that are essentially powersets of other sets:
Authors who use this formulation often speak of the "choice function on A", but be advised that this is a slightly different notion of choice function. Its domain is the powerset of "A" (with the empty set removed), and so makes sense for any set "A", whereas with the definition used elsewhere in this article, the domain of a choice function on a "collection of sets" is that collection, and so only makes sense for sets of sets. With this alternate notion of choice function, the axiom of choice can be compactly stated as
which is equivalent to
The negation of the axiom can thus be expressed as:

The statement of the axiom of choice does not specify whether the collection of nonempty sets is finite or infinite, and thus implies that every <a href="finite%20set">finite collection</a> of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, that particular case is a theorem of <a href="Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel%20set%20theory">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a> without the axiom of choice (ZF); it is easily proved by <a href="mathematical%20induction">mathematical induction</a>. In the even simpler case of a collection of "one" set, a choice function just corresponds to an element, so this instance of the axiom of choice says that every nonempty set has an element; this holds trivially. The axiom of choice can be seen as asserting the generalization of this property, already evident for finite collections, to arbitrary collections.

Until the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly, although it had not yet been formally stated. For example, after having established that the set "X" contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said "let "F(s)" be one of the members of "s" for all "s" in "X"." In general, it is impossible to prove that "F" exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until <a href="Zermelo">Zermelo</a>.

Not every situation requires the axiom of choice. For finite sets "X", the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory. In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box. Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on. The number of boxes is finite, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end. The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on. (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of <a href="mathematical%20induction">mathematical induction</a> to prove "for every natural number "k", every family of "k" nonempty sets has a choice function.") This method cannot, however, be used to show that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function, as is asserted by the <a href="axiom%20of%20countable%20choice">axiom of countable choice</a>. If the method is applied to an infinite sequence ("X" : "i"∈ω) of nonempty sets, a function is obtained at each finite stage, but there is no stage at which a choice function for the entire family is constructed, and no "limiting" choice function can be constructed, in general, in ZF without the axiom of choice.

The nature of the individual nonempty sets in the collection may make it possible to avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections. For example, suppose that each member of the collection "X" is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers. Every such subset has a smallest element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it maps each set to the least element of that set. This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set, and makes it unnecessary to apply the axiom of choice.

The difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set. If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our set exists? For example, suppose that "X" is the set of all non-empty subsets of the <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s. First we might try to proceed as if "X" were finite. If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because "X" is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of "X". Next we might try specifying the least element from each set. But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open <a href="Interval%20%28mathematics%29">interval</a> (0,1) does not have a least element: if "x" is in (0,1), then so is "x"/2, and "x"/2 is always strictly smaller than "x". So this attempt also fails.

Additionally, consider for instance the unit circle "S", and the action on "S" by a group "G" consisting of all rational rotations. Namely, these are rotations by angles which are rational multiples of "π". Here "G" is countable while "S" is uncountable. Hence "S" breaks up into uncountably many orbits under "G". Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset "X" of "S" with the property that all of its translates by G are disjoint from "X". The set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Since "X" is not measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive finite measure on "S", finding an algorithm to select a point in each orbit requires the axiom of choice. See <a href="non-measurable%20set%23Example">non-measurable set</a> for more details.

The reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are <a href="well-order">well-order</a>ed: every nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element under the natural ordering. One might say, "Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering. Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering." The problem then becomes that of constructing a well-ordering, which turns out to require the axiom of choice for its existence; every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice holds.

A proof requiring the axiom of choice may establish the existence of an object without explicitly <a href="definable%20set">defining</a> the object in the language of set theory. For example, while the axiom of choice implies that there is a <a href="well-ordering">well-ordering</a> of the real numbers, there are models of set theory with the axiom of choice in which no well-ordering of the reals is definable. Similarly, although a subset of the real numbers that is not <a href="Lebesgue%20measure">Lebesgue measurable</a> can be proved to exist using the axiom of choice, it is <a href="consistent">consistent</a> that no such set is definable.

The axiom of choice proves the existence of these intangibles (objects that are proved to exist, but which cannot be explicitly constructed), which may conflict with some philosophical principles. Because there is no <a href="Canonical%20form">canonical</a> well-ordering of all sets, a construction that relies on a well-ordering may not produce a canonical result, even if a canonical result is desired (as is often the case in <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a>). This has been used as an argument against the use of the axiom of choice.

Another argument against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem counterintuitive. One example is the <a href="Banach%E2%80%93Tarski%20paradox">Banach–Tarski paradox</a> which says that it is possible to decompose the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are <a href="non-measurable%20set">non-measurable set</a>s.

Despite these seemingly paradoxical facts, most mathematicians accept the axiom of choice as a valid principle for proving new results in mathematics. The debate is interesting enough, however, that it is considered of note when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is <a href="logical%20equivalence">logically equivalent</a> (with just the ZF axioms) to the axiom of choice, and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of choice to be false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type which requires the axiom of choice to be true.

It is possible to prove many theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation; such statements will be true in any <a href="model%20theory">model</a> of <a href="Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel%20set%20theory">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a> (ZF), regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model. The restriction to ZF renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its negation unprovable. For example, the Banach–Tarski paradox is neither provable nor disprovable from ZF alone: it is impossible to construct the required decomposition of the unit ball in ZF, but also impossible to prove there is no such decomposition. Similarly, all the statements listed below which require choice or some weaker version thereof for their proof are unprovable in ZF, but since each is provable in ZF plus the axiom of choice, there are models of ZF in which each statement is true. Statements such as the Banach–Tarski paradox can be rephrased as conditional statements, for example, "If AC holds, then the decomposition in the Banach–Tarski paradox exists." Such conditional statements are provable in ZF when the original statements are provable from ZF and the axiom of choice.

As discussed above, in ZFC, the axiom of choice is able to provide "<a href="nonconstructive%20proof">nonconstructive proof</a>s" in which the existence of an object is proved although no explicit example is constructed. ZFC, however, is still formalized in classical logic. The axiom of choice has also been thoroughly studied in the context of constructive mathematics, where non-classical logic is employed. The status of the axiom of choice varies between different varieties of constructive mathematics.

In <a href="Martin-L%C3%B6f%20type%20theory">Martin-Löf type theory</a> and higher-order <a href="Heyting%20arithmetic">Heyting arithmetic</a>, the appropriate statement of the axiom of choice is (depending on approach) included as an axiom or provable as a theorem. <a href="Errett%20Bishop">Errett Bishop</a> argued that the axiom of choice was constructively acceptable, saying

In <a href="constructive%20set%20theory">constructive set theory</a>, however, <a href="Diaconescu%27s%20theorem">Diaconescu's theorem</a> shows that the axiom of choice implies the <a href="law%20of%20excluded%20middle">law of excluded middle</a> (unlike in Martin-Löf type theory, where it does not). Thus the axiom of choice is not generally available in constructive set theory. A cause for this difference is that the axiom of choice in type theory does not have the <a href="extensionality">extensionality</a> properties that the axiom of choice in constructive set theory does.

Some results in constructive set theory use the <a href="axiom%20of%20countable%20choice">axiom of countable choice</a> or the <a href="axiom%20of%20dependent%20choice">axiom of dependent choice</a>, which do not imply the law of the excluded middle in constructive set theory. Although the axiom of countable choice in particular is commonly used in constructive mathematics, its use has also been questioned.

Assuming ZF is consistent, <a href="Kurt%20G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a> showed that the "negation" of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an <a href="inner%20model">inner model</a> (the <a href="constructible%20universe">constructible universe</a>) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent. Assuming ZF is consistent, <a href="Paul%20Cohen%20%28mathematician%29">Paul Cohen</a> employed the technique of <a href="forcing%20%28mathematics%29">forcing</a>, developed for this purpose, to show that the axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Together these results establish that the axiom of choice is <a href="Independence%20%28mathematical%20logic%29">logically independent</a> of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.

One argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it because it allows one to prove some simplifying propositions that otherwise could not be proved. Many theorems which are provable using choice are of an elegant general character: every <a href="Ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a> in a ring is contained in a <a href="maximal%20ideal">maximal ideal</a>, every <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a> has a <a href="Basis%20%28linear%20algebra%29">basis</a>, and every <a href="Product%20topology">product</a> of <a href="compact%20space">compact space</a>s is compact. Without the axiom of choice, these theorems may not hold for mathematical objects of large cardinality.

The proof of the independence result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased in the language of <a href="Peano%20arithmetic">Peano arithmetic</a>, are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC. Statements in this class include the statement that <a href="P%20%3D%20NP">P = NP</a>, the <a href="Riemann%20hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>, and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.

The axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of ZF. For example, the <a href="Continuum%20hypothesis%23The%20generalized%20continuum%20hypothesis">generalized continuum hypothesis</a> (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZFC. However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.

The <a href="axiom%20of%20constructibility">axiom of constructibility</a> and the <a href="Continuum%20hypothesis%23The%20generalized%20continuum%20hypothesis">generalized continuum hypothesis</a> each imply the axiom of choice and so are strictly stronger than it. In class theories such as <a href="Von%20Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del%20set%20theory">Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory</a> and <a href="Morse%E2%80%93Kelley%20set%20theory">Morse–Kelley set theory</a>, there is an axiom called the <a href="axiom%20of%20global%20choice">axiom of global choice</a> that is stronger than the axiom of choice for sets because it also applies to proper classes. The axiom of global choice follows from the <a href="axiom%20of%20limitation%20of%20size">axiom of limitation of size</a>.

There are important statements that, assuming the axioms of <a href="Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel%20set%20theory">ZF</a> but neither AC nor ¬AC, are equivalent to the axiom of choice. The most important among them are <a href="Zorn%27s%20lemma">Zorn's lemma</a> and the <a href="well-ordering%20theorem">well-ordering theorem</a>. In fact, Zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem.


There are several results in <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a> which invoke the axiom of choice for their proof. These results might be weaker than, equivalent to, or stronger than the axiom of choice, depending on the strength of the technical foundations. For example, if one defines categories in terms of sets, that is, as sets of objects and morphisms (usually called a <a href="small%20category">small category</a>), or even locally small categories, whose hom-objects are sets, then there is no <a href="category%20of%20sets">category of all sets</a>, and so it is difficult for a category-theoretic formulation to apply to all sets. On the other hand, other foundational descriptions of category theory are considerably stronger, and an identical category-theoretic statement of choice may be stronger than the standard formulation, à la class theory, mentioned above.

Examples of category-theoretic statements which require choice include:

There are several weaker statements that are not equivalent to the axiom of choice, but are closely related. One example is the <a href="axiom%20of%20dependent%20choice">axiom of dependent choice</a> (DC). A still weaker example is the <a href="axiom%20of%20countable%20choice">axiom of countable choice</a> (AC or CC), which states that a choice function exists for any countable set of nonempty sets. These axioms are sufficient for many proofs in elementary <a href="mathematical%20analysis">mathematical analysis</a>, and are consistent with some principles, such as the Lebesgue measurability of all sets of reals, that are disprovable from the full axiom of choice.

Other choice axioms weaker than axiom of choice include the <a href="Boolean%20prime%20ideal%20theorem">Boolean prime ideal theorem</a> and the <a href="Uniformization%20%28set%20theory%29">axiom of uniformization</a>. The former is equivalent in ZF to the existence of an <a href="ultrafilter">ultrafilter</a> containing each given filter, proved by Tarski in 1930.

One of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that it shows up. Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC). Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.


Now, consider stronger forms of the negation of AC. For example, if we abbreviate by BP the claim that every set of real numbers has the <a href="property%20of%20Baire">property of Baire</a>, then BP is stronger than ¬AC, which asserts the nonexistence of any choice function on perhaps only a single set of nonempty sets. Note that strengthened negations may be compatible with weakened forms of AC. For example, ZF + DC + BP is consistent, if ZF is.

It is also consistent with ZF + DC that every set of reals is <a href="Lebesgue%20measurable">Lebesgue measurable</a>; however, this consistency result, due to <a href="Robert%20M.%20Solovay">Robert M. Solovay</a>, cannot be proved in ZFC itself, but requires a mild <a href="large%20cardinal">large cardinal</a> assumption (the existence of an <a href="inaccessible%20cardinal">inaccessible cardinal</a>). The much stronger <a href="axiom%20of%20determinacy">axiom of determinacy</a>, or AD, implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, and has the <a href="perfect%20set%20property">perfect set property</a> (all three of these results are refuted by AC itself). ZF + DC + AD is consistent provided that a sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom is consistent (the existence of infinitely many <a href="Woodin%20cardinal">Woodin cardinal</a>s).

There are models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false. We shall abbreviate "Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the negation of the axiom of choice" by ZF¬C. For certain models of ZF¬C, it is possible to prove the negation of some standard facts.
Note that any model of ZF¬C is also a model of ZF, so for each of the following statements, there exists a model of ZF in which that statement is true.


For proofs, see .


This is a joke: although the three are all mathematically equivalent, many mathematicians find the axiom of choice to be intuitive, the well-ordering principle to be counterintuitive, and Zorn's lemma to be too complex for any intuition.

The observation here is that one can define a function to select from an infinite number of pairs of shoes by stating for example, to choose a left shoe. Without the axiom of choice, one cannot assert that such a function exists for pairs of socks, because left and right socks are (presumably) indistinguishable.
Polish-American mathematician <a href="Jan%20Mycielski">Jan Mycielski</a> relates this anecdote in a 2006 article in the Notices of the AMS.
This quote comes from the famous <a href="April%20Fools%27%20Day">April Fools' Day</a> article in the "computer recreations" column of the "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>", April 1989.

Attila

Attila ( or ; <a href="fl.">fl.</a> <a href="circa">circa</a> 406–453), frequently referred to as Attila the Hun, was the ruler of the <a href="Huns">Huns</a> from 434 until his death in March 453. He was also the leader of a tribal empire consisting of <a href="Hun">Hun</a>s, <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a>, and <a href="Alans">Alans</a> among others, on the territory of <a href="Central%20and%20Eastern%20Europe">Central and Eastern Europe</a>.

During his reign, he was one of the most feared enemies of the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Eastern</a> Roman Empires. He crossed the Danube twice and plundered the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, but was unable to take <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. His unsuccessful campaign in <a href="Persia">Persia</a> was followed in 441 by an invasion of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, the success of which emboldened Attila to invade the West. He also attempted to conquer <a href="Roman%20Gaul">Roman Gaul</a> (modern France), crossing the Rhine in 451 and marching as far as Aurelianum (<a href="Orl%C3%A9ans">Orléans</a>) before being defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Catalaunian%20Plains">Battle of the Catalaunian Plains</a>.

He subsequently invaded <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, devastating the northern provinces, but was unable to take <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. He planned for further campaigns against the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> but died in 453. After Attila's death his close adviser <a href="Ardaric">Ardaric</a> of the <a href="Gepids">Gepids</a> led a Germanic revolt against Hunnic rule, after which the Hunnic Empire <a href="Battle%20of%20Nedao">quickly collapsed</a>.

There is no surviving first-hand account of Attila's appearance, but there is a possible second-hand source provided by <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a>, who cites a description given by <a href="Priscus">Priscus</a>.

Some modern scholars have suggested that this description is typically East Asian, because it has all the combined features that fit the physical type of people from Eastern Asia, and Attila's ancestors may have come from there.

The origin of the name "<a href="Attila%20%28name%29">Attila</a>" is unclear, and there is no consensus among scholars.

<a href="Otto%20J.%20Maenchen-Helfen">Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen</a> considered an <a href="East%20Germanic%20languages">East Germanic</a> origin; "Attila" is formed from <a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a> or <a href="Gepids">Gepidic</a> noun "atta", "father", by means of the diminutive suffix "-ila", meaning "little father". The Gothic etymology can be tracked up to <a href="Jacob%20Grimm">Jacob Grimm</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Grimm">Wilhelm Grimm</a> in the early 19th century. Maenchen-Helfen noted that Hunnic names were "not the true names of the Hun princes and lords. What we have are Hunnic names in Germanic dress, modified to fit the Gothic tongue, or popular Gothic etymologies, or both". <a href="Peter%20Heather">Peter Heather</a>, who strongly considered Germanic etymology of the name Attila and some of noble Huns, stated that the possibility Attila was of <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> ancestry cannot be ruled out. The names of Attila's brother <a href="Bleda">Bleda</a>, and most powerful minister <a href="Onegesius">Onegesius</a>, also have hypothetical Germanic etymology. Only credible Germanic etymology have Attila's blood relative <a href="Laudaricus">Laudaricus</a>, and certain Hun-Goth <a href="Ragnaris">Ragnaris</a>.

Hyun Jin Kim argued that the "Germanization of Hunnic names may have been a conscious policy among the Hunnic elite in the West in order to ease the transition to their rule of formerly independent German tribal unions". In the Western part of Hunnic Empire, where mostly lived subjected Gothic tribes, Huns probably spoke both <a href="Hunnic%20language">Hunnic</a> and Gothic language, and as such bore Germanized or Germanic name, like Laudaricus. Maenchen-Helfen also expressed concern over orthography of the writer, possible morphological change, that some names writers heard from the Goths, the tendency of Roman and Byzantine writers to alter foreign names, and manuscript corruption.

However, Kim noted that those names considered by Heather to be Gothic, especially in this case of Attila and Bleda, have more natural and probable <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic</a> etymology. Heather also ignored the fact that all <a href="List%20of%20Hunnic%20rulers">Hunnic rulers</a> before Attila, as well his father <a href="Mundzuk">Mundzuk</a>, paternal uncles <a href="Octar">Octar</a>, <a href="Rugila">Ruga</a> and Oebarsius, wife <a href="Kreka">Kreka</a>, father-in-law Eskam, and sons <a href="Ellac">Ellac</a>, <a href="Dengizich">Dengizich</a> and <a href="Ernak">Ernak</a>, have names of Turkic origin.

<a href="Omeljan%20Pritsak">Omeljan Pritsak</a> considered "̕Άττίλα" (Atilla) a composite title-name which derived from Turkic *"es" (great, old), and *"t il" (sea, ocean), and the suffix /a/. The stressed back syllabic "til" assimilated the front member "es", so it became *"as". It is a nominative, in form of "attíl-" (< *"etsíl" < *"es tíl") with the meaning "the oceanic, universal ruler". <a href="Peter%20Benjamin%20Golden">Peter Golden</a>, citing Pritsak, like László Rásonyi connected Attila's name with <a href="Menander">Menander</a> note in which used term "Attilan" as the name of the <a href="Volga%20River">Volga River</a> (Turkic "<a href="Atil">Atil/Itil</a>"; "great river"). <a href="J.J.%20Mikkola">J.J. Mikkola</a> connected it with Turkic "āt" (name, fame). Gerd Althoff considered it was related to Turkish "atli" (horseman, cavalier), or Turkish "at" (horse) and "dil" (tongue).

<a href="Tom%20Shippey">Tom Shippey</a> in his work "Goths and Huns: The Rediscovery of Northern Cultures in the Nineteenth Century" (1982), argued that the Gothic etymology is a product of 19th century Germanic <a href="Romanticism">romantic</a> philological revisionism.

M. Snædal casts doubt on the Germanic origin of the name Attila in a recently published article. "The Gothic origin of the name Attila is questionable," Snædal writes. "It is at least as likely to be of Hunnic origin". The article points out that the word "atta" is a migratory term for "father/forefather" common in multiple languages, including many Turkic languages (see <a href="Ata%20%28name%29">Ata</a>). The article also indicates that Attila's name could have originated from Turkic-<a href="Mongolian%20languages">Mongolian</a> "at, adyy/agta" (<a href="gelding">gelding</a>, <a href="Horses%20in%20warfare">warhorse</a>) and Turkish "atli" (horseman, cavalier), meaning "possessor of geldings, provider of warhorses", a suitable name for a warlord. He concludes: 

The name has many variants in several languages: Atli and Atle in <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a>; Etzel in <a href="Middle%20High%20German">Middle High German</a> (<a href="Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a>); Ætla in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a>; Attila, Atilla, and Etele in <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a> (Attila is the most popular); Attila, <a href="Atilla%20%28disambiguation%29">Atilla</a>, Atilay, or Atila in <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>; and Adil and Edil in <a href="Kazakh%20language">Kazakh</a> or Adil ("same/similar") or Edil ("to use") in <a href="Mongolian%20language">Mongolian</a>.

The historiography of Attila is faced with a major challenge, in that the only complete sources are written in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a> by the enemies of the Huns. Attila's contemporaries left many testimonials of his life, but only fragments of these remain. <a href="Priscus">Priscus</a> was a <a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Byzantine</a> diplomat and historian who wrote in Greek, and he was both a witness to and an actor in the story of Attila, as a member of the embassy of <a href="Theodosius%20II">Theodosius II</a> at the Hunnic court in 449. He was obviously biased by his political position, but his writing is a major source for information on the life of Attila, and he is the only person known to have recorded a physical description of him. He wrote a history of the late Roman Empire in eight books covering the period from 430 to 476.

Today we have only fragments of Priscus' work, but it was cited extensively by 6th-century historians <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a> and <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a>, especially in Jordanes' "<a href="Getica">The Origin and Deeds of the Goths</a>". It contains numerous references to Priscus's history, and it is also an important source of information about the Hunnic empire and its neighbors. He describes the legacy of Attila and the Hunnic people for a century after Attila's death. <a href="Marcellinus%20Comes">Marcellinus Comes</a>, a chancellor of <a href="Justinian">Justinian</a> during the same era, also describes the relations between the Huns and the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>.

Numerous ecclesiastical writings contain useful but scattered information, sometimes difficult to authenticate or distorted by years of hand-copying between the 6th and 17th centuries. The <a href="Hungary">Hungarian</a> writers of the 12th century wished to portray the Huns in a positive light as their glorious ancestors, and so repressed certain historical elements and added their own legends.

The literature and knowledge of the Huns themselves was transmitted orally, by means of epics and chanted poems that were handed down from generation to generation. Indirectly, fragments of this <a href="oral%20history">oral history</a> have reached us via the literature of the Scandinavians and Germans, neighbors of the Huns who wrote between the 9th and 13th centuries. Attila is a major character in many Medieval epics, such as the <a href="Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a>, as well as various <a href="Edda">Edda</a>s and <a href="saga">saga</a>s.

<a href="Archaeology">Archaeological</a> investigation has uncovered some details about the lifestyle, art, and warfare of the Huns. There are a few traces of battles and sieges, but today the tomb of Attila and the location of his capital have not yet been found.

The Huns were a group of <a href="Eurasian%20nomads">Eurasian nomads</a>, appearing from east of the <a href="Volga">Volga</a>, who migrated into Europe c. 370 and built up an enormous empire there. Their main military techniques were <a href="mounted%20archer">mounted archer</a>y and <a href="javelin">javelin</a> throwing. They were possibly the descendants of the <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> (Hsiung-nu) who <a href="History%20of%20the%20Han%20Dynasty">had been northern neighbors</a> of China three hundred years before and may be the first expansion of <a href="Turkic%20people">Turkic people</a> across <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. They were in the process of developing <a href="sedentism">settlements</a> before their arrival in Europe, yet the Huns were a society of pastoral warriors whose primary form of nourishment was meat and milk, products of their herds.

The origin and <a href="Hunnic%20language">language of the Huns</a> has been the subject of debate for centuries. According to some theories, their leaders at least may have spoken a <a href="Turkic%20language">Turkic language</a>, perhaps closest to the modern <a href="Chuvash%20language">Chuvash language</a>. One scholar suggests a relationship to <a href="Yeniseian">Yeniseian</a>. According to the "Encyclopedia of European Peoples", "the Huns, especially those who migrated to the west, may have been a combination of central Asian <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a>, <a href="Mongols">Mongolic</a>, and <a href="Ugric%20peoples">Ugric</a> stocks".

Attila's father <a href="Mundzuk">Mundzuk</a> was the brother of kings <a href="Octar">Octar</a> and <a href="Rugila">Ruga</a>, who reigned jointly over the Hunnic empire in the early fifth century. This form of <a href="diarchy">diarchy</a> was recurrent with the Huns, but historians are unsure whether it was institutionalized, merely customary, or an occasional occurrence. His family was from a noble lineage, but it is uncertain whether they constituted a royal <a href="dynasty">dynasty</a>. Attila's birthdate is debated, journalist <a href="%C3%89ric%20Deschodt">Éric Deschodt</a> and writer Herman Schreiber have proposed a date of 395. However, historian <a href="Iaroslav%20Lebedynsky">Iaroslav Lebedynsky</a> and archaeologist Katalin Escher prefer an estimate between the 390s and the first decade of the fifth century. Several historians have proposed 406 as the date.

Attila grew up in a rapidly changing world. His people were nomads who had only recently arrived in Europe. They crossed the <a href="Volga">Volga</a> river during the 370s and annexed the territory of the <a href="Alans">Alans</a>, then attacked the Gothic kingdom between the <a href="Carpathian%20mountains">Carpathian mountains</a> and the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. They were a very mobile people, whose mounted archers had acquired a reputation of invincibility, and the <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic tribes</a> seemed unable to withstand them. Vast populations fleeing the Huns moved from <a href="Germania">Germania</a> into the Roman Empire in the west and south, and along the banks of the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> and Danube. In 376, the Goths crossed the Danube, initially submitting to the Romans but soon rebelling against Emperor <a href="Valens">Valens</a>, whom they killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople">Battle of Adrianople</a> in 378. Large numbers of <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, Alans, <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>, and <a href="Burgundians">Burgundians</a> <a href="crossing%20of%20the%20Rhine">crossed the Rhine</a> and invaded Roman <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> on December 31, 406 to escape the Huns. The Roman Empire had been split in half since 395 and was ruled by two distinct governments, one based in <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a> in the West, and the other in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in the East. The Roman Emperors, both East and West, were generally from the <a href="Theodosian%20dynasty">Theodosian</a> family in Attila's lifetime (despite several power struggles).

The Huns dominated a vast territory with nebulous borders determined by the will of a constellation of ethnically varied peoples. Some were assimilated to Hunnic nationality, whereas many retained their own identities and rulers but acknowledged the <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> of the king of the Huns. The Huns were also the indirect source of many of the Romans' problems, driving various Germanic tribes into Roman territory, yet relations between the two empires were cordial: the Romans used the Huns as <a href="mercenary">mercenaries</a> against the Germans and even in their civil wars. Thus, the usurper <a href="Joannes">Joannes</a> was able to recruit thousands of Huns for his army against <a href="Valentinian%20III">Valentinian III</a> in 424. It was <a href="Flavius%20Aetius">Aëtius</a>, later Patrician of the West, who managed this operation. They exchanged ambassadors and hostages, the alliance lasting from 401 to 450 and permitting the Romans numerous military victories. The Huns considered the Romans to be paying them tribute, whereas the Romans preferred to view this as payment for services rendered. The Huns had become a great power by the time that Attila came of age during the reign of his uncle Ruga, to the point that <a href="Nestorius">Nestorius</a>, the Patriarch of Constantinople, deplored the situation with these words: "They have become both masters and slaves of the Romans".

The death of <a href="Rugila">Rugila</a> (also known as Rua or Ruga) in 434 left the sons of his brother <a href="Mundzuk">Mundzuk</a>, Attila and <a href="Bleda">Bleda</a>, in control of the united Hun tribes. At the time of the two brothers' accession, the Hun tribes were bargaining with Eastern Roman Emperor <a href="Theodosius%20II">Theodosius II</a>'s envoys for the return of several <a href="wikt%3Arenegade">renegades</a> who had taken refuge within the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>, possibly Hunnic nobles who disagreed with the brothers' assumption of leadership.

The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at <a href="Margus%20%28city%29">Margus</a> (<a href="Po%C5%BEarevac">Požarevac</a>), all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner, and negotiated an advantageous <a href="Treaty%20of%20Margus">treaty</a>. The Romans agreed to return the fugitives, to double their previous <a href="tribute">tribute</a> of 350 Roman pounds (c. 115 kg) of gold, to open their markets to Hunnish traders, and to pay a ransom of eight "<a href="solidus%20%28coin%29">solidi</a>" for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the Roman Empire and returned to their home in the <a href="Great%20Hungarian%20Plain">Great Hungarian Plain</a>, perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the <a href="walls%20of%20Constantinople">walls of Constantinople</a>, building the city's first <a href="sea%20wall">sea wall</a>, and to build up his border defenses along the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>.

The Huns remained out of Roman sight for the next few years while they invaded the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a>. They were defeated in <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> by the Sassanids, abandoned their invasion, and turned their attentions back to Europe. In 440, they reappeared in force on the borders of the Roman Empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been established by the treaty.

Crossing the Danube, they laid waste to the cities of <a href="Illyricum%20%28Roman%20province%29">Illyricum</a> and forts on the river, including (according to <a href="Priscus">Priscus</a>) <a href="Viminacium">Viminacium</a>, a city of <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a>. Their advance began at Margus, where they demanded that the Romans turn over a bishop who had retained property that Attila regarded as his. While the Romans discussed the bishop's fate, he slipped away secretly to the Huns and betrayed the city to them.

While the Huns attacked city-states along the Danube, the <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> (led by <a href="Geiseric">Geiseric</a>) captured the Western Roman province of Africa and its capital of <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>. Carthage was the richest province of the Western Empire and a main source of food for Rome. The <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid</a> <a href="Shah">Shah</a> <a href="Yazdegerd%20II%20of%20Persia">Yazdegerd II</a> invaded <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> in 441.

The Romans stripped the Balkan area of forces, sending them to Sicily in order to mount an expedition against the Vandals in Africa. This left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyricum into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army sacked Margus and Viminacium, and then took <a href="Singidunum">Singidunum</a> (<a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>) and <a href="Sirmium">Sirmium</a>. During 442, Theodosius recalled his troops from <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and ordered a large issue of new coins to finance operations against the Huns. He believed that he could defeat the Huns and refused the Hunnish kings' demands.

Attila responded with a campaign in 443. The Huns were equipped with new military weapons as they advanced along the Danube, such as <a href="battering%20ram">battering ram</a>s and rolling siege towers, and they overran the military centers of Ratiara and successfully besieged Naissus (<a href="Ni%C5%A1">Niš</a>).

Advancing along the <a href="Ni%C5%A1ava">Nišava River</a>, the Huns next took Serdica (<a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>), Philippopolis (<a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>), and Arcadiopolis (<a href="L%C3%BCleburgaz">Lüleburgaz</a>). They encountered and destroyed a Roman army outside Constantinople but were stopped by the double walls of the Eastern capital. They defeated a second army near Callipolis (<a href="Gelibolu">Gelibolu</a>).

Theodosius, stripped of his armed forces, admitted defeat, sending the "<a href="magister%20militum">Magister militum per Orientem</a>" <a href="Anatolius%20%28consul%20440%29">Anatolius</a> to negotiate peace terms. The terms were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (c. 2000 kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (c. 700 kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 "solidi".

Their demands were met for a time, and the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire. Bleda died following the Huns' withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around 445). Attila then took the throne for himself, becoming the sole ruler of the Huns.

In 447, Attila again rode south into the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> through <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a>. The <a href="Roman%20military%20history">Roman army</a>, under <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> "<a href="magister%20militum">magister militum</a>" Arnegisclus, met him in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Utus">Battle of the Utus</a> and was defeated, though not without inflicting heavy losses. The Huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the Balkans as far as <a href="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a>.

Constantinople itself was saved by the <a href="Isauria">Isauria</a>n troops of "<a href="magister%20militum%20per%20Orientem">magister militum per Orientem</a>" <a href="Zeno%20%28consul%20448%29">Zeno</a> and protected by the intervention of prefect <a href="Constantinus%20%28consul%20457%29">Constantinus</a>, who organized the reconstruction of the walls that had been previously damaged by earthquakes and, in some places, to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old. An account of this invasion survives:

In 450, Attila proclaimed his intent to attack the <a href="Visigoth">Visigoth</a> kingdom of <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> by making an <a href="military%20alliance">alliance</a> with Emperor <a href="Valentinian%20III">Valentinian III</a>. He had previously been on good terms with the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> and its influential general <a href="Flavius%20Aetius">Flavius Aëtius</a>. Aëtius had spent a brief <a href="exile">exile</a> among the Huns in 433, and the troops that Attila provided against the <a href="Goths">Goths</a> and <a href="Bagaudae">Bagaudae</a> had helped earn him the largely honorary title of "<a href="magister%20militum">magister militum</a>" in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of <a href="Geiseric">Geiseric</a>, who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila's plans.

However, Valentinian's sister was <a href="Justa%20Grata%20Honoria">Honoria</a>, who had sent the Hunnish king a plea for help—and her engagement ring—in order to escape her forced betrothal to a <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman senator</a> in the spring of 450. Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, but Attila chose to interpret her message as such. He accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as dowry.

When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of his mother <a href="Galla%20Placidia">Galla Placidia</a> convinced him to exile Honoria, rather than killing her. He also wrote to Attila, strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila sent an emissary to <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a> to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his.

Attila interfered in a succession struggle after the death of a Frankish ruler. Attila supported the elder son, while Aëtius supported the younger. (The location and identity of these kings is not known and subject to conjecture.) Attila gathered his <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s—<a href="Gepids">Gepids</a>, <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a>, <a href="Rugians">Rugians</a>, <a href="Scirians">Scirians</a>, <a href="Heruls">Heruls</a>, <a href="Thuringians">Thuringians</a>, <a href="Alans">Alans</a>, <a href="Burgundians">Burgundians</a>, among others–and began his march west. In 451, he arrived in <a href="Belgica">Belgica</a> with an army exaggerated by <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a> to half a million strong.

On April 7, he captured <a href="Metz">Metz</a>. Other cities attacked can be determined by the <a href="hagiographic">hagiographic</a> "<a href="biography">vitae</a>" written to commemorate their bishops: <a href="Nicasius%20of%20Rheims">Nicasius</a> was slaughtered before the altar of his church in <a href="Rheims">Rheims</a>; <a href="Servatus">Servatus</a> is alleged to have saved <a href="Tongeren">Tongeren</a> with his prayers, as Saint <a href="Genevieve">Genevieve</a> is said to have saved Paris. <a href="Lupus%20of%20Troyes">Lupus</a>, bishop of <a href="Troyes">Troyes</a>, is also credited with saving his city by meeting Attila in person.

Aëtius moved to oppose Attila, gathering troops from among the <a href="Franks">Franks</a>, the <a href="Burgundians">Burgundians</a>, and the <a href="Celts">Celts</a>. A mission by <a href="Avitus">Avitus</a> and Attila's continued westward advance convinced the Visigoth king <a href="Theodoric%20I">Theodoric I</a> (Theodorid) to ally with the Romans. The combined armies reached <a href="Orl%C3%A9ans">Orléans</a> ahead of Attila, thus checking and turning back the Hunnish advance. Aëtius gave chase and caught the Huns at a place usually assumed to be near Catalaunum (modern <a href="Ch%C3%A2lons-en-Champagne">Châlons-en-Champagne</a>). Attila decided to fight the Romans on plains where he could use his cavalry.

The two armies clashed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Catalaunian%20Plains">Battle of the Catalaunian Plains</a>, the outcome of which is commonly considered to be a strategic victory for the Visigothic-Roman alliance. Theodoric was killed in the fighting, and Aëtius failed to press his advantage, according to Edward Gibbon and Edward Creasy, because he feared the consequences of an overwhelming Visigothic triumph as much as he did a defeat. From Aëtius' point of view, the best outcome was what occurred: Theodoric died, Attila was in retreat and disarray, and the Romans had the benefit of appearing victorious.

Attila returned in 452 to renew his marriage claim with Honoria, invading and ravaging Italy along the way. Communities became established in what would later become <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venice</a> as a result of these attacks when the residents fled to small islands in the <a href="Venetian%20Lagoon">Venetian Lagoon</a>. His army sacked numerous cities and razed <a href="Sack%20of%20Aquileia">Aquileia</a> so completely that it was afterwards hard to recognize its original site. Aëtius lacked the strength to offer battle, but managed to harass and slow Attila's advance with only a shadow force. Attila finally halted at the <a href="Po%20River">River Po</a>. By this point, disease and starvation may have taken hold in Attila's camp, thus helping to stop his invasion.

Emperor <a href="Valentinian%20III">Valentinian III</a> sent three envoys, the high civilian officers <a href="Gennadius%20Avienus">Gennadius Avienus</a> and Trigetius, as well as the Bishop of Rome <a href="Pope%20Leo%20I">Leo I</a>, who met Attila at <a href="Mincio">Mincio</a> in the vicinity of <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> and obtained from him the promise that he would withdraw from Italy and negotiate peace with the Emperor. <a href="Prosper%20of%20Aquitaine">Prosper of Aquitaine</a> gives a short description of the historic meeting, but gives all the credit to Leo for the successful negotiation. Priscus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of <a href="Alaric%20I">Alaric</a> gave him pause—as Alaric died shortly after sacking Rome in 410.

Italy had suffered from a terrible famine in 451 and her crops were faring little better in 452. Attila's devastating invasion of the plains of northern Italy this year did not improve the harvest. To advance on Rome would have required supplies which were not available in Italy, and taking the city would not have improved Attila's supply situation. Therefore, it was more profitable for Attila to conclude peace and retreat back to his homeland.

Furthermore, an East Roman force had crossed the Danube under the command of another officer also named Aetius—who had participated in the <a href="Council%20of%20Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a> the previous year—and proceeded to defeat the Huns who had been left behind by Attila to safeguard their home territories. Attila, hence, faced heavy human and natural pressures to retire "from Italy without ever setting foot south of the <a href="Po%20%28river%29">Po</a>". As <a href="Hydatius">Hydatius</a> writes in his "Chronica Minora":

Marcian was the successor of Theodosius, and he had ceased paying tribute to the Huns in late 450 while Attila was occupied in the west. Multiple invasions by the Huns and others had left the Balkans with little to plunder.
After Attila left Italy and returned to his palace across the Danube, he planned to strike at Constantinople again and reclaim the tribute which Marcian had stopped. However, he died in the early months of 453.

The conventional account from Priscus says that Attila was at a feast celebrating his latest marriage, this time to the beautiful young <a href="Ildico">Ildico</a> (the name suggests <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> or <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoth</a> origins). In the midst of the revels, however, he suffered a severe <a href="Epistaxis">nosebleed</a> and choked to death in a stupor. An alternative theory is that he succumbed to <a href="internal%20bleeding">internal bleeding</a> after heavy drinking, possibly a condition called <a href="esophageal%20varices">esophageal varices</a>, where dilated veins in the lower part of the <a href="esophagus">esophagus</a> rupture leading to death by hemorrhage.

Another account of his death was first recorded 80 years after the events by Roman chronicler <a href="Marcellinus%20Comes">Marcellinus Comes</a>. It reports that "Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife". The "<a href="Volsunga%20saga">Volsunga saga</a>" and the "<a href="Poetic%20Edda">Poetic Edda</a>" claim that King Atli (Attila) died at the hands of his wife <a href="Gudrun">Gudrun</a>. Most scholars reject these accounts as no more than hearsay, preferring instead the account given by Attila's contemporary Priscus. Priscus' version, however, has recently come under renewed scrutiny by Michael A. Babcock. Based on detailed <a href="Philology">philological</a> analysis, Babcock concludes that the account of natural death given by Priscus was an ecclesiastical "cover story", and that Emperor Marcian (who ruled the Eastern Roman Empire from 450 to 457) was the political force behind Attila's death. Jordanes recounts:

Attila's sons <a href="Ellac">Ellac</a>, <a href="Dengizich">Dengizich</a> and <a href="Ernak">Ernak</a>, ""in their rash eagerness to rule they all alike destroyed his empire"". They "were clamoring that the nations should be divided among them equally and that warlike kings with their peoples should be apportioned to them by lot like a family estate". Against the treatment as "slaves of the basest condition" a Germanic alliance led by the Gepid ruler <a href="Ardaric">Ardaric</a> (who was noted for great loyalty to Attila) revolted and fought with the Huns in Pannonia in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nedao">Battle of Nedao</a> 454 AD. Attila's eldest son Ellac was killed in that battle. Attila's sons "regarding the Goths as deserters from their rule, came against them as though they were seeking fugitive slaves", attacked Ostrogothic co-ruler <a href="Valamir">Valamir</a> (who also fought alongside Ardaric and Attila at the Catalaunian Plains), but were repelled, and some group of Huns moved to Scythia (probably those of Ernak). His brother Dengizich attempted a renewed invasion across the Danube in 468 AD, but was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bassianae">Battle of Bassianae</a> by the Ostrogoths. Dengizich was killed by Roman-Gothic general <a href="Anagast">Anagast</a> the following year, after which the Hunnic dominion ended.

Attila's many children and relatives are known by name and some even by deeds, but soon valid genealogical sources all but dried up, and there seems to be no verifiable way to trace Attila's descendants. This has not stopped many genealogists from attempting to reconstruct a <a href="descent%20from%20antiquity">valid line of descent</a> for various medieval rulers. One of the most credible claims has been that of the "<a href="Nominalia%20of%20the%20Bulgarian%20khans">Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans</a>" for mythological <a href="Avitohol">Avitohol</a> and <a href="Ernak">Irnik</a> from the <a href="Dulo%20clan">Dulo clan</a> of the <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a>.

Attila himself is said to have claimed the titles "Descendant of the Great <a href="Nimrod">Nimrod</a>", and "King of the Huns, the Goths, the <a href="Danes">Danes</a>, and the <a href="Medes">Medes</a>"—the last two peoples being mentioned to show the extent of his control over subject nations even on the peripheries of his domain.

<a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a> embellished the report of <a href="Priscus">Priscus</a>, reporting that Attila had possessed the "Holy War Sword of the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a>", which was given to him by <a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars</a> and made him a "prince of the entire world".

By the end of the 12th century the royal court of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Hungary</a> proclaimed their descent from Attila. <a href="Lampert%20of%20Hersfeld">Lampert of Hersfeld</a>'s contemporary chronicles report that shortly before the year 1071, the <a href="Sword%20of%20Attila">Sword of Attila</a> had been presented to <a href="Otto%20of%20Nordheim">Otto of Nordheim</a> by the exiled queen of Hungary, <a href="Anastasia%20of%20Kiev">Anastasia of Kiev</a>. This sword, a cavalry <a href="sabre">sabre</a> now in the <a href="Kunsthistorisches%20Museum">Kunsthistorisches Museum</a> in Vienna, appears to be the work of Hungarian goldsmiths of the ninth or tenth century.

An anonymous chronicler of the medieval period represented the meeting of Pope Leo and Atilla as attended also by <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a> and <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">Saint Paul</a>, "a miraculous tale calculated to meet the taste of the time" This apotheosis was later portrayed artistically by the Renaissance artist <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> and sculptor <a href="Algardi">Algardi</a>, whom eighteenth-century historian <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a> praised for establishing "one of the noblest legends of ecclesiastical tradition".

According to a version of this narrative related in the <a href="Chronicon%20Pictum">Chronicon Pictum</a>, a mediaeval Hungarian chronicle, the Pope promised Attila that if he left Rome in peace, one of his successors would receive a holy crown (which has been understood as referring to the <a href="Holy%20Crown%20of%20Hungary">Holy Crown of Hungary</a>).

Some histories and chronicles describe him as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three Norse <a href="sagas">sagas</a>: "<a href="Atlakvi%C3%B0a">Atlakviða</a>", "<a href="Volsunga%20saga">Volsunga saga</a>", and "<a href="Atlam%C3%A1l">Atlamál</a>". The "Polish Chronicle" represents Attila's name as "Aquila".

<a href="Frutolf%20of%20Michelsberg">Frutolf of Michelsberg</a> and <a href="Otto%20of%20Freising">Otto of Freising</a> pointed out that some songs as "vulgar fables" made <a href="Theoderic%20the%20Great">Theoderic the Great</a>, Attila and <a href="Ermanaric">Ermanaric</a> contemporaries, when any reader of Jordanes knew that <a href="anachronism">this was not the case</a>.

In 1812, <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> conceived the idea of writing an opera about Attila and approached <a href="August%20von%20Kotzebue">August von Kotzebue</a> to write the libretto. It was, however, never written.

In World War I, Allied propaganda referred to Germans as the "<a href="List%20of%20terms%20used%20for%20Germans%23Hun">Huns</a>", based on a 1900 speech by <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Emperor Wilhelm II</a> praising Attila the Hun's military prowess, according to <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>'s "<a href="Glimpses%20of%20World%20History">Glimpses of World History</a>". "<a href="Der%20Spiegel">Der Spiegel</a>" commented on November 6, 1948, that the <a href="Sword%20of%20Attila">Sword of Attila</a> was hanging menacingly over <a href="Austria">Austria</a>.

American writer <a href="Cecelia%20Holland">Cecelia Holland</a> wrote "The Death of Attila" (1973), a historical novel in which Attila appears as a powerful background figure whose life and death deeply impact the protagonists, a young Hunnic warrior and a Germanic one.

In modern <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> and in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, "Attila" and its Turkish variation "Atilla" are commonly used as a male first name. In Hungary, several public places are named after Attila; for instance, in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> there are 10 Attila Streets, one of which is an important street behind the <a href="Buda%20Castle">Buda Castle</a>. When the <a href="Turkish%20Armed%20Forces">Turkish Armed Forces</a> invaded <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> in 1974, the operations were named after Attila ("The Attila Plan").

The 1954 <a href="Universal%20International">Universal International</a> film "<a href="Sign%20of%20the%20Pagan">Sign of the Pagan</a>" starred <a href="Jack%20Palance">Jack Palance</a> as Attila.

Aegean Sea

The Aegean Sea (; ; ) is an elongated embayment of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> located between the <a href="Geography%20of%20Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>n <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>s, i.e., between the mainlands of <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. In the north, it is connected to the <a href="Marmara%20Sea">Marmara Sea</a> and <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> by the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> and <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a>. The <a href="Aegean%20Islands">Aegean Islands</a> are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including <a href="Crete">Crete</a> and <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>.

The sea was traditionally known as "<a href="Archipelago">the Archipelago</a>" (in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>, "Αρχιπέλαγος", meaning "chief sea"), but in English the meaning of Archipelago has changed to refer to the Aegean Islands and, generally, to any island group.

In ancient times, there were various explanations for the name "Aegean". It was said to have been named after the Greek town of <a href="Aegae%20%28Achaea%29">Aegae</a>, or after <a href="Aegea">Aegea</a>, a queen of the <a href="Amazons">Amazons</a> who died in the sea, or Aigaion, the "sea goat", another name of <a href="Briareus">Briareus</a>, one of the archaic <a href="Hecatonchires">Hecatonchires</a>, or, especially among the Athenians, <a href="Aegeus">Aegeus</a>, the father of <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a>, who drowned himself in the sea when he thought his son had died.

A possible etymology is a derivation from the Greek word "" – "aiges" = ""waves"" (<a href="Hesychius%20of%20Alexandria">Hesychius of Alexandria</a>; metaphorical use of ("aix") "goat"), hence "wavy sea", cf. also (aigialos = aiges "(waves)" + hals "(sea)"), hence meaning "sea-shore".

The <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetians</a>, who ruled many Greek islands in the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High</a> and <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>, popularized the name "Archipelago" (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> for "main sea" or "chief sea"), a name that held on in many European countries until the early modern period.

In some South Slavic languages the Aegean is often called "White Sea" ("Belo more" in Serbian, "Бело море" in Macedonian and Бяло море "Byalo more" in Bulgarian).

The Aegean Sea covers about in area, and measures about longitudinally and latitudinally. The sea's maximum depth is , east of Crete. The <a href="Aegean%20Islands">Aegean Islands</a> are found within its waters, with the following islands delimiting the sea on the south (generally from west to east): <a href="Kythera">Kythera</a>, <a href="Antikythera">Antikythera</a>, <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, <a href="Kasos">Kasos</a>, <a href="Karpathos">Karpathos</a> and <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>.

The Aegean Islands, which almost all belong to Greece, can be divided into seven groups:

The word "<a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>" was originally applied specifically to the Aegean Sea and its islands. Many of the Aegean Islands, or chains of islands, are actually extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to <a href="Chios">Chios</a>, another extends across <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> to <a href="Samos">Samos</a>, and a third extends across the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> and Crete to Rhodes, dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean.

The bays and gulfs of the Aegean beginning at the South and moving clockwise include on Crete, the <a href="Mirabello%20Bay">Mirabello</a>, <a href="Almyros%20Bay">Almyros</a>, <a href="Souda%20Bay">Souda</a> and <a href="Gulf%20of%20Chania">Chania</a> bays or gulfs, on the mainland the <a href="Myrtoan%20Sea">Myrtoan Sea</a> to the west with the <a href="Argolic%20Gulf">Argolic Gulf</a>, the <a href="Saronic%20Gulf">Saronic Gulf</a> northwestward, the <a href="Petalies%20Gulf">Petalies Gulf</a> which connects with the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Euboea">South Euboic Sea</a>, the <a href="Pagasetic%20Gulf">Pagasetic Gulf</a> which connects with the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Euboea">North Euboic Sea</a>, the <a href="Thermian%20Gulf">Thermian Gulf</a> northwestward, the <a href="Chalkidiki">Chalkidiki</a> Peninsula including the <a href="Cassandra%20Gulf">Cassandra</a> and the <a href="Singitic%20Gulf">Singitic Gulf</a>s, northward the <a href="Strymonian%20Gulf">Strymonian Gulf</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Kavala">Gulf of Kavala</a> and the rest are in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>; <a href="Saros%20Gulf">Saros Gulf</a>, <a href="Edremit%20%28District%29%2C%20Bal%C4%B1kesir">Edremit</a> Gulf, Dikili Gulf, <a href="Gulf%20of%20%C3%87andarl%C4%B1">Gulf of Çandarlı</a>, <a href="Gulf%20of%20%C4%B0zmir">Gulf of İzmir</a>, <a href="Gulf%20of%20Ku%C5%9Fadas%C4%B1">Gulf of Kuşadası</a>, <a href="Gulf%20of%20G%C3%B6kova">Gulf of Gökova</a>, <a href="G%C3%BCll%C3%BCk">Güllük</a> Gulf.

The <a href="International%20Hydrographic%20Organization">International Hydrographic Organization</a> defines the limits of the Aegean Sea as follows:

"On the South." A line running from Cape Aspro (28°16'E) in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, to Cum Burnù (Capo della Sabbia) the Northeast extreme of the Island of <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, through the island to Cape <a href="Prasonisi">Prasonisi</a>, the Southwest point thereof, on to Vrontos Point (35°33'N) in Skarpanto <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Karpathos">Karpathos</a><nowiki>]</nowiki>, through this island to Castello Point, the South extreme thereof, across to Cape Plaka (East extremity of Crete), through Crete to Agria Grabusa, the Northwest extreme thereof, thence to Cape Apolitares in <a href="Antikythera">Antikithera</a> Island, through the island to Psira Rock (off the Northwest point) and across to Cape Trakhili in <a href="Kythira">Kithera</a> Island, through Kithera to the Northwest point (Cape Karavugia) and thence to Cape Santa Maria () in the <a href="Morea">Morea</a>.
<br><br>"In the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>". A line joining Kum Kale (26°11'E) and <a href="Cape%20Helles">Cape Helles</a>.

Aegean surface water circulates in a counter-clockwise <a href="Ocean%20gyre">gyre</a>, with <a href="hypersaline">hypersaline</a> Mediterranean water moving northward along the west coast of <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, before being displaced by less dense <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> outflow. The dense <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> water sinks below the Black Sea inflow to a depth of , then flows through the <a href="Dardanelles%20Strait">Dardanelles Strait</a> and into the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a> at velocities of 5–15 cm/s. The Black Sea outflow moves westward along the northern Aegean Sea, then flows southwards along the east coast of Greece.

The physical oceanography of the Aegean Sea is controlled mainly by the regional climate, the fresh water discharge from major rivers draining southeastern Europe, and the seasonal variations in the Black Sea surface water outflow through the <a href="Dardanelles%20Strait">Dardanelles Strait</a>.

Analysis of the Aegean during 1991 and 1992 revealed 3 distinct water masses:


The current coastline dates back to about 4000 BC. Before that time, at the peak of the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last ice age</a> (c. 16,000 BC) sea levels everywhere <a href="sea%20level%20rise">were 130 metres lower</a>, and there were large well-watered coastal plains instead of much of the northern Aegean. When they were first occupied, the present-day islands including <a href="Milos">Milos</a> with its important <a href="obsidian">obsidian</a> production were probably still connected to the mainland. The present coastal arrangement appeared c. 7000 BC, with post-ice age sea levels continuing to rise for another 3,000 years after that.

The subsequent <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> civilizations of <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and the Aegean Sea have given rise to the general term "<a href="Aegean%20civilization">Aegean civilization</a>". In ancient times, the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations – the <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoans</a> of Crete and the <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Myceneans</a> of the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>.
Later arose the city-states of <a href="Athens">Athens</a> and <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> among many others that constituted the <a href="Athenian%20Empire">Athenian Empire</a> and <a href="Hellenic%20Civilization">Hellenic Civilization</a>. <a href="Plato">Plato</a> described the Greeks living round the Aegean "like frogs around a pond". The Aegean Sea was later invaded by the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persians</a> and the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Romans</a>, and inhabited by the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Romans (Byzantines)</a>, the <a href="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a>, the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetians</a>, the <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoese</a>, the <a href="Seljuq%20Turks">Seljuq Turks</a>, and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottomans</a>. The Aegean was the site of the original <a href="democracy">democracies</a>, and its seaways were the means of contact among several diverse civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean.

In the 21st century, the northern Aegean Sea became one of the main scenes of the <a href="European%20migrant%20crisis">Refugee crisis</a> as over 1 million <a href="Syrians">Syrians</a>, <a href="Iraqis">Iraqis</a> and <a href="Afghans">Afghans</a> fled wars and poverty in their countries and attempted to cross the Sea from Turkey to Greece (an <a href="EU">EU</a> member state).

Many of the islands in the Aegean have safe harbours and bays. In ancient times, navigation through the sea was easier than travelling across the rough terrain of the Greek mainland (and to some extent the coastal areas of Anatolia). Many of the islands are <a href="Volcano">volcanic</a>, and <a href="marble">marble</a> and <a href="iron">iron</a> are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains. Of the main islands in the Aegean Sea, two belong to <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> – <a href="Bozcaada">Bozcaada</a> (<a href="Tenedos">Tenedos</a> "<a href="%CE%A4%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%82">Τένεδος</a>") and <a href="G%C3%B6k%C3%A7eada">Gökçeada</a> (<a href="Imbros">Imbros</a> "<a href="%CE%8A%CE%BC%CE%B2%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82">Ίμβρος</a>"); the rest belong to <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. Between the two countries, there are <a href="Aegean%20dispute">political disputes</a> over several aspects of political control over the Aegean space, including the size of territorial waters, air control and the <a href="delimitation">delimitation</a> of economic rights to the <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>.

A Clockwork Orange (novel)

A Clockwork Orange is a <a href="Dystopian%20fiction">dystopian</a> novel by <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> published in 1962. Set in a near future <a href="England">English</a> society featuring a subculture of extreme youth violence, the teenage protagonist, Alex, narrates his violent exploits and his experiences with state authorities intent on reforming him. The book is partially written in a <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>-influenced <a href="argot">argot</a> called "<a href="Nadsat">Nadsat</a>". According to Burgess it was a "<a href="wikt%3Ajeu%20d%27esprit">jeu d'esprit</a>" written in just three weeks.

In 2005, "A Clockwork Orange" was included on "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, and it was named by <a href="Modern%20Library">Modern Library</a> and its readers as one of the <a href="Modern%20Library%20100%20Best%20Novels">100 best English-language novels of the 20th century</a>. The original manuscript of the book has been located at <a href="McMaster%20University">McMaster University</a>'s <a href="William%20Ready%20Division%20of%20Archives%20and%20Research%20Collections">William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections</a> in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, Canada since the institution purchased the documents in 1971.

<a href="Alex%20%28A%20Clockwork%20Orange%29">Alex</a> is a 15-year-old living in near-future dystopian England who leads his gang on a night of opportunistic, random "ultra-violence". Alex's friends ("droogs" in the novel's Anglo-Russian <a href="slang">slang</a>, '<a href="Nadsat">Nadsat</a>') are Dim, a slow-witted bruiser who is the gang's muscle; Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence. Characterised as a <a href="Antisocial%20personality%20disorder">sociopath</a> and a hardened juvenile delinquent, Alex also displays intelligence, quick wit, and a predilection for <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a>; he is particularly fond of <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, referred to as "Lovely Ludwig Van".

The novella begins with the droogs sitting in their favourite hangout, the <a href="Korova%20Milk%20Bar">Korova Milk Bar</a>, and drinking "milk-plus" — a beverage consisting of milk laced with the customer's drug of choice — to prepare for a night of mayhem. They <a href="assault">assault</a> a scholar walking home from the public library; rob a store, leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious; beat up a beggar; then scuffle with a rival gang. <a href="Joyride%20%28crime%29">Joyriding</a> through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and terrorise the young couple living there, beating the husband and <a href="rape">raping</a> his wife. In a <a href="metafiction">metafiction</a>al touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called ""A Clockwork Orange"", and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript. Back at the Korova, Alex strikes Dim for his crude response to a woman's singing of an operatic passage, and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his parents' futuristic flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume, which he describes as giving him orgasmic bliss before falling asleep.

Alex coyly feigns illness to his parents to stay out of school the next day. Following an unexpected visit from P.R. Deltoid, his "post-corrective adviser", Alex visits a record store, where he meets two pre-teen girls. He invites them back to the flat, where he drugs and rapes them. The next morning, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood, waiting downstairs in the torn-up and graffitied lobby. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a "man-sized" job. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie, then in a show of generosity, takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy elderly woman. Alex breaks in and knocks the woman unconscious, but when he opens the door to let the others in, Dim strikes him in payback for the earlier fight. The gang abandons Alex on the front step to be arrested by the police; while in their custody, he learns that the woman has died from her injuries.

Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison (Pete visiting one day informed him that Georgie has been killed in a botched robbery). Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels playing religious music on the stereo to accompany the Sunday religious services. The chaplain mistakes Alex's <a href="Bible">Bible</a> studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent passages. After his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted. The technique is a form of <a href="aversion%20therapy">aversion therapy</a>, in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence. As an <a href="unintended%20consequence">unintended consequence</a>, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.

The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of VIPs, who watch as Alex collapses before a bully and abases himself before a scantily-clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations. Although the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will, the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released from prison.

Alex returns to his parents' flat, only to find that they are renting his room to a lodger. Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for committing suicide. The old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends. Two policemen come to Alex's rescue, but turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader. They take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there. Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1. The writer, F. Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the gang-rape. He does not recognise Alex, but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone. Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers. He attempts suicide by leaping from the window.

Alex wakes up in a hospital, where he is courted by government officials anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt. With Alexander placed in a <a href="mental%20institution">mental institution</a>, Alex is offered a well-paying job if he agrees to side with the government. A round of tests reveals that his old violent impulses have returned, indicating that the hospital doctors have undone the effects of his conditioning. As photographers snap pictures, Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and reflects, "I was cured all right."

In the final chapter, Alex finds himself halfheartedly preparing for yet another night of crime with a new gang (Lenn, Rick, Bully). After a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of senseless violence. He begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own, while reflecting on the notion that his own children will be just as destructive as he has been, if not more so.

The book has three parts, each with seven chapters. Burgess has stated that the total of 21 chapters was an intentional nod to the age of 21 being recognised as a milestone in <a href="Maturity%20%28psychological%29">human maturation</a>. The 21st chapter was omitted from the editions published in the United States prior to 1986. In the introduction to the updated American text (these newer editions include the missing 21st chapter), Burgess explains that when he first brought the book to an American publisher, he was told that U.S. audiences would never go for the final chapter, in which Alex sees the error of his ways, decides he has lost all energy for and thrill from violence and resolves to turn his life around (a moment of <a href="Metanoia%20%28psychology%29">metanoia</a>).

At the American publisher's insistence, Burgess allowed their editors to cut the redeeming final chapter from the U.S. version, so that the tale would end on a darker note, with Alex succumbing to his violent, reckless nature—an ending which the publisher insisted would be "more realistic" and appealing to a U.S. audience. The film adaptation, directed by <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, is based on the American edition of the book (which Burgess considered to be "badly flawed"). Kubrick called Chapter 21 "an extra chapter" and claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, and that he had never given serious consideration to using it. In Kubrick's opinion—as in the opinion of other readers, including the original American editor—the final chapter was unconvincing and inconsistent with the book.


"A Clockwork Orange" was written in <a href="Hove">Hove</a>, then a senescent <a href="seaside%20town">seaside town</a>. Burgess had arrived back in Britain after his stint abroad to see that much had changed. A youth culture had grown, including coffee bars, pop music and teenage gangs. England was gripped by fears over <a href="juvenile%20delinquency">juvenile delinquency</a>. Burgess claimed that the novel's inspiration was his first wife Lynne's beating by a gang of drunk American servicemen stationed in England during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. She subsequently miscarried. In its investigation of free will, the book's target is ostensibly the concept of <a href="behaviourism">behaviourism</a>, pioneered by such figures as <a href="B.%20F.%20Skinner">B. F. Skinner</a>.

Burgess later stated that he wrote the book in three weeks.

Burgess gave three possible origins for the title:


In his essay "Clockwork Oranges," Burgess asserts that "this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of <a href="Ivan%20Pavlov">Pavlovian</a> or mechanical laws to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and sweetness." This title alludes to the protagonist's negative emotional responses to feelings of evil which prevent the exercise of his <a href="free%20will">free will</a> subsequent to the administration of the Ludovico Technique. To induce this conditioning, Alex is forced to watch scenes of violence on a screen that are <a href="Operant%20conditioning">systematically paired</a> with negative physical stimulation. The negative physical stimulation takes the form of <a href="nausea">nausea</a> and "feelings of terror," which are caused by an <a href="emesis">emetic</a> medicine administered just before the presentation of the films.

The book, narrated by Alex, contains many words in a slang argot which Burgess invented for the book, called <a href="Nadsat">Nadsat</a>. It is a mix of modified <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> words, <a href="rhyming%20slang">rhyming slang</a>, derived Russian (like "baboochka"), and words invented by Burgess himself. For instance, these terms have the following meanings in Nadsat: "droog" = friend; "korova" = cow; "gulliver" ("golova") = head; "malchick" or "malchickiwick" = boy; "soomka" = sack or bag; "Bog" = God; "khorosho" ("horrorshow") = good; "prestoopnick" = criminal; "rooka" ("rooker") = hand; "cal" = crap; "veck" ("chelloveck") = man or guy; "litso" = face; "malenky" = little; and so on. Compare <a href="Polari">Polari</a>.

One of Alex's doctors explains the language to a colleague as "odd bits of old rhyming slang; a bit of <a href="Romani%20people">gypsy</a> talk, too. But most of the roots are Slav propaganda. <a href="Subliminal%20message">Subliminal</a> penetration." Some words are not derived from anything, but merely easy to guess, e.g. "in-out, in-out" or "the old in-out" means sexual intercourse. "Cutter", however, means "money", because "cutter" rhymes with "bread-and-butter"; this is <a href="rhyming%20slang">rhyming slang</a>, which is intended to be impenetrable to outsiders (especially eavesdropping policemen). Additionally, slang like "appypolly loggy" ("apology") seems to derive from school boy slang. This reflects Alex's age of 15.

In the first edition of the book, no key was provided, and the reader was left to interpret the meaning from the context. In his appendix to the restored edition, Burgess explained that the slang would keep the book from seeming dated, and served to muffle "the raw response of pornography" from the acts of violence.

The term "ultraviolence", referring to excessive or unjustified <a href="violence">violence</a>, was <a href="Neologism">coined</a> by Burgess in the book, which includes the phrase "do the ultra-violent". The term's association with <a href="Aestheticization%20of%20violence">aesthetic violence</a> has led to its use in the media.

In 1976, "A Clockwork Orange" was removed from an <a href="Aurora%2C%20Colorado">Aurora, Colorado</a> high school because of "objectionable language". A year later in 1977 it was removed from high school classrooms in <a href="Westport%2C%20Massachusetts">Westport, Massachusetts</a> over similar concerns with "objectionable" language. In 1982, it was removed from two <a href="Anniston%2C%20Alabama">Anniston, Alabama</a> libraries, later to be reinstated on a restricted basis. Also, in 1973 a bookseller was arrested for selling the novel. Charges were later dropped. However, each of these instances came after the release of Stanley Kubrick's popular 1971 film adaptation of "A Clockwork Orange", itself the subject of much controversy.

In 1985, Burgess published "Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence", and while discussing "<a href="Lady%20Chatterley%27s%20Lover">Lady Chatterley's Lover</a>" in his biography, Burgess compared that novel's notoriety with "A Clockwork Orange": "We all suffer from the popular desire to make the known notorious. The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel I am prepared to repudiate: written a quarter of a century ago, a "jeu d'esprit" knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and "Lady Chatterley's Lover"." Burgess has also dismissed "A Clockwork Orange" as "too didactic to be artistic".


"A Clockwork Orange" was chosen by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine as one of the 100 best <a href="English%20language">English-language</a> books from 1923 to 2005.

The best known adaptation of the novella to other forms is the 1971 film "<a href="A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28film%29">A Clockwork Orange</a>" by <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, starring <a href="Malcolm%20McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a> as Alex.

A 1965 film by <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> entitled "<a href="Vinyl%20%281965%20film%29">Vinyl</a>" was an adaptation of Burgess' novel.

In 1987 Burgess published a stage play titled "A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music". The play includes songs, written by Burgess, that are inspired by Beethoven and Nadsat slang.

In 1988, a German adaptation of "A Clockwork Orange" at the intimate theatre of <a href="Bad%20Godesberg">Bad Godesberg</a> featured a musical score by the German <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> band <a href="Die%20Toten%20Hosen">Die Toten Hosen</a> which, combined with orchestral clips of <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven's</a> <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Ninth Symphony</a> and "other dirty melodies" (so stated by the subtitle), was released on the album "<a href="Ein%20kleines%20bisschen%20Horrorschau">Ein kleines bisschen Horrorschau</a>". The track "<a href="Hier%20kommt%20Alex">Hier kommt Alex</a>" became one of the band's signature songs.
In February 1990, another musical version was produced at the Barbican Theatre in <a href="London">London</a> by the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a>. Titled "A Clockwork Orange: 2004", it received mostly negative reviews, with <a href="John%20Peter%20%28critic%29">John Peter</a> of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" of London calling it "only an intellectual "<a href="Rocky%20Horror%20Show">Rocky Horror Show</a>"", and John Gross of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</a>" calling it "a clockwork lemon". Even Burgess himself, who wrote the script based on his novel, was disappointed. According to "<a href="The%20Evening%20Standard">The Evening Standard</a>", he called the score, written by <a href="Bono">Bono</a> and <a href="The%20Edge">The Edge</a> of the rock group <a href="U2%20%28band%29">U2</a>, "neo-wallpaper." Burgess had originally worked alongside the director of the production, Ron Daniels, and envisioned a musical score that was entirely classical. Unhappy with the decision to abandon that score, he heavily criticised the band's experimental mix of <a href="hip%20hop">hip hop</a>, <a href="liturgy">liturgical</a> and <a href="gothic%20music">gothic music</a>. Lise Hand of "<a href="The%20Irish%20Independent">The Irish Independent</a>" reported The Edge as saying that Burgess' original conception was "a score written by a novelist rather than a songwriter". Calling it "meaningless glitz", Jane Edwardes of "20/20 Magazine" said that watching this production was "like being invited to an expensive French Restaurant – and being served with a <a href="Big%20Mac">Big Mac</a>."

In 1994, Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater put on a production of "A Clockwork Orange" directed by <a href="Terry%20Kinney">Terry Kinney</a>. The American premiere of novelist Anthony Burgess' own adaptation of his "A Clockwork Orange" starred <a href="K.%20Todd%20Freeman">K. Todd Freeman</a> as Alex. In 2001, UNI Theatre (Mississauga, Ontario) presented the Canadian premiere of the play under the direction of Terry Costa.

In 2002, Godlight Theatre Company presented the New York Premiere adaptation of "A Clockwork Orange" at <a href="Manhattan%20Theatre%20Source">Manhattan Theatre Source</a>. The production went on to play at the SoHo Playhouse (2002), Ensemble Studio Theatre (2004), 59E59 Theaters (2005) and the <a href="Edinburgh%20Fringe">Edinburgh Festival Fringe</a> (2005). While at <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, the production received rave reviews from the press while playing to sold-out audiences. The production was directed by Godlight's Artistic Director, Joe Tantalo.

In 2003, Los Angeles director <a href="Brad%20Mays">Brad Mays</a> and the <a href="ARK%20Theatre%20Company">ARK Theatre Company</a> staged a <a href="multi-media">multi-media</a> adaptation of "A Clockwork Orange", which was named "Pick Of The Week" by the "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>" and nominated for three of the 2004 <a href="LA%20Weekly%20Theater%20Award">LA Weekly Theater Award</a>s: Direction, Revival Production (of a 20th-century work), and Leading Female Performance. <a href="Vanessa%20Claire%20Smith">Vanessa Claire Smith</a> won Best Actress for her gender-bending portrayal of <a href="Alex%20%28A%20Clockwork%20Orange%29">Alex</a>, the music-loving teenage <a href="Antisocial%20personality%20disorder">sociopath</a>. This production utilised three separate video streams outputted to seven onstage video monitors – six 19-inch and one 40-inch. In order to preserve the first-person narrative of the book, a pre-recorded video stream of Alex, "your humble narrator", was projected onto the 40-inch monitor, thereby freeing the onstage character during passages which would have been awkward or impossible to sustain in the breaking of the fourth wall.

An adaptation of the work, based on the original novel, the film and Burgess' own stage version, was performed by The SiLo Theatre in Auckland, New Zealand in early 2007.

Amsterdam

Amsterdam (; ) is the <a href="Capital%20of%20the%20Netherlands">capital</a> and <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20the%20Netherlands">most populous municipality</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a>. Its status as the capital is mandated by the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Constitution of the Netherlands</a>, although it is not the seat of the government, which is <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>. Amsterdam has a population of 851,373 within the <a href="city%20proper">city proper</a>, 1,351,587 in the urban area, and 2,410,960 in the <a href="Amsterdam%20metropolitan%20area">Amsterdam metropolitan area</a>. The city is located in the <a href="Provinces%20of%20the%20Netherlands">province</a> of <a href="North%20Holland">North Holland</a> in the west of the country. The metropolitan area comprises much of the northern part of the <a href="Randstad">Randstad</a>, one of the larger <a href="conurbation">conurbation</a>s in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million.

Amsterdam's name derives from "Amstelredamme", indicative of the city's origin around a dam in the river <a href="Amstel">Amstel</a>. Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Dutch Golden Age</a> (17th century), a result of its innovative developments in trade. During that time, the city was the leading centre for finance and diamonds. In the 19th and 20th centuries the city expanded, and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century <a href="canals%20of%20Amsterdam">canals of Amsterdam</a> and the 19–20th century <a href="Stelling%20van%20Amsterdam">Defence Line of Amsterdam</a> are on the <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage List</a>. Since the annexation of municipality Sloten in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam, the oldest historic part of the city lies in <a href="Sloten%2C%20Amsterdam">Sloten</a> (9th century).

As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an <a href="Global%20city">alpha world city</a> by the <a href="Globalization%20and%20World%20Cities%20Research%20Network">Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) study group</a>. The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands. Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters there, and seven of the world's 500 largest companies, including <a href="Philips">Philips</a> and <a href="ING%20Group">ING</a>, are based in the city. In 2012, Amsterdam was ranked the second best city to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and 12th globally on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer. The city was ranked 3rd in innovation by Australian innovation agency 2thinknow in their Innovation Cities Index 2009. The <a href="Port%20of%20Amsterdam">Amsterdam seaport</a> to this day remains the second in the country, and the fifth largest seaport in Europe.

Famous Amsterdam residents include the diarist <a href="Anne%20Frank">Anne Frank</a>, artists <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt van Rijn</a> and <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a>, and philosopher <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a>.

The <a href="Amsterdam%20Stock%20Exchange">Amsterdam Stock Exchange</a>, the oldest stock exchange in the world, is located in the city center. <a href="List%20of%20tourist%20attractions%20in%20Amsterdam">Amsterdam's main attractions</a>, including its <a href="Canals%20of%20Amsterdam">historic canals</a>, the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a>, the <a href="Van%20Gogh%20Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a>, <a href="Stedelijk%20Museum%20Amsterdam">Stedelijk Museum</a>, <a href="Hermitage%20Amsterdam">Hermitage Amsterdam</a>, <a href="Anne%20Frank%20House">Anne Frank House</a>, <a href="Amsterdam%20Museum">Amsterdam Museum</a>, its <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a>, and its many <a href="Coffeeshop%20%28Netherlands%29">cannabis coffee shop</a>s draw more than 5 million international visitors annually. It is also the world's most multicultural city with at least 177 nationalities represented.

After the floods of 1170 and 1173, locals near the river Amstel built a bridge over the river and a dam across it, giving its name to the village: "Aemstelredamme". The earliest recorded use of that name is in a document dated October 27, 1275, which exempted inhabitants of the village from paying <a href="toll%20bridge">bridge tolls</a> to Count <a href="Floris%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Holland">Floris V</a>. This allowed the inhabitants of the village of Aemstelredamme to travel freely through the <a href="County%20of%20Holland">County of Holland</a>, paying no tolls at bridges, locks and dams. The certificate describes the inhabitants as "homines manentes apud Amestelledamme" (people residing near Amestelledamme). By 1327, the name had developed into "Aemsterdam".

Amsterdam is much younger than Dutch cities such as <a href="Nijmegen">Nijmegen</a>, <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, and <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a>. In October 2008, <a href="historical%20geography">historical geographer</a> Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then, since <a href="land%20reclamation">reclamation of land</a> may not have been for farming—it may have been for <a href="peat">peat</a>, for use as fuel.

Amsterdam was granted <a href="City%20rights%20in%20the%20Low%20Countries">city rights</a> in either 1300 or 1306. From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely from trade with the <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic League</a>. In 1345, an alleged <a href="Blessed%20Sacrament">Eucharistic miracle</a> in the <a href="Kalverstraat">Kalverstraat</a> rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">adoption of the Protestant faith</a>. The Miracle devotion went underground but was kept alive. In the 19th century, especially after the jubilee of 1845, the devotion was revitalized and became an important national point of reference for Dutch Catholics. The "<a href="Stille%20Omgang">Stille Omgang</a>"—a silent walk or <a href="procession">procession</a> in civil attire—is the expression of the pilgrimage within the Protestant Netherlands since the late 19th century. In the heyday of the Silent Walk, up to 90,000 pilgrims came to Amsterdam. In the 21st century this has reduced to about 5000.

In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the <a href="religious%20persecution">religious persecution</a> of Protestants by the newly introduced <a href="Inquisition%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Inquisition</a>. The revolt escalated into the <a href="Eighty%20Years%27%20War">Eighty Years' War</a>, which ultimately led to Dutch independence. Strongly pushed by <a href="Dutch%20Revolt">Dutch Revolt</a> leader <a href="William%20the%20Silent">William the Silent</a>, the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> became known for its relative <a href="History%20of%20religion%20in%20the%20Netherlands">religious</a> tolerance. <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20the%20Netherlands">Jews</a> from the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>s from France, prosperous merchants and printers from <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, and economic and religious refugees from the Spanish-controlled parts of the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> found safety in Amsterdam. The influx of Flemish printers and the city's intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">free press</a>.

The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's "<a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Golden Age</a>", during which it became the wealthiest city in the western world. Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> and the <a href="Dutch%20West%20India%20Company">Dutch West India Company</a>. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Dutch colonies</a>. Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading <a href="Financial%20centre">Financial centre</a> of the western world. In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the international trading Dutch East India Company became the world's first <a href="stock%20exchange">stock exchange</a> by trading in its own shares. The Bank of Amsterdam started operations in 1609, acting as a full service bank for Dutch merchant bankers and as a reserve bank.

Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The <a href="Anglo-Dutch%20Wars">wars</a> of the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> and France took their toll on Amsterdam. During the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">French Empire</a>. However, the later establishment of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">United Kingdom of the Netherlands</a> in 1815 marked a turning point.

The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam's second Golden Age. New museums, a railway station, and the <a href="Concertgebouw">Concertgebouw</a> were built; in this same time, the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> reached the city. The <a href="Amsterdam%E2%80%93Rhine%20Canal">Amsterdam–Rhine Canal</a> was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>, and the <a href="North%20Sea%20Canal">North Sea Canal</a> was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906, <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in "".

Shortly before the First World War, the city started to expand again, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the "Aardappeloproer" (Potato rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food.

On 1 January 1921, after a flood in 1916, the depleted municipalities of Durgerdam, Holysloot, Zunderdorp and <a href="Schellingwoude">Schellingwoude</a>, all lying north of Amsterdam, were, at their own request, annexed to the city.

Between the wars, the city continued to expand, most notably to the west of the <a href="Jordaan">Jordaan</a> district in the <a href="Frederik%20Hendrikbuurt">Frederik Hendrikbuurt</a> and surrounding neighbourhoods.

<a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Netherlands">invaded the Netherlands</a> on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 <a href="Dutch%20Jews">Dutch Jews</a> were deported to <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a>, of whom some 60,000 lived in Amsterdam. Perhaps the most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl <a href="Anne%20Frank">Anne Frank</a>, who died in the <a href="Bergen-Belsen%20concentration%20camp">Bergen-Belsen concentration camp</a>. At the end of the Second World War, communication with the rest of the country broke down, and food and fuel became scarce. Many citizens travelled to the countryside to forage. Dogs, cats, <a href="sugar">raw sugar</a> beets, and <a href="Tulip">Tulip</a> bulbs—cooked to a pulp—were consumed to stay alive. Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel, and all the wood was taken from the apartments of deported Jews.

Many new suburbs, such as <a href="Osdorp">Osdorp</a>, <a href="Slotervaart%20%28neighborhood%29">Slotervaart</a>, Slotermeer and Geuzenveld, were built in the years after the Second World War.
These suburbs contained many public parks and wide open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other events of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing, politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings, and also for new roads, as the automobile became available to most people. A <a href="Amsterdam%20Metro">metro</a> started operating in 1977 between the new suburb of Bijlmer and the centre of Amsterdam. Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect the <a href="Amsterdam%20Centraal%20railway%20station">Central Station</a> and city centre with other parts of the city.

The required large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam's former Jewish neighbourhood. Smaller streets, such as the Jodenbreestraat, were widened and almost all of their houses were demolished. At the peak of the demolition, the "Nieuwmarktrellen" (<a href="Nieuwmarkt%20Riots">Nieuwmarkt Riots</a>) broke out; the rioters expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city.

As a result, the demolition was stopped, and the highway was never built; only the metro was completed. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished Waterlooplein. Meanwhile, large private organisations, such as "Stadsherstel Amsterdam", were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing. The entire city centre has reattained its former splendour and, as a whole, is now a <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the "Grachtengordel" (the three concentric canals, <a href="Herengracht">Herengracht</a>, <a href="Keizersgracht">Keizersgracht</a>, and <a href="Prinsengracht">Prinsengracht</a>) was added to the <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage List</a>.

In the early years of the 21st century, the Amsterdam city centre has attracted large numbers of tourists: between 2012 and 2015, the annual number of visitors rose from 10 million to 17 million. Real estate prices have surged, and local shops are making way for tourist-oriented ones, making the centre unaffordable for the city's inhabitants. These developments have evoked comparisons with <a href="Venice%20%28Italy%29">Venice</a>, a city thought to be overwhelmed by the tourist influx.

Construction of a metro line connecting the part of the city north of the river (or lake) <a href="IJ%20%28Amsterdam%29">IJ</a> to the centre was started in 2003. The project is controversial because its cost had exceeded its budget by a factor three by 2008, because of fears of damage to buildings in the centre, and because construction had to be halted and restarted multiple times.

Since 2014, renewed focus has been given to urban regeneration and renewal, especially in areas directly bordering the city centre, such as <a href="Frederik%20Hendrikbuurt">Frederik Hendrikbuurt</a>. This urban renewal and expansion of the traditional centre of the city is part of the Structural Vision Amsterdam 2040 initiative.

Amsterdam is in the western Netherlands, in the province of <a href="North%20Holland">North Holland</a>. The river <a href="Amstel">Amstel</a> ends in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the <a href="IJ%20%28Amsterdam%29">IJ</a>. Amsterdam is about <a href="above%20mean%20sea%20level">below sea level</a>. The surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large <a href="polder">polder</a>s. A man-made forest, <a href="Amsterdamse%20Bos">Amsterdamse Bos</a>, is in the southwest. Amsterdam is connected to the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> through the long <a href="North%20Sea%20Canal">North Sea Canal</a>.

Amsterdam is intensely urbanised, as is the <a href="Amsterdam%20Metropolitan%20Area">Amsterdam Metropolitan Area</a> surrounding the city. Comprising of land, the <a href="city%20limits">city proper</a> has 4,457 inhabitants per km and 2,275 houses per km. Parks and <a href="nature%20reserve">nature reserve</a>s make up 12% of Amsterdam's land area.

Amsterdam has more than of <a href="Canals%20of%20Amsterdam">canals</a>, most of which are navigable by boat. The three main canals are <a href="Prinsengracht">Prinsengracht</a>, <a href="Herengracht">Herengracht</a>, and <a href="Keizersgracht">Keizersgracht</a>. In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the <a href="Singel">Singel</a>, which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and makes the city centre a horseshoe shape. The city is also served by a <a href="Port%20of%20Amsterdam">seaport</a>. It has been compared with <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, due to its division into about 90 islands, which are linked by more than 1,200 bridges.

Amsterdam has an <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "Cfb") strongly influenced by its proximity to the North Sea to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. Both winters and summers are considered mild, although winters can get quite cold, while summers are quite warm occasionally. Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">USDA</a> <a href="Hardiness%20zone">Hardiness zone</a> 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant <a href="Urban%20heat%20island">heat-island effect</a>, nights rarely fall below , while it could easily be in Hilversum, southeast. Summers are moderately warm with a number of hot days every month. The average daily high in August is , and or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2. The record extremes range from to .
Days with more than of <a href="precipitation">precipitation</a> are common, on average 133 days per year. Amsterdam's average annual precipitation is , more than what is measured at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. A large part of this precipitation falls as light rain or brief showers. Cloudy and damp days are common during the cooler months of October through March.

Compared to other important towns in the <a href="County%20of%20Holland">County of Holland</a>, such as <a href="Dordrecht">Dordrecht</a>, <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a>, <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>, <a href="Delft">Delft</a> and <a href="Alkmaar">Alkmaar</a>, Amsterdam is a relatively young city. In stark contrast to the relative decline of those other towns, Amsterdam's population grew in the 15th and 16th centuries, mainly due to the rise of the profitable <a href="Baltic%20maritime%20trade%20%28c.%201400%E2%80%931800%29">Baltic maritime trade</a> after the Burgundian victory in the <a href="Dutch%E2%80%93Hanseatic%20War">Dutch–Hanseatic War</a>. Still, the population of Amsterdam and other towns in Holland was only modest compared to the towns and cities of <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a> and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brabant">Brabant</a>, which comprised the most urbanised area of the Low Countries.

This changed when, during the <a href="Dutch%20Revolt">Dutch Revolt</a>, many people from the Southern Netherlands fled to the North, especially after <a href="Fall%20of%20Antwerp">Antwerp fell to Spanish forces</a> in 1585. In thirty years, Amsterdam's population more than doubled from 41,362 inhabitants in 1590 to 106,500 inhabitants in 1620. During the 1660s, Amsterdam's population reached 200,000. The city's growth levelled off and the population stabilised around 240,000 for most of the 18th century.

At the turn of the 18th century, Amsterdam was the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20European%20cities%20in%20history">fourth largest city in Europe</a>, behind <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> (about 700,000), London (550,000) and Paris (530,000). This was all the more remarkable as Amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>, which itself was a much smaller state than England, France or the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. In contrast to those other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a> (about 67,000), <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> (45,000), <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a> (38,000), and <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a> (30,000).

The city's population declined in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, dipping under 200,000 in 1820. By the second half of the 19th century, industrialisation spurred renewed growth. Amsterdam's population hit an all-time high of 872,000 in 1959, before declining in the following decades due to government-sponsored suburbanisation to so-called "groeikernen" (growth centres) such as <a href="Purmerend">Purmerend</a> and <a href="Almere">Almere</a>. Between 1970 and 1980, Amsterdam experienced its sharpest population decline ever, and by 1985 the city had only 675,570 residents. This was soon followed by <a href="reurbanization">reurbanisation</a> and <a href="gentrification">gentrification</a>, however, leading to renewed population growth in the 2010s. The municipal department for Research, Information and Statistics expects a new record population to be set in 2020.

In the 16th and 17th century non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>s, <a href="Flemish%20people">Flemings</a>, <a href="Sephardi%20Jews">Sephardi Jews</a> and <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>ns. Huguenots came after the <a href="Edict%20of%20Fontainebleau">Edict of Fontainebleau</a> in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the <a href="Eighty%20Years%27%20War">Eighty Years' War</a>. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons – their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Amsterdam">Jewish</a>. Just twenty per cent of them survived the <a href="The%20Holocaust">Shoah</a>.

The first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s <a href="Foreign%20worker">guest workers</a> from Turkey, Morocco, Italy and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the <a href="Bijlmermeer">Bijlmer</a> area. Other immigrants, including refugees <a href="Right%20of%20asylum">asylum seekers</a> and <a href="illegal%20immigration">illegal immigrants</a>, came from Europe, <a href="Americas">America</a>, Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like <a href="Almere">Almere</a> and <a href="Purmerend">Purmerend</a>, prompted by the third <a href="Land-use%20planning">planological</a> bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so-called "groeikernen", literally "cores of growth". Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the <a href="Jordaan">Jordaan</a> abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the <a href="Public%20housing">social housing</a> projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of the city'
s children. Segregation along ethnic lines is clearly visible, with people of non-Western origin, considered a separate group by <a href="Statistics%20Netherlands">Statistics Netherlands</a>, concentrating in specific neighbourhoods especially in <a href="Amsterdam%20Nieuw-West">Nieuw-West</a>, <a href="Zeeburg">Zeeburg</a>, <a href="Bijlmermeer">Bijlmer</a> and in certain areas of <a href="Amsterdam-Noord">Amsterdam-Noord</a>.

In 2000, Christians formed the largest <a href="religious%20denomination">religious group</a> in the city (27% of the population). The next largest religion was Islam (14%), most of whose followers were <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a>.

There is a Japanese population resident in Amsterdam. The <a href="Japanese%20School%20of%20Amsterdam">Japanese School of Amsterdam</a> serves elementary and junior high school students. 8% of the student body of the <a href="International%20School%20Amsterdam">International School Amsterdam</a> in nearby <a href="Amstelveen">Amstelveen</a> was Japanese; this figure was 40% in 1997. As of 1997 most Japanese children who lived in the Netherlands attended high schools and universities located in Japan.

In 1578 the previously Roman Catholic city of Amsterdam joined the revolt against Spanish rule, late in comparison to other major northern Dutch cities. In line with Protestant procedure of that time, all churches were converted to Protestant worship. <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> became the dominant religion, and although Catholicism was not forbidden and priests allowed to serve, the <a href="Hierarchy%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic hierarchy</a> was prohibited. This led to the establishment of "schuilkerken", covert churches, behind seemingly ordinary canal side house fronts. One example is the current debate centre de Rode Hoed.
A large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th-century Amsterdam, in particular <a href="Sephardi%20Jews">Sefardic Jews</a> from Spain and Portugal, <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>s from France, and Protestants from the <a href="Southern%20Netherlands">Southern Netherlands</a>. This led to the establishment of many non-Dutch-speaking religious churches. In 1603, the first notification was made of Jewish religious service. In 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated. The Jews came to call the town <a href="Jerusalem%20of%20the%20West">Jerusalem of the West</a>, a reference to their sense of belonging there.
As they became established in the city, other <a href="Christian%20denomination">Christian denomination</a>s used converted Catholic chapels to conduct their own services. The oldest English-language church congregation in the world outside the United Kingdom is found at the <a href="Begijnhof%2C%20Amsterdam">Begijnhof</a>. Regular services there are still offered in English under the auspices of the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>. The Huguenots accounted for nearly 20% of Amsterdam's inhabitants in 1700. Being Calvinists, they soon integrated into the <a href="Dutch%20Reformed%20Church">Dutch Reformed Church</a>, though often retaining their own congregations. Some, commonly referred by the moniker 'Walloon', are recognisable today as they offer occasional services in French.

In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazim</a>, Jews from <a href="Central%20Europe">Central and Eastern Europe</a>, which continued into the 19th century. Jews often fled the <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s in those areas. The first Ashkenazi who arrived in Amsterdam were <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s from the <a href="Khmelnytsky%20Uprising">Chmielnicki Uprising</a> in Poland and the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>. They not only founded their own synagogues, but had a strong influence on the 'Amsterdam dialect' adding a large <a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a> local vocabulary.

Despite an absence of an official Jewish <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a>, most Jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city. The main street of this Jewish neighbourhood was the "Jodenbreestraat". The neighbourhood comprised the "Waterlooplein" and the <a href="Nieuwmarkt">Nieuwmarkt</a>. Buildings in this neighbourhood fell into disrepair after the Second World War, and a large section of the neighbourhood was demolished during the construction of the subway. This led to riots, and as a result the original plans for large-scale reconstruction were abandoned and the neighbourhood was rebuilt with smaller-scale residence buildings on the basis of its original layout.
Catholic churches in Amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853. One of the principal architects behind the city's Catholic churches, <a href="Pierre%20Cuypers">Cuypers</a>, was also responsible for the Amsterdam Central Station and the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a>, which led to a refusal of Protestant King <a href="William%20III%20of%20the%20Netherlands">William III</a> to open 'that monastery'.
In 1924, <a href="Catholic%20Church">the Roman Catholic Church</a> of the Netherlands hosted the <a href="Eucharistic%20Congress">International Eucharistic Congress</a> in Amsterdam, and numerous Catholic <a href="prelate">prelate</a>s visited the city, where festivities were held in churches and stadiums. Catholic processions on the public streets, however, were still forbidden under law at the time. Only in the 20th century was Amsterdam's relation to Catholicism normalised, but despite its far larger <a href="population%20size">population size</a>, the <a href="Holy%20orders">Catholic clergy</a> chose to place its episcopal see of the city in the nearby provincial town of <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>.

In recent times, religious demographics in Amsterdam have been changed by large-scale immigration from former colonies. Immigrants from Suriname have introduced <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> Protestantism and <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a>, from the Hernhutter variety; <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> has been introduced mainly from Suriname; and several distinct branches of Islam have been brought from various parts of the world. Islam is now the largest non-Christian religion in Amsterdam. The large community of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants have established African churches, often in parking garages in the <a href="Bijlmermeer">Bijlmer</a> area, where many have settled. In addition, a broad array of other religious movements have established congregations, including <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. <a href="Jews">Jews</a> make up about 2% of the city's total population.

Although the saying "Leef en laat leven" or "Live and let live" summarises the Dutch and especially the Amsterdam open and tolerant society, the increased influx of religions and cultures after the Second World War, has on a number of occasions strained <a href="social%20relation">social relation</a>s. With 180 different nationalities, Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world. The proportion of the population of immigrant origin in the city proper is about 50% and 88% of the population are Dutch citizens.

The city has been at times marked by ethnic tension. In 2004 film director <a href="Theo%20van%20Gogh%20%28film%20director%29">Theo van Gogh</a> was murdered in Amsterdam. In line with attitude changes in Dutch politics towards certain minorities, Turkish-language and Arabic-language TV channels have been dropped from the basic cable TV package. In recent years, politicians are actively discouraged from campaigning in minority languages to encourage assimilation. In the local elections of 2010 politicians were criticised by current Amsterdam mayor Mr Van der Laan (then Minister of Integration) for distributing election leaflets in minority languages and in some cases leaflets were collected. Due to this alleged anti-multicultural stand, Van der Laan has been accused of hypocrisy by his own party's <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29">PvdA</a> main candidate. Also during the same period, possibly due to his belief in integration via (possibly not always voluntary) assimilation, Amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the Netherlands which provided immigrants with extensive and free <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch-language</a> courses, which have benefited many immigrants.

Amsterdam fans out south from the <a href="Amsterdam%20Centraal%20railway%20station">Amsterdam Centraal railway station</a> and <a href="Damrak">Damrak</a>, the main street off the station. The oldest area of the town is known as "<a href="de%20Wallen">de Wallen</a>" (the quays). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red light district. To the south of de Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein. The medieval and colonial age <a href="canals%20of%20Amsterdam">canals of Amsterdam</a>, known as "Grachten", embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working class areas of <a href="Jordaan">Jordaan</a> and de Pijp. The <a href="Museumplein">Museumplein</a> with the city's major museums, the <a href="Vondelpark">Vondelpark</a>, a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer <a href="Joost%20van%20den%20Vondel">Joost van den Vondel</a>, and the <a href="Plantage%20%28Amsterdam%29">Plantage</a> neighbourhood, with the <a href="Natura%20Artis%20Magistra">zoo</a>, are also located outside the Grachtengordel.

Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are <a href="polder">polder</a>s. This can be recognised by the suffix "-meer" which means "lake", as in <a href="Aalsmeer">Aalsmeer</a>, <a href="Bijlmermeer">Bijlmermeer</a>, <a href="Haarlemmermeer">Haarlemmermeer</a>, and <a href="Watergraafsmeer">Watergraafsmeer</a>.

The Amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious <a href="Urban%20planning">city planning</a>. In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the <a href="IJ%20%28Amsterdam%29">IJ</a> bay. Known as the "Grachtengordel", three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the "<a href="Herengracht">Herengracht</a>" (where "Heren" refers to "Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam" (ruling lords of Amsterdam), and "gracht" means canal, so the name can be roughly translated as "Canal of the lords"), "<a href="Keizersgracht">Keizersgracht</a>" (Emperor's Canal), and "<a href="Prinsengracht">Prinsengracht</a>" (Prince's Canal). The fourth and outermost canal is the "Singelgracht", which is often not mentioned on maps, because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and most inner canal "<a href="Singel">Singel</a>". The canals served for defence, <a href="Water%20resource%20management">water management</a> and transport. The defences took the form of a moat and <a href="Earthworks%20%28engineering%29">earthen dikes</a>, with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>s. The original plans have been lost, so historians, such as Ed Taverne, need to speculate on the original intentions: it is thought that the considerations of the layout were purely practical and defensive rather than ornamental.
Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic <a href="Windscreen%20wiper">windshield wiper</a> as the historian <a href="Geert%20Mak">Geert Mak</a> calls it – and "not" from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.
Over the years, several canals have been filled in, becoming streets or squares, such as the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal and the <a href="Spui%20%28Amsterdam%29">Spui</a>.

After the development of Amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century, <a href="Samuel%20Sarphati">Samuel Sarphati</a> devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the "grachtengordel". The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve public health. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date, like the "Paleis voor Volksvlijt".

Following Sarphati, "Van Niftrik" and "Kalff" designed an entire ring of 19th-century neighbourhoods surrounding the city's centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th-century limit, thus firmly controlling development. Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.

In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: "Plan Zuid", designed by the architect <a href="Hendrik%20Petrus%20Berlage">Berlage</a>, and "West". These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of "housing blocks" for all social classes.

After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by <a href="Car">motor car</a>. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the "Westelijke Tuinsteden". The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the "Bijlmer".

Amsterdam has a rich <a href="History%20of%20architecture">architectural history</a>. The oldest building in Amsterdam is the <a href="Oude%20Kerk%2C%20Amsterdam">Oude Kerk</a> (Old Church), at the heart of the Wallen, consecrated in 1306. The oldest wooden building is "<a href="Begijnhof%2C%20Amsterdam">het Houten Huys</a>" at the <a href="Begijnhof%2C%20Amsterdam">Begijnhof</a>.
It was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings. It is also one of the few examples of <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic architecture</a> in Amsterdam.
In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the <a href="architectural%20style">architectural style</a> of the <a href="The%20Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their <a href="Crow-stepped%20gable">stepped gable</a> façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Renaissance architecture</a>. These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect <a href="Hendrick%20de%20Keyser">Hendrick de Keyser</a>. One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyer is the <a href="Westerkerk">Westerkerk</a>. In the 17th century <a href="baroque%20architecture">baroque architecture</a> became very popular, as it was elsewhere in Europe. This roughly coincided with Amsterdam's <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Golden Age</a>. The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were <a href="Jacob%20van%20Campen">Jacob van Campen</a>, <a href="Philips%20Vingboons">Philips Vingboons</a> and <a href="Dani%C3%ABl%20Stalpaert">Daniel Stalpaert</a>.
Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants' houses throughout the city. A famous building in <a href="baroque">baroque style</a> in Amsterdam is the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Amsterdam">Royal Palace</a> on <a href="Dam%20Square">Dam Square</a>. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by <a href="Culture%20of%20France">French culture</a>. This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles. Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">neo-gothic</a> style. At the end of the 19th century, the <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Jugendstil</a> or <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the <a href="Museumplein">Museum Square</a> in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the <a href="Modern%20history">modern era</a> was <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a>. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the <a href="Amsterdam%20School">Amsterdamse School</a>. Whole districts were built this style, such as the "Rivierenbuurt". A notable feature of the façades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors.

The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century.
Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city's centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early
20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre.
Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals.

Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. <a href="Vondelpark">Vondelpark</a>, the largest park in the city, is located in the <a href="Amsterdam%20Oud-Zuid">Oud-Zuid</a> borough and is named after the 17th century Amsterdam author, <a href="Joost%20van%20den%20Vondel">Joost van den Vondel</a>. Yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. In the park is an open-air theatre, a playground and several <a href="horeca">horeca</a> facilities. In the <a href="Amsterdam-Zuid">Zuid</a> borough, is <a href="Beatrixpark%20%28Amsterdam%29">Beatrixpark</a>, named after <a href="Beatrix%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Queen Beatrix</a>. Between Amsterdam and <a href="Amstelveen">Amstelveen</a> is the <a href="Amsterdamse%20Bos">Amsterdamse Bos</a> (Amsterdam Forest), the largest recreational area in Amsterdam. Annually, almost 4.5 million people visit the park, which has a size of 1.000 hectares and is approximately three times the size of <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>. <a href="Amstelpark">Amstelpark</a> in the <a href="Amsterdam-Zuid">Zuid</a> borough houses the Rieker windmill, which dates to 1636. Other parks include <a href="Sarphatipark">Sarphatipark</a> in the <a href="De%20Pijp">De Pijp</a> neighbourhood, <a href="Oosterpark%20%28Amsterdam%29">Oosterpark</a> in the <a href="Amsterdam-Oost">Oost</a> borough, and <a href="Westerpark%20%28park%29">Westerpark</a> in the <a href="Westerpark%20%28neighborhood%29">Westerpark neighbourhood</a>. The city has four beaches, the Nemo Beach, Citybeach "Het stenen hoofd" (Silodam), Blijburg, and one in <a href="Amsterdam-Noord">Amsterdam-Noord</a>.

The city has many open squares (plein in Dutch). The namesake of the city as the site of the original dam, <a href="Dam%20Square">Dam Square</a>, is the main town square and has the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Amsterdam">Royal Palace</a> and <a href="National%20Monument%20%28Amsterdam%29">National Monument</a>. <a href="Museumplein">Museumplein</a> hosts various museums, including the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a>, <a href="Van%20Gogh%20Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a>, and <a href="Stedelijk%20Museum%20Amsterdam">Stedelijk Museum</a>. Other squares include <a href="Rembrandtplein">Rembrandtplein</a>, <a href="Muntplein%2C%20Amsterdam">Muntplein</a>, <a href="Nieuwmarkt">Nieuwmarkt</a>, <a href="Leidseplein">Leidseplein</a>, <a href="Spui%20%28Amsterdam%29">Spui</a>, and <a href="Waterlooplein">Waterlooplein</a>. Also, near to Amsterdam is the <a href="Nekkeveld%20estate">Nekkeveld estate</a> conservation project.

Amsterdam is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands.
Amsterdam is currently one of the best European cities in which to locate an <a href="international%20business">international business</a>. It is ranked fifth in this category and is only surpassed by London, Paris, <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> and <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. Many large corporations and banks have their headquarters in Amsterdam, including <a href="AkzoNobel">Akzo Nobel</a>, <a href="Heineken%20International">Heineken International</a>, <a href="ING%20Group">ING Group</a>, <a href="ABN%20AMRO">ABN AMRO</a>, <a href="TomTom">TomTom</a>, <a href="Delta%20Lloyd%20Group">Delta Lloyd Group</a>, <a href="Booking.com">Booking.com</a> and <a href="Philips">Philips</a>. <a href="KPMG">KPMG</a> International's global headquarters is located in nearby Amstelveen, where many non-Dutch companies have settled as well, because surrounding communities allow full land ownership, contrary to Amsterdam's land-lease system.

Though many small offices are still located on the old canals, companies are increasingly relocating outside the city centre. The <a href="Zuidas">Zuidas</a> (English: South Axis) has become the new financial and legal hub. The five largest law firms of the Netherlands, a number of Dutch subsidiaries of large consulting firms like <a href="Boston%20Consulting%20Group">Boston Consulting Group</a> and <a href="Accenture">Accenture</a>, and the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%28Amsterdam%29">World Trade Center Amsterdam</a> are also located in Zuidas.

There are three other smaller financial districts in Amsterdam. The first is the area surrounding <a href="Amsterdam%20Sloterdijk%20railway%20station">Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station</a>, where several newspapers like "<a href="De%20Telegraaf">De Telegraaf</a>" have their offices. Also, <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a>, the <a href="Gemeentelijk%20Vervoerbedrijf">Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf</a> (municipal public transport company) and the Dutch tax offices ("Belastingdienst") are located there. The second <a href="Central%20business%20district">Financial District</a> is the area surrounding <a href="Amsterdam%20Arena">Amsterdam Arena</a>. The third is the area surrounding <a href="Amsterdam%20Amstel%20railway%20station">Amsterdam Amstel railway station</a>. The <a href="List%20of%20tallest%20buildings%20and%20structures%20in%20the%20world">tallest building</a> in Amsterdam, the <a href="Rembrandt%20Tower">Rembrandt Tower</a>, is situated there, as is the headquarters of <a href="Philips">Philips</a>.

The <a href="Port%20of%20Amsterdam">Port of Amsterdam</a> is the fourth largest port in Europe, the 38th largest port in the world and the second largest port in the Netherlands by metric tons of cargo. In 2014 the Port of Amsterdam had a cargo throughput of 97,4 million tons of cargo, which was mostly <a href="bulk%20cargo">bulk cargo</a>.
Amsterdam has the biggest cruise port in the Netherlands with more than 150 cruise ships every year.
In 2019 the new lock in IJmuiden will open; the port will then be able to grow to 125 million tonnes in capacity.

The <a href="Amsterdam%20Stock%20Exchange">Amsterdam Stock Exchange</a> (AEX), now part of <a href="Euronext">Euronext</a>, is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. It is near <a href="Dam%20Square">Dam Square</a> in the city centre.

Together with <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a> (<a href="Brainport%2C%20Netherlands">Brainport</a>) and <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> (<a href="Port%20of%20Rotterdam">Seaport</a>), Amsterdam (Airport) forms the foundation of the Dutch economy.

Amsterdam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 4.63 million international visitors annually, this is excluding the 16 million day trippers visiting the city every year. The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two-thirds of the hotels are located in the city's centre. Hotels with 4 or 5 stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room occupation rate was 78% in 2006, up from 70% in 2005. The majority of tourists (74%) originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total. Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated "Rembrandt 400", to celebrate the 400th birthday of <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt van Rijn</a>. Some hotels offer special arrangements or activities during these years. The average number of guests per year staying at the four campsites around the city range from 12,000 to 65,000.

De Wallen, also known as Walletjes or Rosse Buurt, is a designated area for <a href="Prostitution%20in%20the%20Netherlands">legalised prostitution</a> and is Amsterdam's largest and most well known <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a>. This neighbourhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of roads and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by <a href="sex%20worker">sex worker</a>s who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights.

Shops in Amsterdam range from large high end department stores such as <a href="De%20Bijenkorf">De Bijenkorf</a> founded in 1870 to small specialty shops. Amsterdam's high-end shops are found in the streets <a href="P.C.%20Hooftstraat">P.C. Hooftstraat</a> and "Cornelis Schuytstraat", which are located in the vicinity of the <a href="Vondelpark">Vondelpark</a>. One of Amsterdam's busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval <a href="Kalverstraat">Kalverstraat</a> in the heart of the city. Other shopping areas include the "Negen Straatjes" and Haarlemmerdijk and Haarlemmerstraat. "Negen Straatjes" are nine narrow streets within the "Grachtengordel", the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk were voted best shopping street in the Netherlands in 2011. These streets have as the "Negen Straatjes" a large diversity of privately owned shops. But as the "Negen Straatjes" are dominated by fashion stores the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk offer a very wide variety of all kinds of stores, just to name some specialties: candy and other food related stores, lingerie, sneakers, wedding clothing, interior shops, books, Italian deli's, racing and mountain bikes, skatewear, etc.

The city also features a large number of open-air markets such as the <a href="Albert%20Cuyp%20Market">Albert Cuyp Market</a>, Westerstraat-markt, Ten Katemarkt, and <a href="Dappermarkt">Dappermarkt</a>. Some of these markets are held on a daily basis, like the Albert Cuypmarkt and the Dappermarkt. Others, like the Westerstraatmarkt, are held on a weekly basis.

Fashion brands like <a href="G-Star%20Raw">G-star</a>, Gsus, BlueBlood, PICHICHI, Iris van Herpen, fair trade denim brand <a href="MUD%20Jeans">MUD Jeans</a>, <a href="10%20feet">10 feet</a> and <a href="Warmenhoven%20%26amp%3B%20Venderbos">Warmenhoven & Venderbos</a>, and fashion designers like <a href="Mart%20Visser">Mart Visser</a>, <a href="Viktor%20%26amp%3B%20Rolf">Viktor & Rolf</a>, Sheila de Vries, <a href="Marlies%20Dekkers">Marlies Dekkers</a> and <a href="Frans%20Molenaar">Frans Molenaar</a> are based in Amsterdam. <a href="Modeling%20agency">Modelling agencies</a> <a href="Elite%20Model%20Management">Elite Models</a>, Touche models and Tony Jones have opened branches in Amsterdam. Fashion models like <a href="Yfke%20Sturm">Yfke Sturm</a>, <a href="Doutzen%20Kroes">Doutzen Kroes</a> and <a href="Kim%20Noorda">Kim Noorda</a> started their careers in Amsterdam. Amsterdam has its garment centre in the World Fashion Center. Buildings which formerly housed brothels in the red light district have been converted to ateliers for young fashion designers, AKA eagle fuel. Fashion photographers <a href="Inez%20and%20Vinoodh">Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin</a> were born in Amsterdam(Netherland).

During the later part of the 16th-century Amsterdam's Rederijkerskamer (<a href="Chamber%20of%20rhetoric">Chamber of rhetoric</a>) organised contests between different Chambers in the reading of poetry and drama. In 1638, Amsterdam opened its first theatre. Ballet performances were given in this theatre as early as 1642. In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was under the influence of German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera. In the 19th century, popular culture was centred on the Nes area in Amsterdam (mainly <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> and <a href="music%20hall">music-hall</a>). The <a href="metronome">metronome</a>, one of the most important advances in European classical music, was invented here in 1812 by <a href="Dietrich%20Nikolaus%20Winkel">Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel</a>. At the end of this century, the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a> and <a href="Stedelijk%20Museum%20Amsterdam">Stedelijk Museum</a> were built. In 1888, the <a href="Royal%20Concertgebouw%20Orchestra">Concertgebouworkest</a> was established. With the 20th century came cinema, radio and television. Though most studios are located in <a href="Hilversum">Hilversum</a> and <a href="Aalsmeer">Aalsmeer</a>, Amsterdam's influence on programming is very strong. Many people who work in the television industry live in Amsterdam. Also, the headquarters of the Dutch <a href="SBS%206">SBS Broadcasting Group</a> is located in Amsterdam.

The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the <a href="Museumplein">Museumplein</a> (Museum Square), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former <a href="Internationale%20Koloniale%20en%20Uitvoerhandel%20Tentoonstelling">World's fair</a>. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the very large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter. The northwestern part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, House of Bols Cocktail & Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A <a href="Multi-storey%20car%20park">parking garage</a> can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999, when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.
The <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a> possesses the largest and most important collection of classical <a href="Dutch%20art">Dutch art</a>.

Van Gogh lived in Amsterdam for a short while and there is a <a href="Van%20Gogh%20Museum">museum dedicated to his work</a>. The museum is housed in one of the few modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by <a href="Gerrit%20Rietveld">Gerrit Rietveld</a>. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect <a href="Kisho%20Kurokawa">Kisho Kurokawa</a>. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum.

Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many "<a href="bar%20%28establishment%29">cafés</a>" (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cozy. The typical "Bruine Kroeg" (brown "café") breathe a more old fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. Most "cafés" have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many <a href="discoth%C3%A8que">discothèque</a>s. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the <a href="Leidseplein">Leidseplein</a> and the <a href="Rembrandtplein">Rembrandtplein</a>.

The city of Amsterdam is a <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20the%20Netherlands">municipality</a> under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a directly elected <a href="Municipal%20council%20%28Netherlands%29">municipal council</a>, a <a href="College%20van%20burgemeester%20en%20wethouders">municipal executive board</a> and a <a href="Burgemeester">mayor</a>. Since 1981, the <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20the%20Netherlands">municipality</a> of Amsterdam has gradually been divided into semi-autonomous <a href="Boroughs%20of%20Amsterdam">boroughs</a>, called "stadsdelen" or 'districts'. Over time, a total of 15 boroughs were created. In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of <a href="Boroughs%20of%20Amsterdam">Amsterdam boroughs</a> was reduced to eight: <a href="Amsterdam-Centrum">Amsterdam-Centrum</a> covering the city centre including the <a href="Canals%20of%20Amsterdam">canal belt</a>, <a href="Amsterdam-Noord">Amsterdam-Noord</a> consisting of the neighbourhoods north of the <a href="IJ%20%28Amsterdam%29">IJ lake</a>, <a href="Amsterdam-Oost">Amsterdam-Oost</a> in the east, <a href="Amsterdam-Zuid">Amsterdam-Zuid</a> in the south, <a href="Amsterdam-West">Amsterdam-West</a> in the west, <a href="Amsterdam%20Nieuw-West">Amsterdam Nieuw-West</a> in the far west, <a href="Amsterdam%20Zuidoost">Amsterdam Zuidoost</a> in the southeast, and <a href="Westpoort%20%28Amsterdam%29">Westpoort</a> covering the <a href="Port%20of%20Amsterdam">Port of Amsterdam</a> area.

As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a directly elected <a href="Municipal%20council%20%28Netherlands%29">municipal council</a>, a <a href="College%20van%20burgemeester%20en%20wethouders">municipal executive board</a> and a <a href="Burgemeester">mayor</a> ("burgemeester"). The mayor is a member of the municipal executive board, but also has individual responsibilies in maintaining public order. In July 2010, <a href="Eberhard%20van%20der%20Laan">Eberhard van der Laan</a> (<a href="Labour%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29">Labour Party</a>) was appointed <a href="Burgemeester">mayor</a> of Amsterdam by the national government for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam <a href="Municipal%20council%20%28Netherlands%29">municipal council</a>. After the <a href="Dutch%20municipal%20elections%2C%202014">2014 municipal council elections</a>, a governing majority of <a href="Democrats%2066">D66</a>, <a href="People%27s%20Party%20for%20Freedom%20and%20Democracy">VVD</a> and <a href="Socialist%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29">SP</a> was formed – the first coalition without the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29">Labour Party</a> since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Next to the <a href="Burgemeester">mayor</a>, the <a href="College%20van%20burgemeester%20en%20wethouders">municipal executive board</a> consists of eight "wethouders" ('alderpersons') appointed by the <a href="Municipal%20council%20%28Netherlands%29">municipal council</a>: four <a href="Democrats%2066">D66</a> alderpersons, two <a href="People%27s%20Party%20for%20Freedom%20and%20Democracy">VVD</a> alderpersons and two <a href="Socialist%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29">SP</a> alderpersons.

On 18 September 2017 it was announced by <a href="Eberhard%20van%20der%20Laan">Eberhard van der Laan</a> in an open letter to Amsterdam citizens that Kajsa Ollongren would take up his office as acting Mayor of Amsterdam - with immediate effect - with the resignation of Van der Laan due to ill health.

Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into eight <a href="Boroughs%20of%20Amsterdam">boroughs</a>, called "stadsdelen" or 'districts', a system that was implemented gradually in the 1980s to improve local governance. The <a href="Boroughs%20of%20Amsterdam">boroughs</a> are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of <a href="Boroughs%20of%20Amsterdam">Amsterdam boroughs</a> reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council ("deelraad"), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth, <a href="Westpoort">Westpoort</a>, covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council. Under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the <a href="Boroughs%20of%20Amsterdam">borough</a> system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the <a href="Boroughs%20of%20Amsterdam">Amsterdam boroughs</a> lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished. The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees ("bestuurscommissies"). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.
"Amsterdam" is usually understood to refer to the <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20the%20Netherlands">municipality</a> of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of <a href="Durgerdam">Durgerdam</a>, may not be considered part of Amsterdam.

<a href="Statistics%20Netherlands">Statistics Netherlands</a> uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam ("Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam", not to be confused with "Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam", a synonym of "Groot Amsterdam"), Greater Amsterdam ("Groot Amsterdam", a <a href="COROP">COROP</a> region) and the urban region Amsterdam ("Stadsgewest Amsterdam"). The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the "Stadsregio Amsterdam" ('City Region of Amsterdam'). The city region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities of <a href="Zaanstad">Zaanstad</a> and <a href="Wormerland">Wormerland</a>. It excludes <a href="Graft-De%20Rijp">Graft-De Rijp</a>.

The smallest of these areas is the <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20the%20Netherlands">municipality</a> of Amsterdam with a population of 802,938 in 2013. The conurbation had a population of 1,096,042 in 2013. It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam. Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities, and had a population of 1,293,208 in 2013. Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of <a href="Zaanstad">Zaanstad</a>. The largest area by population, the <a href="Amsterdam%20Metropolitan%20Area">Amsterdam Metropolitan Area</a> (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,33 million. It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerveer, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft-De Rijp. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area <a href="Randstad">Randstad</a>, with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.

Of these various metropolitan area configurations, only the "Stadsregio Amsterdam" (City Region of Amsterdam) has a formal governmental status. Its responsibities include regional spatial planning and the metropolitan public transport concessions.

Under the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Dutch Constitution</a>, Amsterdam is the <a href="capital%20of%20the%20Netherlands">capital of the Netherlands</a>. Since the 1983 constitutional revision, the constitution mentions "Amsterdam" and "capital" in chapter 2, article 32: The king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in "the capital Amsterdam" (""de hoofdstad Amsterdam""). Previous versions of the constitution only mentioned "the city of Amsterdam" (""de stad Amsterdam""). For a royal investiture, therefore, the <a href="States%20General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">States General of the Netherlands</a> (the Dutch Parliament) meets for a ceremonial joint session in Amsterdam. The ceremony traditionally takes place at the <a href="Nieuwe%20Kerk%20%28Amsterdam%29">Nieuwe Kerk</a> on <a href="Dam%20Square">Dam Square</a>, immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Amsterdam">Royal Palace of Amsterdam</a>. Normally, however, the Parliament sits in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>, the city which has historically been the seat of the <a href="Politics%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Dutch government</a>, the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Dutch monarchy</a>, and the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Dutch supreme court</a>. Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague.

The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three <a href="Saltire">St Andrew's crosses</a>, aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> was <a href="Saint%20Nicholas">Saint Nicholas</a>).

Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's <a href="imperial%20crown">imperial crown</a> when he was crowned <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>.
