Boudica

Boudica or Boudicca (, <a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised</a> as Boadicea or Boudicea , and known in <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> as ) was a queen of the <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">British</a> <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> <a href="Iceni">Iceni</a> tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in AD 60 or 61, and died shortly after its failure. She is sometimes considered a British folk hero.

Boudica's husband, <a href="Prasutagus">Prasutagus</a>, ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome and left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a> in his will. However, when he died, his will was ignored, and the kingdom was annexed. According to <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, Boudica was flogged and her daughters <a href="wartime%20sexual%20violence">raped</a>. <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a> provides an alternative explanation for Boudica's response, saying that previous imperial donations to influential Britons were confiscated and the Roman financier and philosopher <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a> called in the loans he had forced on the reluctant Britons.

In AD 60 or 61, when the <a href="Governors%20of%20Roman%20Britain">Roman governor</a> <a href="Gaius%20Suetonius%20Paulinus">Gaius Suetonius Paulinus</a> was campaigning on the island of <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a> off the northwest coast of <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, Boudica led the <a href="Iceni">Iceni</a>, the <a href="Trinovantes">Trinovantes</a>, and others in revolt. They destroyed (modern <a href="Colchester">Colchester</a>), earlier the capital of the Trinovantes but at that time a "", a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers and site of a temple to the former Emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a>. Upon hearing of the revolt, Suetonius hurried to (modern <a href="London">London</a>), the 20-year-old commercial settlement that was the rebels' next target. The Romans, having concluded that they lacked sufficient numbers to defend the settlement, evacuated and abandoned . Boudica led 100,000 Iceni, Trinovantes, and others to fight , and burned and destroyed and (modern-day <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>).

An estimated 70,000–80,000 Romans and British were killed in the three cities by those led by Boudica. Suetonius, meanwhile, regrouped his forces in the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28region%29">West Midlands</a>, and, despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated the Britons in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Watling%20Street">Battle of Watling Street</a>. The crisis caused <a href="Nero">Nero</a> to consider withdrawing all Roman forces from Britain, but Suetonius' eventual victory over Boudica confirmed Roman control of the province. Boudica then either killed herself to avoid capture, or died of illness. The extant sources, <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> and <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a>, differ.

Interest in these events revived in the <a href="English%20Renaissance">English Renaissance</a> and led to Boudica's fame in the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. Boudica has remained an important <a href="cultural%20icon">cultural symbol</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The absence of native British literature during the early part of the first millennium means that knowledge of Boudica's rebellion comes solely from the writings of the Romans.

Boudica has been known by several versions of her name. <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a> calls her Voadicia, while <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a> calls her Bunduca, a version of the name that was used in the popular Jacobean play "<a href="Bonduca">Bonduca</a>", in 1612. <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a>'s poem, "Boadicea, an ode" (1782) popularised an alternative version of the name. From the 19th century and much of the late 20th century, Boadicea was the most common version of the name, which is probably derived from a mistranscription when a manuscript of <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> was copied in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>.

Her name was clearly spelled Boudicca in the best manuscripts of Tacitus, but also , , and in the (later and probably secondary) <a href="epitome">epitome</a> of <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a>.

<a href="Kenneth%20H.%20Jackson">Kenneth Jackson</a> concludes, based on later development of Welsh and Irish, that the name derives from the <a href="Proto-Celtic%20language">Proto-Celtic</a> feminine adjective "*boudīkā", "victorious", that in turn is derived from the <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic</a> word "*boudā", "victory" (cf. <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a> ' (Classical Irish '), "Buaidheach", <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> '), and that the correct spelling of the name in <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Common Brittonic</a> (the British Celtic language) is "Boudica", pronounced . The <a href="Gaulish%20language">Gaulish</a> version is attested in inscriptions as Boudiga in <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, Boudica in <a href="Lusitania">Lusitania</a>, and Bodicca in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>.

The closest English equivalent to the vowel in the first syllable is the "ow" in "bow-and-arrow". The modern English pronunciation is , and it has been suggested that the most comparable English name, in meaning only, would be "Victoria".

Tacitus and Cassius Dio agree that Boudica was of <a href="Royal%20family">royal</a> descent. Dio describes her as "possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women." He also describes her as tall, with <a href="Tawny%20%28color%29">tawny</a> hair hanging down to below her waist, a harsh voice and a piercing glare. He notes that she habitually wore a large golden necklace (perhaps a <a href="torc">torc</a>), a colourful tunic, and a thick cloak fastened by a <a href="brooch">brooch</a>.

Boudicca’s husband, Prasutagus, was the king of the Iceni, a people who inhabited roughly what is now <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. The Iceni initially voluntarily allied with Rome following Claudius's conquest of southern Britain in AD 43.They were proud of their independence, and had revolted in AD 47 when the then Roman governor <a href="Publius%20Ostorius%20Scapula">Publius Ostorius Scapula</a> planned to disarm all the peoples in the area of Britain under Roman control following a number of local uprisings. Ostorius defeated them and went on to put down other uprisings around Britain. The Iceni remained independent. Tacitus first mentioned Prasutagus when he wrote about Boudica’s rebellion. We do not know whether he became the king after the mentioned defeat of the Iceni. The client relationship with Rome ended after the end of the rebellion.

Tacitus wrote "The Icenian king Prasutagus, celebrated for his long prosperity, had named the emperor his heir, together with his two daughters; an act of deference which he thought would place his kingdom and household beyond the risk of injury. The result was contrary — so much so that his kingdom was pillaged by centurions, his household by slaves; as though they had been prizes of war." He added that Boudica was lashed and her two daughters were raped and that the estates of the leading Iceni men were confiscated.

Cassius Dio wrote: "An excuse for the war was found in the confiscation of the sums of money that Claudius had given to the foremost Britons; for these sums, as <a href="Catus%20Decianus">Decianus Catus</a>, the procurator of the island maintained, were to be paid back." He also said that another reason was "the fact that <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a>, in the hope of receiving a good rate of interest, had lent to the islanders 40,000,000 sesterces that they did not want, and had afterwards called in this loan all at once and had resorted to severe measures in exacting it."

Tacitus did not say why Prasutagus' naming the emperor as his heir as well as his daughters was meant to avert the risk of injury. He did not explain why the Romans pillaged the kingdom, why they took the lands of the chiefs or why Boudica was flogged and her daughters were raped. Cassius Dio did not mention any of this. He said that the cause of the rebellion was the decision of the procurator of Britain (the chief financial officer) and Seneca (an advisor of the emperor Nero) to call in Prasutagus' debts and the harsh measures which were taken to collect them. Tacitus does not mention these events. However, he wrote: "Alarmed by this disaster and by the fury of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity, the procurator Catus crossed over into Gaul."

It has to be noted that this was happening while the governor of Britain, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was away fighting in North Wales. We do not know whether he approved of these actions. We do not know who the centurions who pillaged the kingdom were and who sent them. The text of Cassius Dio seems to suggest that Seneca, who was a private citizen, was responsible for the violence. It is unlikely that a legion was sent to the land of the Iceni as two of them were fighting at the island of Anglesey and the other two were stationed at their garrisons. Tacitus said that "It was against the veterans that their hatred was most intense. For these new settlers in the colony of Camulodunum drove people out of their houses, ejected them from their farms, called them captives and slaves ..."

In AD 60 or 61, while the current governor, <a href="Gaius%20Suetonius%20Paulinus">Gaius Suetonius Paulinus</a>, was leading a campaign against the island of (modern <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a>) in the north of Wales, which was a refuge for British rebels and a stronghold of the <a href="druid">druid</a>s, the Iceni conspired with their neighbours the Trinovantes, amongst others, to revolt. Boudica was chosen as their leader. Tacitus records that she addressed her army with these words, " It is not as a woman descended from noble ancestry, but as one of the people that I am avenging lost freedom, my scourged body, the outraged chastity of my daughters," and concluded " This is a woman's resolve; as for men, they may live and be slaves." According to Tacitus, they drew inspiration from the example of <a href="Arminius">Arminius</a>, the prince of the <a href="Cherusci">Cherusci</a> who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9, and their own ancestors who had driven <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> from Britain. Dio says that at the outset Boudica employed a form of <a href="divination">divination</a>, releasing a <a href="hare">hare</a> from the folds of her dress and interpreting the direction in which it ran, and invoked <a href="Andraste">Andraste</a>, a British <a href="goddess">goddess</a> of <a href="Victoria%20%28mythology%29">victory</a>.

The rebels' first target was (<a href="Colchester">Colchester</a>), the former Trinovantian capital and, at that time, a Roman ". The Roman veterans who had been settled there mistreated the locals and a temple to the former emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> had been erected there at local expense, making the city a focus for resentment. The Roman inhabitants sought reinforcements from the procurator, Catus Decianus, but he sent only two hundred <a href="Auxiliaries%20%28Roman%20military%29">auxiliary troops</a>. Boudica's army fell on the poorly defended city and destroyed it, besieging the last defenders in the temple for two days before it fell. <a href="Archaeology">Archaeologists</a> have shown that the city was methodically demolished. The future governor <a href="Quintus%20Petillius%20Cerialis">Quintus Petillius Cerialis</a>, then commanding the <a href="Legio%20IX%20Hispana">Legio IX "Hispana"</a>, attempted to relieve the city, but suffered an <a href="Massacre%20of%20the%20Ninth%20Legion">overwhelming defeat</a>. His infantry was wiped out—only the commander and some of his cavalry escaped.

The location of this famous destruction of the is now claimed by some to be the village of <a href="Great%20Wratting">Great Wratting</a>, in Suffolk, which lies in the Stour Valley on the Icknield Way West of Colchester, and by a village in Essex. After this defeat, Catus Decianus fled to <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>.

When news of the rebellion reached him, Suetonius hurried along <a href="Watling%20Street">Watling Street</a> through hostile territory to . was a relatively new settlement, founded after the conquest of AD 43, but it had grown to be a thriving commercial centre with a population of travellers, traders, and, probably, Roman officials. Suetonius considered giving battle there, but considering his lack of numbers and chastened by Petillius's defeat, decided to sacrifice the city to save the province.

Alarmed by this disaster and by the fury of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity, the procurator Catus crossed over into Gaul. Suetonius, however, with wonderful resolution, marched amidst a hostile population to Londinium, which, though undistinguished by the name of a colony, was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading vessels. Uncertain whether he should choose it as a seat of war, as he looked round on his scanty force of soldiers, and remembered with what a serious warning the rashness of Petilius had been punished, he resolved to save the province at the cost of a single town. Nor did the tears and weeping of the people, as they implored his aid, deter him from giving the signal of departure and receiving into his army all who would go with him. Those who were chained to the spot by the weakness of their sex, or the infirmity of age, or the attractions of the place, were cut off by the enemy.

Londinium was abandoned to the rebels who burnt it down, slaughtering anyone who had not evacuated with Suetonius. Archaeology shows a thick red layer of burnt debris covering coins and pottery dating before AD 60 within the bounds of Roman Londinium; while Roman-era skulls found in the <a href="Walbrook">Walbrook</a> in 2013 were potentially linked to victims of the rebels. (<a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>) was next to be destroyed.

In the three settlements destroyed, between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed. Tacitus says that the Britons had no interest in taking or selling prisoners, only in slaughter by <a href="gibbet">gibbet</a>, fire, or cross. Dio's account gives more detail; that the noblest women were impaled on spikes and had their breasts cut off and sewn to their mouths, "to the accompaniment of sacrifices, banquets, and wanton behaviour" in sacred places, particularly the groves of Andraste.

While Boudica's army continued their assault in Verulamium (St. Albans), Suetonius regrouped his forces. According to Tacitus, he amassed a force including his own <a href="Legio%20XIV%20Gemina">Legio XIV "Gemina"</a>, some "vexillationes" (detachments) of the <a href="Legio%20XX%20Valeria%20Victrix">XX "Valeria Victrix"</a>, and any available auxiliaries. The <a href="prefect">prefect</a> of , <a href="Poenius%20Postumus">Poenius Postumus</a>, stationed near <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, ignored the call, and a fourth legion, , had been routed trying to relieve , but nonetheless the governor was able to call on almost ten thousand men.

Suetonius took a stand at an unidentified location, probably in the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28region%29">West Midlands</a> somewhere along the <a href="Roman%20road">Roman road</a> now known as <a href="Watling%20Street">Watling Street</a>, in a <a href="Defile%20%28geography%29">defile</a> with a wood behind him — but his men were heavily outnumbered. Dio says that, even if they were lined up one deep, they would not have extended the length of Boudica's line. By now the rebel forces were said to have numbered 230,000. However, this number should be treated with scepticism — Dio's account is known only from a late <a href="epitome">epitome</a>, and ancient sources commonly exaggerate enemy numbers.

Boudica exhorted her troops from her <a href="chariot">chariot</a>, her daughters beside her. Tacitus records her giving a short speech in which she presents herself not as an <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocrat</a> avenging her lost wealth, but as an ordinary person, avenging her lost freedom, her battered body, and the abused chastity of her daughters. She said their cause was just, and the deities were on their side; the one legion that had dared to face them had been destroyed. She, a woman, was resolved to win or die; if the men wanted to live in slavery, that was their choice.

However, the lack of manoeuvrability of the British forces, combined with lack of open-field tactics to command these numbers, put them at a disadvantage to the Romans, who were skilled at open combat due to their superior equipment and discipline. Also, the narrowness of the field meant that Boudica could put forth only as many troops as the Romans could at a given time.

First, the Romans stood their ground and used volleys of ' (heavy javelins) to kill thousands of Britons who were rushing toward the Roman lines. The Roman soldiers, who had now used up their ', were then able to engage Boudica's second wave in the open. As the Romans advanced in a <a href="Flying%20wedge">wedge</a> formation, the Britons attempted to flee, but were impeded by the presence of their own families, whom they had stationed in a ring of wagons at the edge of the battlefield, and were slaughtered. This is not the first instance of this tactic — the women of the <a href="Cimbri">Cimbri</a>, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vercellae">Battle of Vercellae</a> against <a href="Gaius%20Marius">Gaius Marius</a>, were stationed in a line of wagons and acted as a last line of defence. <a href="Ariovistus">Ariovistus</a> of the <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a> is reported to have done the same thing in <a href="Battle%20of%20Vosges%20%2858%20BC%29">his battle</a> against <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>. Tacitus reports that "according to one report almost eighty thousand Britons fell" compared with only four hundred Romans.

According to Tacitus in his "Annals", Boudica poisoned herself, though in the ' which was written almost twenty years prior he mentions nothing of suicide and attributes the end of the revolt to ' ("indolence"); Dio says she fell sick and died and then was given a lavish burial; though this may be a convenient way to remove her from the story. Considering Dio must have read Tacitus, it is worth noting he mentions nothing about suicide (which was also how Postumus and Nero ended their lives).

Postumus, on hearing of the Roman victory, fell on his sword. <a href="Catus%20Decianus">Catus Decianus</a>, who had fled to Gaul, was replaced by <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Alpinus%20Classicianus">Gaius Julius Alpinus Classicianus</a>. Suetonius conducted punitive operations, but criticism by Classicianus led to an investigation headed by <a href="Nero">Nero</a>'s <a href="freedman">freedman</a> <a href="Polyclitus%20%28freedman%29">Polyclitus</a>. Fearing Suetonius's actions would provoke further rebellion, Nero replaced the governor with the more conciliatory <a href="Publius%20Petronius%20Turpilianus">Publius Petronius Turpilianus</a>. The historian <a href="Suetonius">Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus</a> tells us the crisis had almost persuaded Nero to abandon Britain. No historical records tell us what had happened to Boudica's two daughters.

The location of Boudica's defeat is unknown. Most historians favour a site in the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28county%29">West Midlands</a>, somewhere along the Roman road now known as <a href="Watling%20Street">Watling Street</a>. Kevin K. Carroll suggests a site close to <a href="High%20Cross%2C%20Leicestershire">High Cross</a> in <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a>, on the junction of Watling Street and the <a href="Fosse%20Way">Fosse Way</a>, which would have allowed the , based at <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, to rendezvous with the rest of Suetonius's forces, had they not failed to do so. <a href="Manduessedum">Manduessedum</a> (<a href="Mancetter">Mancetter</a>), near the modern town of <a href="Atherstone">Atherstone</a> in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, has also been suggested, as has "The Rampart" near <a href="Messing">Messing</a> in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, according to legend. More recently, a discovery of Roman artefacts in <a href="Kings%20Norton">Kings Norton</a> close to <a href="Birmingham%20military%20history">Metchley Camp</a> has suggested another possibility, and a thorough examination of a stretch of Watling Street between St. Albans, Boudica's last known location, and the Fosse Way junction has suggested the Cuttle Mill area of <a href="Paulerspury">Paulerspury</a> in Northamptonshire, which has <a href="topography">topography</a> very closely matching that described by Tacitus of the scene of the battle.

In 2009 it was suggested that the Iceni were returning to East Anglia along the <a href="Icknield%20Way">Icknield Way</a> when they encountered the Roman army in the vicinity of <a href="Arbury%20Banks%2C%20Hertfordshire">Arbury Banks, Hertfordshire</a>. In March 2010, evidence was published suggesting the site may be located at <a href="Church%20Stowe">Church Stowe</a>, Northamptonshire.

Tacitus took a particular interest in Britain as his father-in-law <a href="Gnaeus%20Julius%20Agricola">Gnaeus Julius Agricola</a> served there three times (and was the subject of his first book). Agricola was a military tribune under Suetonius Paulinus, which almost certainly gave Tacitus an eyewitness source for Boudica's revolt. Cassius Dio's account is only known from an <a href="epitome">epitome</a>, and his sources are uncertain. He is generally agreed to have based his account on that of Tacitus, but he simplifies the sequence of events and adds details, such as the calling in of loans, that Tacitus does not mention.

"Buddug" is likely to have been a figure of praise in the post-Roman Bardic tradition of the <a href="Welsh%20people">British Celts</a>. In his 6th century work "", the monk <a href="Gildas">Gildas</a> demonstrates his knowledge of this tradition, but is critical of the anti-Roman separatism:

""A treacherous lioness butchered the governors who had been left to give fuller voice and strength to the endeavors of Roman rule"".

"Buddug" has yet to be conclusively identified within the cannon of <a href="medieval%20Welsh%20literature">medieval Welsh literature</a> and she is not apparent in the ', the ' or <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>'s "<a href="History%20of%20the%20Kings%20of%20Britain">History of the Kings of Britain</a>".

The area of <a href="King%27s%20Cross%2C%20London">King's Cross, London</a> was previously a village known as Battle Bridge which was an ancient crossing of the <a href="River%20Fleet">River Fleet</a>. The original name of the bridge was Broad Ford Bridge.

The name "Battle Bridge" led to a tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the Iceni tribe led by Boudica. The tradition is not supported by any historical evidence and is rejected by modern historians. However, <a href="Lewis%20Spence">Lewis Spence</a>'s 1937 book "Boadicea — warrior queen of the Britons" went so far as to include a map showing the positions of the opposing armies. There is a belief that she was buried between platforms 9 and 10 in <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">King's Cross station</a> in London, England. There is no evidence for this and it is probably a post-<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> invention.

The first English writings appear during the reign of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth</a> following the rediscovery of the works of Tacitus. <a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a> may have reintroduced her to British history as "Voadicea" in 1534. <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a> also included her story in his "Chronicles" (1577), based on Tacitus and Dio, and inspired <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare's</a> younger contemporaries <a href="Francis%20Beaumont">Francis Beaumont</a> and <a href="John%20Fletcher%20%28playwright%29">John Fletcher</a> to write a play, "<a href="Bonduca">Bonduca</a>", in 1610. <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a> wrote a popular poem, "Boadicea, an ode", in 1782.

It was in the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> that Boudica's fame took on legendary proportions as <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> came to be seen as Boudica's "namesake", their names being identical in meaning. Victoria's <a href="Poet%20Laureate">Poet Laureate</a>, <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>, wrote a poem, "Boadicea", and <a href="HMS%20Boadicea">several ships</a> were named after her.



She has also appeared in several comic book series, including:

Boudica has been the subject of multiple films:




Boudica's story is the subject of several novels, including books by J. F.

Borneo

Borneo (; , ) is the third-<a href="List%20of%20islands%20by%20area">largest island in the world</a> and the largest in <a href="Asia">Asia</a>. At the geographic centre of <a href="Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia">Maritime Southeast Asia</a>, in relation to major Indonesian islands, it is located north of <a href="Java%20Island">Java</a>, west of <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a>, and east of <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>.

The <a href="list%20of%20divided%20islands">island is politically divided</a> among three countries: <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a> in the north, and <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> to the south. Approximately 73% of the island is Indonesian territory. In the north, the <a href="East%20Malaysia">East Malaysia</a>n states of <a href="Sabah">Sabah</a> and <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a> make up about 26% of the island. Additionally, the Malaysian federal territory of <a href="Labuan">Labuan</a> is situated on a small island just off the coast of Borneo. The sovereign state of <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a>, located on the north coast, comprises about 1% of Borneo's land area.

<a href="Antipodes">Antipodal</a> to an area of <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a>, Borneo is itself home to one of the oldest <a href="Tropical%20rainforest">rainforests</a> in the world.

The island is known by many names. Internationally it is known as "Borneo", after <a href="Empire%20of%20Brunei">Brunei</a>, derived from European contact with the kingdom in the 16th century during the <a href="Age%20of%20Exploration">Age of Exploration</a>. The name "Brunei" possibly derives from the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word """" (), meaning either "water" or the mythological <a href="Varuna">Varuna</a>, the Hindu god of rain. <a href="Native%20Indonesian">Indonesian natives</a> called it "<a href="Kalimantan">Kalimantan</a>," which was derived from the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word "Kalamanthana," meaning "burning weather island" (to describe its hot and humid <a href="tropical">tropical</a> weather).

In earlier times, the island was known by other names. In 977, <a href="History%20of%20China">Chinese records</a> began to use the term "Po-ni" to refer to Borneo or Brunei. In 1225, it was also mentioned by the Chinese official <a href="Zhao%20Rugua">Chau Ju-Kua</a> (趙汝适). The Javanese manuscript <a href="Nagarakretagama">Nagarakretagama</a>, written by <a href="Majapahit">Majapahit</a> court poet <a href="Mpu%20Prapanca">Mpu Prapanca</a> in 1365, mentioned the island as "Nusa Tanjungnagara", which means the island of the <a href="Tanjungpura%20Kingdom">Tanjungpura Kingdom</a>.

 by the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a> to the north and northwest, the <a href="Sulu%20Sea">Sulu Sea</a> to the northeast, the <a href="Celebes%20Sea">Celebes Sea</a> and the <a href="Makassar%20Strait">Makassar Strait</a> to the east, and the <a href="Java%20Sea">Java Sea</a> and <a href="Karimata%20Strait">Karimata Strait</a> to the south. To the west of Borneo are the <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a> and <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>. To the south and east are islands of Indonesia: <a href="Java%20%28island%29">Java</a> and <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a>, respectively. To the northeast are the <a href="Philippines">Philippine Islands</a>. With an area of , it is the third-largest island in the world, and is the largest island of <a href="Asia">Asia</a> (the largest continent). Its highest point is <a href="Mount%20Kinabalu">Mount Kinabalu</a> in <a href="Sabah">Sabah</a>, Malaysia, with an elevation of . Before sea levels rose at the end of the last <a href="Ice%20Age">Ice Age</a>, Borneo was part of the mainland of Asia, forming, with <a href="Java">Java</a> and <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, the upland regions of a peninsula that extended east from present day <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>. The <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a> and <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> now submerge the former low-lying areas of the peninsula. Deeper waters separating Borneo from neighbouring <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> prevented a land connection to that island, creating the divide known as <a href="Wallace%27s%20Line">Wallace's Line</a> between Asian and Australia-<a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> biological regions.
The largest river system is the <a href="Kapuas%20River">Kapuas</a> in <a href="West%20Kalimantan">West Kalimantan</a>, with a length of . Other major rivers include the <a href="Mahakam%20River">Mahakam</a> in <a href="East%20Kalimantan">East Kalimantan</a> (), the <a href="Barito%20River">Barito</a> in <a href="South%20Kalimantan">South Kalimantan</a> (), <a href="Rajang%20River">Rajang</a> in Sarawak () and <a href="Kinabatangan%20River">Kinabatangan</a> in Sabah (). Borneo has significant cave systems. In Sarawak, the Clearwater Cave has one of the world's longest underground rivers while <a href="Deer%20Cave">Deer Cave</a> is home to over three million <a href="bat">bat</a>s, with <a href="guano">guano</a> accumulated to over deep. The <a href="Gomantong%20Caves">Gomantong Caves</a> in Sabah has been dubbed as the "Cockroach Cave" due to the presence of million of cockroaches inside the cave. The <a href="Gunung%20Mulu%20National%20Park">Gunung Mulu National Park</a> in Sarawak and <a href="Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat%20Karst">Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat Karst</a> in East Kalimantan which particularly a <a href="karst">karst</a> areas contains thousands of smaller caves.

The Borneo <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> is estimated to be around 140 million years old, making it one of the oldest rainforests in the world. It is the centre of the evolution and distribution of many <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> species of plants and animals, and the rainforest is one of the few remaining <a href="Habitat%20%28ecology%29">natural habitats</a> for the endangered <a href="Bornean%20orangutan">Bornean orangutan</a>. It is an important refuge for many endemic forest species, including the <a href="Borneo%20elephant">Borneo elephant</a>, the <a href="eastern%20Sumatran%20rhinoceros">eastern Sumatran rhinoceros</a>, the <a href="Bornean%20clouded%20leopard">Bornean clouded leopard</a>, the <a href="hose%27s%20palm%20civet">hose's palm civet</a> and the <a href="dayak%20fruit%20bat">dayak fruit bat</a>.

<a href="Borneo%20peat%20swamp%20forests">Peat swamp forests</a> occupy the entire coastline of Borneo. The soil of the peat swamp are comparatively infertile, while it is known to be the home of various bird species such as the <a href="hook-billed%20bulbul">hook-billed bulbul</a>, <a href="helmeted%20hornbill">helmeted hornbill</a> and <a href="rhinoceros%20hornbill">rhinoceros hornbill</a>. There are about 15,000 species of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s with 3,000 species of trees (267 species are <a href="dipterocarp">dipterocarp</a>s), 221 species of terrestrial mammals and 420 species of resident birds in Borneo. There are about 440 freshwater fish species in Borneo (about the same as Sumatra and Java combined). In 2010, the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> (WWF) stated that 123 species have been discovered in Borneo since the "<a href="Heart%20of%20Borneo">Heart of Borneo</a>" agreement was signed in 2007.
The WWF has classified the island into seven distinct <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a>s. Most are lowland regions:
The highest elevations of <a href="Mount%20Kinabalu">Mount Kinabalu</a> are home to the Kinabalu mountain <a href="alpine%20meadow">alpine meadow</a>, an alpine shrubland notable for its numerous endemic species, including many orchids.

The island historically had extensive rainforest cover, but the area was reduced due to heavy <a href="logging">logging</a> by the Indonesian and Malaysian wood industry, especially with the large demands of raw materials from <a href="developed%20country">industrial countries</a> along with the conversion of forest lands for large-scale agricultural purposes. Half of the annual global <a href="tropical%20timber">tropical timber</a> acquisition comes from Borneo. <a href="Palm%20oil">Palm oil</a> plantations have been widely developed and are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest. <a href="Wildfire">Forest fires</a> since 1997, started by the locals to clear the forests for plantations were exacerbated by an exceptionally dry <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a> season, worsening the annual shrinkage of the rainforest. During these fires, hotspots were visible on <a href="Satellite%20imagery">satellite images</a> and resulting <a href="haze">haze</a> that frequently affecting Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and if turns much worse the haze will also reaching to southern <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> as evidenced on the <a href="2015%20Southeast%20Asian%20haze">2015 Southeast Asian haze</a>.

According to ancient Chinese (977), Indian and Japanese manuscripts, western coastal cities of Borneo had become trading ports by the first millennium AD. In Chinese manuscripts, gold, <a href="camphor">camphor</a>, <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a> shells, <a href="hornbill%20ivory">hornbill ivory</a>, <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a> horn, <a href="Crane%20%28bird%29">crane crest</a>, <a href="beeswax">beeswax</a>, <a href="lakawood">lakawood</a> (a scented heartwood and root wood of a thick <a href="liana">liana</a>, "Dalbergia parviflora"), <a href="dragon%27s%20blood">dragon's blood</a>, <a href="rattan">rattan</a>, edible <a href="bird%27s%20nest%20soup">bird's nests</a> and various spices were described as among the most valuable items from Borneo. The <a href="demographics%20of%20India">Indians</a> named Borneo "Suvarnabhumi" (the land of gold) and also "Karpuradvipa" (Camphor Island). The <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a> named Borneo "Puradvipa", or Diamond Island. <a href="Archaeological">Archaeological</a> findings in the Sarawak river delta reveal that the area was a thriving centre of trade between India and China from the 6th century until about 1300.

Stone pillars bearing inscriptions in the <a href="Pallava%20script">Pallava script</a>, found in <a href="Kutai">Kutai</a> along the <a href="Mahakam%20River">Mahakam River</a> in <a href="East%20Kalimantan">East Kalimantan</a> and dating to around the second half of the 4th century, constitute some of the oldest evidence of <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> influence in Southeast Asia. By the 14th century, Borneo became a <a href="vassal%20state">vassal state</a> of <a href="Majapahit">Majapahit</a> (in present-day Indonesia), later changing its allegiance to the <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a> of China. The religion of <a href="Islam">Islam</a> entered the island in the 10th century, following the arrival of Muslim traders who later converted many indigenous peoples in the coastal areas.

The Sultanate of Brunei declared independence from Majapahit following the death of Majapahit Emperor in mid-14th century. During its golden age under <a href="Bolkiah">Bolkiah</a> from the 15th century to the 17th century, the <a href="Bruneian%20Empire">Bruneian Empire</a> ruled almost entire coastal area of Borneo (lending its name to the island due to its influence in the region) and several islands in the Philippines. During the 1450s, <a href="Sharif%20ul-H%C4%81shim%20of%20Sulu">Shari'ful Hashem Syed Abu Bakr</a>, an Arab born in <a href="Johor">Johor</a>, arrived in Sulu from Malacca. In 1457, he founded the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Sulu">Sultanate of Sulu</a>; he titled himself as "Paduka Maulana Mahasari Sharif Sultan Hashem Abu Bakr". Following their independence in 1578 from Brunei's influence, the Sulu's began to expand their <a href="thalassocracy">thalassocracy</a> to parts of the northern Borneo. Both the sultanates who ruled northern Borneo had traditionally engaged in trade with China by means of the frequently-arriving Chinese <a href="junk%20%28ship%29">junk</a>s. Despite the thalassocracy of the sultanates, Borneo's interior region remained free from the rule of any kingdoms.

Since the <a href="Capture%20of%20Malacca%20%281511%29">fall of Malacca</a> in 1511, Portuguese merchants traded regularly with Borneo, and especially with Brunei from 1530. Having visited Brunei's capital, the Portuguese described the place as surrounded by a <a href="stone%20wall">stone wall</a>. While Borneo was seen as rich, the Portuguese did not make any attempts to conquer it. The Spanish visit to Brunei led to the <a href="Castilian%20War">Castilian War</a> in 1578. The English began to trade with <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Sambas">Sambas</a> of southern Borneo in 1609, while the Dutch only began their trade in 1644: to Banjar and Martapura, also in the southern Borneo. The Dutch tried to settle the island of <a href="Balambangan%20Island">Balambangan</a>, north of Borneo, in the second half of the 18th century, but withdrew by 1797. In 1812, the sultan in southern Borneo ceded his forts to the <a href="English%20East%20India%20Company">English East India Company</a>. The English, led by <a href="Stamford%20Raffles">Stamford Raffles</a>, then tried to establish an intervention in Sambas but failed. Although they managed to defeat the Sultanate the next year and declared a blockade on all ports in Borneo except Brunei, <a href="Banjarmasin">Banjarmasin</a> and <a href="Pontianak%2C%20Indonesia">Pontianak</a>, the project was cancelled by the British Governor-General <a href="Gilbert%20Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Minto">Lord Minto</a> in India as it was too expensive. At the beginning of British and Dutch exploration on the island, they described the island of Borneo as full of <a href="headhunting">head hunters</a>, with the indigenous in the interior practising <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a>, and the waters around the island infested with <a href="piracy">pirates</a>, especially between the north eastern Borneo and the southern Philippines. The <a href="Malay%20race">Malay</a> and <a href="Iban%20people">Sea Dayak</a> pirates preyed on maritime shipping in the waters between Singapore and Hong Kong from their haven in Borneo, along with the attacks by <a href="Illanun">Illanun</a>s of the <a href="Moro%20Pirates">Moro Pirates</a> from the southern Philippines, such as in the <a href="Battle%20off%20Mukah">Battle off Mukah</a>.
The Dutch began to intervene in the southern part of the island upon resuming contact in 1815, posting <a href="Resident%20%28title%29">Resident</a>s to Banjarmasin, Pontianak and Sambas and Assistant-Residents to Landak and Mampawa. The Sultanate of Brunei in 1842 granted large parts of land in Sarawak to the English adventurer <a href="James%20Brooke">James Brooke</a>, as a reward for his help in quelling a local rebellion. Brooke established the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sarawak">Kingdom of Sarawak</a> and was recognised as its rajah after paying a fee to the Sultanate. He established a monarchy, and the Brooke dynasty (through his nephew and great-nephew) ruled Sarawak for 100 years; the leaders were known as the <a href="White%20Rajahs">White Rajahs</a>. Brooke also acquired the island of <a href="Labuan">Labuan</a> for <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a> in 1846 through the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Labuan">Treaty of Labuan</a> with the Sultan of Brunei, <a href="Omar%20Ali%20Saifuddin%20II">Omar Ali Saifuddin II</a> on 18 December 1846. The region of northern Borneo came under the administration of <a href="North%20Borneo%20Chartered%20Company">North Borneo Chartered Company</a> following the acquisition of territory from the Sultanates of Brunei and Sulu by a German businessman and adventurer named <a href="Gustav%20Overbeck">Baron von Overbeck</a>, before it was passed to British Dent brothers (comprising <a href="Alfred%20Dent">Alfred Dent</a> and Edward Dent). Further enroachment by the British reduced the territory of Brunei. This led the 26th Sultan of Brunei, <a href="Hashim%20Jalilul%20Alam%20Aqamaddin">Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin</a> to appeal the British to stop, and as a result a Treaty of Protection was signed in 1888, rendering Brunei a British protectorate.
Before the acquisition by the British, the Americans also managed to establish their temporary presence in northwestern Borneo after acquiring a parcel of land from the Sultanate of Brunei. A company known as <a href="American%20Trading%20Company%20of%20Borneo">American Trading Company of Borneo</a> was formed by <a href="Joseph%20William%20Torrey">Joseph William Torrey</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Bradley%20Harris">Thomas Bradley Harris</a> and several Chinese investors, establishing a colony named "Ellena" in the <a href="Kimanis">Kimanis</a> area. The colony failed and was abandoned, due to denials of financial backing, especially by the US government, and to diseases and riots among the workers. Before Torrey left, he managed to sell the land to the German businessman, Overbeck. Meanwhile, the Germans under William Frederick Schuck was awarded a parcel of land in northeastern Borneo of the Sandakan Bay from the Sultanate of Sulu where he operate business and export large quantities of arms, <a href="opium">opium</a>, textiles and tobacco to Sulu before the land were also passed to Overbeck by the Sultanate.

Prior to the recognition of Spanish presence in the Philippine archipelago, a protocol known as the <a href="Madrid%20Protocol%20of%201885">Madrid Protocol of 1885</a> was signed between the governments of the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> to cement Spanish influence and recognise their sovereignty over the Sultanate of Sulu—in return for Spain's relinquishing its claim to the former possessions of the Sultanate in northern Borneo. The British administration then established the first railway network in northern Borneo, known as the <a href="North%20Borneo%20Railway">North Borneo Railway</a>. During this time, the British sponsored a large number of Chinese workers to migrate to northern Borneo to work in European plantation and mines, and the Dutch followed suit to increase their economic production. By 1888, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei in northern Borneo had become British <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a>. The area in southern Borneo was made Dutch protectorate in 1891. The Dutch who already claimed the whole Borneo were asked by Britain to delimit their boundaries between the two colonial territories to avoid further conflicts. The British and Dutch governments had signed the <a href="Anglo-Dutch%20Treaty%20of%201824">Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824</a> to exchange trading ports in <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a> and <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> that were under their controls and assert spheres of influence. This resulted in indirectly establishing British- and Dutch-controlled areas in the north (Malay Peninsula) and south (Sumatra and Riau Islands) respectively.

During World War II, Japanese forces gained control and occupied most areas of Borneo from 1941–45. In the first stage of the war, the British saw the Japanese advance to Borneo as motivated by political and territorial ambitions rather than economic factors. The occupation drove many people in the coastal towns to the interior, searching for food and escaping the Japanese. The Chinese residents in Borneo, especially with the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Sino-Japanese War</a> in <a href="Mainland%20China">Mainland China</a> mostly resisted the Japanese occupation. Following the formation of resistance movements in northern Borneo such as the <a href="Jesselton%20Revolt">Jesselton Revolt</a>, many innocent indigenous and Chinese people were executed by the Japanese for their alleged involvement.

In Kalimantan, the Japanese also killed many Malay intellectuals, executing all the Malay Sultans of West Kalimantan in the <a href="Pontianak%20incidents">Pontianak incidents</a>, together with Chinese people who were already against the Japanese for suspecting them to be threats. Sultan <a href="Muhammad%20Ibrahim%20Shafi%20ud-din%20II">Muhammad Ibrahim Shafi ud-din II</a> of <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Sambas">Sambas</a> was executed in 1944. The Sultanate was thereafter suspended and replaced by a Japanese council. The Japanese also set-up "Pusat Tenaga Rakjat" (PUTERA) in the Indonesian archipelago in 1943, although it was abolished the following year when it become too nationalistic. Some of the Indonesian nationalist like <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a> and <a href="Mohammad%20Hatta">Hatta</a> who had returned from Dutch exile began to co-operate with the Japanese. Shortly after his release, Sukarno became President of the Central Advisory Council, an advisory council for south Borneo, <a href="Celebes%20Islands">Celebes</a>, and <a href="Lesser%20Sunda%20Islands">Lesser Sunda</a>, set up in February 1945.

Since the <a href="fall%20of%20Singapore">fall of Singapore</a>, the Japanese sent several thousand of British and Australian <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> to camps in Borneo such as <a href="Batu%20Lintang%20camp">Batu Lintang camp</a>. From the <a href="Sandakan%20camp">Sandakan camp</a> site, only six of some 2,500 prisoners survived after they were forced to march in an event known as the <a href="Sandakan%20Death%20March">Sandakan Death March</a>. In addition, of the total of 17,488 <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a> labourers brought in by the Japanese during the occupation, only 1,500 survived mainly due to starvation, harsh working conditions and maltreatment. The Dayak and other indigenous people played a role in <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a> against the occupying forces, particularly in the <a href="Kapit%20Division">Kapit Division</a>. They temporarily revived headhunting of Japanese toward the end of the war, with Allied <a href="Z%20Special%20Unit">Z Special Unit</a> provided assistance to them. Australia contributed significantly to the liberation of Borneo. The <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> was sent to Borneo to fight off the Japanese. Together with other Allies, the island <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">was completely liberated</a> in 1945.

Towards the end of the war, Japan decided to give an early independence to a new proposed country of Indonesia on 17 July 1945, with an Independence Committee meeting scheduled for 19 August 1945. However, following the <a href="surrender%20of%20Japan">surrender of Japan</a> to the Allied forces, the meeting was shelved. Sukarno and Hatta continued the plan by unilaterally declaring independence, although the Dutch tried to retake their colonial possession in Borneo. The southern part of the island achieved its independence through the <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">Proclamation of Indonesian Independence</a> on 17 August 1945. The reaction was relatively muted with little open fighting in Pontianak or in the Chinese majority areas. While nationalist guerrillas supporting the inclusion of southern Borneo in the new Indonesian republic were active in Ketapang, and to lesser extent in Sambas where they rallied with the red-white flag which became the <a href="flag%20of%20Indonesia">flag of Indonesia</a>, most of the Chinese residents in southern Borneo expected to be liberate by <a href="National%20Revolutionary%20Army">Chinese Nationalist troops</a> from Mainland China and to integrate their districts as an overseas province of <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%9349%29">China</a>.

In May 1945, officials in Tokyo suggested that whether northern Borneo should be included in the proposed new country of Indonesia should be separately determined based on the desires of its indigenous people and following the disposition of <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a>. Sukarno and <a href="Mohammad%20Yamin">Mohammad Yamin</a> meanwhile continuously advocated for a <a href="Greater%20Indonesia">Greater Indonesia</a>n republic. As the President of the new republic, perceiving the British trying to maintain their presence in northern Borneo and Malay Peninsula, he decided to launch a military infiltration later known as the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">confrontation</a> between 1962 until 1969. In 1961, Prime Minister <a href="Tunku%20Abdul%20Rahman">Tunku Abdul Rahman</a> of the independent <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Federation of Malaya</a> desired to unite Malaya, the British colonies of <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Sarawak">Sarawak</a>, <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20North%20Borneo">North Borneo</a>, <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Singapore">Singapore</a> and the Protectorate of <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a> under the proposed <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaysia">Federation of Malaysia</a>. The idea was heavily opposed by the governments in both Indonesia and the Philippines as well from Communist sympathisers and nationalist in Borneo. As a response to the growing opposition, the British deployed their armed forces to guard their colonies against Indonesian and communist revolts, which was also participated by Australia and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.
The Philippines opposed the newly proposed federation, claiming the eastern part of North Borneo (today the Malaysian state of Sabah) as part of its territory as a former possession of the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Sulu">Sultanate of Sulu</a>. The Philippine government mostly based their claim on the Sultanate of Sulu's <a href="cession">cession</a> agreement with the British North Borneo Company, as by now the Sultanate had come under the jurisdiction of the Philippine republican administration, which therefore should inherit the Sulu former territories. The Philippine government also claimed that the heirs of the Sultanate had ceded all their territorial rights to the republic.

The Sultanate of Brunei at the first welcomed the proposal of a new larger federation. Meanwhile, the <a href="Brunei%20People%27s%20Party">Brunei People's Party</a> led by <a href="A.M.%20Azahari">A.M. Azahari</a> desired to reunify Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo into one federation known as the <a href="North%20Borneo%20Federation">North Borneo Federation</a> (), where the <a href="List%20of%20Sultans%20of%20Brunei">Sultan of Brunei</a> would be the head of state for the federation—though Azahari had his own intention to abolish the Brunei Monarchy, to make Brunei more democratic, and to integrate the territory and other former British colonies in Borneo into Indonesia, with the support from the latter government. This directly led to the <a href="Brunei%20Revolt">Brunei Revolt</a>, which thwarted Azahari's attempt and forced him to escape to Indonesia. Brunei withdrew from being part of the new Federation of Malaysia due to some disagreements on other issues while political leaders in Sarawak and North Borneo continued to favour inclusion in a larger federation.

With the continuous opposition from Indonesia and the Philippines, the <a href="Cobbold%20Commission">Cobbold Commission</a> was established to discover the feeling of the native populations in northern Borneo; it found the people greatly in favour of federation, with various stipulations. The federation was successfully achieved with the inclusion of northern Borneo through the <a href="Malaysia%20Agreement">Malaysia Agreement</a> on 16 September 1963. Until present, the area in northern Borneo still subjected to attacks by Moro Pirates since the 18th century, and militants such as the <a href="Abu%20Sayyaf">Abu Sayyaf</a> since 2000 in the frequent <a href="Cross%20border%20attacks%20in%20Sabah">cross border attacks</a>. During the administration of Philippine President of <a href="Ferdinand%20Marcos">Ferdinand Marcos</a>, the President made some attempts to destabilise the state of Sabah, although his plan failed and resulted in the <a href="Jabidah%20massacre">Jabidah massacre</a> and later in <a href="Moro%20conflict">insurgency in the southern Philippines</a>.

The <a href="demonym">demonym</a> for Borneo is Bornean.

Borneo has 19.8 million inhabitants (in mid-2010), a population density of 26 inhabitants per square km. Most of the population lives in coastal cities, although the hinterland has small towns and villages along the rivers. The population consists mainly of <a href="Dayak%20people">Dayak</a> ethnic groups, <a href="Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Malay</a>, <a href="Banjar%20people">Banjar</a>, <a href="Orang%20Ulu">Orang Ulu</a>, <a href="Han%20Chinese">Chinese</a> and <a href="Kadazan-Dusun">Kadazan-Dusun</a>. The <a href="Overseas%20Chinese">Chinese</a>, who make up 29% of the population of <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a> and 17% of total population in <a href="West%20Kalimantan">West Kalimantan</a>, Indonesia are descendants of immigrants primarily from southeastern China.

In Sabah during the administration of <a href="Mustapha%20Harun">Mustapha Harun</a> of the <a href="United%20Sabah%20National%20Organisation">United Sabah National Organisation</a> (USNO) in the 1970s, thousands of Muslim immigrants and refugees from the southern Philippines of <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> and <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> of Indonesia were given sanctuary and later <a href="identity%20card">identity card</a>s in the bid to increase the Muslim population of the state: a policy later known as <a href="Project%20IC">Project IC</a>. Due to the high number of crimes attributed to the new migrant populations, <a href="ethnic%20tension">ethnic tension</a> between the indigenous and migrant populations has risen up to the present.

In Kalimantan since the 1990s, the Indonesian government has undertaken an intense <a href="transmigration%20program">transmigration program</a>; to that end it has financed the relocation of poor, landless families from Java, Madura, and Bali. By 2001, transmigrants made up 21% of the population in <a href="Central%20Kalimantan">Central Kalimantan</a>. Since the 1990s, the indigenous Dayak and Malays have resisted encroachment by these migrants, and violent conflict has occurred between some transmigrant and indigenous populations. In the 1999 <a href="Sambas%20riots">Sambas riots</a>, <a href="Dayak%20people">Dayaks</a> and <a href="Ethnic%20Malays">Malays</a> joined together to massacre thousands of the <a href="Madurese%20people">Madurese</a> migrants.

Ballpoint pen

A ballpoint pen, also known as a biro, or ball pen, is a <a href="pen">pen</a> that dispenses <a href="ink">ink</a> over a <a href="Ball%20%28bearing%29">metal ball</a> at its point, i.e. over a "ball point". The metal commonly used is <a href="steel">steel</a>, <a href="brass">brass</a>, or <a href="tungsten%20carbide">tungsten carbide</a>. It was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to <a href="dip%20pen">dip pen</a>s and <a href="fountain%20pen">fountain pen</a>s, and it is now the world's most-used <a href="Writing%20implement">writing instrument</a>: millions are manufactured and sold daily. As a result, it has influenced art and <a href="graphic%20design">graphic design</a> and spawned <a href="ballpoint%20pen%20artwork">an artwork genre</a>.

Pen manufacturers produce designer ballpoint pens for the <a href="Luxury%20goods">high-end</a> and collectors' markets.

The <a href="Bic%20Cristal">Bic Cristal</a> is a popular disposable type of ballpoint pen whose design is recognised by its place in the permanent collection of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>, New York.

The concept of using a "ball point" within a writing instrument as a method of applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century. In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen.

The first <a href="patent">patent</a> for a ballpoint pen was issued on 30 October 1888, to <a href="John%20J.%20Loud">John J. Loud</a>, who was attempting to make a writing instrument that would be able to write "on rough surfaces-such as wood, coarse wrapping-paper, and other articles" which then-common <a href="fountain%20pen">fountain pen</a>s could not. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited and the patent eventually lapsed.
The manufacture of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as we know them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century. Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens. If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear. Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, <a href="capillary%20action">capillary action</a>, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.

<a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20B%C3%ADr%C3%B3">László Bíró</a>, a Hungarian <a href="newspaper">newspaper</a> editor frustrated by the amount of time that he wasted filling up fountain pens and cleaning up smudged pages, noticed that inks used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge free. He decided to create a pen using the same type of ink. Bíró enlisted the help of his brother György, a chemist, to develop viscous ink formulae for new ballpoint designs.

Bíró's innovation successfully coupled ink-viscosity with a ball-socket mechanism which acted compatibly to prevent ink from drying inside the reservoir while allowing controlled flow. Bíró filed a British patent on 15 June 1938.

In 1941, the Bíró brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Germany and moved to Argentina, where they formed "Bíró Pens of Argentina" and filed a new patent in 1943. Their pen was sold in Argentina as the "Birome" (<a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of the names Bíró and Meyne), which is how ballpoint pens are still known in that country. This new design was licensed by the British, who produced ballpoint pens for <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> aircrew as the "Biro". Ballpoint pens were found to be more versatile than fountain pens, especially at high altitudes, where fountain pens were prone to ink-leakage.

Bíró's patent, and other early patents on ballpoint pens often used the term "ball-point fountain pen".

Following World War II, many companies vied to commercially produce their own ballpoint pen design. In post-war Argentina, success of the Birome ballpoint was limited, but in mid-1945, the "Eversharp" Co., a maker of <a href="mechanical%20pencil">mechanical pencil</a>s, teamed up with <a href="Eberhard%20Faber">Eberhard Faber</a> Co. to license the rights from Birome for sales in the United States.

During the same period, American entrepreneur <a href="Milton%20Reynolds">Milton Reynolds</a> came across a Birome ballpoint pen during a business trip to <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina. Recognizing commercial potential, he purchased several ballpoint samples, returned to the United States, and founded "<a href="Milton%20Reynolds%23The%20Reynolds%20International%20Pen%20Company">Reynolds International Pen Company</a>". Reynolds bypassed the Birome patent with sufficient design alterations to obtain an American patent, beating Eversharp and other competitors to introduce the pen to the U.S. market. Debuting at <a href="Gimbels">Gimbels</a> department store in New York City on 29 October 1945, for US$12.50 each (1945 US dollar value, about $ in dollars), "Reynolds Rocket" became the first commercially successful ballpoint pen. Reynolds went to great extremes to market the pen, with great success; Gimbel's sold many thousands of pens within one week. In Britain, the Miles Martin pen company was producing the first commercially successful ballpoint pens there by the end of 1945.

Neither Reynolds' nor Eversharp's ballpoint lived up to consumer expectations in America. Ballpoint pen sales peaked in 1946, and consumer interest subsequently plunged due to market-saturation. By the early 1950s the ballpoint boom had subsided and Reynolds' company folded.

<a href="Paper%20Mate">Paper Mate</a> pens, among the emerging ballpoint brands of the 1950s, bought the rights to distribute their own ballpoint pens in Canada. Facing concerns about ink-reliability, Paper Mate pioneered new ink formulas and advertised them as "banker-approved". In 1954, <a href="Parker%20Pens">Parker Pens</a> released "<a href="Jotter">The Jotter</a>"—the company's first ballpoint—boasting additional features and technological advances which also included the use of tungsten-carbide textured ball-bearings in their pens. In less than a year, Parker sold several million pens at prices between three and nine dollars. In the 1960s, the failing <a href="Eversharp">Eversharp Co.</a> sold its pen division to Parker and ultimately folded.

<a href="Marcel%20Bich">Marcel Bich</a> also introduced a ballpoint pen to the American marketplace in the 1950s, licensed from Bíró and based on the Argentine designs. Bich shortened his name to Bic in 1953, becoming the ballpoint brand now recognised globally. Bic pens struggled until the company launched its "Writes The First Time, Every Time!" advertising campaign in the 1960s. Competition during this era forced unit prices to drop considerably.

Ballpoint pens are produced in both disposable and refillable models. Refills allow for the entire internal ink reservoir, including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced. Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials. The simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip, which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.

<a href="Rollerball%20pen">Rollerball pen</a>s employ the same ballpoint mechanics, but with the use of water-based inks instead of oil-based inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface. Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to "smearing"—posing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing <a href="right-to-left">right-to-left</a> script)—and "running", should the writing surface become wet.

Because of a ballpoint pen's reliance on gravity to coat the ball with ink, most cannot be used to write upside-down. However, technology developed by Fisher pens in the United States resulted in the production of what came to be known as the "Fisher <a href="Space%20Pen">Space Pen</a>". Space Pens combine a more viscous ink with a pressurised ink reservoir that forces the ink toward the point. Unlike standard ballpoints, the rear end of a Space Pen's pressurized reservoir is sealed, eliminating evaporation and leakage, thus allowing the pen to write upside-down, in zero-gravity environments, and reportedly underwater. Astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space.

Ballpoint pens with "erasable ink" were pioneered by the <a href="Paper%20Mate">Paper Mate</a> pen company. The ink formulas of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to <a href="rubber%20cement">rubber cement</a>, allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent. Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflow—meaning they can also write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.

The inexpensive, disposable <a href="Bic%20Cristal">Bic Cristal</a> (also simply "Bic pen" or "Biro") is reportedly the most widely sold pen in the world. It was the Bic company's first product and is still synonymous with the company name. The Bic Cristal is part of the permanent collection at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, acknowledged for its <a href="industrial%20design">industrial design</a>. Its hexagonal barrel mimics that of a wooden <a href="pencil">pencil</a> and is transparent, showing the ink level in the reservoir. Originally a sealed streamlined cap, the modern pen cap has a small hole at the top to meet safety standards, helping to prevent suffocation if children suck it into the throat.

Multipens are pens that feature multiple varying colored ballpoint refills. Sometimes ballpoint refills are combined with another non-ballpoint refill.

Ballpoint pens are sometimes provided free by businesses, such as hotels, as a form of advertising—printed with a company's name; a ballpoint pen is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (customers will use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities include ballpoint pens in direct mail campaigns to increase a customer's interest in the mailing. Ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events, such as a pen commemorating the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Ballpoint pens have proven to be a versatile <a href="art%20medium">art medium</a> for professional artists as well as amateur <a href="doodle">doodle</a>rs. Low cost, availability, and portability are cited by practitioners as qualities which make this common writing tool a convenient, alternative art supply. Some artists use them within <a href="mixed-media">mixed-media</a> works, while others use them solely as their medium-of-choice.

Effects not generally associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved. Traditional <a href="pen">pen-and-ink</a> techniques such as <a href="stipple">stippling</a> and <a href="cross-hatching">cross-hatching</a> can be used to create half-tones or the illusion of form and volume. For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush. Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork and photography, causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist <a href="Lennie%20Mace">Lennie Mace</a> refers to as the "Wow Factor".

Famous 20th-century artists such as <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, among others, have utilised ballpoint pens to some extent during their careers. Ballpoint pen artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st century, with <a href="contemporary">contemporary</a> artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens; for their technical proficiency, imagination, and innovation. Korean-American artist <a href="Il%20Lee">Il Lee</a> has been creating large-scale, ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s. Since the 1980s, <a href="Lennie%20Mace">Lennie Mace</a> creates imaginative, ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity, applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim. The artist coined terms such as "PENtings" and "Media Graffiti" to describe his varied output. More recently, British artist <a href="James%20Mylne%20%28artist%29">James Mylne</a> has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints, sometimes with minimal mixed-media color. In the mid-2000s (decade), <a href="Juan%20Francisco%20Casas">Juan Francisco Casas</a> generated Internet attention for a series of large-scale, <a href="photorealism">photo-realistic</a> ballpoint duplications of his own <a href="snapshot%20%28photography%29">snapshots</a> of friends, utilising only blue pens.
Using ballpoint pens to create artwork is not without limitations. Color availability and sensitivity of ink to light are among concerns of ballpoint pen artists. Mistakes pose greater risks to ballpoint artists; once a line is drawn, it generally cannot be erased. Additionally, "blobbing" of ink on the drawing surface and "skipping" of ink-flow require consideration when using ballpoint pens for artistic purposes. Although the mechanics of ballpoint pens remain relatively unchanged, ink composition has evolved to solve certain problems over the years, resulting in unpredictable sensitivity to light and some extent of fading.

Although designs and construction vary between brands, basic components of all ballpoint pens are universal. Standard components include the freely rotating "ball point" itself (distributing the ink), a "socket" holding the ball in place, and a self-contained "ink reservoir" supplying ink to the ball. In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity. Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points, then housed in a brass socket.

The function of these components can be compared with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale. The ball point delivers the ink to the writing surface while acting as a "buffer" between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.

The common ballpoint pen is a product of <a href="mass%20production">mass production</a>, with components produced separately on assembly lines. Basic steps in the manufacturing process include production of ink formulas, moulding of metal and plastic components, and assembly. <a href="Marcel%20Bich">Marcel Bich</a> was involved in developing the production of inexpensive ballpoint pens.

The <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> has published standards for ball point and roller ball pens:


The world's largest functioning ballpoint pen was made by Acharya Makunuri Srinivasa in India. The pen measures 5.5 m (18 ft 0.53 in) long and weighs 37.23 kg (82.08 lb 1.24 oz).

A seized nib of a Ballpoint pen can be freed by heating the nib briefly with a cigarette lighter.

Burroughs Corporation

The Burroughs Corporation was a major American manufacturer of business equipment. The company was founded in 1886 as the <a href="American%20Arithmometer%20Company">American Arithmometer Company</a>, and after the 1986 merger with <a href="UNIVAC">Sperry UNIVAC</a> was renamed <a href="Unisys">Unisys</a>. The company's history paralleled many of the major developments in <a href="history%20of%20computing">computing</a>. At its start it produced mechanical <a href="adding%20machine">adding machine</a>s, and later moved into programmable ledgers and then computers. It was one of the largest producers of <a href="mainframe%20computer">mainframe computer</a>s in the world, also producing related equipment including <a href="typewriter">typewriter</a>s and <a href="Printer%20%28computing%29">printer</a>s.

In 1886, the American Arithmometer Company was established in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> to produce and sell an <a href="adding%20machine">adding machine</a> invented by <a href="William%20Seward%20Burroughs%20I">William Seward Burroughs</a> (grandfather of <a href="Beat%20Generation">Beat Generation</a> author <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>). In 1904, six years after Burroughs' death, the company moved to Detroit and changed its name to the Burroughs Adding Machine Company. It was soon the biggest adding machine company in America.

The adding machine range began with the basic, hand-cranked P100 which was only capable of adding. The design included some revolutionary features, foremost of which was the <a href="dashpot">dashpot</a>. The P200 offered a subtraction capability and the P300 provided a means of keeping 2 separate totals. The P400 provided a moveable carriage, and the P600 and top-of-the-range P612 offered some limited programmability based upon the position of the carriage. The range was further extended by the inclusion of the "J" series which provided a single finger calculation facility, and the "c" series of both manual and electrical assisted <a href="comptometer">comptometer</a>s. In the late 1960s, the Burroughs sponsored <a href="Nixie%20tube">"nixi-tube"</a> provided an electronic display calculator. Burroughs developed a range of adding machines with different capabilities, gradually increasing in their capabilities. A revolutionary adding machine was the "Sensimatic", which was able to perform many business functions semi-automatically. It had a moving programmable carriage to maintain <a href="general%20ledger">ledgers</a>. It could store 9, 18 or 27 <a href="Trial%20balance">balances</a> during the ledger posting operations and worked with a mechanical adder named a Crossfooter. The Sensimatic developed into the "Sensitronic" which could store balances on a <a href="Magnetic%20stripe%20card">magnetic stripe</a> which was part of the ledger card. This balance was read into the accumulator when the card was inserted into the carriage. The Sensitronic was followed by the E1000, E2000, E3000, E4000, E6000 and the E8000, which were computer systems supporting card reader/punches and a <a href="line%20printer">line printer</a>.

Later, Burroughs was selling more than adding machines, including typewriters. But the biggest shift in company history came in 1953: the Burroughs Adding Machine Company was renamed the Burroughs Corporation and began moving into computer products, initially for banking institutions. This move began with Burroughs' purchase, in June 1956, of the ElectroData Corporation in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>, a spinoff of the Consolidated Engineering Corporation which had designed test instruments and had a cooperative relationship with <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Caltech</a> in Pasadena. ElectroData had built the Datatron 205 and was working on the Datatron 220. The first major computer product that came from this marriage was the B205 tube computer. In the late 1960s the L and TC series range was produced (e.g. the TC500—Terminal Computer 500) which had a <a href="IBM%20Selectric%20typewriter">golf ball printer</a> and in the beginning a 1K (64 bit) disk <a href="Computer%20memory">memory</a>. These were popular as branch <a href="Computer%20terminal">terminal</a>s to the B5500/6500/6700 systems, and sold well in the banking sector, where they were often connected to non-Burroughs mainframes. In conjunction with these products, Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of cheque processing equipment, normally attached as terminals to a larger system such as a B2700 or B1700.

Burroughs was one of the nine major United States computer companies in the 1960s, with <a href="IBM">IBM</a> the largest, <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a>, <a href="NCR%20Corporation">NCR Corporation</a>, <a href="Control%20Data%20Corporation">Control Data Corporation</a> (CDC), <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> (GE), <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> (DEC), <a href="RCA">RCA</a> and <a href="Sperry%20Rand">Sperry Rand</a> (<a href="UNIVAC">UNIVAC</a> line). In terms of sales, Burroughs was always a distant second to <a href="IBM">IBM</a>. In fact, IBM's market share was so much larger than all of the others that this group was often referred to as "IBM and the Seven Dwarfs." By 1972 when GE and RCA were no longer in the mainframe business, the remaining five companies behind IBM became known as the <a href="BUNCH">BUNCH</a>, an <a href="acronym">acronym</a> based on their initials.

At the same time, Burroughs was very much a competitor. Like IBM, Burroughs tried to supply a complete line of products for its customers, including Burroughs-designed printers, <a href="disk%20drive">disk drive</a>s, <a href="tape%20drive">tape drive</a>s, computer printing paper, and even <a href="typewriter%20ribbon">typewriter ribbon</a>s.

In the 1950s, Burroughs worked with the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Bank">Federal Reserve Bank</a> on the development and computer processing of <a href="magnetic%20ink%20character%20recognition">magnetic ink character recognition</a> (MICR) especially for the processing of bank cheques. Burroughs made special MICR/OCR sorter/readers which attached to their medium systems line of computers (<a href="Burroughs%20B2000">2700/3700/4700</a>) and this entrenched the company in the computer side of the banking industry.

The Burroughs Corporation developed three highly innovative <a href="computer%20architecture">architectures</a>, based on the design philosophy of "<a href="language-directed%20design">language-directed design</a>". Their machine instruction sets favored one or many <a href="high%20level%20programming%20languages">high level programming languages</a>, such as <a href="ALGOL">ALGOL</a>, <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a> or <a href="FORTRAN">FORTRAN</a>. All three architectures were considered <a href="Mainframe%20computer">mainframe</a> class machines:

In September 1986, Burroughs Corporation merged with <a href="Sperry%20Corporation">Sperry Corporation</a> to form <a href="Unisys">Unisys</a>. For a time, the combined company retained the Burroughs processors as the A- and V-systems lines. However, as the market for large systems shifted from proprietary architectures to common servers, the company eventually dropped the V-Series line, although customers continued to use V-series systems . Unisys continues to develop and market the A-Series, now known as ClearPath.

In 2010, UNISYS sold off its Payment Systems Division to <a href="Marlin%20Equity%20Partners">Marlin Equity Partners</a>, a California-based private investment firm, which incorporated it as Burroughs Payment Systems based in <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Michigan">Plymouth, Michigan</a>.

Burroughs B205 hardware has appeared as props in many <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> television and film productions from the late 1950s. For example, a B205 <a href="front%20panel">console</a> was often shown in the television series "<a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">Batman</a>" as the "Bat Computer"; also as the computer in "<a href="Lost%20in%20Space">Lost in Space</a>". B205 tape drives were often seen in series such as "<a href="The%20Time%20Tunnel">The Time Tunnel</a>" and "<a href="Voyage%20to%20the%20Bottom%20of%20the%20Sea%20%28TV%20series%29">Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea</a>".

Brick

A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in <a href="masonry">masonry</a> construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of <a href="clay">clay</a>, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are "fired" and "non-fired" bricks.

<a href="Concrete%20masonry%20unit">Block</a> is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from <a href="expanded%20clay%20aggregate">expanded clay aggregate</a>.

Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest <a href="building%20material">building material</a>s, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 5000 BC. Air-dried bricks, also known as <a href="mudbrick">mudbrick</a>s, have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.

Bricks are laid in "courses" and numerous patterns known as "bonds", collectively known as <a href="brickwork">brickwork</a>, and may be laid in various kinds of <a href="mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a> to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.

The earliest bricks were "dried brick", meaning that they were formed from clay-bearing earth or mud and dried (usually in the sun) until they were strong enough for use. The oldest discovered bricks, originally made from shaped mud and dating before 7500 BC, were found at <a href="Tell%20Aswad">Tell Aswad</a>, in the upper <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a> region and in southeast <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> close to <a href="Diyarbakir">Diyarbakir</a>. Other more recent findings, dated between 7,000 and 6,395 BC, come from <a href="Jericho">Jericho</a>, <a href="Catal%20H%C3%BCy%C3%BCk">Catal Hüyük</a>, the ancient Egyptian fortress of <a href="Buhen">Buhen</a>, and the ancient <a href="Indus%20Valley">Indus Valley</a> cities of <a href="Mohenjo-daro">Mohenjo-daro</a>, <a href="Harappa">Harappa</a>, and <a href="Mehrgarh">Mehrgarh</a>. Ceramic, or "fired brick" was used as early as 3000 BC in early Indus Valley cities.

In <a href="History%20of%20China">pre-modern China</a>, bricks were being used from the 2nd millennium BC at a site near <a href="Xi%27an">Xi'an</a>. Bricks were produced on a larger scale under the <a href="Western%20Zhou">Western Zhou</a> dynasty about 3,000 years ago, and evidence for some of the first fired bricks ever produced has been discovered in ruins dating back to the Zhou. The carpenter's manual "<a href="Yingzao%20Fashi">Yingzao Fashi</a>", published in 1103 at the time of the <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> described the brick making process and <a href="Ceramic%20glaze">glazing</a> techniques then in use. Using the 17th century encyclopaedic text "<a href="Song%20Yingxing">Tiangong Kaiwu</a>", historian <a href="Timothy%20Brook%20%28historian%29">Timothy Brook</a> outlined the brick production process of <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> China:

Early civilisations around the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> adopted the use of fired bricks, including the <a href="Ancient%20Greeks">Ancient Greeks</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>. The <a href="Roman%20legion">Roman legion</a>s operated mobile <a href="kiln">kiln</a>s, and built large brick structures throughout the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, stamping the bricks with the seal of the legion.

During the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Middle Ages</a> the use of bricks in construction became popular in <a href="Northern%20Europe">Northern Europe</a>, after being introduced there from Northern-Western <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. An independent style of brick architecture, known as <a href="brick%20Gothic">brick Gothic</a> (similar to <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic architecture</a>) flourished in places that lacked indigenous sources of rocks. Examples of this architectural style can be found in modern-day <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, and <a href="Russia">Russia</a>.

This style evolved into <a href="List%20of%20Brick%20Renaissance%20buildings">Brick Renaissance</a> as the stylistic changes associated with the <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a> spread to northern Europe, leading to the adoption of <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Renaissance</a> elements into brick building. A clear distinction between the two styles only developed at the transition to <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque architecture</a>. In <a href="L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a>, for example, Brick Renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist Statius von Düren, who was also active at <a href="Schwerin">Schwerin</a> (<a href="Schwerin%20Castle">Schwerin Castle</a>) and <a href="Wismar">Wismar</a> (Fürstenhof).
Long-distance <a href="bulk%20transport">bulk transport</a> of bricks and other construction equipment remained prohibitively expensive until the development of modern transportation infrastructure, with the construction of <a href="canal">canal</a>, <a href="road">road</a>s, and <a href="railway">railway</a>s.

Production of bricks increased massively with the onset of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> and the rise in factory building in England. For reasons of speed and economy, bricks were increasingly preferred as building material to stone, even in areas where the stone was readily available. It was at this time in <a href="London">London</a>, that bright red brick was chosen for construction to make the buildings more visible in the heavy fog and to help prevent traffic accidents.

The transition from the traditional method of production known as hand-moulding to a mechanised form of mass-production slowly took place during the first half of the nineteenth century. Possibly the first successful brick-making machine was <a href="patent">patent</a>ed by Henry Clayton, employed at the Atlas Works in <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>, England, in 1855, and was capable of producing up to 25,000 bricks daily with minimal supervision. His mechanical apparatus soon achieved widespread attention after it was adopted for use by the <a href="South%20Eastern%20Railway%2C%20UK">South Eastern Railway Company</a> for brick-making at their factory near <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a>. The <a href="Bradley%20%26amp%3B%20Craven%20Ltd">Bradley & Craven Ltd</a> ‘Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine’ was patented in 1853, apparently predating Clayton. Bradley & Craven went on to be a dominant manufacturer of brickmaking machinery. Predating both Clayton and Bradley & Craven Ltd. however was the brick making machine patented by Richard A. Ver Valen of Haverstraw, New York in 1852.

The demand for high office building construction at the turn of the 20th century led to a much greater use of <a href="cast%20iron">cast</a> and <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a>, and later, steel and <a href="concrete">concrete</a>. The use of brick for <a href="skyscraper">skyscraper</a> construction severely limited the size of the building – the <a href="Monadnock%20Building">Monadnock Building</a>, built in 1896 in Chicago, required exceptionally thick walls to maintain the structural integrity of its 17 storeys.

Following pioneering work in the 1950s at the <a href="ETH%20Zurich">Swiss Federal Institute of Technology</a> and the <a href="Building%20Research%20Establishment">Building Research Establishment</a> in <a href="Watford">Watford</a>, UK, the use of improved masonry for the construction of tall structures up to 18 storeys high was made viable. However, the use of brick has largely remained restricted to small to medium-sized buildings, as steel and concrete remain superior materials for high-rise construction.

There are thousands of types of bricks that are named for their use, size, forming method, origin, quality, texture, and/or materials.

Bricks named for place of origin:

Three basic types of brick are un-fired, fired, and chemically set bricks. Each type is manufactured differently.

Unfired bricks, also known as <a href="mudbrick">mudbrick</a>s, are made from a wet, clay-containing soil mixed with straw or similar binders. They are air-dried until ready for use.

Fired bricks are burned in a kiln which makes them durable. Modern, fired, clay bricks are formed in one of three processes – soft mud, dry press, or extruded. Depending on the country, either the extruded or soft mud method is the most common, since they are the most economical.

Normally, bricks contain the following ingredients:


It starts with the raw clay, preferably in a mix with 25–30% sand to reduce shrinkage. The clay is first ground and mixed with water to the desired consistency. The clay is then pressed into steel moulds with a <a href="Hydraulics">hydraulic</a> press. The shaped clay is then fired ("burned") at 900–1000 °C to achieve strength.

For extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10–15% <a href="water">water</a> (stiff extrusion) or 20–25% water (soft extrusion) in a <a href="pugmill">pugmill</a>. This mixture is forced through a <a href="Die%20%28manufacturing%29">die</a> to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150 °C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the kiln.

European-style extruded bricks or blocks are used in single-wall construction with finishes applied on the inside and outside. Their many voids comprise a greater proportion of the volume than the solid, thin walls of fired clay. Such bricks are made in 15-, 25-, 30-, 42-, and 50-cm widths. Some models have very high thermal insulation properties, making them suitable for <a href="zero-energy%20building">zero-energy building</a>s.

The dry-press method is similar to the soft mud method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more accurate, sharper-edged bricks. The greater force in pressing and the longer burn make this method more expensive.

In modern <a href="brickworks">brickworks</a>, this is usually done in a continuously fired tunnel kiln, in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln on <a href="conveyors">conveyors</a>, rails, or kiln cars, which achieves a more consistent brick product. The bricks often have <a href="Lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>, ash, and organic matter added, which accelerates the burning process.

In <a href="India">India</a>, brick making is typically a manual process. The most common type of brick kiln in use there is the Bull's Trench Kiln (BTK), based on a design developed by British engineer W. Bull in the late 19th century.

An oval or circular trench is dug, 6–9 metres wide, 2-2.5 metres deep, and 100–150 metres in circumference. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with "green" (unfired) bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.

In operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one end of the brick pile; cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport to their destinations. In the middle, the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal, wood, oil, debris, and so on) through access holes in the roof above the trench.

The advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with <a href="clamp%20kiln">clamp</a> or <a href="scove%20kiln">scove kiln</a>s. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying the bricks), and finally out the chimney, where the rising gases create suction that pulls air through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.

As with the rail process above, the BTK process is continuous. A half-dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000–25,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.

The fired colour of tired clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral content of the raw materials, the firing temperature, and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example, pink bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues; as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple, and then to brown or grey at around . The names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour, such as <a href="London%20stock%20brick">London stock brick</a> and Cambridgeshire White. "Brick tinting" may be performed to change the colour of bricks to blend-in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry.

An impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by <a href="salt%20glaze%20pottery">salt glazing</a>, in which salt is added during the burning process, or by the use of a <a href="Slip%20%28ceramics%29">slip</a>, which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped. Subsequent reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the brick base.

Chemically set bricks are not fired but may have the curing process accelerated by the application of heat and pressure in an autoclave.

Calcium-silicate bricks are also called sandlime or flintlime bricks, depending on their ingredients. Rather than being made with clay they are made with <a href="Lime%20%28mineral%29">lime</a> binding the silicate material. The raw materials for calcium-silicate bricks include lime mixed in a proportion of about 1 to 10 with sand, <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, crushed <a href="flint">flint</a>, or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral <a href="colourant">colourant</a>s. The materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated; the mixture is then pressed into moulds and cured in an <a href="autoclave">autoclave</a> for three to fourteen hours to speed the chemical hardening. The finished bricks are very accurate and uniform, although the sharp <a href="arris">arris</a>es need careful handling to avoid damage to brick and bricklayer. The bricks can be made in a variety of colours; white, black, buff, and grey-blues are common, and pastel shades can be achieved. This type of brick is common in Sweden, especially in houses built or renovated in the 1970s. In India these are known as <a href="fly%20ash%20brick">fly ash brick</a>s, manufactured using the FaL-G (fly ash, lime, and gypsum) process. Calcium-silicate bricks are also manufactured in Canada and the United States, and meet the criteria set forth in ASTM C73 – 10 Standard Specification for Calcium Silicate Brick (Sand-Lime Brick).

Bricks formed from <a href="concrete">concrete</a> are usually termed as blocks, and are typically pale grey. They are made from a dry, small aggregate concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either an "egglayer" or static machine. The finished blocks are cured, rather than fired, using low-pressure steam. Concrete blocks are manufactured in a much wider range of shapes and sizes than clay bricks and are also available with a wider range of face treatments – a number of which simulate the appearance of clay bricks.

Concrete bricks are available in many colours and as an engineering brick made with sulfate-resisting Portland cement or equivalent. When made with adequate amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet conditions and retaining walls. They are made to standards BS 6073, EN 771-3. Concrete bricks expand and contract more than clay or sandlime bricks so they need movement joints every 5 to 6 metres, but are similar to other bricks of similar density in thermal and sound resistance and fire resistance.

<a href="Compressed%20earth%20block">Compressed earth block</a>s are made mostly from slightly moistened local soils compressed with a mechanical hydraulic press or manual lever press. A small amount of a cement binder may be added, resulting in a stabilised compressed earth block.

For efficient handling and laying, bricks must be small enough and light enough to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about four inches (about 100 mm). In most cases, the length of a brick is about twice its width, about eight inches (about 200 mm) or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid "<a href="Brickwork">bonded</a>" in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in "English bond", at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of "stretchers", bricks laid longways, and "headers", bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of "English bond" called "English cross bond" where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true "English bond", the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other.

A bigger brick makes for a thicker (and thus more insulating) wall. Historically, this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates (see for instance the slightly larger size of the Russian brick in table below), while a smaller brick was adequate, and more economical, in warmer regions. A notable illustration of this correlation is the <a href="Green%20Gate">Green Gate</a> in Gdansk; built in 1571 of imported <a href="Dutch%20brick">Dutch brick</a>, too small for the colder climate of Gdansk, it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence. Nowadays this is no longer an issue, as modern walls typically incorporate specialised insulation materials.

The correct brick for a job can be selected from a choice of colour, surface texture, density, weight, absorption, and pore structure, thermal characteristics, thermal and moisture movement, and fire resistance.

In England, the length and width of the common brick has remained fairly constant over the centuries (but see <a href="brick%20tax">brick tax</a>), but the depth has varied from about two inches (about 51 mm) or smaller in earlier times to about two and a half inches (about 64 mm) more recently. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the usual size of a modern brick is 215 × 102.5 × 65 mm (about × ×  inches), which, with a nominal 10 mm ( inch) mortar joint, forms a "<a href="unit%20size">unit size</a>" of 225 × 112.5 × 75 mm (9 × × 3 inches), for a ratio of 6:3:2.

In the United States, modern standard bricks are specified for various uses; most are sized at about 8 ×   ×  inches (203 × 92 × 57 mm). The more commonly used is the modular brick   ×   ×  inches (194 × 92 × 57 mm). This modular brick of with a mortar joint eases the calculation of the number of bricks in a given wall.

Some brickmakers create innovative sizes and shapes for bricks used for plastering (and therefore not visible on the inside of the building) where their inherent mechanical properties are more important than their visual ones. These bricks are usually slightly larger, but not as large as blocks and offer the following advantages:

Blocks have a much greater range of sizes. Standard co-ordinating sizes in length and height (in mm) include 400×200, 450×150, 450×200, 450×225, 450×300, 600×150, 600×200, and 600×225; depths (work size, mm) include 60, 75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and 250. They are usable across this range as they are lighter than clay bricks. The density of solid clay bricks is around 2000 kg/m³: this is reduced by frogging, hollow bricks, and so on, but aerated autoclaved concrete, even as a solid brick, can have densities in the range of 450–850 kg/m³.

Bricks may also be classified as "solid" (less than 25% perforations by volume, although the brick may be "frogged," having indentations on one of the longer faces), "perforated" (containing a pattern of small holes through the brick, removing no more than 25% of the volume), "cellular" (containing a pattern of holes removing more than 20% of the volume, but closed on one face), or "hollow" (containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25% of the brick's volume). Blocks may be solid, cellular or hollow

The term "frog" can refer to the indentation or the implement used to make it. Modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of wood.

The compressive strength of bricks produced in the United States ranges from about 1000 lbf/in² to 15,000 lbf/in² (7 to 105 <a href="MPa">MPa</a> or N/mm² ), varying according to the use to which the brick are to be put. In England clay bricks can have strengths of up to 100 <a href="MPa">MPa</a>, although a common house brick is likely to show a range of 20–40 <a href="MPa">MPa</a>.

In the United States, bricks have been used for both buildings and pavements. Examples of brick use in buildings can be seen in colonial era buildings and other notable structures around the country. Bricks have been used in pavements especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The introduction of asphalt and concrete reduced the use of brick pavements, but it is used as a method of <a href="traffic%20calming">traffic calming</a> or as a decorative surface in <a href="pedestrianized%20zone">pedestrian precincts</a>. For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of <a href="Grand%20Rapids">Grand Rapids</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, were paved with bricks. Today, there are only about 20 blocks of brick-paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all the streets in the city limits). Much like in Grand Rapids, municipalities across the United States began replacing brick streets with inexpensive <a href="asphalt%20concrete">asphalt concrete</a> by the mid-20th century.

Bricks in the <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a> and <a href="glass">glass</a> industries are often used for lining <a href="furnace">furnace</a>s, in particular <a href="refractory">refractory</a> bricks such as <a href="silica">silica</a>, <a href="Periclase">magnesia</a>, <a href="Grog%20%28clay%29">chamotte</a> and neutral (<a href="chromomagnesite">chromomagnesite</a>) <a href="fire%20brick">refractory bricks</a>. This type of brick must have good <a href="thermal%20shock">thermal shock</a> resistance, refractoriness under load, high melting point, and satisfactory <a href="porosity">porosity</a>. There is a large refractory <a href="brick%20industry">brick industry</a>, especially in the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands.

In Northwest Europe, bricks have been used in construction for centuries. Until recently, almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks. Although many houses are now built using a mixture of <a href="concrete%20block">concrete block</a>s and other materials, many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for aesthetic appeal.

<a href="Engineering%20brick">Engineering brick</a>s are used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.

In the UK a <a href="redbrick%20university">redbrick university</a> is one founded and built in the Victorian era. The term is used to refer to such institutions collectively to distinguish them from the older <a href="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> institutions, the post-war 'plate glass' universities, and the "new" universities of the 1990s.

Colombian architect <a href="Rogelio%20Salmona">Rogelio Salmona</a> was noted for his extensive use of red bricks in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals, radial geometry and curves in his designs. Most buildings in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> are made of brick, given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one.

Starting in the 20th century, the use of brickwork declined in some areas due to concerns with earthquakes. Earthquakes such as the <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">San Francisco earthquake of 1906</a> and the <a href="1933%20Long%20Beach%20earthquake">1933 Long Beach earthquake</a> revealed the weaknesses of unreinforced brick masonry in earthquake-prone areas. During seismic events, the mortar cracks and crumbles, and the bricks are no longer held together. Brick masonry with steel reinforcement, which helps hold the masonry together during earthquakes, was used to replace many of the unreinforced masonry buildings. Retrofitting older unreinforced masonry structures has been mandated in many jurisdictions.

Béla Bartók

Béla Viktor János Bartók (; ; 25 March 1881 – 26 September 1945) was a <a href="Hungarian%20people">Hungarian</a> composer, pianist and an ethnomusicologist. He is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century; he and <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> are regarded as Hungary's greatest composers . Through his collection and analytical study of <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>, he was one of the founders of comparative musicology, which later became <a href="ethnomusicology">ethnomusicology</a>. 

Béla Bartók Jr. was born in the small <a href="Banat">Banat</a>ian town of Nagyszentmiklós in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a>, <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> (since 1920 <a href="S%C3%A2nnicolau%20Mare">Sânnicolau Mare</a>, Romania) on 25 March 1881. Bartók had a diverse ancestry. On his father's side, the Bartók family was a Hungarian lower noble family, originating from <a href="Borsodszir%C3%A1k">Borsodszirák</a>, <a href="Borsod%20county">Borsod county</a> . Although his paternal grandmother was of a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Serbian family, Bartók's father, Béla Bartók Sr., considered himself to be an ethnic-born Hungarian. Béla Bartók's mother, Paula (born Paula Voit), was an ethnic German, though she spoke <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a> fluently . She was a native of <a href="Martin%2C%20Slovakia">Turčiansky Svätý Martin (today Martin</a>, <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>).

Béla displayed notable musical talent very early in life: according to his mother, he could distinguish between different dance rhythms that she played on the piano before he learned to speak in complete sentences . By the age of four he was able to play 40 pieces on the piano and his mother began formally teaching him the next year.

Béla was a small and sickly child and suffered from severe eczema until the age of 5 . In 1888, when he was seven, his father (the director of an agricultural school) died suddenly. Béla's mother then took him and his sister, Erzsébet, to live in <a href="Nagysz%C5%91l%C5%91s">Nagyszőlős</a> (today <a href="Vinogradiv">Vinogradiv</a>, Ukraine) and then to <a href="Bratislava">Prešporok</a> ￼￼￼(German: Pressburg, today <a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>, Slovakia). Béla gave his first public recital aged 11 in Nagyszőlős, to a warm critical reception . Among the pieces he played was his own first composition, written two years previously: a short piece called "The Course of the Danube" . Shortly thereafter László Erkel accepted him as a pupil.

From 1899 to 1903, Bartók studied piano under <a href="Istv%C3%A1n%20Thom%C3%A1n">István Thomán</a>, a former student of <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, and composition under <a href="J%C3%A1nos%20Koessler">János Koessler</a> at the <a href="Franz%20Liszt%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music in Budapest</a>. There he met <a href="Zolt%C3%A1n%20Kod%C3%A1ly">Zoltán Kodály</a>, who made a strong impression on him and became a lifelong friend and colleague. In 1903, Bartók wrote his first major orchestral work, "<a href="Kossuth%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Kossuth</a>", a <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a> which honored <a href="Lajos%20Kossuth">Lajos Kossuth</a>, hero of the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201848">Hungarian Revolution of 1848</a>.

The music of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>, whom he met in 1902 at the <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> premiere of "<a href="Also%20sprach%20Zarathustra%20%28Strauss%29">Also sprach Zarathustra</a>," strongly influenced his early work. When visiting a holiday resort in the summer of 1904, Bartók overheard a young nanny, Lidi Dósa from <a href="Kib%C3%A9d">Kibéd</a> in Transylvania, sing folk songs to the children in her care. This sparked his lifelong dedication to folk music.

From 1907, he also began to be influenced by the French composer <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>, whose compositions Kodály had brought back from Paris. Bartók's large-scale orchestral works were still in the style of <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Johannes Brahms</a> and Richard Strauss, but he wrote a number of small piano pieces which showed his growing interest in folk music. The first piece to show clear signs of this new interest is the <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%201%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">String Quartet No. 1</a> in A minor (1908), which contains folk-like elements.

In 1907, Bartók began teaching as a piano professor at the Royal Academy. This position freed him from touring Europe as a pianist and enabled him to work in Hungary. Among his notable students were <a href="Fritz%20Reiner">Fritz Reiner</a>, <a href="Sir%20Georg%20Solti">Sir Georg Solti</a>, <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20S%C3%A1ndor">György Sándor</a>, <a href="Ern%C5%91%20Balogh">Ernő Balogh</a>, and <a href="Lili%20Kraus">Lili Kraus</a>. After Bartók moved to the United States, he taught <a href="Jack%20Beeson">Jack Beeson</a> and <a href="Violet%20Archer">Violet Archer</a>.

In 1908, he and Kodály traveled into the countryside to collect and research old <a href="Hungarian%20people">Magyar</a> folk melodies. Their growing interest in folk music coincided with a contemporary social interest in traditional national culture. They made some surprising discoveries. Magyar folk music had previously been categorised as <a href="Romani%20people">Gypsy</a> music. The classic example is Franz Liszt's famous "<a href="Hungarian%20Rhapsodies">Hungarian Rhapsodies</a>" for piano, which he based on popular art songs performed by <a href="Romani%20people">Romani</a> bands of the time. In contrast, Bartók and Kodály discovered that the old Magyar folk melodies were based on <a href="pentatonic">pentatonic</a> scales, similar to those in Asian folk traditions, such as those of Central Asia, <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> and <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>.

Bartók and Kodály quickly set about incorporating elements of such Magyar peasant music into their compositions. They both frequently quoted folk song melodies "verbatim" and wrote pieces derived entirely from authentic songs. An example is his two volumes entitled "For Children" for solo piano, containing 80 folk tunes to which he wrote accompaniment. Bartók's style in his art music compositions was a synthesis of folk music, classicism, and modernism. His melodic and harmonic sense was profoundly influenced by the folk music of Hungary, Romania, and other nations. He was especially fond of the asymmetrical dance rhythms and pungent harmonies found in <a href="Bulgarian%20music">Bulgarian music</a>. Most of his early compositions offer a blend of nationalist and late Romanticism elements.

In 1909, at the age of 28, Bartók married Márta Ziegler (1893–1967), aged 16. Their son, Béla Bartók III, was born on 22 August 1910. After nearly 15 years together, Bartók divorced Márta in June 1923.

Two months after his divorce, he married <a href="Ditta%20P%C3%A1sztory-Bart%C3%B3k">Ditta Pásztory</a> (1903–1982), a piano student, ten days after proposing to her. She was aged 19, he 42. Their son, Péter, was born in 1924.

In 1911, Bartók wrote what was to be his only opera, "<a href="Bluebeard%27s%20Castle">Bluebeard's Castle</a>", dedicated to Márta. He entered it for a prize by the Hungarian Fine Arts Commission, but they rejected his work as not fit for the stage . In 1917 Bartók revised the score for the 1918 première, and rewrote the ending. Following the <a href="Hungarian%20Soviet%20Republic">1919 revolution</a> in which he actively participated, he was pressured by the <a href="Horthy%27s%20Hungary">Horthy regime</a> to remove the name of the librettist <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bal%C3%A1zs">Béla Balázs</a> from the opera , as he was blacklisted and had left the country for Vienna. "Bluebeard's Castle" received only one revival, in 1936, before Bartók emigrated. For the remainder of his life, although he was passionately devoted to Hungary, its people and its culture, he never felt much loyalty to the government or its official establishments.

After his disappointment over the Fine Arts Commission competition, Bartók wrote little for two or three years, preferring to concentrate on collecting and arranging folk music. He collected first in the <a href="Carpathian%20Basin">Carpathian Basin</a> (then the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20in%20the%2018th%20and%2019th%20century">Kingdom of Hungary</a>), where he notated <a href="Hungarian%20folk%20music">Hungarian</a>, <a href="Music%20of%20Slovakia">Slovak</a>, <a href="Music%20of%20Romania">Romanian</a>, and <a href="Music%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a> folk music. He also collected in <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>, <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>, and (in 1913) <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>. The outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> forced him to stop the expeditions; and he returned to composing, writing the ballet "<a href="The%20Wooden%20Prince">The Wooden Prince</a>" (1914–16) and the <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%202%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">String Quartet No. 2</a> in (1915–17), both influenced by <a href="Debussy">Debussy</a>.

Raised as a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, by his early adulthood Bartók had become an <a href="agnostic">agnostic</a>. He believed that the existence of God could not be determined and was unnecessary. He later became attracted to <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a> and publicly converted to the <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> faith in 1916. As an adult, his son later became president of the Hungarian Unitarian Church .

Bartók wrote another ballet, "<a href="The%20Miraculous%20Mandarin">The Miraculous Mandarin</a>", influenced by <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>, as well as <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>. A modern story of prostitution, robbery, and murder, it was started in 1918, but not performed until 1926 because of its <a href="Human%20sexuality">sexual</a> content. He next wrote his two <a href="violin%20sonata">violin sonata</a>s (written in 1921 and 1922 respectively), which are harmonically and structurally some of his most complex pieces.

In 1927–28, Bartók wrote his <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%203%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Third</a> and <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%204%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Fourth String Quartets</a>, after which his compositions demonstrated his mature style. Notable examples of this period are "<a href="Music%20for%20Strings%2C%20Percussion%20and%20Celesta">Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta</a>" (1936) and <a href="Divertimento%20for%20String%20Orchestra%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Divertimento for String Orchestra</a> (1939). The <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%205%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Fifth String Quartet</a> was composed in 1934, and the <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%206%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Sixth String Quartet</a> (his last) in 1939.

In 1936 he travelled to <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> to collect and study folk music. He worked in collaboration with Turkish composer <a href="Ahmet%20Adnan%20Saygun">Ahmet Adnan Saygun</a> mostly around <a href="Adana">Adana</a> (; ).

In 1940, as the European political situation worsened after the outbreak of World War II, Bartók was increasingly tempted to flee Hungary. He was strongly opposed to the <a href="Nazis">Nazis</a> and Hungary's siding with Germany. After the Nazis came to power in the early 1930s, Bartók refused to give concerts in Germany and broke away from his publisher there. His anti-fascist political views caused him a great deal of trouble with the establishment in Hungary. Having first sent his manuscripts out of the country, Bartók reluctantly emigrated to the U.S. with his wife <a href="Ditta%20P%C3%A1sztory-Bart%C3%B3k">Ditta</a> in October that year. They settled in New York City after arriving on the night of October 29–30, 1940 via a steamer from Lisbon. After joining them in 1942, their son, Péter Bartók, enlisted in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> where he served in the Pacific during the remainder of the war and later settled in Florida where he became a recording and sound engineer. His oldest son, Béla Bartók III, remained in Hungary where he survived the war and later worked as a railroad official until his retirement in the early 1980s.

Although he became an American citizen in 1945, shortly before his death , Bartók never felt fully at home in the USA. He initially found it difficult to compose. Although well known in America as a pianist, ethnomusicologist and teacher, he was not well known as a composer. There was little American interest in his music during his final years. He and his wife Ditta gave some concerts, although demand for them was low. Bartók, who had made some recordings in Hungary, also recorded for <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> after he came to the US; many of these recordings (some with Bartók's own spoken introductions) were later issued on LP and CD .

Supported by a research fellowship from <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, for several years, Bartók and Ditta worked on a large collection of <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a> and <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a> folk songs in Columbia's libraries. Bartók's economic difficulties during his first years in America were mitigated by publication royalties, teaching and performance tours. While his finances were always precarious, he did not live and die in poverty as was the common myth. He had enough friends and supporters to ensure that there was sufficient money and work available for him to live on. Bartók was a proud man and did not easily accept charity. Despite being short on cash at times, he often refused money that his friends offered him out of their own pockets. Although he was not a member of the <a href="ASCAP">ASCAP</a>, the society paid for any medical care he needed during his last two years. Bartók reluctantly accepted this .

The first symptoms of his health problems began late in 1940, when his right shoulder began to show signs of stiffening. In 1942, symptoms increased and he started having bouts of fever, but no underlying disease was diagnosed, in spite of medical examinations. Finally, in April 1944, <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> was diagnosed, but by this time, little could be done .

As his body slowly failed, Bartók found more creative energy, and he produced a final set of masterpieces, partly thanks to the violinist <a href="Joseph%20Szigeti">Joseph Szigeti</a> and the conductor <a href="Fritz%20Reiner">Fritz Reiner</a> (Reiner had been Bartók's friend and champion since his days as Bartók's student at the Royal Academy). Bartók's last work might well have been the String Quartet No. 6 but for <a href="Serge%20Koussevitzky">Serge Koussevitzky</a>'s <a href="commission%20%28art%29">commission</a> for the <a href="Concerto%20for%20Orchestra%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Concerto for Orchestra</a>. Koussevitsky's <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> premièred the work in December 1944 to highly positive reviews. The Concerto for Orchestra quickly became Bartók's most popular work, although he did not live to see its full impact. In 1944, he was also commissioned by <a href="Yehudi%20Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a> to write a <a href="Sonata%20for%20Solo%20Violin%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Sonata for Solo Violin</a>. In 1945, Bartók composed his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%203%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Piano Concerto No. 3</a>, a graceful and almost neo-classical work, as a surprise 42nd birthday present for Ditta, but he died just over a month before her birthday, with the scoring not quite finished. He had also sketched his <a href="Viola%20Concerto%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Viola Concerto</a>, but had barely started the scoring at his death, leaving completed only the viola part and sketches of the orchestral part.
Béla Bartók died at age 64 in a hospital in New York City from complications of <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> (specifically, of secondary <a href="polycythemia">polycythemia</a>) on 26 September 1945. His funeral was attended by only ten people. Among them were his wife Ditta, their son Péter, and his pianist friend <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20S%C3%A1ndor">György Sándor</a> .

Bartók's body was initially interred in <a href="Ferncliff%20Cemetery">Ferncliff Cemetery</a> in Hartsdale, New York. During the final year of communist Hungary in the late 1980s, the Hungarian government, along with his two sons, Béla III and Péter, requested that his remains be exhumed and transferred back to <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> for burial, where Hungary arranged a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> for him on 7 July 1988. He was reinterred at Budapest's <a href="Farkasr%C3%A9ti%20Cemetery">Farkasréti Cemetery</a>, next to the remains of Ditta, who died in 1982, the year after his centenary .

The two unfinished works were later completed by his pupil <a href="Tibor%20Serly">Tibor Serly</a>. György Sándor was the soloist in the first performance of the Third Piano Concerto on February 8, 1946. Ditta Pásztory-Bartók later played and recorded it. The Viola Concerto was revised and published in the 1990s by Bartók's son, Peter; this version may be closer to what Bartók intended .

Concurrently, Peter Bartók, in association with Argentinian musician <a href="Nelson%20Dellamaggiore">Nelson Dellamaggiore</a>, worked to reprint and revise past editions of the Third Piano Concerto .


Bartók's music reflects two trends that dramatically changed the sound of music in the 20th century: the breakdown of the <a href="diatonic">diatonic</a> system of harmony that had served composers for the previous two hundred years ; and the revival of nationalism as a source for musical inspiration, a trend that began with <a href="Mikhail%20Glinka">Mikhail Glinka</a> and <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Antonín Dvořák</a> in the last half of the 19th century . In his search for new forms of tonality, Bartók turned to Hungarian folk music, as well as to other folk music of the <a href="Carpathian%20Basin">Carpathian Basin</a> and even of Algeria and Turkey; in so doing he became influential in that stream of modernism which exploited indigenous music and techniques .

One characteristic style of music is his <a href="Night%20music%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Night music</a>, which he used mostly in slow movements of multi-movement ensemble or orchestral compositions in his mature period. It is characterised by "eerie dissonances providing a backdrop to sounds of nature and lonely melodies" . An example is the third movement (Adagio) of his "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta".

His music can be grouped roughly in accordance with the different periods in his life.

The works of his youth are of a late-Romantic style. Between 1890 and 1894 (nine to 13 years of age) he wrote 31 piano pieces with corresponding opus numbers. He started numbering his works anew with "opus 1" in 1894 with his first large-scale work, a piano sonata in G minor . Up to 1902, Bartók wrote in total 74 works which can be considered in Romantic style. Most of these early compositions are either scored for piano solo or include a piano. Additionally, there is some chamber music for strings.

Under the influence of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>—among other works "<a href="Also%20sprach%20Zarathustra%20%28Strauss%29">Also sprach Zarathustra</a>" , Bartók composed in 1903 "<a href="Kossuth%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Kossuth</a>", a symphonic poem in ten tableaux. In 1904 followed his "Rhapsody for piano and orchestra" which he numbered opus 1 again, marking it himself as the start of a new era in his music. An even more important occurrence of this year was his overhearing the eighteen-year-old nanny Lidi Dósa from <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a> sing folk songs, sparking Bartók's lifelong dedication to folk music . When criticised for not composing his own melodies Bartók pointed out that <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a> and <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> mostly based their plays on well-known stories too. Regarding the incorporation of folk music into art music he said:
The question is, what are the ways in which peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music? We may, for instance, take over a peasant melody unchanged or only slightly varied, write an accompaniment to it and possibly some opening and concluding phrases. This kind of work would show a certain analogy with Bach's treatment of chorales. ... Another method ... is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above. ... There is yet a third way ... Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may say, he has completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue. 

Bartók became first acquainted with Debussy's music in 1907 and regarded his music highly. In an interview in 1939 Bartók said

Debussy's great service to music was to reawaken among all musicians an awareness of harmony and its possibilities. In that, he was just as important as Beethoven, who revealed to us the possibilities of progressive form, or as Bach, who showed us the transcendent significance of counterpoint. Now, what I am always asking myself is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a> exclaim 'At last something truly new!' . Until 1911, Bartók composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera "Bluebeard's Castle". The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 1911 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements (; ).

His pessimistic attitude towards composing was lifted by the stormy and inspiring contact with Klára Gombossy in the summer of 1915 . This interesting episode in Bartók's life remained hidden until it was researched by Denijs Dille between 1979 and 1989 . Bartók started composing again, including the Suite for piano opus 14 (1916), and "The Miraculous Mandarin" (1918) and he completed "The Wooden Prince" (1917).

Bartók felt the result of World War I as a personal tragedy . Many regions he loved were severed from <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>: <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, the <a href="Banat">Banat</a> where he was born, and <a href="Pozsony">Pozsony</a> where his mother lived. Additionally, the political relations between Hungary and the other successor states to the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20empire">Austro-Hungarian empire</a> prohibited his folk music research outside of Hungary . Bartók also wrote the noteworthy "<a href="Eight%20Improvisations%20on%20Hungarian%20Peasant%20Songs">Eight Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs</a>" in 1920, and the sunny "<a href="Dance%20Suite%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Dance Suite</a>" in 1923, the year of his second marriage.

In 1926, Bartók needed a significant piece for piano and orchestra with which he could tour in Europe and America. In the preparation for writing his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%201%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">First Piano Concerto</a>, he wrote his Sonata, "<a href="Out%20of%20Doors%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Out of Doors</a>", and "Nine Little Pieces", all for solo piano . He increasingly found his own voice in his maturity. The style of his last period—named "Synthesis of East and West" —is hard to define let alone to put under one term. In his mature period, Bartók wrote relatively few works but most of them are large-scale compositions for large settings. Only his voice works have programmatic titles and his late works often adhere to classical forms.

Among his masterworks are all the six <a href="List%20of%20string%20quartets%20by%20B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">string quartets</a> (1908, 1917, 1927, 1928, 1934, and 1939), the "<a href="Cantata%20Profana">Cantata Profana</a>" (1930, Bartók declared that this was the work he felt and professed to be his most personal "credo" , the "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta" (1936), the Concerto for Orchestra (1943) and the Third Piano Concerto (1945).

Bartók also made a lasting contribution to the literature for younger students: for his son Péter's music lessons, he composed "<a href="Mikrokosmos%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Mikrokosmos</a>", a six-volume collection of graded piano pieces.

<a href="Paul%20Wilson%20%28music%20theorist%29">Paul Wilson</a> lists as the most prominent characteristics of Bartók's music from late 1920s onwards the influence of the <a href="Carpathian%20basin">Carpathian basin</a> and European art music, and his changing attitude toward (and use of) tonality, but without the use of the traditional <a href="Diatonic%20functionality">harmonic functions</a> associated with major and minor scales .

Although Bartók claimed in his writings that his music was always tonal, he rarely uses the chords or scales of tonality, and so the descriptive resources of tonal theory are of limited use. <a href="George%20Perle">George</a> and Elliott focus on alternative methods of signaling tonal centers, via axes of inversional symmetry. Others view Bartók's axes of symmetry in terms of atonal analytic protocols. <a href="Richard%20Cohn">Richard</a> argues that <a href="Inversion%20%28music%29%23Inversional%20equivalency">inversional symmetry</a> is often a byproduct of another atonal procedure, the formation of chords from transpositionally related dyads. Atonal pitch-class theory also furnishes the resources for exploring <a href="polymodal%20chromaticism">polymodal chromaticism</a>, <a href="projected%20set">projected set</a>s, <a href="privileged%20pattern">privileged pattern</a>s, and large set types used as source sets such as the equal tempered twelve tone <a href="tone%20row%23total%20chromatic">aggregate</a>, <a href="octatonic%20scale">octatonic scale</a> (and <a href="alpha%20chord">alpha chord</a>), the diatonic and "heptatonia secunda" seven-note scales, and less often the whole tone scale and the primary pentatonic collection .

He rarely used the simple aggregate actively to shape musical structure, though there are notable examples such as the second theme from the first movement of his Second Violin Concerto, commenting that he "wanted to show <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Schoenberg</a> that one can use all twelve tones and still remain tonal" . More thoroughly, in the first eight measures of the last movement of his Second Quartet, all notes gradually gather with the twelfth (G♭) sounding for the first time on the last beat of measure 8, marking the end of the first section. The aggregate is partitioned in the opening of the Third String Quartet with C♯–D–D♯–E in the accompaniment (strings) while the remaining pitch classes are used in the melody (violin 1) and more often as 7–35 (diatonic or "white-key" collection) and 5–35 (pentatonic or "black-key" collection) such as in no. 6 of the "Eight Improvisations". There, the primary theme is on the black keys in the left hand, while the right accompanies with triads from the white keys. In measures 50–51 in the third movement of the Fourth Quartet, the first violin and cello play black-key chords, while the second violin and viola play stepwise diatonic lines . On the other hand, from as early as the Suite for piano, Op. 14 (1914), he occasionally employed a form of <a href="serialism">serialism</a> based on compound interval cycles, some of which are maximally distributed, multi-aggregate cycles (; ).
<a href="Ern%C5%91%20Lendvai">Ernő Lendvai</a> (1971) analyses Bartók's works as being based on two opposing tonal systems, that of the <a href="acoustic%20scale">acoustic scale</a> and the <a href="axis%20system">axis system</a>, as well as using the <a href="golden%20ratio">golden section</a> as a structural principle.

<a href="Milton%20Babbitt">Milton Babbitt</a>, in his 1949 critique of Bartók's string quartets, criticized Bartók for using tonality and non tonal methods unique to each piece. Babbitt noted that "Bartók's solution was a specific one, it cannot be duplicated" . Bartók's use of "two organizational principles"—tonality for large scale relationships and the piece-specific method for moment to moment thematic elements—was a problem for Babbitt, who worried that the "highly attenuated tonality" requires extreme non-harmonic methods to create a feeling of closure .

The cataloguing of Bartók's works is somewhat complex. Bartók assigned opus numbers to his works three times, the last of these series ending with the Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 1, Op. 21 in 1921. He ended this practice because of the difficulty of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works. Since his death, three attempts—two full and one partial—have been made at cataloguing. The first, and still most widely used, is <a href="Andr%C3%A1s%20Sz%C5%91ll%C5%91sy">András Szőllősy</a>'s chronological Sz. numbers, from 1 to 121. <a href="Denijs%20Dille">Denijs Dille</a> subsequently reorganised the juvenilia (Sz. 1–25) thematically, as DD numbers 1 to 77. The most recent catalogue is that of <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Somfai">László Somfai</a>; this is a chronological index with works identified by BB numbers 1 to 129, incorporating corrections based on the Béla Bartók Thematic Catalogue.

On 1 January 2016 his works entered the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a> in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>.


On 18 March 2016 <a href="Decca%20Classics">Decca Classics</a> released "Béla Bartók: The Complete Works", the first ever complete compilation of all of Bartók's compositions, including new recordings of never-before-recorded early piano and vocal works. However, none of the composer's own performances are included in this 32-disc set .

Bill Haley

William John Clifton Haley (; July 6, 1925 – February 9, 1981) was an American <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> musician. He is credited by many with first popularizing this form of music in the early 1950s with his group <a href="Bill%20Haley%20%26amp%3B%20His%20Comets">Bill Haley & His Comets</a> and million-selling hits such as "<a href="Rock%20Around%20the%20Clock">Rock Around the Clock</a>", "<a href="See%20You%20Later%2C%20Alligator">See You Later, Alligator</a>", "<a href="Shake%2C%20Rattle%20and%20Roll">Shake, Rattle and Roll</a>", "<a href="Rocket%2088">Rocket 88</a>", "<a href="Skinny%20Minnie">Skinny Minnie</a>", and "Razzle Dazzle". He has sold over 25 million records worldwide.

Bill Haley was born July 6, 1925 in <a href="Highland%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Highland Park</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, as William John Clifton Haley. In 1929, the four-year-old Haley underwent an inner-ear mastoid operation which accidentally severed an optic nerve, leaving him blind in his left eye for the rest of his life. As a result of the effects of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> on the <a href="Detroit%2C%20Michigan">Detroit</a> area, his father moved the family to <a href="Bethel%20Township%2C%20Delaware%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bethel</a>, PA when Bill was seven years old. Haley's father William Albert Haley was from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> and played the <a href="banjo">banjo</a> and <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>, and his mother, Maude Green, who was originally from <a href="Ulverston">Ulverston</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, <a href="England">England</a>, was a technically accomplished <a href="keyboardist">keyboardist</a> with classical training. Haley told the story that when he made a simulated guitar out of cardboard, his parents bought him a real one.

One of his first appearances was in 1938 for a Bethel Junior baseball team entertainment event performing guitar and songs when he was 13 years old.

The anonymous sleeve notes accompanying the 1956 Decca album "Rock Around The Clock" describe Haley's early life and career: "When Bill Haley was fifteen [c. 1940] he left home with his guitar and very little else and set out on the hard road to fame and fortune. The next few years, continuing this story in a fairy-tale manner, were hard and poverty-stricken, but crammed full of useful experience. Apart from learning how to exist on one meal a day and other artistic exercises, he worked at an open-air park show, sang and yodelled with any band that would have him, and worked with a traveling medicine show. Eventually he got a job with a popular group known as the "Down Homers" while they were in <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford</a>, <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. Soon after this he decided, as all successful people must decide at some time or another, to be his own boss again – and he has been that ever since.' These notes fail to account for his early band, known as the Four Aces of Western Swing. During the 1940s Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America as "Silver Yodeling Bill Haley".

The sleeve notes conclude: "For six years Bill Haley was a musical director of Radio Station <a href="WPWA">WPWA</a> in <a href="Chester%2C%20Pennsylvania">Chester</a>, Pennsylvania, and led his own band all through this period. It was then known as Bill Haley's Saddlemen, indicating their definite leaning toward the tough Western style. They continued playing in clubs as well as over the radio around <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and in 1951 made their first recordings on Ed Wilson's Keystone Records in Philadelphia." On June 14, 1951 the Saddlemen recorded a cover of "<a href="Rocket%2088">Rocket 88</a>".

During the Labor Day weekend in 1952, the Saddlemen were renamed Bill Haley with Haley's Comets (inspired by the supposedly official pronunciation of <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a>, a name suggested by WPWA radio station program director, Bob Johnson, where Bill Haley had a live radio program from noon to 1 p.m.), and in 1953, Haley's recording of "<a href="Crazy%20Man%2C%20Crazy">Crazy Man, Crazy</a>" (co-written by him and his bass player, <a href="Marshall%20Lytle">Marshall Lytle</a>, although Lytle would not receive credit until 2001) became the first rock and roll song to hit the American charts, peaking at no.15 on Billboard and no.11 on Cash Box. Soon after, the band's name was revised to <a href="Bill%20Haley%20%26amp%3B%20His%20Comets">Bill Haley & His Comets</a>.

In 1953, "<a href="Rock%20Around%20the%20Clock">Rock Around the Clock</a>" was recorded by Haley. Initially, it was relatively successful, peaking at no. 23 on the "Billboard" pop singles chart and staying on the charts for a few weeks. A month later it re-entered at number 1.

Haley soon had another worldwide hit with "<a href="Shake%2C%20Rattle%20and%20Roll">Shake, Rattle and Roll</a>", which went on to sell a million copies and was the first ever rock 'n' roll song to enter the British singles charts in December 1954, becoming a Gold Record. He retained elements of the original (which was slow blues), but sped it up with some country music aspects into the song (specifically, Western swing) and changed up the lyrics. Haley and his band were important in launching the music known as "Rock and Roll" to a wider audience after a period of it being considered an underground genre.

When "Rock Around the Clock" appeared as the theme song of the 1955 film "<a href="Blackboard%20Jungle">Blackboard Jungle</a>" starring <a href="Glenn%20Ford">Glenn Ford</a>, it soared to the top of the American "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" chart for eight weeks. The single is commonly used as a convenient line of demarcation between the "rock era" and the music industry that preceded it. "Billboard" separated its statistical tabulations into 1890–1954 and 1955–present. After the record rose to number one, Haley was quickly given the title "Father of Rock and Roll" by the media, and by teenagers who had come to embrace the new style of music. With the song's success, the age of rock music began overnight and ended the dominance of the jazz and pop standards performed by <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Jo%20Stafford">Jo Stafford</a>, <a href="Perry%20Como">Perry Como</a>, <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> and others. Nevertheless, in the United Kingdom Haley was supported by former Dankworth Seven lead vocalist <a href="Frank%20Holder%20%28musician%29">Frank Holder</a> among others.

"Rock Around the Clock" was the first record ever to sell over one million copies in both <a href="UK">Britain</a> and <a href="West%20Germany">Germany</a>. Later on in 1957, Haley became the first major American rock singer to tour Europe. Haley continued to score hits throughout the 1950s such as "<a href="See%20You%20Later%2C%20Alligator">See You Later, Alligator</a>" and he starred in the first rock and roll musical films "<a href="Rock%20Around%20the%20Clock%20%28film%29">Rock Around the Clock</a>" and "<a href="Don%27t%20Knock%20the%20Rock">Don't Knock the Rock</a>", both in 1956. Haley was already 30 years old and so he was soon eclipsed in the United States by the younger, sexier <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, but continued to enjoy great popularity in Latin America, Europe and Australia during the 1960s.

Bill Haley and the Comets performed "Rock Around the Clock" on the <a href="Texaco%20Star%20Theater">Texaco Star Theater</a> hosted by <a href="Milton%20Berle">Milton Berle</a> on Tuesday, May 31, 1955 on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> in an a cappella and lip-synched version. Berle predicted that the song would go no. 1: "A group of entertainers who are going right to the top." Berle also sang and danced to the song which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre with a much wider audience.

Bill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll act to appear on the iconic American musical variety series the <a href="Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">Ed Sullivan Show</a> on Sunday, August 7, 1955 on <a href="CBS">CBS</a> in a broadcast that originated from the Shakespeare Festival Theater in Hartford, Connecticut. They performed a live version of "Rock Around the Clock" with Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The band made their second appearance on the show on Sunday, April 28, 1957 performing the songs "<a href="Rudy%27s%20Rock">Rudy's Rock</a>" and "Forty Cups of Coffee".

Bill Haley and the Comets appeared on "<a href="American%20Bandstand">American Bandstand</a>" hosted by <a href="Dick%20Clark">Dick Clark</a> on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> twice in 1957, on the prime time show October 28, 1957 and on the regular daytime show on November 27, 1957. The band also appeared on Dick Clark's "Saturday Night Beechnut Show", also known as "<a href="The%20Dick%20Clark%20Show">The Dick Clark Show</a>", a primetime TV series from New York on March 22, 1958 during the first season and on February 20, 1960, performing "Rock Around the Clock", "Shake, Rattle and Roll", and "Tamiami".

Bill Haley was married three times:

Bill Haley had at least ten children. John W. Haley, his eldest son, wrote "Sound and Glory", a biography of Haley, and had another child, Sharyn, with his first wife, Dorothy Crowe. His youngest daughter, <a href="Gina%20Haley">Gina Haley</a>, is a professional musician based in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. Scott Haley is an athlete. His youngest son Pedro is also a musician.

He also had a daughter, Martha Maria, from his last marriage with Martha Velasco.

Bill Haley Jr. (Haley's second son and first with Joan Barbara "Cuppy" Haley-Hahn) publishes a regional business magazine in Southeastern Pennsylvania ("Route 422 Business Advisor"). He sang and played guitar with a band called "Bill Haley and the Satellites," and released a CD in 2011.

An admitted alcoholic (as indicated in a 1974 radio interview for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>), Haley fought a battle with alcohol into the 1970s. Nonetheless, he and his band continued to be a popular touring act, benefiting from a 1950s nostalgia movement that began in the late 1960s and the signing of a lucrative record deal with the European <a href="Sonet%20Records">Sonet</a> label. After performing for <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Variety%20Performance">Royal Variety Performance</a> on November 10, 1979, Haley made his final performances in South Africa in May and June 1980. Before the South African tour, he was diagnosed with a <a href="brain%20tumor">brain tumor</a>, and a planned tour of <a href="Germany">Germany</a> in the autumn of 1980 was cancelled.

The October 25, 1980 edition of the German paper "Bild" reported that Haley had a brain tumor. It quoted British manager Patrick Malynn as saying that Haley "had taken a fit and went over the seat. He didn't recognize anyone any more" after being taken to his home in Beverly Hills. It also reported that a doctor at the clinic where Haley had been taken said, 'The tumor can't be operated on any more.'"

The "<a href="Berliner%20Zeitung">Berliner Zeitung</a>" reported a few days later that Haley had collapsed after a performance in Texas and been taken to the hospital in his home town of <a href="Harlingen%2C%20Texas">Harlingen, Texas</a>. However, this account is questionable as Bill Haley did not perform in the United States at all in 1980.

Despite his ill health, Haley began compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he went back to his home in Harlingen, where he died early in the morning of February 9, 1981.

Martha, Bill's widow, who was with him in these troubling times, denies he had a brain tumor as does his old, very close friend, Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Bill did not want to go on the road any more and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. According to McCallum, "It's my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card."

It was obvious that his drinking problem was getting worse. By this time, Bill and Martha fought all the time and she told him to stop drinking or move out. He then did move out into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. "There were days we never saw him," said his daughter Martha Maria.

In addition to Haley's drinking problems, it had also become obvious that he was having serious mental problems as well; Martha Maria said that, "It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking." After he'd been jailed by the Harlingen Police, Martha had the judge put Haley in the hospital where he was seen by a psychiatrist who said Bill's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction but said Bill would have to stop drinking. Martha said, "This is pointless." She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house and the downward spiral continued until his death on February 9, 1981.

Haley's death certificate listed "Natural causes: Most likely heart attack" as the 'Immediate Cause' of death. The next lines, 'Due to, or as a consequence of" were blank.

Haley made a succession of bizarre, mostly monologue late-night phone calls to friends and relatives in which he seemed incoherently drunk or ill. Haley's first wife has been quoted as saying, "He would call and ramble and dwell on the past, his mind was really warped." A belligerent phone call to a business associate was taped and gives evidence of Haley's troubled state of mind.

Media reports immediately following his death indicated Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in his final weeks, although there is little information about Haley's final days beyond a biography by John Swenson, released a year later, which described him painting the windows of his home black. After a small funeral service, Haley was cremated, although his widow Martha won't say what was done with the ashes.

Haley was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1987. His son Pedro represented him at the ceremony. He received a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> on February 8, 1960, for his contributions to the music industry at 6350 <a href="Hollywood%20Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a>. The Comets were separately inducted into the Hall of Fame as a group in 2012, after a rule change allowed the induction of backing groups (the Comets were mass-inducted alongside several other groups such as <a href="Hank%20Ballard">Hank Ballard</a>'s Midnighters and <a href="Gene%20Vincent">Gene Vincent</a>'s Blue Caps).

Songwriters <a href="Tom%20Russell">Tom Russell</a> and <a href="Dave%20Alvin">Dave Alvin</a> addressed Haley's demise in musical terms with "Haley's Comet" on Alvin's 1991 album "Blue Blvd." <a href="Dwight%20Yoakam">Dwight Yoakam</a> sang backup on the tribute.

Surviving members of the 1954–55 contingent of Haley's Comets reunited in the late 1980s and continued to perform for many years around the world. They released a concert DVD in 2004 on Hydra Records, played the <a href="Viper%20Room">Viper Room</a> in <a href="West%20Hollywood">West Hollywood</a> in 2005, and performed at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Theater in <a href="Branson%2C%20Missouri">Branson, Missouri</a>, beginning in 2006–07. As of 2014, only two members of this particular contingent are still alive (Joey Ambrose and Dick Richards), but they continue to perform in Branson and in Europe. At least two other groups also continue to perform in North America under the Comets name as of 2014.

In March 2007, the Original Comets pre-opened the Bill Haley Museum in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, Germany. On October 27, 2007, ex-Comets guitar player Bill Turner opened the Bill Haley Museum for the public.

Two of Haley's children, Bill Haley Jr. and Gina Haley, are themselves musicians and have in recent years recorded albums of their father's music and headlined tribute musical shows.

In February 2006, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> announced the naming of <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> <a href="79896%20Billhaley">79896 Billhaley</a> to mark the 25th anniversary of Bill Haley's death.


Unlike his contemporaries, Bill Haley has rarely been portrayed on screen. Following the success of "<a href="The%20Buddy%20Holly%20Story">The Buddy Holly Story</a>" in 1978, Haley expressed interest in having his life story committed to film, but this never came to fruition. In the 1980s and early 1990s, numerous media reports emerged stating that plans were underway to do a biopic based upon Haley's life, with <a href="Beau%20Bridges">Beau Bridges</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> and <a href="John%20Ritter">John Ritter</a> all at one point being mentioned as actors in line to play Haley (according to "<a href="Goldmine%20%28magazine%29">Goldmine Magazine</a>", Ritter attempted to buy the film rights to "Sound and Glory").

Bill Haley has also been portrayed – not always in a positive light – in several "period" films:

In March 2005, the British network <a href="British%20Sky%20Broadcasting">Sky TV</a> reported that <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a> was planning to produce a biopic on the life of Bill Haley, with production tentatively scheduled to begin in 2006. However this rumor was quickly debunked by Hanks.

Before the formation of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen, which later became the Comets, Haley released several singles with other groups. Dates are approximate due to lack of documentation.

As Bill Haley and the Four Aces of Western Swing:

1948
1949

As Johnny Clifton and His String Band:

1950

Many Haley discographies list two 1946 recordings by the <a href="Down%20Homers">Down Homers</a> released on the <a href="Vogue%20Records">Vogue Records</a> label as featuring Haley. Haley historian Chris Gardner, as well as surviving members of the group, have confirmed that the two singles: "Out Where the West Winds Blow"/"Who's Gonna Kiss You When I'm Gone" (Vogue R736) and "Boogie Woogie Yodel"/"Baby I Found Out All About You" (Vogue R786) do not feature Haley. However, the tracks were nonetheless included in the compilation box set "Rock 'n' Roll Arrives" released by <a href="Bear%20Family%20Records">Bear Family Records</a> in 2006.

Bill Haley recorded prolifically during the 1940s, often at the radio stations where he worked, or in formal studio settings. Virtually none of these recordings were ever released. Liner notes for a 2003 CD release by <a href="Hydra%20Records">Hydra Records</a> entitled "Bill Haley and Friends Vol. 2: The Legendary Cowboy Recordings" reveal that several additional Cowboy label single releases were planned for the Four Aces, but this never occurred.

A number of previously unreleased Haley country-western recordings from the 1946–1950 period began to emerge near the end of Haley's life, some of which were released by the <a href="Arzee%20Records">Arzee</a> label, with titles such as "Yodel Your Blues Away" and "Rose of My Heart." Still more demos, alternate takes, and wholly unheard-before recordings have been released since Haley's death. Notable examples of such releases include the albums "Golden Country Origins" by <a href="Grassroots%20Records">Grassroots Records</a> of Australia and "Hillbilly Haley" by the British label, <a href="Rollercoaster%20Records">Rollercoaster</a>, as well as the aforementioned German release by Hydra Records. In 2006, <a href="Bear%20Family%20Records">Bear Family Records</a> of Germany released what is considered to be the most comprehensive (yet still incomplete) collection of Haley's 1946–1950 recordings as part of its Haley box set "Rock n' Roll Arrives".

Bill Haley's compositions included "Four Leaf Clover Blues", "Rose of My Heart", "Yodel Your Blues Away", "<a href="Crazy%20Man%2C%20Crazy">Crazy Man, Crazy</a>", "What'Cha Gonna Do", "Fractured", "Live It Up", "Farewell, So Long, Goodbye", "Real Rock Drive", "Rocking Chair on the Moon", "Sundown Boogie", "Green Tree Boogie", "Tearstains on My Heart", "Down Deep in My Heart", "Straight Jacket", "<a href="Birth%20of%20the%20Boogie">Birth of the Boogie</a>", "<a href="Two%20Hound%20Dogs">Two Hound Dogs</a>", "<a href="Rock-A-Beatin%27%20Boogie">Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie</a>", "<a href="Hot%20Dog%20Buddy%20Buddy">Hot Dog Buddy Buddy</a>", "R-O-C-K", "<a href="Rudy%27s%20Rock">Rudy's Rock</a>", "Calling All Comets", "Tonight's the Night", "Hook, Line and Sinker", "Sway with Me", "Paper Boy (On Main Street U.S.A.)", "<a href="Skinny%20Minnie">Skinny Minnie</a>", "B.B. Betty", "Eloise", "Whoa Mabel!", "Vive la Rock and Roll", "I've Got News For You", "So Right Tonight", "Ana Maria", "Yucatán Twist", "Football Rock and Roll", and "Chick Safari"

He also wrote or co-wrote songs for other artists such as "I've Got News for You" for Penny Smith in 1955 on Kahill, "Calypso Rock" for Dave Day and The Red Coats on Kapp in 1956, "A.B.C. Rock" and "Rocky the Rockin' Rabbit" for <a href="Sally%20Starr%20%28TV%20hostess%29">Sally Starr</a> on Arcade, "Toodle-Oo-Bamboo" for Ray Coleman and His Skyrockets on Skyrocket Records in 1959, "The Cat" for Cappy Bianco, and "(Ya Gotta) Sing For the Ladies" and "Butterfly Love" for Ginger Shannon and Johnny Montana in 1960 on Arcade as well as the unissued "I'm Shook" in 1958.

"<a href="NME">NME</a>" – October 1955

The following recording by Bill Haley was inducted into the <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Grammy Hall of Fame</a>, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have "qualitative or historical significance."

Northern bobwhite

The northern bobwhite, Virginia quail or (in its home range) bobwhite quail ("Colinus virginianus") is a ground-dwelling <a href="bird">bird</a> native to the United States, Mexico, and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. It is a member of the group of species known as <a href="New%20World%20quail">New World quail</a>s (Odontophoridae). They were initially placed with the Old World quails in the pheasant <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> (<a href="Phasianidae">Phasianidae</a>), but are not particularly closely related. The name "<a href="Colinus">bobwhite</a>" derives from its characteristic whistling call. Despite its secretive nature, the northern bobwhite is one of the most familiar quails in eastern North America because it is frequently the only quail in its range. Habitat degradation has likely contributed to the northern bobwhite population in eastern North America declining by roughly 85% from 1966-2014. This population decline is apparently range-wide and continuing.

There are 21 <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of northern bobwhite, many of which are hunted extensively as <a href="game%20birds">game birds</a>. One subspecies, the masked bobwhite ("Colinus virginianus ridgwayi"), is listed as endangered with wild populations located in the northern Mexican state of <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a> and a reintroduced population in <a href="Buenos%20Aires%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge</a> in <a href="southern%20Arizona">southern Arizona</a>.

This is a moderately-sized <a href="quail">quail</a> and is the only small galliform native to eastern North America. The bobwhite can range from in length with a wingspan. As indicated by body mass, weights increase in birds found further north, as corresponds to <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">Bergmann's rule</a>. In Mexico, northern bobwhites weigh from whereas in the north they average and large males can attain as much as . Among standard measurements, the <a href="Wing%20chord%20%28biology%29">wing chord</a> is , the <a href="tail">tail</a> is the <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> is and the <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> is . It has the typical chunky, rounded shape of a quail. The bill is short, curved and brown-black in color. This species is <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>. Males have a white throat and brow stripe bordered by black. The overall rufous plumage has gray mottling on the wings, white scalloped stripes on the flanks, and black scallops on the whitish underparts. The tail is gray. Females are similar but are duller overall and have a buff throat and brow without the black border. Both sexes have pale legs and feet.

There are twenty-one recognized <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> in 3 groups. 1 subspecies is extinct.

The northern bobwhite's diet consists of plants and small invertebrates, such as <a href="tick">tick</a>s, <a href="snail">snail</a>s, <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, and <a href="potato%20beetle">potato beetle</a>s. Plant sources include grass seeds, wild berries, <a href="partridge%20pea">partridge pea</a>s, and cultivated grains. It forages on the ground in open areas with some spots of taller vegetation.

The northern bobwhite can be found year-round in agricultural fields, grassland, open woodland areas, roadsides and wood edges. Its range covers the southeastern quadrant of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> from the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and southern <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> east to <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and southern <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, and extending west to southern <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="Colorado%20front-range%20foothills%20to%207000%20feet">Colorado front-range foothills to 7000 feet</a>, and all but westernmost <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. It is absent from the southern tip of <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and the highest elevations of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>, but occurs in eastern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. Isolated populations have been introduced in <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>. The northern bobwhite has also been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

The clear whistle "bob-WHITE" or "bob-bob-WHITE" call is very recognizable. The syllables are slow and widely spaced, rising in pitch a full octave from beginning to end. Other calls include <a href="lisp">lisp</a>s, peeps, and more rapidly whistled warning calls. Another phrase to used mimic the call of the bobwhite is "Bobwhite, your (bob) peas (bob) ripe (white)?".

Like most game birds, the northern bobwhite is shy and elusive. When threatened, it will crouch and freeze, relying on camouflage to stay undetected, but will flush into low flight if closely disturbed. It is generally solitary or paired early in the year, but family groups are common in the late summer and winter roosts may have two dozen or more birds in a single covey.

The species is generally monogamous, but there is some evidence of polygamy. Both parents incubate a brood for 23 to 24 days, and the precocial young leave the nest shortly after hatching. Both parents lead the young birds to food and care for them for 14 to 16 days until their first flight. A pair may raise one or two broods annually, with 12 to 16 eggs per clutch.

Northern bobwhite were introduced into <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in 1927, and are reported in the plains and hills in the northwest of the country. Other reports from the EU are in <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, and <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. As bobwhites are highly productive and popular aviary subjects, it is reasonable to expect other introductions have been made in other parts of the EU, especially in the <a href="UK">UK</a> and <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, where game-bird breeding, liberation, and naturalisation are relatively common practices.

From 1898 to 1902, some 1300 birds were imported from America and released in many parts of the North and South Islands, from Northland to Southland. The bird was briefly on the Nelson game shooting licence, but: "It would seem that the committee was a little too eager in placing these Quail on the licence, or the shooters of the day were over-zealous and greedy in their bag limits, for the Virginian Quail, like the Mountain Quail were soon thing of the past." The Taranaki (Acclimatisation) Society released a few in 1900 and was confidant that in a year or two they might offer good sport; two years later, broods were reported and the species was said to be "steadily increasing"; but after another two years they seemed "to have disappeared" and that was the end of them. The Otago (Acclimatisation) Society imported more in 1948, but these releases "did no good". After 1923, no more genuinely wild birds were sighted until 1952, when a small population was found North-West of Wairoa in the Ruapapa Road area. Since then bobwhite have been found at several localities around Waikaremoana, in farmland, open bush and along roadsides.

More birds have been imported into <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> by private individuals since the 1990s and a healthy captive population is now held by backyard aviculturalists and have been found to be easily cared for, bred, and are popular for their song and good looks. A larger proportion of the national captive population belong to a few game preserves and game bird breeders. Though the birds would be self-sustaining in the wild if they were protected; it is tricky to guess what the effect of an annual population subsidy and hunting has on any of the original populations from the Acclimatisation Society releases. It would be fair to suggest most birds in the wild are no more than one generation from captive stock.

An <a href="albino">albino</a> hen was present in a <a href="covey">covey</a> in Bayview, Hawkes Bay for a couple of seasons sometime around 2000.

Bobwhites are popular throughout the world, with healthy captive populations everywhere where bird-keeping is enjoyed. Certain countries/states require permits and record keeping, as the possibility that an introduced population may compete with or spread diseases with native quail is a real threat.

Bobwhites are generally compatible with most <a href="parrots">parrots</a>, <a href="softbills">softbills</a> and <a href="doves">doves</a>. This species should, however, be the only ground-dwelling species in the aviary. Most individuals will do little damage to <a href="finches">finches</a>, but one should watch that nests are not being crushed when the species perches at night. Single pairs are preferred, unless the birds have been raised together as a group since they were chicks. Some fighting will occur between cocks at breeding time. One cock may be capable of servicing several hens at once, but the fertility seems to be highest in the eggs from the "preferred" hen. Aviary style is a compromise between what is tolerated by the bird and what is best for the bird. Open parrot-style type aviaries may be used, but some birds will remain flighty and shy in this situation. In a planted aviary, this species will generally settle down to become quite tame and confiding. Parents with chicks will roost on the ground, forming a circular arrangement, with heads facing outwards. In the early morning and late afternoon, the cock will utter its call, which, although not loud, carries well and may offend noise-sensitive neighbors. Most breeding facilities keep birds in breeding groups, on wire up off the ground. This keeps the birds clean and generally avoids diseases and parasites which can devastate a covey. Cages with mesh floors for pairs and trios are also employed, but usually where there is a photo-period manipulation to keep birds breeding through winter.

In the wild the bobwhite feeds on a variety of seeds of weeds, grasses, as well as insects. These are generally collected on the ground or from low foliage. Birds in the aviary are easily catered for with a commercial small seed mix (finch, budgerigar, or small parrot mix) when supplemented with greenfeed. Live food is not usually necessary for breeding, but will be ravenously accepted. High protein foods such as chicken grower crumble are more convenient to supply and will be useful for the stimulation of breeding birds. Extra <a href="calcium">calcium</a> is required, especially by laying hens; it can be supplied in the form of shell grit, or <a href="cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a> bone.

In an open aviary hens will lay all over the show if a nesting site and privacy are not provided. Hens that do this may lay upwards of 80 eggs in a season which can be taken for artificial incubation - and chicks hand raised. Otherwise hens with nesting cover, that do make a nest (on the ground) will build up 8–25 eggs in a clutch, with eggs being laid daily

Some captive bobwhite hybrids recorded are between <a href="blue%20quail">blue quail</a> (<a href="scaled%20quail">scaled quail</a>), <a href="Gambel%27s%20quail">Gambel's quail</a>, <a href="California%20quail">California quail</a>, <a href="mountain%20quail">mountain quail</a> and it has long been suggested that there are <a href="Japanese%20quail">Japanese quail</a> hybrids being bred commercially; there is a distinct lack of photographic proof to substantiate this.

Bipolar disorder

Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a <a href="mental%20disorder">mental disorder</a> that causes periods of <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a> and periods of elevated <a href="mood%20%28psychology%29">mood</a>. The elevated mood is significant and is known as <a href="mania">mania</a> or <a href="hypomania">hypomania</a>, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> are present. During mania, an individual <a href="Behavior">behaves</a> or feels <a href="Abnormal%20behavior">abnormally</a> energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of <a href="suicide">suicide</a> among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while <a href="self-harm">self-harm</a> occurs in 30–40 percent. Other mental health issues such as <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety disorder</a>s and <a href="substance%20use%20disorder">substance use disorder</a> are commonly associated.
The causes are not clearly understood, but both <a href="Environmental%20factor">environmental</a> and <a href="Genetics">genetic</a> factors play a role. Many genes of small effect contribute to risk. Environmental factors include a history of <a href="childhood%20abuse">childhood abuse</a>, and long-term <a href="stress%20%28psychological%29">stress</a>. The condition is divided into <a href="bipolar%20I%20disorder">bipolar I disorder</a> if there has been at least one manic episode, with or without depressive episodes, and <a href="bipolar%20II%20disorder">bipolar II disorder</a> if there has been at least one hypomanic episode (but no manic episodes) and one major depressive episode. In those with less severe symptoms of a prolonged duration, the condition <a href="Cyclothymia">cyclothymic disorder</a> may be diagnosed. If due to drugs or medical problems, it is classified separately. Other conditions that may present in a similar manner include <a href="attention%20deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a>, <a href="personality%20disorder">personality disorder</a>s, <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>, and <a href="Substance%20abuse">substance use disorder</a> as well as a number of medical conditions. <a href="Medical%20test">Medical test</a>ing is not required for a <a href="diagnosis">diagnosis</a>, though blood tests or <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a> can be done to rule out other problems.
Treatment commonly includes <a href="psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a>, as well as <a href="medication">medication</a>s such as <a href="mood%20stabilizer">mood stabilizer</a>s and <a href="antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a>s. Examples of mood stabilizers that are commonly used include <a href="Lithium%20%28medication%29">lithium</a> and various <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a>s. Treatment in a <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">hospital</a> without the individual's <a href="consent">consent</a> may be required if a person is at risk to themselves or others but refuses treatment. Severe behavioral problems, such as agitation or combativeness, may be managed with short term antipsychotics or <a href="benzodiazepine">benzodiazepine</a>s. In periods of mania it is recommended that <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s be stopped. If antidepressants are used for periods of depression they should be used with a mood stabilizer. <a href="Electroconvulsive%20therapy">Electroconvulsive therapy</a> (ECT), while not very well studied, may be helpful for those who do not respond to other treatments. If treatments are stopped, it is recommended that this be done slowly. Many individuals have financial, social or work-related problems due to the illness. These difficulties occur a quarter to a third of the time on average. The risk of death from <a href="natural%20causes">natural causes</a> such as <a href="Coronary%20heart%20disease">heart disease</a> is twice that of the general population. This is due to poor lifestyle choices and the side effects from medications.
Bipolar disorder affects approximately 1% of the global population. In the United States about 3% are estimated to be affected at some point in their life. The most common age at which symptoms begin is 25. Rates appear to be similar in females and males. The economic costs of the disorder has been estimated at $45 billion for the United States in 1991. A large proportion of this was related to a higher number of missed work days, estimated at 50 per year. People with bipolar disorder often face problems with social stigma.

<a href="Mania">Mania</a> is the defining feature of bipolar disorder and can occur with different levels of severity. With milder levels of mania, known as <a href="hypomania">hypomania</a>, individuals are energetic, excitable, and may be highly productive. As hypomania worsens, individuals begin to exhibit erratic and impulsive behavior, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future, and sleep less. At the extreme, manic individuals can experience distorted or delusional beliefs about the universe, hallucinate, hear voices, to the point of <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a>. A depressive episode commonly follows an episode of mania. The biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode, or vice versa, remain poorly understood.

Mania is a distinct period of at least one week of elevated or irritable <a href="Mood%20%28psychology%29">mood</a>, which can range from euphoria to delirium, and those experiencing hypo- or mania may exhibit three or more of the following behaviors: <a href="Pressured%20speech">speak in a rapid, uninterruptible manner</a>, short <a href="attention%20span">attention span</a>, <a href="racing%20thoughts">racing thoughts</a>, increased <a href="goal-oriented">goal-oriented</a> activities, agitation, or they may exhibit behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk, such as <a href="hypersexuality">hypersexuality</a> or excessive spending. To meet the definition for a manic episode, these behaviors must impair the individual's ability to socialize or work. If untreated, a manic episode usually lasts three to six months.

People with hypomania or mania may experience a decreased need of sleep, impaired judgment, and speak excessively and very rapidly. Manic individuals often have a history of substance abuse developed over years as a form of "self-medication". At the more extreme, a person in a full blown manic state can experience <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a>; a break with reality, a state in which thinking is affected along with mood. They may feel unstoppable, or as if they have been "chosen" and are on a "special mission", or have other grandiose or delusional ideas. This may lead to violent behavior and, sometimes, hospitalization in an inpatient <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">psychiatric hospital</a>. The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the <a href="Young%20Mania%20Rating%20Scale">Young Mania Rating Scale</a>, though questions remain about the reliability of these scales.

The onset of a manic (or depressive) episode is often foreshadowed by <a href="Sleep%20disorder">sleep disturbances</a>. Mood changes, <a href="Psychomotor%20agitation">psychomotor</a> and appetite changes, and an increase in anxiety can also occur up to three weeks before a manic episode develops.

<a href="Hypomania">Hypomania</a> is the milder form of mania, defined as at least four days of the same criteria as mania, but does not cause a significant decrease in the individual's ability to socialize or work, lacks psychotic features such as <a href="delusions">delusions</a> or hallucinations, and does not require psychiatric hospitalization. Overall functioning may actually increase during episodes of hypomania and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression by some. Hypomanic episodes rarely progress to full blown manic episodes. Some people who experience hypomania show increased creativity while others are irritable or demonstrate poor judgment.

Hypomania may feel good to some persons who experience it, though most people who experience hypomania state that the stress of the experience is very painful. Bipolar people who experience hypomania, however, tend to forget the effects of their actions on those around them. Even when family and friends recognize mood swings, the individual will often deny that anything is wrong. What might be called a "hypomanic event", if not accompanied by depressive episodes, is often not deemed problematic, unless the mood changes are uncontrollable, volatile, or mercurial. Most commonly, symptoms continue for a few weeks to a few months.

Symptoms of the <a href="Major%20depressive%20episode">depressive phase</a> of bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of sadness, irritability or anger, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, sleeping too much or not enough, changes in appetite and/or weight, fatigue, problems concentrating, self-loathing or feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or suicide. In severe cases, the individual may develop symptoms of <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a>, a condition also known as severe bipolar disorder with psychotic features. These symptoms include <a href="delusion">delusion</a>s and <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s. A major depressive episode persists for at least two weeks, and may result in suicide if left untreated.

The earlier the age of onset, the more likely the first few episodes are to be depressive. Because a bipolar diagnosis requires a manic or hypomanic episode, many patients are initially diagnosed and treated as having <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">major depression</a> and then incorrectly prescribed antidepressants.

In bipolar disorder, <a href="Mixed%20affective%20state">mixed state</a> is a condition during which symptoms of both mania and depression occur simultaneously. Individuals experiencing a mixed state may have manic symptoms such as grandiose thoughts while simultaneously experiencing depressive symptoms such as excessive guilt or feeling suicidal. Mixed states are considered to be high-risk for suicidal behavior since depressive emotions such as hopelessness are often paired with <a href="Emotional%20lability">mood swings</a> or <a href="Impulsivity">difficulties with impulse control</a>. <a href="Anxiety%20disorder">Anxiety disorder</a>s occur more frequently as a comorbidity in mixed bipolar episodes than in non-mixed bipolar depression or mania. Substance abuse (including <a href="Alcohol%20use%20disorder">alcohol</a>) also follows this trend, thereby appearing to depict bipolar symptoms as no more than a consequence of substance abuse.

Associated features are clinical phenomena that often accompany the disorder but are not part of the diagnostic criteria. In adults with the condition, bipolar disorder is often accompanied by changes in <a href="Cognition">cognitive</a> processes and abilities. These include reduced <a href="attention">attention</a>al and <a href="Executive%20functions">executive</a> capabilities and impaired <a href="memory">memory</a>. How the individual processes the universe also depends on the phase of the disorder, with differential characteristics between the manic, hypomanic and depressive states. Some studies have found a significant association between bipolar disorder and <a href="creativity">creativity</a>. Those with bipolar disorder may have difficulty in maintaining relationships. There are several common childhood precursors seen in children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder; these disorders include mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and <a href="attention%20deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD).

The diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be complicated by coexisting (comorbid) psychiatric conditions including the following: <a href="obsessive-compulsive%20disorder">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>, <a href="substance%20abuse">substance abuse</a>, <a href="eating%20disorder">eating disorder</a>s, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, <a href="social%20anxiety%20disorder">social phobia</a>, <a href="premenstrual%20syndrome">premenstrual syndrome</a> (including <a href="premenstrual%20dysphoric%20disorder">premenstrual dysphoric disorder</a>), or <a href="panic%20disorder">panic disorder</a>. A careful longitudinal analysis of symptoms and episodes, enriched if possible by discussions with friends and family members, is crucial to establishing a treatment plan where these comorbidities exist.

The causes of bipolar disorder likely vary between individuals and the exact mechanism underlying the disorder remains unclear. Genetic influences are believed to account for 60–80 percent of the risk of developing the disorder indicating a strong hereditary component. The overall <a href="heritability">heritability</a> of the <a href="bipolar%20spectrum">bipolar spectrum</a> has been estimated at 0.71. <a href="Twin%20studies">Twin studies</a> have been limited by relatively small sample sizes but have indicated a substantial genetic contribution, as well as environmental influence. For bipolar disorder type I, the (probandwise) <a href="concordance%20%28genetics%29">concordance</a> rates in modern studies have been consistently estimated at around 40 percent in <a href="identical%20twins">identical twins</a> (same genes), compared to about 5 percent in <a href="fraternal%20twins">fraternal twins</a>. A combination of bipolar I, II and <a href="cyclothymia">cyclothymia</a> produced concordance rates of 42 percent vs. 11 percent, with a relatively lower ratio for bipolar II that likely reflects <a href="Homogeneity%20and%20heterogeneity">heterogeneity</a>. There is overlap with unipolar depression and if this is also counted in the co-twin the concordance with bipolar disorder rises to 67 percent in monozygotic twins and 19 percent in dizygotic. The relatively low concordance between dizygotic twins brought up together suggests that shared family environmental effects are limited, although the ability to detect them has been limited by small sample sizes.

<a href="Behavioral%20genetics">Behavioral genetic</a> studies have suggested that many <a href="chromosomal">chromosomal</a> regions and <a href="candidate%20gene">candidate gene</a>s are related to bipolar disorder susceptibility with <a href="Polygenic%20disorder">each gene exerting a mild to moderate effect</a>. The risk of bipolar disorder is nearly ten-fold higher in first degree-relatives of those affected with bipolar disorder when compared to the general population; similarly, the risk of major depressive disorder is three times higher in relatives of those with bipolar disorder when compared to the general population.

Although the first <a href="genetic%20linkage">genetic linkage</a> finding for mania was in 1969, the linkage studies have been inconsistent. The largest and most recent <a href="genome-wide%20association%20study">genome-wide association study</a> failed to find any particular locus that exerts a large effect reinforcing the idea that no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder in most cases. Polymorphisms in <a href="BDNF">BDNF</a>, <a href="DRD4">DRD4</a>, <a href="DAO">DAO</a>, and <a href="TPH1">TPH1</a> have been frequently associated with bipolar disorder and were initially successful in a meta analysis, but failed after correction for multiple testing. On the other hand, two polymorphisms in <a href="TPH1">TPH1</a> were identified as being associated with bipolar disorder.

Due to the inconsistent findings in GWAS, multiple studies have undertaken the approach of analyzing SNPs in biological pathways. Signaling pathways traditionally associated with bipolar disorder that have been supported by these studies include <a href="CRH">CRH</a> signaling, cardiac <a href="%CE%B2-adrenergic">β-adrenergic</a> signaling, <a href="Phospholipase%20C">Phospholipase C</a> signaling, <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a> receptor signaling, cardiac hypertrophy signaling, <a href="Wnt%20signaling%20pathway">Wnt signaling</a>, <a href="Notch%20signaling">Notch signaling</a>, and <a href="endothelin%201">endothelin 1</a> signaling. Of the 16 genes identified in these pathways, three were found to be dysregulated in the <a href="DLPFC">DLPFC</a> in post-mortem studies, <a href="CACNA1C">CACNA1C</a>, <a href="GNG2">GNG2</a>, and <a href="ITPR2">ITPR2</a>.

Findings point strongly to heterogeneity, with different genes being implicated in different families. Robust and replicable genome-wide significant associations showed several common <a href="single%20nucleotide%20polymorphism">single nucleotide polymorphism</a>s, including variants within the genes <a href="CACNA1C">CACNA1C</a>, <a href="ODZ4">ODZ4</a>, and <a href="NCAN">NCAN</a>.

<a href="Paternal%20age%20effect">Advanced paternal age</a> has been linked to a somewhat increased chance of bipolar disorder in offspring, consistent with a hypothesis of increased new <a href="genetic%20mutations">genetic mutations</a>.

Environmental factors play a significant role in the development and course of bipolar disorder, and individual psychosocial variables may interact with genetic dispositions. It is probable that recent life events and interpersonal relationships contribute to the onset and recurrence of bipolar mood episodes, just as they do for unipolar depression. In surveys, 30–50 percent of adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder report traumatic/abusive experiences in childhood, which is associated on average with earlier onset, a higher rate of suicide attempts, and more co-occurring disorders such as <a href="PTSD">PTSD</a>. The number of reported stressful events in childhood is higher in those with an adult diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder compared to those without, particularly events stemming from a harsh environment rather than from the child's own behavior.

Less commonly bipolar disorder, or a bipolar-like disorder, may occur as a result of or in association with a neurological condition or injury. Conditions like these and injuries include (but are not limited to) <a href="stroke">stroke</a>, <a href="traumatic%20brain%20injury">traumatic brain injury</a>, <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV infection</a>, <a href="multiple%20sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a>, <a href="porphyria">porphyria</a>, and rarely <a href="temporal%20lobe%20epilepsy">temporal lobe epilepsy</a>.

Abnormalities in the structure and/or function of certain brain circuits could underlie bipolar. <a href="Meta%20analysis">Meta-analyses</a> of structural MRI studies in bipolar disorder report an increase in the volume of the <a href="lateral%20ventricles">lateral ventricles</a>, <a href="globus%20pallidus">globus pallidus</a>, and an increase in the rates of deep <a href="white%20matter">white matter</a> <a href="hyperintensities">hyperintensities</a>. <a href="Functional%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">Functional MRI</a> findings suggest that abnormal modulation between ventral <a href="prefrontal%20cortex">prefrontal</a> and <a href="limbic%20system">limbic</a> regions, especially the <a href="amygdala">amygdala</a>, likely contributes to poor emotional regulation and mood symptoms.

<a href="Euthymia%20%28medicine%29">Euthymic</a> bipolar people show decreased activity in the lingual gyrus, while people who are manic demonstrate decreased activity in the inferior frontal cortex, while no differences were found in people with depressed bipolar. People with bipolar have increased activation of left hemisphere ventral limbic areas and decreased activation of right hemisphere cortical structures related to cognition.

One proposed model for bipolar suggests that hypersensitivity of reward circuits consisting of fronto-striatal circuits causes mania and hyposensitivity of these circuits cause depression.

According to the "kindling" hypothesis, when people who are genetically predisposed toward bipolar disorder experience stressful events, the stress threshold at which mood changes occur becomes progressively lower, until the episodes eventually start (and recur) spontaneously. There is evidence supporting an association between early-life stress and dysfunction of the <a href="hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal%20axis">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</a> (HPA axis) leading to its over activation, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder.

Some of the brain components which have been proposed to play a role are the <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> and a sodium <a href="ATPase">ATPase</a> pump. <a href="Circadian%20rhythm">Circadian rhythm</a>s and melatonin regulation also seem to be altered.

<a href="Dopamine">Dopamine</a>, a known neurotransmitter responsible for mood cycling, has been shown to have increased transmission during the manic phase. The dopamine hypothesis states that the increase in dopamine results in secondary homeostatic down regulation of key systems and receptors such as an increase in dopamine mediated <a href="G%20protein-coupled%20receptors">G protein-coupled receptors</a>. This results in decreased dopamine transmission characteristic of the depressive phase. The depressive phase ends with homeostatic up regulation potentially restarting the cycle over again.

<a href="Glutamate%20%28neurotransmitter%29">Glutamate</a> is significantly increased within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, and returns to normal levels once the phase is over. The increase in <a href="GABA">GABA</a> is possibly caused by a disturbance in early development causing a disturbance of cell migration and the formation of normal lamination, the layering of brain structures commonly associated with the <a href="cerebral%20cortex">cerebral cortex</a>.

Medications used to treat bipolar may exert their effect by modulating intracellular signaling, such as through depleting myo-inositol levels, inhibition of cAMP signaling, and through altering G coupled proteins.

Decreased levels of 5-HIAA in the CSF of bipolar patients during both depressed and manic phases. Increased dopaminergic activity has been hypothesized in manic states due to the ability of <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a> agonist to stimulant mania in bipolar patients. Decreased sensitivity of regulatory α <a href="adrenergic%20receptor">adrenergic receptor</a>s as well as increased cell counts in the locus coeruleus indicated increased noradrenergic activity in manic patients. Low plasma GABA levels on both sides of the mood spectrum have been found. One review found no difference in monoamine levels, but found abnormal norepinephrine turnover in bipolar patients. Tyrosine depletion was found to attenuate the effects of <a href="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a> in bipolar patients as well as symptoms of mania, implicating dopamine in mania. VMAT2 binding was found to be increased in one study of bipolar manic patients.

Attempts at <a href="Mental%20disorder%23Prevention">prevention of bipolar disorder</a> have focused on stress (such as childhood adversity or highly conflictual families) which, although not a diagnostically specific causal agent for bipolar, does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more pernicious course of illness. There has been debate regarding the causal relationship between usage of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a> and bipolar disorder.

Bipolar disorder is commonly diagnosed during adolescence or early adulthood, but onset can occur throughout the life cycle. The disorder can be difficult to distinguish from unipolar depression and the average delay in diagnosis is 5–10 years after symptoms begin. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder takes several factors into account and considers the self-reported experiences of the symptomatic individual, abnormal behavior reported by family members, friends or co-workers, observable signs of illness as assessed by a clinician, and often a medical work-up to rule-out medical causes. In diagnosis, caregiver-scored rating scales, specifically the mother, has been found to be more accurate than teacher and youth report in predicting identifying youths with bipolar disorder. Assessment is usually done on an outpatient basis; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to oneself or others. The most widely used criteria for diagnosing bipolar disorder are from the <a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a>'s (APA) <a href="DSM-5">"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", Fifth Edition</a> (DSM-5) and the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>'s (WHO) <a href="ICD-10">"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems", 10th Edition</a> (ICD-10). The ICD-10 criteria are used more often in clinical settings outside of the U.S. while the DSM criteria are used clinically within the U.S. and are the prevailing criteria used internationally in research studies. The DSM-5, published in 2013, included further and more accurate specifiers compared to its predecessor, the <a href="DSM-IV-TR">DSM-IV-TR</a>. <a href="Semi-structured%20interview">Semi structured interviews</a> such as the <a href="Kiddie%20Schedule%20for%20Affective%20Disorders%20and%20Schizophrenia">Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia</a> (KSADS) and the <a href="Structured%20Clinical%20Interview%20for%20DSM-IV">Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV</a> (SCID) are used for diagnostic confirmation of bipolar disorder.

Several <a href="rating%20scale">rating scale</a>s for the screening and evaluation of bipolar disorder exist, including the <a href="Bipolar%20spectrum%20diagnostic%20scale">Bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale</a>, <a href="Mood%20Disorder%20Questionnaire">Mood Disorder Questionnaire</a>, the <a href="General%20Behavior%20Inventory">General Behavior Inventory</a> and the <a href="HCL-32">Hypomania Checklist</a>. The use of evaluation scales cannot substitute a full clinical interview but they serve to systematize the recollection of symptoms. On the other hand, instruments for screening bipolar disorder tend to have lower <a href="sensitivity%20and%20specificity">sensitivity</a>.

There are several other mental disorders with symptoms similar to those seen in bipolar disorder. These disorders include schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and certain personality disorders, such as <a href="borderline%20personality%20disorder">borderline personality disorder</a>.

Although there are no biological tests that are diagnostic of bipolar disorder, blood tests and/or imaging may be carried out to exclude medical illnesses with clinical presentations similar to that of bipolar disorder such as <a href="hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</a> or <a href="hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</a>, metabolic disturbance, a chronic disease, or an infection such as HIV or <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>. A review of current and recent medications and drug use is considered to rule out these causes; common medications that can cause manic symptoms include antidepressants, <a href="prednisone">prednisone</a>, <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a> medications, <a href="Levothyroxine">thyroid hormone</a>, stimulants (including <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> and methamphetamine), and certain <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s. An <a href="Electroencephalography">EEG</a> may be used to exclude <a href="neurological%20disorder">neurological disorder</a>s such as <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, and a <a href="Computed%20tomography">CT scan</a> or <a href="MRI">MRI</a> of the head may be used to exclude brain lesions. Additional testing is especially indicated when age of first onset is mid to late life. Investigations are not generally repeated for a relapse unless there is a specific medical indication.

Bipolar spectrum disorders includes: bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder and cases where subthreshold symptoms are found to cause clinically significant impairment or distress. These disorders involve major depressive episodes that alternate with manic or hypomanic episodes, or with mixed episodes that feature symptoms of both mood states. The concept of the bipolar <a href="spectrum%20disorder">spectrum</a> is similar to that of <a href="Emil%20Kraepelin">Emil Kraepelin</a>'s original concept of manic depressive illness.

Unipolar hypomania without accompanying depression has been noted in the medical literature. There is speculation as to whether this condition may occur with greater frequency in the general, untreated population; successful social function of these potentially high-achieving individuals may lead to being labeled as normal, rather than as individuals with substantial dysregulation.

The DSM and the ICD characterize bipolar disorder as a spectrum of disorders occurring on a continuum. The DSM-5 lists three specific subtypes:


When relevant, specifiers for "peripartum onset" and "with rapid cycling" should be used with any subtype. Individuals who have subthreshold symptoms that cause clinically significant distress or impairment, but do not meet full criteria for one of the three subtypes may be diagnosed with other specified or unspecified bipolar disorder. Other specified bipolar disorder is used when a clinician chooses to provide an explanation for why the full criteria were not met (e.g., hypomania without a prior major depressive episode).

Most people who meet criteria for bipolar disorder experience a number of episodes, on average 0.4 to 0.7 per year, lasting three to six months. "Rapid cycling", however, is a course specifier that may be applied to any of the above subtypes. It is defined as having four or more mood disturbance episodes within a one-year span and is found in a significant proportion of individuals with bipolar disorder. These episodes are separated from each other by a remission (partial or full) for at least two months or a switch in mood polarity (i.e., from a depressive episode to a manic episode or vice versa). The definition of rapid cycling most frequently cited in the literature (including the DSM) is that of Dunner and Fieve: at least four major depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes are required to have occurred during a 12-month period. Ultra-rapid (days) and ultra-ultra rapid or <a href="ultradian">ultradian</a> (within a day) cycling have also been described. The literature examining the pharmacological treatment of rapid cycling is sparse and there is no clear consensus with respect to its optimal pharmacological management.

There are a number of <a href="pharmacological">pharmacological</a> and <a href="psychotherapeutic">psychotherapeutic</a> techniques used to treat bipolar disorder. Individuals may use <a href="self-help%20groups%20for%20mental%20health">self-help</a> and pursue <a href="recovery%20model">recovery</a>.

Hospitalization may be required especially with the manic episodes present in bipolar I. This can be voluntary or (if mental health legislation allows and varying state-to-state regulations in the USA) involuntary (called civil or <a href="involuntary%20commitment">involuntary commitment</a>). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to <a href="deinstitutionalization">deinstitutionalization</a>, although these can still occur. Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or an <a href="Assertive%20Community%20Treatment">Assertive Community Treatment</a> team, supported employment and patient-led support groups, intensive outpatient programs. These are sometimes referred to as partial-inpatient programs.

<a href="Psychotherapy">Psychotherapy</a> is aimed at alleviating core symptoms, recognizing episode triggers, reducing negative expressed emotion in relationships, recognizing <a href="prodromal">prodromal</a> symptoms before full-blown recurrence, and, practicing the factors that lead to maintenance of <a href="remission%20%28medicine%29">remission</a>. <a href="Cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a>, <a href="family%20therapy">family-focused therapy</a>, and <a href="psychoeducation">psychoeducation</a> have the most evidence for efficacy in regard to relapse prevention, while <a href="interpersonal%20and%20social%20rhythm%20therapy">interpersonal and social rhythm therapy</a> and cognitive-behavioral therapy appear the most effective in regard to residual depressive symptoms. Most studies have been based only on bipolar I, however, and treatment during the acute phase can be a particular challenge. Some clinicians emphasize the need to talk with individuals experiencing mania, to develop a <a href="therapeutic%20alliance">therapeutic alliance</a> in support of <a href="recovery%20model">recovery</a>.

A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The medication with the best evidence is <a href="lithium%20%28medication%29">lithium</a>, which is an effective treatment for acute manic episodes, preventing relapses, and bipolar depression. Lithium reduces the risk of suicide, self-harm, and death in people with bipolar disorder. It is unclear if <a href="ketamine">ketamine</a> is useful in bipolar as of 2015.

Four <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a>s are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder for their mood stabilizing properties. <a href="Carbamazepine">Carbamazepine</a> effectively treats manic episodes, with some evidence it has greater benefit in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, or those with more psychotic symptoms or a more schizoaffective clinical picture. It is less effective in preventing relapse than lithium or valproate. Carbamazepine became a popular treatment option for bipolar in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but was displaced by <a href="sodium%20valproate">sodium valproate</a> in the 1990s. Since then, valproate has become a commonly prescribed treatment, and is effective in treating manic episodes. <a href="Lamotrigine">Lamotrigine</a> has some efficacy in treating bipolar depression, and this benefit is greatest in more severe depression. It has also been shown to have some benefit in preventing further episodes, though there are concerns about the studies done, and is of no benefit in rapid cycling disorder. The effectiveness of <a href="topiramate">topiramate</a> is unknown. Depending on the severity of the case, anticonvulsants may be used in combination with lithium or on their own.

<a href="Antipsychotic">Antipsychotic</a> medications are effective for short-term treatment of bipolar manic episodes and appear to be superior to lithium and anticonvulsants for this purpose. However, other medications such as lithium are preferred for long-term use. <a href="Olanzapine">Olanzapine</a> is effective in preventing relapses, although the evidence is not as solid as the evidence for lithium. <a href="Antidepressants">Antidepressants</a> have not been found to be of any benefit over that found with mood stabilizers. Furthermore, antidepressants are not recommended for use alone in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

Short courses of <a href="benzodiazepines">benzodiazepines</a> may be used in addition to other medications until mood stabilizing become effective. <a href="Electroconvulsive%20therapy">Electroconvulsive therapy</a> (ECT) is an effective form of treatment for acute mood disturbances in those with bipolar disorder, especially when psychotic or <a href="Catatonia">catatonic</a> features are displayed. ECT is also recommended for use in pregnant women with bipolar disorder.

Several studies have suggested that <a href="omega%203%20fatty%20acids">omega 3 fatty acids</a> may have beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, but not manic symptoms. However, only a few small studies of variable quality have been published and there is not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions.

A lifelong condition with periods of partial or full recovery in between recurrent episodes of relapse, bipolar disorder is considered to be a major health problem worldwide because of the increased rates of disability and premature mortality. It is also associated with co-occurring psychiatric and medical problems and high rates of initial under- or misdiagnosis, causing a delay in appropriate treatment interventions and contributing to poorer prognoses. After a diagnosis is made, it remains difficult to achieve complete remission of all symptoms with the currently available psychiatric medications and symptoms often become progressively more severe over time.

Compliance with medications is one of the most significant factors that can decrease the rate and severity of relapse and have a positive impact on overall prognosis. However, the types of medications used in treating BD commonly cause side effects and more than 75% of individuals with BD inconsistently take their medications for various reasons.

Of the various types of the disorder, rapid cycling (four or more episodes in one year) is associated with the worst prognosis due to higher rates of <a href="self-harm">self-harm</a> and suicide. Individuals diagnosed with bipolar who have a family history of bipolar disorder are at a greater risk for more frequent manic/hypomanic episodes. Early onset and psychotic features are also associated with worse outcomes, as well as subtypes that are nonresponsive to lithium.

Early recognition and intervention also improve prognosis as the symptoms in earlier stages are less severe and more responsive to treatment. Onset after adolescence is connected to better prognoses for both genders, and being male is a protective factor against higher levels of depression. For women, better social functioning prior to developing bipolar disorder and being a parent are protective towards suicide attempts.

People with bipolar disorder often experience a decline in cognitive functioning during (or possibly before) their first episode, after which a certain degree of cognitive dysfunction typically becomes permanent, with more severe impairment during <a href="acute%20medicine">acute phases</a> and moderate impairment during periods of remission. As a result, two-thirds of people with BD continue to experience impaired <a href="psychosocial">psychosocial functioning</a> in between episodes even when their mood symptoms are in full remission. A similar pattern in seen in both BD-I and BD-II, but people with BD-II experience a lesser degree of impairment. Cognitive deficits typically increase over the course of the illness. Higher degrees of impairment correlate with the number of previous manic episodes and hospitalizations, and with the presence psychotic symptoms. Early intervention can slow the progression of cognitive impairment, while treatment at later stages can help reduce distress and negative consequences related to cognitive dysfunction.

Despite the overly ambitious goals that are frequently part of manic episodes, symptoms of mania undermine the ability to achieve these goals and often interfere an individual's social and occupational functioning. One third of people with BD remain unemployed for one year following a hospitalization for mania. Depressive symptoms during and between episodes, which occur much more frequently for most people than hypomanic or manic symptoms over the course of illness, are associated with lower functional recovery in between episodes, including unemployment or underemployment for both BD-I and BD-II. However, the course of illness (duration, age of onset, number of hospitalizations, and presence or not of rapid cycling) and cognitive performance are the best predictors of employment outcomes in individuals with bipolar disorder, followed by symptoms of depression and years of education.

A naturalistic study from first admission for mania or mixed episode (representing the hospitalized and therefore most severe cases) found that 50 percent achieved syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks and 98 percent within two years. Within two years, 72 percent achieved symptomatic recovery (no symptoms at all) and 43 percent achieved functional recovery (regaining of prior occupational and residential status). However, 40 percent went on to experience a new episode of mania or depression within 2 years of syndromal recovery, and 19 percent switched phases without recovery.

Symptoms preceding a relapse (<a href="prodromal">prodromal</a>), specially those related to mania, can be reliably identified by people with bipolar disorder. There have been intents to teach patients <a href="coping%20strategies">coping strategies</a> when noticing such symptoms with encouraging results.

Bipolar disorder can cause suicidal ideation that leads to <a href="suicidal">suicidal</a> attempts. Individuals whose bipolar disorder begins with a depressive or mixed affective episode seem to have a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of suicide. One out of two people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide at least once during their lifetime and many attempts are successfully completed. The annual average suicide rate is 0.4 percent, which is 10–20 times that of the general population. The <a href="standardized%20mortality%20ratio">standardized mortality ratio</a> from <a href="suicide">suicide</a> in bipolar disorder is between 18 and 25. The lifetime risk of suicide has been estimated to be as high as 20 percent in those with bipolar disorder.

Bipolar disorder is the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide and has a lifetime prevalence of about 3 percent in the general population. However, a reanalysis of data from the National Epidemiological Catchment Area survey in the United States suggested that 0.8 percent of the population experience a <a href="manic%20episode">manic episode</a> at least once (the diagnostic threshold for <a href="bipolar%20I">bipolar I</a>) and a further 0.5 percent have a <a href="hypomanic">hypomanic</a> episode (the diagnostic threshold for bipolar II or cyclothymia). Including sub-threshold diagnostic criteria, such as one or two symptoms over a short time-period, an additional 5.1 percent of the population, adding up to a total of 6.4 percent, were classified as having a bipolar spectrum disorder. A more recent analysis of data from a second US <a href="National%20Comorbidity%20Survey">National Comorbidity Survey</a> found that 1 percent met lifetime prevalence criteria for bipolar I, 1.1 percent for bipolar II, and 2.4 percent for subthreshold symptoms.

There are conceptual and methodological limitations and variations in the findings. Prevalence studies of bipolar disorder are typically carried out by lay interviewers who follow fully structured/fixed interview schemes; responses to single items from such interviews may suffer limited validity. In addition, diagnoses (and therefore estimates of prevalence) vary depending on whether a categorical or <a href="spectrum%20approach">spectrum approach</a> is used. This consideration has led to concerns about the potential for both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis.

The incidence of bipolar disorder is similar in men and women as well as across different cultures and ethnic groups. A 2000 study by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> found that prevalence and incidence of bipolar disorder are very similar across the world. Age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 421.0 in South Asia to 481.7 in Africa and Europe for men and from 450.3 in Africa and Europe to 491.6 in Oceania for women. However, severity may differ widely across the globe. Disability-adjusted life year rates, for example, appear to be higher in developing countries, where medical coverage may be poorer and medication less available. Within the United States, <a href="Asian%20American">Asian American</a>s have significantly lower rates than their <a href="African%20American">African</a> and <a href="European%20American">European American</a> counterparts.

Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak years for the onset of bipolar disorder. One study also found that in 10 percent of bipolar cases, the onset of mania had happened after the patient had turned 50.

Variations in moods and energy levels have been observed as part of the human experience throughout history. The words "<a href="melancholia">melancholia</a>", an old word for depression, and "mania" originated in Ancient Greece. The word melancholia is derived from "melas" (), meaning "black", and "chole" (), meaning "bile" or "gall", indicative of the term's origins in pre-Hippocratic <a href="humoral%20theory">humoral theory</a>. Within the humoral theories, mania was viewed as arising from an excess of yellow bile, or a mixture of black and yellow bile. The linguistic origins of mania, however, are not so clear-cut. Several etymologies were proposed by the Ancient Roman physician <a href="Caelius%20Aurelianus">Caelius Aurelianus</a>, including the Greek word "ania", meaning "to produce great mental anguish", and "manos", meaning "relaxed" or "loose", which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul. There are at least five other candidates, and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-Hippocratic poetry and mythology.

In the early 1800s, French psychiatrist <a href="Jean-%C3%89tienne%20Dominique%20Esquirol">Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol</a>'s lypemania, one of his affective <a href="monomania">monomania</a>s, was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression. The basis of the current conceptualisation of bipolar illness can be traced back to the 1850s; on January 31, 1854, <a href="Jules%20Baillarger">Jules Baillarger</a> described to the French Imperial <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20Nationale%20de%20M%C3%A9decine">Académie Nationale de Médecine</a> a biphasic mental illness causing recurrent oscillations between mania and depression, which he termed "folie à double forme" (dual-form insanity). Two weeks later, on February 14, 1854, <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Falret">Jean-Pierre Falret</a> presented a description to the Academy on what was essentially the same disorder, and which he called "folie circulaire" (circular insanity).

These concepts were developed by the German psychiatrist <a href="Emil%20Kraepelin">Emil Kraepelin</a> (1856–1926), who, using <a href="Karl%20Ludwig%20Kahlbaum">Kahlbaum</a>'s concept of cyclothymia, categorized and studied the natural course of untreated bipolar patients. He coined the term "manic depressive psychosis", after noting that periods of acute illness, manic or depressive, were generally punctuated by relatively symptom-free intervals where the patient was able to function normally.

The term "manic–depressive "reaction"" appeared in the first version of the DSM in 1952, influenced by the legacy of <a href="Adolf%20Meyer%20%28psychiatrist%29">Adolf Meyer</a>. Subtyping into "unipolar" depressive disorders and bipolar disorders was first proposed by German psychiatrists <a href="Karl%20Kleist">Karl Kleist</a> and <a href="Karl%20Leonhard">Karl Leonhard</a> in the 1950s and they have regarded as a separate conditions since publication of the DSM-III. The subtypes bipolar II and rapid cycling have been included since the DSM-IV, based on work from the 1970s by <a href="David%20L.%20Dunner">David Dunner</a>, <a href="Elliot%20S.%20Gershon">Elliot Gershon</a>, <a href="Frederick%20K.%20Goodwin">Frederick Goodwin</a>, <a href="Ronald%20R.%20Fieve">Ronald Fieve</a>, and <a href="Joseph%20L.%20Fleiss">Joseph Fleiss</a>.

There are widespread problems with <a href="social%20stigma">social stigma</a>, stereotypes, and prejudice against individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

<a href="Kay%20Redfield%20Jamison">Kay Redfield Jamison</a>, a clinical psychologist and professor of psychiatry at the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine">Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</a>, profiled her own bipolar disorder in her memoir "<a href="An%20Unquiet%20Mind">An Unquiet Mind</a>" (1995). In his autobiography "" (2008) <a href="Chris%20Joseph%20%28autobiographer%29">Chris Joseph</a> describes his struggle between the creative dynamism which allowed the creation of his multimillion-pound advertising agency <a href="Hook%20Advertising">Hook Advertising</a>, and the money-squandering dark despair of his bipolar illness.

Several dramatic works have portrayed characters with traits suggestive of the diagnosis that has been the subject of discussion by psychiatrists and film experts alike. A notable example is "<a href="Mr.%20Jones%20%281993%20film%29">Mr. Jones</a>" (1993), in which Mr. Jones (<a href="Richard%20Gere">Richard Gere</a>) swings from a manic episode into a depressive phase and back again, spending time in a psychiatric hospital and displaying many of the features of the syndrome. In "<a href="The%20Mosquito%20Coast">The Mosquito Coast</a>" (1986), Allie Fox (<a href="Harrison%20Ford">Harrison Ford</a>) displays some features including recklessness, grandiosity, increased goal-directed activity and mood lability, as well as some <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a>. Psychiatrists have suggested that <a href="Willy%20Loman">Willy Loman</a>, the main character in <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a>'s classic play "<a href="Death%20of%20a%20Salesman">Death of a Salesman</a>", suffers from bipolar disorder, though that specific term for the condition did not exist when the play was written.

<a href="TV%20special">TV special</a>s, for example the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "", <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s "<a href="True%20Life">True Life</a>: I'm Bipolar", talk shows, and public radio shows, and the greater willingness of public figures to discuss their own bipolar disorder, have focused on psychiatric conditions, thereby, raising public awareness.

On April 7, 2009, the nighttime drama "<a href="90210%20%28TV%20series%29">90210</a>" on the <a href="The%20CW">CW</a> network, aired a <a href="very%20special%20episode">special episode</a> where the character Silver was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. <a href="Stacey%20Slater">Stacey Slater</a>, a character from the BBC soap <a href="EastEnders">EastEnders</a>, has been diagnosed with the disorder. The storyline was developed as part of the BBC's Headroom campaign. The <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> soap "<a href="Brookside">Brookside</a>" had earlier featured a story about bipolar disorder when the character <a href="Jimmy%20Corkhill">Jimmy Corkhill</a> was diagnosed with the condition. 2011 <a href="Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29">Showtime</a>'s <a href="political%20thriller">political thriller</a> drama "<a href="Homeland%20%28TV%20series%29">Homeland</a>" protagonist <a href="Carrie%20Mathison">Carrie Mathison</a> is bipolar, which she has kept secret since her school days. In April 2014, <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> premiered a medical drama, "<a href="Black%20Box%20%28TV%20series%29">Black Box</a>", in which the main character, a world-renowned neuroscientist, is bipolar.

In the 1920s, <a href="Emil%20Kraepelin">Emil Kraepelin</a> noted that manic episodes are rare before puberty. In general, bipolar disorder in children was not recognized in the first half of the twentieth century. This issue diminished with an increased following of the DSM criteria in the last part of the twentieth century.

While in adults the course of bipolar disorder is characterized by discrete episodes of depression and mania with no clear symptomatology between them, in children and adolescents very fast mood changes or even chronic symptoms are the norm. Pediatric bipolar disorder is commonly characterized by outbursts of anger, irritability and <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a>, rather than <a href="euphoria">euphoric</a> <a href="mania">mania</a>, which is more likely to be seen in adults. Early onset bipolar disorder is more likely to manifest as depression rather than mania or hypomania.

The diagnosis of childhood bipolar disorder is controversial, although it is not under discussion that the typical symptoms of bipolar disorder have negative consequences for minors suffering them. The debate is mainly centered on whether what is called bipolar disorder in children refers to the same disorder as when diagnosing adults, and the related question of whether the criteria for diagnosis for adults are useful and accurate when applied to children. Regarding diagnosis of children, some experts recommend following the DSM criteria. Others believe that these criteria do not correctly separate children with bipolar disorder from other problems such as ADHD, and emphasize fast mood cycles. Still others argue that what accurately differentiates children with bipolar disorder is irritability. The practice parameters of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Child%20and%20Adolescent%20Psychiatry">AACAP</a> encourage the first strategy. American children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorder in community hospitals increased 4-fold reaching rates of up to 40 percent in 10 years around the beginning of the 21st century, while in <a href="outpatient">outpatient</a> clinics it doubled reaching 6 percent. Studies using DSM criteria show that up to 1 percent of youth may have bipolar disorder.

Treatment involves medication and psychotherapy. Drug prescription usually consists in <a href="mood%20stabilizer">mood stabilizer</a>s and <a href="atypical%20antipsychotic">atypical antipsychotic</a>s. Among the former, <a href="Lithium%20%28medication%29">lithium</a> is the only compound approved by the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">FDA</a> for children. Psychological treatment combines normally <a href="Psychoeducation">education on the disease</a>, <a href="Group%20psychotherapy">group therapy</a> and <a href="cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>. <a href="Chronic%20%28medicine%29">Chronic</a> medication is often needed.

Current research directions for bipolar disorder in children include optimizing treatments, increasing the knowledge of the genetic and neurobiological basis of the pediatric disorder and improving diagnostic criteria. Some treatment research suggests that <a href="psychosocial">psychosocial</a> interventions that involve the family, psychoeducation, and skills building (through therapies such as <a href="Cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy">CBT</a>, <a href="Dialectical%20behavior%20therapy">DBT</a>, and <a href="Interpersonal%20and%20social%20rhythm%20therapy">IPSRT</a>) can benefit in a pharmocotherapy. Unfortunately, the literature and research on the effects of psychosocial therapy on BPSD is scarce, making it difficult to determine the efficacy of various therapies. The DSM-5 has proposed a new diagnosis which is considered to cover some presentations currently thought of as childhood-onset bipolar.

There is a relative lack of knowledge about bipolar disorder in late life. There is evidence that it becomes less prevalent with age but nevertheless accounts for a similar percentage of psychiatric admissions; that older bipolar patients had first experienced symptoms at a later age; that later onset of mania is associated with more neurologic impairment; that substance abuse is considerably less common in older groups; and that there is probably a greater degree of variation in presentation and course, for instance individuals may develop new-onset mania associated with vascular changes, or become manic only after recurrent depressive episodes, or may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at an early age and still meet criteria. There is also some weak and not conclusive evidence that mania is less intense and there is a higher prevalence of mixed episodes, although there may be a reduced response to treatment. Overall, there are likely more similarities than differences from younger adults. In the elderly, recognition and treatment of bipolar disorder may be complicated by the presence of <a href="dementia">dementia</a> or the side effects of medications being taken for other conditions.

Burt Lancaster

Burton Stephen "Burt" Lancaster (November 2, 1913 – October 20, 1994) was an American film actor. Initially known for playing "tough guys", Lancaster went on to achieve success with more complex and challenging roles. He was nominated four times for <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>s and won once for his work in "<a href="Elmer%20Gantry%20%28film%29">Elmer Gantry</a>" in 1960. He also won a <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a> for that performance and <a href="BAFTA%20Award">BAFTA Award</a>s for "<a href="Birdman%20of%20Alcatraz%20%28film%29">The Birdman of Alcatraz</a>" (1962) and "<a href="Atlantic%20City%20%281980%20film%29">Atlantic City</a>" (1980). During the 1950s his production company <a href="Hecht-Hill-Lancaster">Hecht-Hill-Lancaster</a> was highly successful, making films such as "<a href="Marty%20%28film%29">Marty</a>" (1955), "<a href="Trapeze%20%28film%29">Trapeze</a>" (1956), "<a href="Sweet%20Smell%20of%20Success">Sweet Smell of Success</a>" (1957), "<a href="Run%20Silent%2C%20Run%20Deep%20%281958%20film%29">Run Silent, Run Deep</a>" (1958), and "<a href="Separate%20Tables%20%28film%29">Separate Tables</a>" (1958).

The <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> ranks Lancaster as #19 of the <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Stars">greatest male stars</a> of classic Hollywood cinema.

Lancaster was born in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, at his parents' home at 209 East 106th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, today the site of <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Plaza">Benjamin Franklin Plaza</a>. Lancaster was the son of Elizabeth (née Roberts) and James Henry Lancaster, who was a mailman. Both of his parents were <a href="Protestantism">Protestants</a> of working class origin. All of Lancaster's grandparents were <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a> immigrants to the United States; his maternal grandparents were from <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> and were descendants of English immigrants to Ireland. The family believed themselves to be related to <a href="Frederick%20Roberts%2C%201st%20Earl%20Roberts">Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts</a>. Lancaster grew up in <a href="East%20Harlem">East Harlem</a> and spent much of his time on the streets, where he developed great interest and skill in gymnastics while attending <a href="DeWitt%20Clinton%20High%20School">DeWitt Clinton High School</a>, where he was a basketball star. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, his mother died of a <a href="cerebral%20hemorrhage">cerebral hemorrhage</a>. Lancaster was accepted by <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> with an athletic scholarship, but subsequently dropped out.

At the age of 19, Lancaster met <a href="Nick%20Cravat">Nick Cravat</a>, with whom he developed a lifelong partnership. Together they learned to act in local theatre productions and circus arts at <a href="Union%20Settlement%20Association">Union Settlement</a>, one of the city's oldest settlement houses. They formed the acrobat duo Lang and Cravat in the 1930s and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However, in 1939, an injury forced Lancaster to give up the profession, with great regret. He then found temporary work, first as a salesman for <a href="Marshall%20Fields">Marshall Fields</a> and then as a singing waiter in various restaurants.

The United States having then entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Lancaster joined the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> in 1942 and performed with the Army's Twenty-First <a href="Special%20Services%20%28entertainment%29">Special Services</a> Division, one of the military groups organized to follow the troops on the ground and provide <a href="USO">USO</a> entertainment to keep up morale. He served with General <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark Clark</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Army%20North">Fifth Army</a> in <a href="Italy">Italy</a> from 1943–45.

Although initially unenthusiastic about acting, after returning to New York from his Army service, Lancaster auditioned for a Broadway play and was offered a role. Although <a href="Harry%20Brown%20%28writer%29">Harry Brown</a>'s "<a href="Eight%20Iron%20Men">A Sound of Hunting</a>" had a run of only three weeks, Lancaster's performance attracted the interest of a Hollywood agent, <a href="Harold%20Hecht">Harold Hecht</a> and, through him, Lancaster was brought to the attention of producer <a href="Hal%20B.%20Wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a>, who signed him to an eight-movie contract. Lancaster's first filmed movie was "<a href="Desert%20Fury">Desert Fury</a>". Fortunately for Lancaster, producer <a href="Mark%20Hellinger">Mark Hellinger</a> approached him to star in "<a href="The%20Killers%20%281946%20film%29">The Killers</a>", in 1946, which was completed and released prior to "Desert Fury" and to great critical success.

The tall, muscular actor won significant acclaim and appeared in two more films the following year. Subsequently, he played in a variety of films, especially in dramas, <a href="Thriller%20film">thrillers</a>, and military and adventure films. In two, "<a href="The%20Flame%20and%20the%20Arrow">The Flame and the Arrow</a>" and "<a href="The%20Crimson%20Pirate">The Crimson Pirate</a>," his friend from his circus years, Nick Cravat, played a key supporting role, and both actors impressed audiences with their acrobatic prowess.

In 1953, Lancaster played one of his best-remembered roles with <a href="Deborah%20Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a> in "<a href="From%20Here%20to%20Eternity">From Here to Eternity</a>." The <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which Deborah Kerr and he make love on a Hawaiian beach amid the crashing waves. The organization named it one of "AFI's top 100 Most Romantic Films" of all time.

Lancaster won the 1960 Academy Award for Best Actor, a Golden Globe Award, and the <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Critics%20Award">New York Film Critics Award</a> for his performance in "Elmer Gantry". He followed this with widely diverse roles, including a Nazi war criminal on trial for his life in "<a href="Judgment%20at%20Nuremberg">Judgment at Nuremberg</a>", a convict serving a life sentence in "<a href="Birdman%20of%20Alcatraz">Birdman of Alcatraz</a>", and a proud Italian nobleman in "<a href="The%20Leopard%20%281963%20film%29">The Leopard</a>". He also played a US Air Force general attempting a coup in the political thriller "<a href="Seven%20Days%20in%20May">Seven Days in May</a>".
In 1966, at the age of 52, Lancaster appeared nude in director <a href="Frank%20Perry">Frank Perry</a>'s film, "<a href="The%20Swimmer%20%281968%20film%29">The Swimmer</a>" in what the critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called "his finest performance". Prior to working on "The Swimmer", Lancaster was terrified of the water because he did not know how to swim. In preparation for the film, he took swimming lessons from <a href="University%20of%20California%20Los%20Angeles">UCLA</a> swim coach Bob Horn. The film was not released until 1968, when it proved to be a commercial failure, though Lancaster remained proud of the movie and his performance.

Lancaster co-starred with <a href="Lee%20Marvin">Lee Marvin</a> in the 1966 western adventure film, "<a href="The%20Professionals%20%281966%20film%29">The Professionals</a>", and with <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a> in the first of the so-called <a href="disaster%20film">disaster film</a> blockbusters, "<a href="Airport%20%281970%20film%29">Airport</a>", one of the biggest box-office hits of 1970 and, at that time, reportedly the highest-grossing film in the history of <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>.

During the latter part of his career, Lancaster left adventure and acrobatic films behind and portrayed more distinguished characters. This period brought him work on several international productions, with directors such as <a href="Luchino%20Visconti">Luchino Visconti</a>, <a href="Bernardo%20Bertolucci">Bernardo Bertolucci</a> and <a href="Louis%20Malle">Louis Malle</a>. His last Oscar nomination was for Malle's 1980 film "<a href="Atlantic%20City%20%281980%20film%29">Atlantic City</a>".

Lancaster sought demanding roles, and if he liked a part or a director, he was prepared to work for much lower pay than he might have earned elsewhere. He even helped to finance movies in whose artistic value he believed. He also mentored directors such as <a href="Sydney%20Pollack">Sydney Pollack</a> and <a href="John%20Frankenheimer">John Frankenheimer</a> and appeared in several television films. Lancaster's last film was "<a href="Field%20of%20Dreams">Field of Dreams</a>" (1989).

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Lancaster has a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.

Lancaster was an early and successful actor/producer. When approached to venture into the film business, after having been in the theater for only a brief period, he chose not to sign with a major studio. Instead he signed with agent <a href="Harold%20Hecht">Harold Hecht</a>, who promised him the opportunity to produce their own movies within five years of hitting Hollywood. Hecht kept his promise and the two formed a partnership production company under the name Norma Productions, named after Lancaster's wife. Their first movie together was "<a href="Kiss%20the%20Blood%20Off%20My%20Hands">Kiss the Blood Off My Hands</a>", released in 1948. Hecht and Lancaster produced two additional films in the early 1950s under the Norma Productions company; "<a href="The%20Flame%20and%20the%20Arrow">The Flame and the Arrow</a>" in 1950 and "<a href="Ten%20Tall%20Men">Ten Tall Men</a>" in 1951, two <a href="swashbucklers">swashbucklers</a> selected to showcase Lancaster's acrobatic skills.

In 1951 the actor/producer duo changed the company's name to Hecht-Lancaster Productions. The first film under the new name was another swashbuckler: "<a href="The%20Crimson%20Pirate">The Crimson Pirate</a>", released in 1952. This was followed by "<a href="Apache%20%28film%29">Apache</a>" two years later. In 1954 Lancaster was hired to star in the <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a> film "<a href="His%20Majesty%20O%27Keefe">His Majesty O'Keefe</a>". This proved to be a turning point for both Lancaster and his company. Lancaster had insisted that the film be produced by Hecht. "His Majesty O'Keefe" featured a new Hollywood writer on board. <a href="James%20Hill%20%28producer%29">James Hill</a> immediately hit it off with Lancaster and Hecht, and he was invited to co-produce upcoming Hecht-Lancaster films, giving up his writer position. His first as a producer was "<a href="Vera%20Cruz%20%28film%29">Vera Cruz</a>", released in 1954. 

Without Hill, Hecht and Lancaster produced "<a href="Marty%20%28film%29">Marty</a>", a 1955 film starring <a href="Ernest%20Borgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a>, which won both the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a> and the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a> award at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. "Marty" was also the first film produced by the company not to feature Lancaster in an acting role. "Vera Cruz" had been a huge success but "Marty" secured Hecht-Lancaster as one of the most successful independent production companies in Hollywood at the time. "<a href="The%20Kentuckian">The Kentuckian</a>" (1955) was directed by Lancaster in his <a href="directorial%20debut">directorial debut</a>.

In 1955 Hill was made an equal partner in the company and the name was upgraded to <a href="Hecht-Hill-Lancaster">Hecht-Hill-Lancaster</a>, releasing their first film in 1956, "<a href="Trapeze%20%28film%29">Trapeze</a>", in which Lancaster performed many of his own stunts. "Trapeze" went on to become the production company's top box office success. Following "Trapeze" Lancaster worked with <a href="Tony%20Curtis">Tony Curtis</a> again on "<a href="Sweet%20Smell%20of%20Success">Sweet Smell of Success</a>" (released in 1957), a co-production between Hecht-Hill-Lancaster and Curtis' own company Curtleigh Productions (co-owned with his wife, <a href="Janet%20Leigh">Janet Leigh</a>). In 1956 Lancaster and Hecht entered the music industry with the companies <a href="Hecht-Lancaster%20%26amp%3B%20Buzzell%20Music">Hecht-Lancaster & Buzzell Music</a> and <a href="Calyork%20Music">Calyork Music</a>.

Hecht-Hill-Lancaster produced seven additional films in the late 1950s; four starring Lancaster; "<a href="Run%20Silent%2C%20Run%20Deep%20%281958%20film%29">Run Silent, Run Deep</a>" (1958), "<a href="Separate%20Tables%20%28film%29">Separate Tables</a>" (1958), "<a href="The%20Devil%27s%20Disciple">The Devil's Disciple</a>" (1959) and "<a href="The%20Unforgiven%20%281960%20film%29">The Unforgiven</a>" (1960), and three without Lancaster: "<a href="The%20Bachelor%20Party">The Bachelor Party</a>" (1956), "<a href="Take%20a%20Giant%20Step">Take a Giant Step</a>" (1959) and "<a href="Summer%20of%20the%20Seventeenth%20Doll">Summer of the Seventeenth Doll</a>" (1960). Additionally Hecht-Hill-Lancaster served as the production company for the 1960-1961 TV series "<a href="Whiplash%20%28TV%20series%29">Whiplash</a>". The "H-H-L" team impressed Hollywood with its success; as "Life" wrote in 1957, "[a]fter the independent production of a baker's dozen of pictures, it has yet to have its first flop ... (They were also good pictures.)." 
The Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions company dissolved in 1960, after Hill ruptured his relation with both Hecht and Lancaster. Hill went on to produce a single additional film, "<a href="The%20Happy%20Thieves">The Happy Thieves</a>", in a new production company, Hillworth Productions, co-owned with his wife <a href="Rita%20Hayworth">Rita Hayworth</a>. Hecht and Lancaster worked on two more films together: "<a href="The%20Young%20Savages">The Young Savages</a>", released in 1961, and "<a href="Birdman%20of%20Alcatraz%20%28film%29">Birdman of Alcatraz</a>", released in 1962 through Norma Productions as the production company's final film. Hecht went on to produce five films without Lancaster's assistance, through his company Harold Hecht Films Productions between 1961 and 1967, including another Academy Award winner, "<a href="Cat%20Ballou">Cat Ballou</a>", starring <a href="Lee%20Marvin">Lee Marvin</a> and <a href="Jane%20Fonda">Jane Fonda</a>. Lancaster and Hecht would reunite twelve years after "Birdman of Alcatraz" for what ended up being Hecht's final film, "<a href="Ulzana%27s%20Raid">Ulzana's Raid</a>", in 1972.

In 1967, Lancaster formed a new partnership with <a href="Roland%20Kibbee">Roland Kibbee</a>, who had already worked as a writer on five Lancaster projects; "Ten Tall Men", "The Crimson Pirate", "<a href="Three%20Sailors%20and%20a%20Girl">Three Sailors and a Girl</a>" (in which Lancaster made a cameo appearance), "Vera Cruz" and "The Devil's Disciple". Through Norlan Productions, Lancaster and Kibbee produced "<a href="The%20Scalphunters">The Scalphunters</a>" in 1968, "<a href="Valdez%20Is%20Coming">Valdez Is Coming</a>" in 1971 (which was also written by Kibbee) and "<a href="The%20Midnight%20Man%20%281974%20film%29">The Midnight Man</a>" in 1974. "The Midnight Man" was written, produced and directed by both Kibbee and Lancaster, and would be the actor's final film as a producer. In his career, Lancaster produced twenty-three films, directed two and wrote for one.

Burt Lancaster appeared in a total of seventeen films produced by his agent <a href="Harold%20Hecht">Harold Hecht</a>. Eight of these were co-produced by <a href="James%20Hill%20%28producer%29">James Hill</a>. He also appeared in eight films produced by <a href="Hal%20B.%20Wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a> and two with producer <a href="Mark%20Hellinger">Mark Hellinger</a>. Although Lancaster's work alongside Kirk Douglas was mostly known as a successful pair of actors, Douglas in fact produced four films for the pair, through his production companies Bryna Productions and Joel Productions. Roland Kibbee also produced three Lancaster films. Lancaster was also cast in two <a href="Stanley%20Kramer">Stanley Kramer</a> productions.


<a href="Roland%20Kibbee">Roland Kibbee</a> wrote for seven Lancaster films.

Lancaster used make-up veteran Robert Schiffer in twenty credited films, hiring Schiffer on nearly all the films he produced.

As Lancaster grew older, he became increasingly plagued by <a href="atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a>, barely surviving a routine <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a> operation in January 1980. Following two minor <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attacks</a>, he had to undergo an emergency quadruple <a href="coronary%20bypass">coronary bypass</a> in 1983, after which he was extremely weak. However, he still managed to continue acting. In 1988, Lancaster was well enough to attended a Congressional hearing with old colleagues such as <a href="Jimmy%20Stewart">Jimmy Stewart</a> and <a href="Ginger%20Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a> to protest media magnate <a href="Ted%20Turner">Ted Turner</a>'s plan to <a href="colorize">colorize</a> various black-and-white films from the 1930s and 1940s. His acting career ended after he suffered a stroke on November 30, 1990, which left him partly <a href="paralysis">paralyzed</a> and largely unable to speak. 13 days before his 81st birthday, he died in his <a href="Century%20City">Century City</a> apartment in Los Angeles from a third heart attack at 4:50 am on October 20, 1994 at the age of 80.

Lancaster was cremated and his ashes were buried under a large oak tree in <a href="Westwood%20Memorial%20Park">Westwood Memorial Park</a> located in <a href="Westwood%20Village">Westwood Village</a>, Los Angeles County, California. A small, square ground plaque inscribed only with "BURT LANCASTER 1913–1994" marks his final resting place. Upon his death, as he requested, he had no memorial or funeral service.

Lancaster vigorously guarded his private life. He was married three times. His first two marriages – to June Ernst from 1935 to 1946 and to Norma Anderson from 1946 to 1969 – ended in divorce. His third marriage, to Susan Martin, was from September 1990 until his death in 1994. All five of his children were with Norma Anderson: <a href="Bill%20Lancaster">Bill</a>, who became a screenwriter, James, Susan, Joanna, and Sighle (pronounced Sheila). He claimed he was romantically involved with Deborah Kerr during the filming of "From Here to Eternity" in 1953. However, Kerr stated that while there was a spark of attraction, nothing ever happened. He reportedly had an affair with <a href="Joan%20Blondell">Joan Blondell</a>. In her 1980 autobiography, <a href="Shelley%20Winters">Shelley Winters</a> claimed to have had a long affair with him. Recent biographers and others believe that Lancaster was <a href="bisexual">bisexual</a>, and that he had intimate relationships with men as well as women. According to testimony in Kate Buford's "Burt Lancaster: An American Life", Lancaster was devotedly loyal to his friends and family. Old pals from his childhood in NYC's East Harlem remained his friends for life.

Lancaster was a vocal supporter of <a href="liberalism">liberal</a> political causes, and frequently spoke out in support of <a href="racial%20minorities">racial minorities</a>, including at the <a href="March%20on%20Washington%20for%20Jobs%20and%20Freedom">March on Washington</a> in 1963. He was a vocal opponent of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> and political movements such as <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, and he helped pay for the successful defense of a soldier accused of "<a href="fragging">fragging</a>" (murdering) another soldier during that war. In 1968, Lancaster actively supported the presidential candidacy of <a href="antiwar">antiwar</a> Senator <a href="Eugene%20McCarthy">Eugene McCarthy</a> of <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, and frequently spoke on his behalf during the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> primaries. He campaigned heavily for <a href="George%20McGovern">George McGovern</a> in the 1972 presidential election. In 1985, Lancaster joined the fight against AIDS after his close friend, <a href="Rock%20Hudson">Rock Hudson</a>, contracted the disease. He campaigned for <a href="Michael%20Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201988">1988 presidential election</a>.

The <a href="centennial">centennial</a> of Lancaster's birth was honored at New York City's <a href="Film%20Society%20of%20Lincoln%20Center">Film Society of Lincoln Center</a> in May 2013 with the screening of 12 of the actor's finest films, from "The Killers" of 1946 to "Atlantic City" in 1981.

For a number of years exhibitors voted Lancaster as among the most popular stars:

Spanish music group <a href="Hombres%20G">Hombres G</a> released an album named <a href="La%20cagaste%2C%20Burt%20Lancaster">La cagaste, Burt Lancaster</a> (You messed up, Burt Lancaster) in 1986. <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28painter%29">Thomas Hart Benton</a> painted a scene from "The Kentuckian" as part of the film's marketing. Lancaster posed for the painting, also known as "<a href="The%20Kentuckian%20%28painting%29">The Kentuckian</a>".

Balts

The Balts or Baltic people (, ) are an <a href="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Indo-European</a> <a href="ethnolinguistics">ethno-linguistic</a> group who speak the <a href="Baltic%20languages">Baltic languages</a>, a branch of the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European language</a> family, which was originally spoken by tribes living in area east of <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> peninsula in the west and <a href="Moscow%20River">Moscow</a>, <a href="Oka%20River">Oka</a> and <a href="Volga">Volga</a> rivers basins in the east. One of the features of Baltic languages is the number of conservative or archaic features retained. Among the Baltic peoples are modern <a href="Lithuanians">Lithuanians</a>, <a href="Latvians">Latvians</a> (including <a href="Latgalians%20%28modern%29">Latgalians</a>) — all Eastern Balts — as well as the <a href="Old%20Prussians">Old Prussians</a>, <a href="Yotvingians">Yotvingians</a> and <a href="Galindians">Galindians</a> — the Western Balts — whose languages and cultures are now extinct.

German medieval chronicler <a href="Adam%20of%20Bremen">Adam of Bremen</a> in the latter part of the 11th century CE was the first writer to use the term Baltic in its modern sense to mean the sea of that name. Although he must have been familiar with the ancient name, Balcia, meaning a supposed island in the Baltic Sea, and although he may have been aware of the Baltic words containing the stem balt-, "white", as "swamp", he reports that he followed the local use of balticus from baelt ("belt") because the sea stretches to the east "in modum baltei" ("in the manner of a belt"). This is the first reference to "the Baltic or Barbarian Sea, a day's journey from <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>."

The Germanics, however, preferred some form of "East Sea" (in different languages) until after about 1600, when they began to use forms of "Baltic Sea." Around 1840 the German nobles of the <a href="Governorate%20of%20Livonia">Governorate of Livonia</a> devised the term "Balts" to mean themselves, the German upper classes of Livonia, excluding the Latvian and Estonian lower classes. They spoke an exclusive dialect, Baltic German. For all practical purposes that was the Baltic language until 1919.
<a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>ns begin settling in Western Baltic lands in <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> during <a href="Vendel%20Age">Vendel Age</a> and with interruptions their presence in Baltic lands continued most of <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a>.

In 1845 <a href="Georg%20Heinrich%20Ferdinand%20Nesselmann">Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann</a> proposed a distinct language group for <a href="Latvian%20language">Latvian</a> and <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian</a> to be called Baltic. It found some credence among linguists but was not generally adopted until the creation of the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a> as part of the settlement of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in 1919. Gradually the non-Baltic <a href="Estonian%20language">Estonian</a> was excluded from the "linguistic" meaning of Baltic, as was <a href="Livonians">Livonian</a>, a now extinct <a href="Finnic%20languages">Finnic language</a> in present-day Latvia, while <a href="Old%20Prussian">Old Prussian</a> — long recognized as close to Lithuanian and Latvian — was added. <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a> and <a href="Finland">Finland</a> (the states of <a href="Baltic%20Finns">Baltic Finns</a>), however, also became counted among the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a> in the geopolitical sense. (Finland was dropped from this definition after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, though Estonia remains within the definition.)

The Balts or Baltic peoples, defined as speakers of one of the Baltic languages, a branch of the Indo-European language family, are descended from a group of Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower Vistula and southeast shore of the Baltic Sea and upper Daugava and Dnieper rivers. Because the thousands of lakes and swamps in this area contributed to the Balts' geographical isolation, the Baltic languages retain a number of conservative or archaic features.

It is possible that around 3,500–2,500 B.C., there was massive migration of peoples representing the <a href="Corded%20Ware%20culture">Corded Ware culture</a>. They came from the southeast and spread all across Eastern and Central Europe, reaching even southern Finland. It is believed that Corded Ware culture peoples were <a href="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Indo-European</a> ancestors of many Europeans, including Balts. It is thought that those Indo-European newcomers were quite numerous and in the Eastern Baltic assimilated earlier indigenous cultures (Europidic cultures – <a href="Narva%20culture">Narva culture</a> and <a href="Neman%20culture">Neman culture</a>). Over time the new people formed the Baltic peoples and they spread in the area from the Baltic sea in the west to the <a href="Volga">Volga</a> in the east.

Some of the major authorities on Balts, such as <a href="Kazimieras%20B%C5%ABga">Būga</a>, <a href="Max%20Vasmer">Vasmer</a>, <a href="Toporov">Toporov</a> and Trubachov, in conducting etymological studies of eastern European river names, were able to identify in certain regions names of specifically Baltic provenance, which most likely indicate where the Balts lived in prehistoric times. This information is summarized and synthesized by <a href="Marija%20Gimbutas">Marija Gimbutas</a> in "The Balts" (1963) to obtain a likely proto-Baltic homeland. Its borders are approximately: from a line on the <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>n coast eastward to include or nearly include the present-day sites of <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, and <a href="Kursk">Kursk</a>, northward through <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> to the River Berzha, westward in an irregular line to the coast of the Gulf of Riga, north of <a href="Riga">Riga</a>.

A possible early reference to a Baltic people occurs in 98 CE, when <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> names a tribe living near the Baltic Sea ("Mare Svebicum") as the <a href="Aesti">Aesti</a> ("Aestiorum gentes") and describes them as <a href="amber">amber</a> gatherers. However, it is not clear if the Aesti mentioned by Tacitus were: (1) a (now-extinct) Baltic people (possibly synonymous with the <a href="Old%20Prussians">Brus/Prūsa</a>), or; (2) a <a href="Finno-Ugric%20people">Finno-Ugric people</a> (e.g. modern <a href="Estonians">Estonians</a>). The Aesti appear to have inhabited the <a href="Sambia%20%28Baltic%29">Sambian</a> peninsula (in or near the present <a href="Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Kaliningrad Oblast</a> .

Over time, the area of Baltic habitation shrank, due to assimilation by other groups, and invasions. According to one of the theories which has gained considerable traction over the years, one of the western Baltic tribes, the <a href="Galindians">Galindians</a>, <a href="Galindae">Galindae</a>, or Goliad, migrated to the Eastern end of Baltic realm around the 4th century CE, and settled around modern day Moscow, Russia. Finally, according to Slavic chronicles of the time, they warred with <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavs</a>, and perhaps, were defeated and assimilated some time in the 11th to 13th centuries.

Balts became differentiated into Western and Eastern Balts in the late centuries BCE. The eastern Baltic region was inhabited by ancestors of the Western Balts: <a href="Old%20Prussians">Brus/Prūsa</a> ("Old Prussians"), <a href="Sudovians">Sudovians</a>/<a href="Jotvingians">Jotvingians</a>, <a href="Scalvians">Scalvians</a>, <a href="Nadruvians">Nadruvians</a>, and <a href="Curonians">Curonians</a>. The Eastern Balts, including the hypothesised <a href="Dniepr%20Balts">Dniepr Balts</a>, were living in modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.

Subsequent <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> and <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> domination in the first half of the first millennium CE in Northern and Eastern Europe, as well as later Slavic expansion, caused large migrations of the Balts — first, the <a href="Galindae">Galindae</a> or <a href="Galindians">Galindians</a> towards the east, and later, Eastern Balts towards the west — until, in the 13th and 14th centuries, they reached the general area that the present-day Balts inhabit. Many other Eastern and Southern Balts either assimilated with other Balts, or Slavs in the 4th–7th centuries and were gradually slavicized.

In the 12th and the 13th centuries, internal struggles, as well as invasions by <a href="Ruthenians">Ruthenians</a> and <a href="Poles">Poles</a> and later the expansion of the <a href="Teutonic%20Order">Teutonic Order</a> resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians. Gradually Old Prussians became <a href="Germanization">Germanized</a> or some Lithuanized during period from the 15th to the 17th centuries, especially after the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a> in <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>. The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern countries of <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> and <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>.

Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western <a href="Baltic%20language">Baltic language</a>s, <a href="Curonian%20language">Curonian</a>, <a href="Galindian%20language">Galindian</a> and <a href="Sudovian%20language">Sudovian</a>. It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern <a href="Baltic%20language">Baltic language</a>s, <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian</a> and <a href="Latvian%20language">Latvian</a>. Compare the Prussian word "seme" ("zemē"), the Latvian "zeme", the Lithuanian "žemė" ("land" in English).

Old Prussian contained a few borrowings specifically from <a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a> (e.g., Old Prussian "ylo" "awl," as with Lithuanian "ýla", Latvian "īlens") and even <a href="North%20Germanic%20languages">North Germanic</a>.

Burnt-in timecode

Burnt-in timecode (often abbreviated to BITC by analogy to <a href="Timecode/Vertical%20interval%20timecode">VITC</a>) is a <a href="human-readable">human-readable</a> on-screen version of the <a href="timecode">timecode</a> information for a piece of material superimposed on a video image. BITC is sometimes used in conjunction with "real" machine-readable timecode, but more often used in copies of original material on to a non-broadcast format such as VHS, so that the VHS copies can be traced back to their master tape and the original time codes easily located. 

Many professional <a href="VTR">VTR</a>s can "burn" (overlay) the tape timecode onto one of their outputs. This output (which usually also displays the setup menu or <a href="on-screen%20display">on-screen display</a>) is known as the "super out" or "monitor out". The "character" switch or menu item turns this behaviour on or off. The "character" function is also used to display the timecode on the preview monitors in <a href="linear%20video%20editing">linear editing</a> suites.

Videotapes that are recorded with timecode numbers overlaid on the video are referred to as "window dubs", named after the "window" that displays the burnt-in timecode on-screen.

When editing was done using magnetic tapes that were subject to damage from excessive wear, it was common to use a window dub as a working copy for the majority of the editing process. Editing decisions would be made using a window dub, and no specialized equipment was needed to write down an <a href="edit%20decision%20list">edit decision list</a> which would then be replicated from the high-quality masters.

Timecode can also be superimposed on video using a dedicated overlay device, often called a "window dub inserter". This inputs a video signal and its separate timecode audio signal, reads the timecode, superimposes the timecode display over the video, and outputs the combined display (usually via composite), all in real time. Stand-alone timecode generator / readers often have the window dub function built-in. 

Some consumer cameras, in particular DV cameras, can "burn" (overlay) the tape timecode onto the composite output. This output typically is semi-transparent and may include other tape information. It is usually activated by turning on the 'display' info in one of the camera's sub-menus. While not as 'professional' as an overlay as created by a professional <a href="VCR">VCR</a>s, it is a cheap alternative that is just as accurate.

Timecode is stored in the metadata areas of captured DV AVI files, and some software is able to "burn" (overlay) this into the video frames. For example, DVMP Pro is able to "burn" timecode or other items of DV metadata (such as date and time, iris, shutter speed, gain, white balance mode, etc.) into DV AVI files.

<a href="Optical%20character%20recognition">OCR</a> techniques can be used to read BITC in situations where other forms of timecode are not available.

In <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, bra–ket notation is a standard notation for describing <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a>s. The notation uses <a href="angle%20bracket">angle bracket</a>s formula_1 and formula_2, and <a href="vertical%20bar">vertical bar</a>s formula_3. It can also be used to denote abstract <a href="vector%20space">vectors</a> and <a href="linear%20functional">linear functional</a>s in <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>. In such terms, the scalar product, or action of a linear functional on a vector in a complex vector space, is denoted by

consisting of a left part,

called the bra , and a right part,

called the ket . The notation was introduced in 1939 by <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a> and is also known as the Dirac notation, though the notation has precursors in <a href="Hermann%20Grassmann">Hermann Grassmann</a>'s use of the notation

for his inner products nearly 100 years earlier. More generally, a ket is an element of a vector space (e.g. a <a href="column%20vector">column vector</a>); the bra an element of the <a href="dual%20space">dual space</a> (e.g. a <a href="row%20vector">row vector</a>); any combination of bras, kets, and operators are interpreted using <a href="matrix%20multiplication">matrix multiplication</a>; and a bra and ket with the same label are <a href="Hermitian%20conjugate">Hermitian conjugate</a>s of each other.

Bra–ket notation is a notation for <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a>, particularly focused on vectors, <a href="inner%20product">inner product</a>s, <a href="linear%20operator">linear operator</a>s, <a href="Hermitian%20conjugation">Hermitian conjugation</a>, and the <a href="dual%20space">dual space</a>, for both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional <a href="complex%20vector%20space">complex vector space</a>s. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.

Its use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread. Many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are usually explained using bra-ket notation.

In simple cases, a ket formula_8 can be described as a <a href="column%20vector">column vector</a>, a bra with the same label formula_9 is its <a href="conjugate%20transpose">conjugate transpose</a> (which is a row vector), and writing a bras, kets, and linear operators next to each other implies <a href="matrix%20multiplication">matrix multiplication</a>. However, kets may also exist in uncountably-infinite-dimensional vector spaces, such that they cannot be literally written as a column vector. Also, writing a column vector as a list of numbers requires picking a <a href="basis%20%28linear%20algebra%29">basis</a>, whereas one can write "formula_8" without committing to any particular basis. This is helpful because quantum mechanics calculations involve frequently switching between different bases (e.g. position basis, momentum basis, energy eigenbasis, etc.), so it is better to have the basis vectors (if any) written out explicitly.

The standard mathematical notation for the <a href="inner%20product">inner product</a>, preferred as well by some physicists, expresses exactly the same thing as the bra-ket notation,

Bras and kets can also be configured in other ways, such as the <a href="outer%20product">outer product</a>

which can also be interpreted as a matrix multiplication (i.e., a column vector times a row vector equals a matrix).

If the ket is an element of a vector space, the bra is technically an element of its <a href="dual%20space">dual space</a>—see <a href="Riesz%20representation%20theorem">Riesz representation theorem</a>.

In mathematics, the term "vector" is used to refer generally to any element of any vector space. In physics, however, the term "vector" is much more specific: "Vector" refers almost exclusively to quantities like <a href="displacement%20%28vector%29">displacement</a> or <a href="velocity">velocity</a>, which have three components that relate directly to the three dimensions of the real world. Such vectors are typically denoted with over arrows (formula_13) or boldface (r).

In quantum mechanics, a <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a> is typically represented as an element of an abstract complex vector space—for example the infinite-dimensional vector space of all possible <a href="wavefunction">wavefunction</a>s (functions mapping each points of 3D space to a complex number). Since the term "vector" is already used for something else (see previous paragraph), it is very common to refer to these elements of abstract complex vector spaces as "kets", and to write them using ket notation.

Ket notation, invented by Dirac, uses vertical bars and angular brackets: formula_14. When this notation is used, these quantities are called "kets," and formula_14 is read as "ket-A". These kets can be manipulated using the usual rules of linear algebra, for example:

Note how any symbols, letters, numbers, or even words—whatever serves as a convenient label—can be used as the label inside a ket. For example, the last line above involves uncountably many different kets, one for each real number "x". In other words, the symbol "formula_14" has a specific and universal mathematical meaning, while just the "" by itself does not. For example, formula_20 might or might not be equal to formula_21. Nevertheless, for convenience, there is usually some logical scheme behind the labels inside kets, such as the common practice of labeling <a href="stationary%20state">energy eigenkets</a> in quantum mechanics through a listing of their <a href="quantum%20number">quantum number</a>s.

An <a href="inner%20product">inner product</a> is a generalization of the <a href="dot%20product">dot product</a>. The inner product of two vectors is a scalar. In neutral notation (notation dedicated to the inner product "only"), this might be written , where and are elements of the abstract vector space, i.e. both are "kets".

Bra-ket notation uses a specific notation for inner products:

Bra–ket notation splits this inner product (also called a "bracket") into two pieces, the "bra" and the "ket":

where formula_24 is called a bra, read as "bra-A", and formula_25 is a ket as above.

The purpose of "splitting" the inner product into a bra and a ket is that "both" the bra formula_24 and the ket formula_25 are meaningful "on their own", and can be used in other contexts besides within an inner product. There are two main ways to think about the meanings of separate bras and kets. Accordingly, the interpretation of the expression formula_28 has a second interpretation, namely that of the action of a <a href="linear%20functional">linear functional</a> per below.

For a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed <a href="orthonormal%20basis">orthonormal basis</a>, the inner product can be written as a <a href="matrix%20multiplication">matrix multiplication</a> of a row vector with a column vector:
Based on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:
and then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies <a href="matrix%20multiplication">matrix multiplication</a>.

The <a href="conjugate%20transpose">conjugate transpose</a> (also called "Hermitian conjugate") of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:
because if one starts with the bra
then performs a <a href="complex%20conjugation">complex conjugation</a>, and then a <a href="matrix%20transpose">matrix transpose</a>, one ends up with the ket

A more abstract definition, which is equivalent but more easily generalized to infinite-dimensional spaces, is to say that bras are <a href="linear%20functional">linear functional</a>s on the space of kets, i.e. linear transformations that input a ket and output a complex number. The bra linear functionals are defined to be consistent with the inner product. Thus, if formula_35 is the linear functional corresponding to formula_25 under Riesz representation theorem, then

i.e. it produces "the same" complex number as the inner product does. The terminology for the right hand side is though "not" inner product, which always involves two "kets". Confusing this is harmless, since the same number is produced in the end.

In mathematics terminology, the <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a> of bras is the <a href="dual%20space">dual space</a> to the vector space of kets, and corresponding bras and kets are related by the <a href="Riesz%20representation%20theorem">Riesz representation theorem</a>.

Bra-ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a <a href="Hilbert%20space">Hilbert space</a>.

In quantum mechanics, it is common practice to write down kets which have infinite <a href="norm%20%28mathematics%29">norm</a>, i.e. non-<a href="normalizable%20wavefunction">normalizable wavefunction</a>s. Examples include states whose <a href="wavefunction">wavefunction</a>s are <a href="Dirac%20delta%20function">Dirac delta function</a>s or infinite <a href="plane%20wave">plane wave</a>s. These do not, technically, belong to the <a href="Hilbert%20space">Hilbert space</a> itself. However, the definition of "Hilbert space" can be broadened to accommodate these states (see the <a href="Gelfand%E2%80%93Naimark%E2%80%93Segal%20construction">Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction</a> or <a href="rigged%20Hilbert%20space">rigged Hilbert space</a>s). The bra-ket notation continues to work in an analogous way in this broader context.

For a rigorous treatment of the Dirac inner product of non-normalizable states, see the definition given by D. Carfì. For a rigorous definition of basis with a continuous set of indices and consequently for a rigorous definition of position and momentum basis, see. For a rigorous statement of the expansion of an S-diagonalizable operator, or observable, in its eigenbasis or in another basis, see.

<a href="Banach%20space">Banach space</a>s are a different generalization of Hilbert spaces. In a Banach space , the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous <a href="linear%20functional">linear functional</a>s by bras. Over any vector space without <a href="topology">topology</a>, we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.

The mathematical structure of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> is based in large part on <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a>:
Since virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vectors and linear operators, it can involve, and often "does" involve, bra-ket notation. A few examples follow:

The Hilbert space of a <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a>-0 point particle is spanned by a "position <a href="basis%20%28linear%20algebra%29">basis</a>" { }, where the label extends over the set of all points in <a href="position%20space">position space</a>. Since there are an <a href="uncountably%20infinite">uncountably infinite</a> number of vector components in the basis, this is an uncountably infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The dimensions of the Hilbert space (usually infinite) and position space (usually 1, 2 or 3) are not to be conflated.

Starting from any ket in this Hilbert space, we can "define" a complex scalar function of , known as a <a href="wavefunction">wavefunction</a>:
On the left side, is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number; on the right side, = is a ket.

It is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets, by

For instance, the <a href="momentum">momentum</a> operator p has the following form,

One occasionally encounters an expression as
though this is something of an <a href="abuse%20of%20notation">abuse of notation</a>. The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator, acting on kets, that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected into the position basis,
even though, in the momentum basis, the operator amounts to a mere multiplication operator (by ).

In quantum mechanics the expression formula_43 is typically interpreted as the <a href="probability%20amplitude">probability amplitude</a> for the state to <a href="wavefunction%20collapse">collapse</a> into the state . Mathematically, this means the coefficient for the projection of onto . It is also described as the projection of state onto state .

A stationary <a href="spin-%C2%BD">spin-½</a> particle has a two-dimensional Hilbert space. One <a href="orthonormal%20basis">orthonormal basis</a> is:
where formula_45 is the state with a definite value of the <a href="angular%20momentum%20operator">spin operator "S"</a> equal to +1/2 and formula_46 is the state with a definite value of the <a href="angular%20momentum%20operator">spin operator "S"</a> equal to −1/2.

Since these are a <a href="basis%20%28linear%20algebra%29">basis</a>, "any" <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a> of the particle can be expressed as a <a href="linear%20combination">linear combination</a> (i.e., <a href="quantum%20superposition">quantum superposition</a>) of these two states:
where , are complex numbers.

A "different" basis for the same Hilbert space is:
defined in terms of "S" rather than "S".

Again, "any" state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two:

In vector form, you might write
depending on which basis you are using. In other words, the "coordinates" of a vector depend on the basis used.

There is a mathematical relationship between , , , ; see <a href="change%20of%20basis">change of basis</a>.

There are a few conventions and abuses of notation that are generally accepted by the physics community, but which might confuse the non-initiated.

It is common to use the same symbol for "labels" and "constants" in the same equation. For example, = , where the symbol is used simultaneously as the "name of the operator" , its "eigenvector" and the associated "eigenvalue" .

Something similar occurs in component notation of vectors. While (uppercase) is traditionally associated with wavefunctions, (lowercase) may be used to denote a "label", a "wave function" or "complex constant" in the same context, usually differentiated only by a subscript.

The main abuses are including operations inside the vector labels. This is done for a fast notation of scaling vectors. E.g. if the vector is scaled by , it might be denoted by , which makes no sense since is a label, not a function or a number, so you can't perform operations on it.

This is especially common when denoting vectors as tensor products, where part of the labels are moved outside the designed slot, e.g. = ⊗ . Here
part of the labeling that should state that all three vectors are different was moved outside the kets, as subscripts 1 and 2. And a further abuse occurs, since is meant to refer to the norm of the first vector—which is a "label" denoting a "value".

A <a href="linear%20operator">linear operator</a> is a map that inputs a ket and outputs a ket. (In order to be called "linear", it is required to have <a href="linear%20operator">certain properties</a>.) In other words, if is a linear operator and is a ket, then is another ket.

In an -dimensional Hilbert space, can be written as an <a href="column%20vector">column vector</a>, and then is an matrix with complex entries. The ket can be computed by normal <a href="matrix%20multiplication">matrix multiplication</a>.

Linear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics. For example, observable physical quantities are represented by <a href="self-adjoint%20operator">self-adjoint operator</a>s, such as <a href="energy">energy</a> or <a href="momentum">momentum</a>, whereas transformative processes are represented by <a href="unitary%20operator">unitary</a> linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.

Operators can also be viewed as acting on bras "from the right hand side". Specifically, if is a linear operator and is a bra, then is another bra defined by the rule

In an -dimensional Hilbert space, can be written as a <a href="row%20vector">row vector</a>, and (as in the previous section) is an matrix. Then the bra can be computed by normal <a href="matrix%20multiplication">matrix multiplication</a>.

If the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side,
then this expression gives the <a href="expectation%20value%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">expectation value</a>, or mean or average value, of the observable represented by operator for the physical system in the state .

A convenient way to define linear operators on Hilbert space is given by the <a href="outer%20product">outer product</a>: if is a bra and is a ket, the outer product
denotes the <a href="finite-rank%20operator">rank-one operator</a> with the rule 

For a finite-dimensional vector space, the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multiplication:
The outer product is an N×N matrix, as expected for a linear operator.

One of the uses of the outer product is to construct <a href="projection%20operator">projection operator</a>s. Given a ket of norm 1, the orthogonal projection onto the <a href="Linear%20subspace">subspace</a> spanned by is

Just as kets and bras can be transformed into each other (making into ), the element from the dual space corresponding to is , where denotes the <a href="Hermitian%20conjugate">Hermitian conjugate</a> (or adjoint) of the operator . In other words,

If is expressed as an matrix, then is its <a href="conjugate%20transpose">conjugate transpose</a>.

<a href="Self-adjoint">Self-adjoint</a> operators, where , play an important role in quantum mechanics; for example, an <a href="observable">observable</a> is always described by a self-adjoint operator. If is a self-adjoint operator, then is always a real number (not complex). This implies that <a href="Expectation%20value%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">expectation values</a> of observables are real.

bra-ket notation was designed to facilitate the formal manipulation of linear-algebraic expressions. Some of the properties that allow this manipulation are listed herein. In what follows, and denote arbitrary <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s, denotes the <a href="complex%20conjugate">complex conjugate</a> of , and denote arbitrary linear operators, and these properties are to hold for any choice of bras and kets.



Given any expression involving complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators (but not addition), written in bra-ket notation, the parenthetical groupings do not matter (i.e., the <a href="associative%20property">associative property</a> holds). For example:
and so forth. The expressions on the right (with no parentheses whatsoever) are allowed to be written unambiguously "because" of the equalities on the left. Note that the associative property does "not" hold for expressions that include non-linear operators, such as the <a href="antilinear">antilinear</a> <a href="T-symmetry">time reversal operator</a> in physics.

bra-ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate (also called "dagger", and denoted ) of expressions. The formal rules are:

These rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression; some examples are as follows:


Two Hilbert spaces and may form a third space by a <a href="tensor%20product">tensor product</a>. In quantum mechanics, this is used for describing composite systems. If a system is composed of two subsystems described in and respectively, then the Hilbert space of the entire system is the tensor product of the two spaces. (The exception to this is if the subsystems are actually <a href="identical%20particles">identical particles</a>. In that case, the situation is a little more complicated.)

If is a ket in and is a ket in , the direct product of the two kets is a ket in . This is written in various notations:

See <a href="quantum%20entanglement%23Quantum%20mechanical%20framework">quantum entanglement</a> and the <a href="EPR%20paradox%23Mathematical%20formulation">EPR paradox</a> for applications of this product.

Consider a complete <a href="orthonormal">orthonormal</a> system ("<a href="Basis%20%28linear%20algebra%29">basis</a>"), formula_73, for a Hilbert space , with respect to the norm from an inner product formula_74. From basic <a href="functional%20analysis">functional analysis</a> we know that any ket can also be written as
with formula_76 the inner product on the Hilbert space.

From the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars now follows that
must be the identity operator, which sends each vector to itself. This can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value, for example
where, in the last identity, the <a href="Einstein%20summation%20convention">Einstein summation convention</a> has been used.

In <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, it often occurs that little or no information about the inner product formula_79 of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while it is still possible to say something about the expansion coefficients formula_80 and formula_81 of those vectors with respect to a specific (orthonormalized) basis. In this case, it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more.

For more information, see <a href="Resolution%20of%20the%20identity">Resolution of the identity</a>, , where ; since , plane waves follow, .

The object physicists are considering when using the "bra-ket" notation is a <a href="Hilbert%20space">Hilbert space</a> (a <a href="Complete%20metric%20space">complete</a> <a href="inner%20product%20space">inner product space</a>).

Let formula_82 be a Hilbert space and formula_83 is a vector in formula_82. What physicists would denote as is the vector itself. That is

Let formula_86 be the <a href="dual%20space">dual space</a> of formula_82. This is the space of linear functionals on formula_88. The isomorphism formula_89 is defined by formula_90 where for all formula_91 we have
where formula_93 and formula_94
are just different notations for expressing an inner product between two elements in a Hilbert space (or for the first three, in "any" inner product space). Notational confusion arises when identifying formula_95 and formula_96 with formula_97 and formula_98 respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let formula_99 and let formula_100. This gives

One ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars. Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a <a href="Ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a> multiplication.

Moreover, mathematicians usually write the dual entity not at the first place, as the physicists do, but at the second one, and they don't use the *-symbol, but an overline (which the physicists reserve for averages and Dirac conjugation) to denote conjugate-complex numbers, i.e. for scalar products mathematicians usually write
whereas physicists would write for the same quantity

Blue

Blue is the <a href="colour">colour</a> between <a href="Violet%20%28color%29">violet</a> and <a href="green">green</a> on the <a href="optical%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a>. <a href="Human%20eyes">Human eyes</a> perceive blue when observing light with a <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> between 450 and 495 <a href="nanometre">nanometre</a>s. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres. In painting and traditional <a href="colour%20theory">colour theory</a>, blue is one of the three <a href="primary%20color">primary colours</a> of pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide <a href="gamut">gamut</a> of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green. Blue is also a primary colour in the <a href="RGB%20color%20model">RGB colour model</a>, used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor.
The <a href="modern%20English">modern English</a> word "blue" comes from <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> "bleu" or "blewe", from the <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "bleu", a word of <a href="Germanic%20language">Germanic</a> origin related to <a href="Old%20Dutch">Old Dutch</a>, <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a>, <a href="Old%20Saxon">Old Saxon</a> "blāo" and <a href="Old%20Frisian">Old Frisian</a> "blāw", "blau". The clear sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as <a href="Rayleigh%20scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a>. When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. An optical effect called <a href="Tyndall%20scattering">Tyndall scattering</a>, similar to Rayleigh scattering, explains <a href="blue%20eyes">blue eyes</a>; there is no blue pigment in blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called <a href="atmospheric%20perspective">atmospheric perspective</a>.
Blue has been used for art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a>, coming from mines in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, was used in ancient Egypt for jewelry and ornament and later, in <a href="The%20Renaissance">The Renaissance</a>, to make the pigment <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a>, the most expensive of all pigments.
It is the most important color in <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>. In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, <a href="cobalt%20blue">cobalt blue</a> was used to colour the <a href="stained%20glass%20windows">stained glass windows</a> of cathedrals. Beginning in the 9th century, Chinese artists used cobalt to make fine <a href="blue%20and%20white%20porcelain">blue and white porcelain</a>. Blue dyes for clothing were made from <a href="woad">woad</a> in Europe and <a href="indigo">indigo</a> in Asia and Africa. In 1828 a synthetic ultramarine pigment was developed, and synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced mineral pigments and vegetable dyes. <a href="Pierre-Auguste%20Renoir">Pierre-Auguste Renoir</a>, <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a> and other late 19th century painters used ultramarine and <a href="cobalt%20blue">cobalt blue</a> not just to depict nature, but to create moods and emotions. In the late 18th century and 19th century, blue became a popular colour for <a href="military%20uniform">military uniform</a>s and police uniforms. In the 20th century, because blue was commonly associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union. Toward the end of the 20th century, dark blue replaced dark grey as the most common colour for business suits; surveys showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm and concentration.

Surveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and sometimes with sadness. In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour.

Blue is the colour of light between violet and green on the <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a>. Hues of blue include indigo and <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a>, closer to violet; pure blue, without any mixture of other colours; <a href="Cyan">Cyan</a>, which is midway on the spectrum between blue and green, and the other blue-greens <a href="Turquoise%20%28color%29">turquoise</a>, <a href="teal">teal</a>, and <a href="aquamarine%20%28color%29">aquamarine</a>.

Blues also vary in shade or tint; darker shades of blue contain black or grey, while lighter tints contain white. Darker shades of blue include ultramarine, <a href="cobalt%20blue">cobalt blue</a>, <a href="navy%20blue">navy blue</a>, and <a href="Prussian%20blue">Prussian blue</a>; while lighter tints include <a href="sky%20blue">sky blue</a>, <a href="azure%20%28color%29">azure</a>, and <a href="Egyptian%20blue">Egyptian blue</a>.

Blue pigments were originally made from minerals such as <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a>, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> and <a href="azurite">azurite</a>, and blue dyes were made from plants; usually <a href="woad">woad</a> in Europe, and "<a href="Indigofera%20tinctoria">Indigofera tinctoria</a>", or true indigo, in Asia and Africa. Today most blue pigments and dyes are made by a chemical process.
The <a href="modern%20English">modern English</a> word "blue" comes from <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> "bleu" or "blewe", from the <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "bleu", a word of <a href="Germanic%20language">Germanic</a> origin, related to the <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> word "blao". In heraldry, the word <a href="azure%20%28heraldry%29">azure</a> is used for blue.

In Russian and some other languages, there is no single word for blue, but rather different words for light blue (голубой, goluboy) and dark blue (синий, siniy). See <a href="Color%20term">Colour term</a>.

Several languages, including <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>, <a href="Thai%20language">Thai</a>, <a href="Korean%20Language">Korean</a>, and <a href="Lakota%20Sioux">Lakota Sioux</a>, use the same word to describe blue and green. For example, in Vietnamese the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is "xanh". In Japanese, the word for blue (青 ao) is often used for colours that English speakers would refer to as green, such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning "go".

Blue was a latecomer among colours used in art and decoration, as well as language and literature. Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in <a href="cave%20paintings">cave paintings</a> from the Upper <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink and purple. This is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making good blue dyes and pigments. The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – <a href="woad">woad</a> in Europe, <a href="indigo">indigo</a> in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a> or <a href="azurite">azurite</a>.

Lapis lazuli, a semi-precious stone, has been mined in Afghanistan for more than three thousand years, and was exported to all parts of the ancient world. In Iran and Mesopotamia, it was used to make jewellery and vessels. In Egypt, it was used for the eyebrows on the funeral mask of <a href="King%20Tutankhamun">King Tutankhamun</a> (1341–1323 BC).

The cost of importing lapis lazuli by caravan across the desert from Afghanistan to Egypt was extremely high. Beginning in about 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians began to produce their own blue pigment known as <a href="Egyptian%20blue">Egyptian blue</a>, made by grinding <a href="silica">silica</a>, <a href="Lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a>, and <a href="alkalai">alkalai</a>, and heating it to . This is considered the first synthetic pigment. Egyptian blue was used to paint wood, papyrus and canvas, and was used to colour a glaze to make <a href="faience">faience</a> beads, inlays, and pots. It was particularly used in funeral statuary and figurines and in tomb paintings. Blue was considered a beneficial colour which would protect the dead against evil in the afterlife. Blue dye was also used to colour the cloth in which mummies were wrapped.

In Egypt blue was associated with the sky and with divinity. The Egyptian god <a href="Amun">Amun</a> could make his skin blue so that he could fly, invisible, across the sky. Blue could also protect against evil; many people around the Mediterranean still wear a blue amulet, representing the eye of God, to protect them from misfortune.

Blue glass was manufactured in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and Egypt as early as 2500 BC, using the same copper ingredients as Egyptian blue pigment. They also added cobalt, which produced a deeper blue, the same blue produced in the Middle Ages in the stained glass windows of the cathedrals of Saint-Denis and Chartres.

The <a href="Ishtar%20Gate">Ishtar Gate</a> of ancient <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> (604–562 BC) was decorated with deep blue glazed bricks used as a background for pictures of lions, dragons and <a href="aurochs">aurochs</a>.

The ancient Greeks classified colours by whether they were light or dark, rather than by their hue. The Greek word for dark blue, "kyaneos", could also mean dark green, violet, black or brown. The ancient Greek word for a light blue, "glaukos", also could mean light green, grey, or yellow.

The Greeks imported indigo dye from India, calling it indikon. They used Egyptian blue in the wall paintings of <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a>, in Crete, (2100 BC). It was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> (red, yellow, black, and white), but nonetheless it was used as a background colour behind the friezes on Greek temples and to colour the beards of Greek statues.

The Romans also imported indigo dye, but blue was the colour of working class clothing; the nobles and rich wore white, black, red or violet. Blue was considered the colour of mourning. It was also considered the colour of barbarians; Julius Caesar reported that the Celts and Germans dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies, and tinted their hair blue when they grew old.

Nonetheless, the Romans made extensive use of blue for decoration. According to <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a>, they made dark blue pigment from indigo, and imported Egyptian blue pigment. The walls of Roman villas in <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> had frescoes of brilliant blue skies, and blue pigments were found in the shops of colour merchants. The Romans had many different words for varieties of blue, including "caeruleus", "caesius", "glaucus", "cyaneus", "lividus", "venetus", "aerius", and "ferreus", but two words, both of foreign origin, became the most enduring; "blavus", from the Germanic word "blau", which eventually became "bleu" or blue; and "azureus", from the Arabic word "lazaward", which became azure.

Dark blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the Byzantine Empire. In Byzantine art Christ and the Virgin Mary usually wore dark blue or purple. Blue was used as a background colour representing the sky in the magnificent mosaics which decorated Byzantine churches.

In the Islamic world, blue was of secondary importance to green, believed to be the favourite colour of the <a href="Prophet%20Mohammed">Prophet Mohammed</a>. At certain times in <a href="Moorish%20Spain">Moorish Spain</a> and other parts of the Islamic world, blue was the colour worn by Christians and Jews, because only Muslims were allowed to wear white and green. Dark blue and turquoise decorative tiles were widely used to decorate the facades and interiors of mosques and palaces from Spain to Central Asia. Lapis lazuli pigment was also used to create the rich blues in <a href="Persian%20miniatures">Persian miniatures</a>.

In the art and life of Europe during the early Middle Ages, blue played a minor role. The nobility wore red or purple, while only the poor wore blue clothing, coloured with poor-quality dyes made from the <a href="woad">woad</a> plant. Blue played no part in the rich costumes of the clergy or the architecture or decoration of churches. This changed dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in Paris, when the <a href="Abbe%20Suger">Abbe Suger</a> rebuilt the <a href="Saint%20Denis%20Basilica">Saint Denis Basilica</a>. He installed <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> windows coloured with <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>, which, combined with the light from the red glass, filled the church with a bluish violet light. The church became the marvel of the Christian world, and the colour became known as the "bleu de Saint-Denis". In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches, including at <a href="Chartres%20Cathedral">Chartres Cathedral</a> and <a href="Sainte-Chapelle">Sainte-Chapelle</a> in Paris.

Another important factor in the increased prestige of the colour blue in the 12th century was the veneration of the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, and a change in the colours used to depict her clothing. In earlier centuries her robes had usually been painted in sombre black, grey, violet, dark green or dark blue. In the 12th century the Roma Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy (and the rest of Europe consequently) to paint the Virgin Mary with the new most expensive pigment imported from Asia; <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a>. Blue became associated with holiness, humility and virtue.

Ultramarine was made from lapis lazuli, from the mines of <a href="Badakshan">Badakshan</a>, in the mountains of Afghanistan, near the source of the <a href="Oxus">Oxus</a> River. The mines were visited by Marco Polo in about 1271; he reported, "here is found a high mountain from which they extract the finest and most beautiful of blues." Ground lapis was used in Byzantine manuscripts as early as the 6th century, but it was impure and varied greatly in colour. Ultramarine refined out the impurities through a long and difficult process, creating a rich and deep blue. It was called "bleu outremer" in French and "blu oltremare" in Italian, since it came from the other side of the sea. It cost far more than any other colour, and it became the luxury colour for the Kings and Princes of Europe.

King <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a>, better known as Saint Louis (1214–1270), became the first king of France to regularly dress in blue. This was copied by other nobles. Paintings of the mythical <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a> began to show him dressed in blue. The coat of arms of the kings of France became an azure or light blue shield, sprinkled with golden <a href="fleur-de-lis">fleur-de-lis</a> or lilies. Blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour.

Once blue became the colour of the king, it also became the colour of the wealthy and powerful in Europe. In the Middle Ages in France and to some extent in Italy, the dyeing of blue cloth was subject to license from the crown or state. In Italy, the dyeing of blue was assigned to a specific guild, the "tintori di guado," and could not be done by anyone else without severe penalty. The wearing of blue implied some dignity and some wealth.

Besides ultramarine, several other blues were widely used in the Middle Ages and later in the Renaissance. <a href="Azurite">Azurite</a>, a form of copper carbonate, was often used as a substitute for ultramarine. The Romans used it under the name lapis armenius, or Armenian stone. The British called it azure of Amayne, or German azure. The Germans themselves called it bergblau, or mountain stone. It was mined in France, Hungary, Spain and Germany, and it made a pale blue with a hint of green, which was ideal for painting skies. It was a favourite background colour of the German painter <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>.

Another blue often used in the Middle Ages was called tournesol or folium. It was made from the plant <a href="Crozophora%20tinctoria">Crozophora tinctoria</a>, which grew in the south of France. It made a fine transparent blue valued in medieval manuscripts.

Another common blue pigment was <a href="smalt">smalt</a>, which was made by grinding blue cobalt glass into a fine powder. It made a deep violet blue similar to ultramarine, and was vivid in frescoes, but it lost some of its brilliance in oil paintings. It became especially popular in the 17th century, when ultramarine was difficult to obtain. It was employed at times by <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, <a href="Tintoretto">Tintoretto</a>, <a href="Paolo%20Veronese">Veronese</a>, <a href="El%20Greco">El Greco</a>, <a href="Van%20Dyck">Van Dyck</a>, <a href="Rubens">Rubens</a> and <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>.

In the Renaissance, a revolution occurred in painting; artists began to paint the world as it was actually seen, with perspective, depth, shadows, and light from a single source. Artists had to adapt their use of blue to the new rules. In medieval paintings, blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the Virgin Mary, and identify her. In Renaissance paintings, artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red, lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights. <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> was a master of this technique, carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture.

Ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the Renaissance, and patrons sometimes specified that it be used in paintings they commissioned. The contract for the "Madone des Harpies" by <a href="Andrea%20del%20Sarto">Andrea del Sarto</a> (1514) required that the robe of the Virgin Mary be coloured with ultramarine costing "at least five good florins an ounce." Good ultramarine was more expensive than gold; in 1508 the German painter <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> reported in a letter that he had paid twelve ducats – the equivalent of forty-one grams of gold – for just thirty grams of ultramarine.

Often painters or clients saved money by using less expensive blues, such as azurite smalt, or pigments made with indigo, but this sometimes caused problems. Pigments made from azurite were less expensive, but tended to turn dark and green with time. An example is the robe of the Virgin Mary in The "Madonna Enthroned with Saints" by <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum">Metropolitan Museum</a> in New York. The Virgin Mary's azurite blue robe has degraded into a greenish-black.

The introduction of oil painting changed the way colours looked and how they were used. Ultramarine pigment, for instance, was much darker when used in oil painting than when used in <a href="tempera">tempera</a> painting, in frescoes. To balance their colours, Renaissance artists like Raphael added white to lighten the ultramarine. The sombre dark blue robe of the Virgin Mary became a brilliant sky blue. <a href="Titian">Titian</a> created his rich blues by using many thin glazes of paint of different blues and violets which allowed the light to pass through, which made a complex and luminous colour, like stained glass. He also used layers of finely ground or coarsely ground ultramarine, which gave subtle variations to the blue.
In about the 9th century, Chinese artisans abandoned the <a href="Han%20blue">Han blue</a> colour they had used for centuries, and began to use <a href="cobalt%20blue">cobalt blue</a>, made with <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> salts of <a href="alumina">alumina</a>, to manufacture fine <a href="blue%20and%20white%20porcelain">blue and white porcelain</a>, The plates and vases were shaped, dried, the paint applied with a brush, covered with a clear glaze, then fired at a high temperature. Beginning in the 14th century, this type of porcelain was exported in large quantity to Europe where it inspired a whole style of art, called <a href="Chinoiserie">Chinoiserie</a>. European courts tried for many years to imitate Chinese blue and white porcelain, but only succeeded in the 18th century after a missionary brought the secret back from China.

Other famous white and blue patterns appeared in Delft, Meissen, Staffordshire, and Saint Petersburg, Russia.
While blue was an expensive and prestigious colour in European painting, it became a common colour for clothing during the Renaissance. The rise of the colour blue in fashion in the 12th and 13th centuries led to a blue dye industry in several cities, notably <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a>, <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, and <a href="Erfurt">Erfurt</a>. They made a dye called pastel from <a href="woad">woad</a>, a plant common in Europe, which had been used to make blue dye by the Celts and German tribes. Blue became a colour worn by domestics and artisans, not just nobles. In 1570, when Pope <a href="Pius%20V">Pius V</a> listed the colours that could be used for ecclesiastical dress and for altar decoration, he excluded blue, because he considered it too common.

The process of making blue with woad was long and noxious – it involved soaking the leaves of the plant for from three days to a week in human urine, ideally urine from men who had been drinking a great deal of alcohol, which was said to improve the colour. The fabric was then soaked for a day in the resulting mixture, then put out in the sun, where as it dried it turned blue.

The pastel industry was threatened in the 15th century by the arrival from India of the same dye (<a href="indigo">indigo</a>), obtained from a shrub widely grown in Asia. The Asian indigo dye precursors is more readily obtained. In 1498, <a href="Vasco%20de%20Gama">Vasco de Gama</a> opened a trade route to import indigo from India to Europe. In India, the indigo leaves were soaked in water, fermented, pressed into cakes, dried into bricks, then carried to the ports London, Marseille, Genoa, and Bruges. Later, in the 17th century, the British, Spanish, and Dutch established indigo plantations in Jamaica, South Carolina, the Virgin Islands and South America, and began to import American indigo to Europe.

The countries with large and prosperous pastel industries tried to block the use of indigo. The German government outlawed the use of indigo in 1577, describing it as a "pernicious, deceitful and corrosive substance, the Devil's dye." In France, <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV</a>, in an edict of 1609, forbade under pain of death the use of "the false and pernicious Indian drug". It was forbidden in England until 1611, when British traders established their own indigo industry in India and began to import it into Europe.

The efforts to block indigo were in vain; the quality of indigo blue was too high and the price too low for pastel made from woad to compete. In 1737 both the French and German governments finally allowed the use of indigo. This ruined the dye industries in Toulouse and the other cities that produced pastel, but created a thriving new indigo commerce to seaports such as Bordeaux, Nantes and Marseille.

Another war of the blues took place at the end of the 19th century, between indigo and synthetic indigo, discovered in 1868 by the German chemist Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer. The German chemical firm BASF put the new dye on the market in 1897, in direct competition with the British-run indigo industry in India, which produced most of the world's indigo. In 1897 Britain sold ten thousand tons of natural indigo on the world market, while BASF sold six hundred tons of synthetic indigo. The British industry cut prices and reduced the salaries of its workers, but it was unable to compete; the synthetic indigo was more pure, made a more lasting blue, and was not dependent upon good or bad harvests. In 1911, India sold only 660 tons of natural indigo, while BASF sold 22,000 tons of synthetic indigo. In 2002, more than 38,000 tons of synthetic indigo was produced, often for the production of blue jeans.

In the 17th century, <a href="Frederick%20William%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg</a>, was one of the first rulers to give his army blue uniforms. The reasons were economic; the German states were trying to protect their pastel dye industry against competition from imported indigo dye. When Brandenburg became the Kingdom of <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> in 1701, the uniform colour was adopted by the Prussian army. Most German soldiers wore dark blue uniforms until the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, with the exception of the Bavarians, who wore light blue.

Thanks in part to the availability of indigo dye, the 18th century saw the widespread use of blue military uniforms. Prior to 1748, British naval officers simply wore upper-class civilian clothing and wigs. In 1748, the British uniform for naval officers was officially established as an embroidered coat of the colour then called marine blue, now known as <a href="navy%20blue">navy blue</a>. When the <a href="Continental%20Navy">Continental Navy</a> of the United States was created in 1775, it largely copied the British uniform and colour.

In the late 18th century, the blue uniform became a symbol of liberty and revolution. In October 1774, even before the United States declared its independence, <a href="George%20Mason">George Mason</a> and one hundred Virginia neighbours of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> organised a voluntary militia unit (the Fairfax County Independent Company of Volunteers) and elected Washington the honorary commander. For their uniforms they chose blue and <a href="Buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a>, the colours of the <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig Party</a>, the opposition party in England, whose policies were supported by George Washington and many other <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">patriots</a> in the American colonies.

When the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> was established in 1775 at the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>, the first <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> declared that the official uniform colour would be brown, but this was not popular with many militias, whose officers were already wearing blue. In 1778 the Congress asked George Washington to design a new uniform, and in 1779 Washington made the official colour of all uniforms blue and <a href="buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a>. Blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the US Army until 1902, and is still the colour of the dress uniform.

In France the <a href="Gardes%20Fran%C3%A7aises">Gardes Françaises</a>, the elite regiment which protected <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a>, wore dark blue uniforms with red trim. In 1789, the soldiers gradually changed their allegiance from the king to the people, and they played a leading role in the <a href="storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">storming of the Bastille</a>. After the fall of Bastille, a new armed force, the <a href="Garde%20Nationale">Garde Nationale</a>, was formed under the command of the <a href="Marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Marquis de Lafayette</a>, who had served with George Washington in America. Lafayette gave the Garde Nationale dark blue uniforms similar to those of the Continental Army. Blue became the colour of the revolutionary armies, opposed to the white uniforms of the Royalists and the Austrians.

<a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> abandoned many of the doctrines of the French Revolution but he kept blue as the uniform colour for his army, although he had great difficulty obtaining the blue dye, since the British controlled the seas and blocked the importation of indigo to France. Napoleon was forced to dye uniforms with woad, which had an inferior blue colour. The French army wore a dark blue uniform coat with red trousers until 1915, when it was found to be a too visible target on the battlefields of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. It was replaced with uniforms of a light blue-grey colour called horizon blue.

Blue was the colour of liberty and revolution in the 18th century, but in the 19th it increasingly became the colour of government authority, the uniform colour of policemen and other public servants. It was considered serious and authoritative, without being menacing. In 1829, when <a href="Robert%20Peel">Robert Peel</a> created the first <a href="London%20Metropolitan%20Police">London Metropolitan Police</a>, he made the colour of the uniform jacket a dark, almost black blue, to make the policemen look different from soldiers, who until then had patrolled the streets. The traditional blue jacket with silver buttons of the London "bobbie" was not abandoned until the mid-1990s, when it was replaced by a light blue shirt and a jumper or sweater of the colour officially known as NATO blue.

The <a href="New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department">New York City Police Department</a>, modelled after the London Metropolitan Police, was created in 1844, and in 1853, they were officially given a navy blue uniform, the colour they wear today.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, chemists in Europe tried to discover a way to create synthetic blue pigments, avoiding the expense of importing and grinding lapis lazuli, azurite and other minerals. The Egyptians had created a synthetic colour, Egyptian blue, three thousand years BC, but the formula had been lost. The Chinese had also created synthetic pigments, but the formula was not known in the west.

In 1709 a German druggist and pigment maker named <a href="Johann%20Jacob%20Diesbach">Johann Jacob Diesbach</a> accidentally discovered a new blue while experimenting with potassium and iron sulphides. The new colour was first called Berlin blue, but later became known as <a href="Prussian%20blue">Prussian blue</a>. By 1710 it was being used by the French painter <a href="Antoine%20Watteau">Antoine Watteau</a>, and later his successor <a href="Nicolas%20Lancret">Nicolas Lancret</a>. It became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper, and in the 19th century was widely used by French impressionist painters.

Beginning in the 1820s, Prussian blue was imported into Japan through the port of <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>. It was called "bero-ai", or Berlin blue, and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional Japanese blue pigment, "ai-gami", made from the <a href="dayflower">dayflower</a>. Prussian blue was used by both <a href="Hokusai">Hokusai</a>, in his famous wave paintings, and <a href="Hiroshige">Hiroshige</a>.

In 1824 the Societé pour l'Encouragement d'Industrie in France offered a prize for the invention of an artificial <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a> which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli. The prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named Jean Baptiste Guimet, but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour. In 1828, another scientist, <a href="Christian%20Gmelin">Christian Gmelin</a> then a professor of chemistry in Tübingen, found the process and published his formula. This was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine, which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product.

In 1878 a German chemist named a. Von Baeyer discovered a synthetic substitute for <a href="indigotine">indigotine</a>, the active ingredient of indigo. This product gradually replaced natural indigo, and after the end of the First World War, it brought an end to the trade of indigo from the East and West Indies.

In 1901 a new synthetic blue dye, called <a href="Indanthrone%20blue">Indanthrone blue</a>, was invented, which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun. This dye gradually replaced artificial indigo, whose production ceased in about 1970. Today almost all blue clothing is dyed with an indanthrone blue.
The invention of new synthetic pigments in the 18th and 19th centuries considerably brightened and expanded the palette of painters. <a href="J.M.W.%20Turner">J.M.W. Turner</a> experimented with the new cobalt blue, and of the twenty colours most used by the <a href="Impressionism">Impressionists</a>, twelve were new and synthetic colours, including cobalt blue, ultramarine and cerulean blue.

Another important influence on painting in the 19th century was the theory of complementary colours, developed by the French chemist Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1828 and published in 1839. He demonstrated that placing complementary colours, such as blue and yellow-orange or ultramarine and yellow, next to each other heightened the intensity of each colour "to the apogee of their tonality." In 1879 an American physicist, Ogden Rood, published a book charting the complementary colours of each colour in the spectrum. This principle of painting was used by Claude Monet in his "Impression – Sunrise – Fog" (1872), where he put a vivid blue next to a bright orange sun, (1872) and in "Régate à Argenteuil" (1872), where he painted an orange sun against blue water. The colours brighten each other. Renoir used the same contrast of cobalt blue water and an orange sun in "Canotage sur la Seine" (1879–1880). Both Monet and Renoir liked to use pure colours, without any blending.

Monet and the impressionists were among the first to observe that shadows were full of colour. In his "La Gare Saint-Lazare", the grey smoke, vapour and dark shadows are actually composed of mixtures of bright pigment, including cobalt blue, cerulean blue, synthetic ultramarine, emerald green, Guillet green, chrome yellow, vermilion and ecarlate red. Blue was a favourite colour of the impressionist painters, who used it not just to depict nature but to create moods, feelings and atmospheres. <a href="Cobalt%20blue">Cobalt blue</a>, a pigment of cobalt oxide-aluminium oxide, was a favourite of <a href="Auguste%20Renoir">Auguste Renoir</a> and <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a>. It was similar to <a href="smalt">smalt</a>, a pigment used for centuries to make blue glass, but it was much improved by the French chemist <a href="Louis%20Jacques%20Th%C3%A9nard">Louis Jacques Thénard</a>, who introduced it in 1802. It was very stable but extremely expensive. Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo, "'Cobalt [blue] is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things ..."

Van Gogh described to his brother Theo how he composed a sky: "The dark blue sky is spotted with clouds of an even darker blue than the fundamental blue of intense cobalt, and others of a lighter blue, like the bluish white of the Milky Way ... the sea was very dark ultramarine, the shore a sort of violet and of light red as I see it, and on the dunes, a few bushes of prussian blue."
Blue had first become the high fashion colour of the wealthy and powerful in Europe in the 13th century, when it was worn by <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a>, better known as Saint Louis (1214-1270). Wearing blue implied dignity and wealth, and blue clothing was restricted to the nobility. However, blue was replaced by black as the power colour in the 14th century, when European princes, and then merchants and bankers, wanted to show their seriousness, dignity and devoutness (see <a href="Black">Black</a>).

Blue gradually returned to court fashion in the 17th century, as part of a palette of peacock-bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes. The modern blue business suit has its roots in England in the middle of the 17th century. Following the London plague of 1665 and the <a href="London%20fire">London fire</a> of 1666, King <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II of England</a> ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats, waistcoats and breeches, and the palette of colours became blue, grey, white and buff. Widely imitated, this style of men's fashion became almost a uniform of the London merchant class and the English country gentleman.

During the American Revolution, the leader of the Whig Party in England, <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a>, wore a blue coat and buff waistcoat and breeches, the colours of the Whig Party and of the uniform of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, whose principles he supported. The men's suit followed the basic form of the military uniforms of the time, particularly the uniforms of the cavalry.

In the early 19th century, during the <a href="British%20Regency">Regency</a> of the future King <a href="George%20IV">George IV</a>, the blue suit was revolutionised by a courtier named George <a href="Beau%20Brummel">Beau Brummel</a>. Brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form. The new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight trousers to replace the knee-length breeches and stockings of the previous century. He used plain colours, such as blue and grey, to concentrate attention on the form of the body, not the clothes. Brummel observed, "If people turn to look at you in the street, you are not well dressed." This fashion was adopted by the Prince Regent, then by London society and the upper classes. Originally the coat and trousers were different colours, but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable. By the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in England and America. In the 20th century, the black suit was largely replaced by the dark blue or grey suit.

At the beginning of the 20th century, many artists recognised the emotional power of blue, and made it the central element of paintings. During his <a href="Blue%20Period">Blue Period</a> (1901–1904) <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> used blue and green, with hardly any warm colours, to create a melancholy mood. In Russia, the <a href="symbolist">symbolist</a> painter <a href="Pavel%20Kuznetsov">Pavel Kuznetsov</a> and the <a href="Blue%20Rose%20%28art%20group%29">Blue Rose</a> art group (1906–1908) used blue to create a fantastic and exotic atmosphere. In Germany, <a href="Wassily%20Kandinsky">Wassily Kandinsky</a> and other Russian émigrés formed the art group called <a href="Der%20Blaue%20Reiter">Der Blaue Reiter</a> (The Blue Rider), and used blue to symbolise spirituality and eternity. <a href="Henri%20Matisse">Henri Matisse</a> used intense blues to express the emotions he wanted viewers to feel. Matisse wrote, "A certain blue penetrates your soul."

In the art of the second half of the 20th century, painters of the <a href="abstract%20expressionist">abstract expressionist</a> movement began to use blue and other colours in pure form, without any attempt to represent anything, to inspire ideas and emotions. Painter <a href="Mark%20Rothko">Mark Rothko</a> observed that colour was "only an instrument;" his interest was "in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on."

In fashion blue, particularly dark blue, was seen as a colour which was serious but not grim. In the mid-20th century, blue passed black as the most common colour of men's business suits, the costume usually worn by political and business leaders. Public opinion polls in the United States and Europe showed that blue was the favourite colour of over fifty per cent of respondents. Green was far behind with twenty per cent, while white and red received about eight per cent each.

In 1873 a German immigrant in San Francisco, <a href="Levi%20Strauss">Levi Strauss</a>, invented a sturdy kind of work trousers, made of <a href="denim">denim</a> fabric and coloured with <a href="indigo">indigo</a> dye, called <a href="jeans">blue jeans</a>. In 1935, they were raised to the level of high fashion by <a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue magazine</a>. Beginning in the 1950s, they became an essential part of uniform of young people in the United States, Europe, and around the world.

Blue was also seen as a colour which was authoritative without being threatening. Following the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, blue was adopted as the colour of important international organisations, including the United Nations, the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a>, <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, the European Union, and <a href="NATO">NATO</a>. United Nations peacekeepers wear blue helmets to stress their peacekeeping role. Blue is used by the <a href="NATO%20Military%20Symbols%20for%20Land%20Based%20Systems">NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems</a> to denote friendly forces, hence the term "blue on blue" for <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a>, and <a href="Blue%20Force%20Tracking">Blue Force Tracking</a> for location of friendly units. The <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Army">People's Liberation Army</a> of China (formerly known as the "Red Army") uses the term "Blue Army" to refer to hostile forces during exercises.

The 20th century saw the invention of new ways of creating blue, such as <a href="chemiluminescence">chemiluminescence</a>, making blue light through a chemical reaction.

In the 20th century, it also became possible to own your own colour of blue. The French artist <a href="Yves%20Klein">Yves Klein</a>, with the help of a French paint dealer, created a specific blue called <a href="International%20Klein%20blue">International Klein blue</a>, which he patented. It was made of ultramarine combined with a resin called Rhodopa, which gave it a particularly brilliant colour. The baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers developed its own blue, called <a href="Dodger%20blue">Dodger blue</a>, and several American universities invented new blues for their colours.

With the dawn of the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a>, blue has become the standard colour for <a href="hyperlinks">hyperlinks</a> in <a href="Graphical%20user%20interface">graphic browsers</a> (though in most browsers links turn purple if you visit their target), to make their presence within text obvious to readers.

Blue <a href="pigments">pigments</a> were made from minerals, especially <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a> and <a href="azurite">azurite</a> (. These minerals were crushed, ground into powder, and then mixed with a quick-drying binding agent, such as egg yolk (<a href="tempera%20painting">tempera painting</a>); or with a slow-drying oil, such as <a href="linseed%20oil">linseed oil</a>, for <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a>. To make blue <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a>, <a href="cobalt%20blue">cobalt blue</a> (cobalt(II) aluminate: )pigment was mixed with the glass. Other common blue pigments made from minerals are <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a> (), <a href="cerulean%20blue">cerulean blue</a> (primarily cobalt (II) stanate: ), and <a href="Prussian%20blue">Prussian blue</a> (milori blue: primarily ).

<a href="Natural%20dyes">Natural dyes</a> to colour cloth and tapestries were made from plants. <a href="Woad">Woad</a> and <a href="Indigofera%20tinctoria">true indigo</a> were used to produce <a href="indigo%20dye">indigo dye</a> used to colour fabrics blue or <a href="indigo">indigo</a>. Since the 18th century, natural blue dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic dyes.

Human eyes perceive blue when observing light which has a wavelength between 450–495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres.

Isaac Newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description the <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a>, He chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale, which he believed was related to the optical spectrum. He included <a href="indigo">indigo</a>, the hue between blue and violet, as one of the separate colours, though today it is usually considered a hue of blue.

In painting and traditional <a href="colour%20theory">colour theory</a>, blue is one of the three <a href="primary%20color">primary colours</a> of pigments (red, yellow, blue), which can be mixed to form a wide <a href="gamut">gamut</a> of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green. Mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark grey. From the Renaissance onwards, painters used this system to create their colours. (See <a href="RYB">RYB</a> colour system.)

The RYB model was used for <a href="colour%20printing">colour printing</a> by <a href="Jacob%20Christoph%20Le%20Blon">Jacob Christoph Le Blon</a> as early as 1725. Later, printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of magenta, cyan, yellow and black ink, put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper. This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy.

In the 19th century the Scottish physicist <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> found a new way of explaining colours, by the wavelength of their light. He showed that white light could be created by combining red, blue and green light, and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours. His idea, called <a href="additive%20colour">additive colour</a> or the <a href="RGB%20colour%20model">RGB colour model</a>, is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens. The screen is covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks white. As the screen is scanned from behind with electrons, each pixel creates its own designated colour, composing a complete picture on the screen.

On the <a href="HSL%20and%20HSV">HSV colour wheel</a>, the <a href="Complementary%20color">complement</a> of blue is <a href="yellow">yellow</a>; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of <a href="red">red</a> and <a href="green">green</a> light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory (<a href="RYB%20color%20model">RYB</a>) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour is considered to be <a href="orange%20%28colour%29">orange</a> (based on the <a href="Munsell%20color%20system">Munsell colour wheel</a>).


Of the colours in the visible spectrum of light, blue has a very short wavelength, while red has the longest wavelength. When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. This effect is called <a href="Rayleigh%20scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a>, after <a href="Lord%20Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a>, the British physicist who discovered it. It was confirmed by <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> in 1911.

Near sunrise and sunset, most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out, leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red. Therefore, when looking at the sunset and sunrise, the colour red is more perceptible than any of the other colours.

The sea is seen as blue for largely the same reason: the water absorbs the longer wavelengths of red and reflects and scatters the blue, which comes to the eye of the viewer. The colour of the sea is also affected by the colour of the sky, reflected by particles in the water; and by <a href="algae">algae</a> and plant life in the water, which can make it look green; or by sediment, which can make it look brown.

The farther away an object is, the more blue it often appears to the eye. For example, mountains in the distance often appear blue. This is the effect of <a href="atmospheric%20perspective">atmospheric perspective</a>; the farther an object is away from the viewer, the less contrast there is between the object and its background colour, which is usually blue. In a painting where different parts of the composition are blue, green and red, the blue will appear to be more distant, and the red closer to the viewer. The cooler a colour is, the more distant it seems.

Blue eyes do not actually contain any blue pigment. <a href="Eye%20colour">Eye colour</a> is determined by two factors: the <a href="pigment">pigment</a>ation of the <a href="human%20eye">eye</a>'s <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> and the <a href="scattering">scattering</a> of light by the <a href="Turbidity">turbid</a> medium in the <a href="Stroma%20of%20iris">stroma of the iris</a>. In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black. The appearance of blue, green, and hazel eyes results from the <a href="Rayleigh%20scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a> of light in the stroma, an optical effect similar to what accounts for the blueness of the sky. The irises of the eyes of people with blue eyes contain less dark <a href="melanin">melanin</a> than those of people with brown eyes, which means that they absorb less short-wavelength blue light, which is instead reflected out to the viewer. Eye colour also varies depending on the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-coloured eyes.

Blue eyes are most common in Ireland, the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> area and Northern Europe, and are also found in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern</a>, <a href="Central%20Europe">Central</a>, and <a href="Southern%20Europe">Southern Europe</a>. Blue eyes are also found in parts of Western Asia, most notably in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. In <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>, 99% of people have blue eyes. In Denmark 30 years ago, only 8% of the population had brown eyes, though through immigration, today that number is about 11%. In Germany, about 75% have blue eyes.

In the United States, as of 2006, one out of every six people, or 16.6% of the total population, and 22.3% of the <a href="White%20Americans">white population</a>, have blue eyes, compared with about half of Americans born in 1900, and a third of Americans born in 1950. Blue eyes are becoming less common among American children. In the US, boys are 3–5 per cent more likely to have blue eyes than girls.

<a href="Laser">Laser</a>s emitting in the blue region of the spectrum became widely available to the public in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445-447 nm <a href="laser%20diode">laser diode</a> technology. Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through <a href="DPSS">DPSS</a> which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, however these technologies are still widely used by the scientific community for applications including <a href="optogenetics">optogenetics</a>, <a href="Raman%20spectroscopy">Raman spectroscopy</a>, and <a href="particle%20image%20velocimetry">particle image velocimetry</a>, due to their superior beam quality. Blue <a href="gas%20laser">gas laser</a>s are also still commonly used for <a href="holography">holography</a>, <a href="DNA%20sequencing">DNA sequencing</a>, <a href="optical%20pumping">optical pumping</a>, and other scientific and medical applications.

Blue compounds are relatively rare in nature.

Various shades of blue are used as the <a href="national%20colours">national colours</a> for many nations.

Blue was first used as a <a href="gender">gender</a> signifier just prior to <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (for either girls or boys), and first established as a male gender signifier in the 1940s.



Many sporting teams make blue their official colour, or use it as detail on kit of a different colour. In addition, the colour is present on the logos of many sports associations. Along with <a href="red">red</a>, blue is the most commonly used non-white colours for teams.


In international <a href="association%20football">association football</a>, blue is a common colour on kits, as a majority of nations wear the colours of their national flag. A notable exception is four-time <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> winners <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a>, who wear a blue kit based on the "Azzuro Savoia" (<a href="Savoy">Savoy</a> blue) of the royal <a href="House%20of%20Savoy">House of Savoy</a> which unified the Italian states. The team themselves are known as "Gli Azzurri" (the Blues). Another World Cup winning nation with a blue shirt is <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>, who are known as "Les Bleus" (the Blues). Two neighbouring countries with two World Cup victories each, <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a> and <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a> wear a light blue shirt, the former with white stripes. Uruguay are known as the "La Celeste", <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> for 'the <a href="sky%20blue">sky blue</a> one', while Argentina are known as "Los Albicelestes", Spanish for 'the sky blue and whites'.

Blue features on the logo of football's governing body <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>, as well as featuring highly in the design of their website. The European governing body of football, <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>, uses two tones of blue to create a map of Europe in the centre of their logo. The <a href="Asian%20Football%20Confederation">Asian Football Confederation</a>, <a href="Oceania%20Football%20Confederation">Oceania Football Confederation</a> and <a href="CONCACAF">CONCACAF</a> (the governing body of football in North and Central America and the Caribbean) use blue text on their logos.

In <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, the premier baseball league in the United States and Canada, blue is one of the three colours, along with white and red, on the league's official logo. A team from <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> are nicknamed the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Blue Jays</a>. Seventeen other teams either regularly feature blue hats or utilize the colour in their uniforms.

The <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a>, the premier <a href="basketball">basketball</a> league in the United States and Canada, also has blue as one of the colours on their logo, along with red and white also, as does its female equivalent, the <a href="WNBA">WNBA</a>. Former NBA player <a href="Blue%20Edwards">Theodore Edwards</a> was nicknamed "Blue". Fifteen NBA teams feature the color in their uniforms.

The <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>, the premier <a href="American%20football">American football</a> league in the United States, also uses blue as one of three colours, along with white and red, on their official logo. Thirteen NFL teams prominently feature the colour .

The <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a>, the premier <a href="Ice%20hockey">Ice hockey</a> league in Canada and the United States, uses blue on its official logo. Blue is the main colour of many teams in the league: the <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a>, <a href="Columbus%20Blue%20Jackets">Columbus Blue Jackets</a>, <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a>, <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>, <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>, <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a> and the <a href="Winnipeg%20Jets">Winnipeg Jets</a>.

Blind Willie McTell

Blind Willie McTell (born William Samuel McTier; May 5, 1898 – August 19, 1959) was a <a href="Piedmont%20blues">Piedmont blues</a> and <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a> singer and guitarist. He played with a fluid, syncopated <a href="fingerstyle%20guitar">fingerstyle guitar</a> technique, common among many exponents of Piedmont blues. Unlike his contemporaries, he came to use <a href="twelve-string%20guitar">twelve-string guitar</a>s exclusively. McTell was also an adept <a href="Slide%20%28guitar%29">slide guitarist</a>, unusual among ragtime bluesmen. His vocal style, a smooth and often laid-back <a href="tenor">tenor</a>, differed greatly from many of the harsher voices of <a href="Delta%20blues">Delta</a> bluesmen such as <a href="Charley%20Patton">Charley Patton</a>. McTell performed in various musical styles, including <a href="blues">blues</a>, <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a>, <a href="Gospel%20music">religious music</a> and <a href="hokum">hokum</a>.

McTell was born in <a href="Thomson%2C%20Georgia">Thomson, Georgia</a>. He learned to play the guitar in his early teens. He soon became a street performer in several Georgia cities, including <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> and <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta</a>, and first recorded in 1927 for <a href="Victor%20Records">Victor Records</a>. He never produced a major <a href="hit%20record">hit record</a>, but he had a prolific recording career with different labels and under different names in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1940, he was recorded by the folklorist <a href="John%20A.%20Lomax">John A. Lomax</a> and <a href="Ruby%20Terrill%20Lomax">Ruby Terrill Lomax</a> for the folk song archive of the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>. He was active in the 1940s and 1950s, playing on the streets of Atlanta, often with his longtime associate <a href="Curley%20Weaver">Curley Weaver</a>. Twice more he recorded professionally. His last recordings originated during an impromptu session recorded by an Atlanta record store owner in 1956. McTell died three years later, having suffered for years from diabetes and alcoholism. Despite his lack of commercial success, he was one of the few blues musicians of his generation who continued to actively play and record during the 1940s and 1950s. He did not live to see the <a href="American%20folk%20music%20revival">American folk music revival</a>, in which many other bluesmen were "rediscovered."

McTell's influence extended over a wide variety of artists, including the <a href="The%20Allman%20Brothers%20Band">Allman Brothers Band</a>, who covered his "<a href="Statesboro%20Blues">Statesboro Blues</a>," and <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, who paid tribute to him in his 1983 song "<a href="Blind%20Willie%20McTell%20%28song%29">Blind Willie McTell</a>," the refrain of which is "And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell." Other artists influenced by McTell include <a href="Taj%20Mahal%20%28musician%29">Taj Mahal</a>, <a href="Alvin%20Youngblood%20Hart">Alvin Youngblood Hart</a>, <a href="Ralph%20McTell">Ralph McTell</a>, <a href="Chris%20Smither">Chris Smither</a>, <a href="Jack%20White">Jack White</a>, and the <a href="The%20White%20Stripes">White Stripes</a>.

He was born William Samuel McTier in <a href="Thomson%2C%20Georgia">Thomson, Georgia</a>. Most sources give the date of his birth as 1898, but researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest 1903, on the basis of his entry in the <a href="1910%20census">1910 census</a>. McTell was born <a href="Blindness">blind</a> in one eye and lost his remaining vision by late childhood. He attended schools for the blind in Georgia, New York and Michigan and showed proficiency in music from an early age, first playing the harmonica and accordion, learning to read and write music in <a href="Braille">Braille</a>, and turning to the six-string guitar in his early teens. His family background was rich in music; both of his parents and an uncle played the guitar. He was related to the bluesman and gospel pioneer <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Dorsey">Thomas A. Dorsey</a>. McTell's father left the family when Willie was young. After his mother died, in the 1920s, he left his hometown and became an itinerant musician, or "<a href="songster">songster</a>." He began his recording career in 1927 for <a href="Victor%20Records">Victor Records</a> in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>.

McTell married Ruth Kate Williams, now better known as <a href="Kate%20McTell">Kate McTell</a>, in 1934. She accompanied him on stage and on several recordings before becoming a nurse in 1939. For most of their marriage, from 1942 until his death, they lived apart, she in <a href="Fort%20Gordon">Fort Gordon</a>, near Augusta, and he working around Atlanta.

In the years before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, McTell traveled and performed widely, recording for several labels under different names: Blind Willie McTell (for Victor and Decca), Blind Sammie (for Columbia), Georgia Bill (for Okeh), Hot Shot Willie (for Victor), Blind Willie (for Vocalion and Bluebird), Barrelhouse Sammie (for Atlantic), and Pig & Whistle Red (for Regal). The appellation "Pig & Whistle" was a reference to a chain of barbecue restaurants in Atlanta; McTell often played for tips in the parking lot of a Pig 'n Whistle restaurant. He also played behind a nearby building that later became Ray Lee's Blue Lantern Lounge. Like <a href="Lead%20Belly">Lead Belly</a>, another songster who began his career as a street artist, McTell favored the somewhat unwieldy and unusual <a href="twelve-string%20guitar">twelve-string guitar</a>, whose greater volume made it suitable for outdoor playing.

In 1940 John A. Lomax and his wife, <a href="Ruby%20Terrill%20Lomax">Ruby Terrill Lomax</a>, a professor of <a href="classics">classics</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>, interviewed and recorded McTell for the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress in a two-hour session held in their hotel room in Atlanta. These recordings document McTell's distinctive musical style, which bridges the gap between the raw country blues of the early part of the 20th century and the more conventionally melodious, <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a>-influenced East Coast Piedmont blues sound. The Lomaxes also elicited from the singer traditional songs (such as <a href="Boll%20Weevil%20%28song%29">"The Boll Weevil"</a> and <a href="John%20Henry%20%28folklore%29%23Music">"John Henry"</a>) and spirituals (such as "<a href="Amazing%20Grace">Amazing Grace</a>"), which were not part of his usual commercial repertoire. In the interview, John A. Lomax is heard asking if McTell knows any "complaining" songs (an earlier term for <a href="protest%20song">protest song</a>s), to which the singer replies somewhat uncomfortably and evasively that he does not. The Library of Congress paid McTell $10, the equivalent of $154.56 in 2011, for this two-hour session. The material from this 1940 session was issued in 1960 as an LP and later as a CD, under the somewhat misleading title "The Complete Library of Congress Recordings", notwithstanding the fact that it was truncated, in that it omitted some of John A. Lomax's interactions with the singer and entirely omitted the contributions of Ruby Terrill Lomax.

McTell recorded for <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a> and <a href="Regal%20Records%20%281949%29">Regal Records</a> in 1949, but these recordings met with less commercial success than his previous works. He continued to perform around Atlanta, but his career was cut short by ill health, mostly due to <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a> and alcoholism. In 1956, an Atlanta record store manager, Edward Rhodes, discovered McTell playing in the street for quarters and enticed him with a bottle of corn liquor into his store, where he captured a few final performances on a tape recorder. These recordings were released posthumously by Prestige/<a href="Bluesville%20Records">Bluesville Records</a> as "Last Session". Beginning in 1957, McTell was a preacher at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Atlanta.

McTell died of a stroke in <a href="Milledgeville%2C%20Georgia">Milledgeville, Georgia</a>, in 1959. He was buried at Jones Grove Church, near Thomson, Georgia, his birthplace. A fan paid to have a gravestone erected on his resting place. The name given on his gravestone is Willie Samuel McTier. He was inducted into the <a href="Blues%20Foundation">Blues Foundation</a>'s <a href="Blues%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Blues Hall of Fame</a> in 1981 and the <a href="Georgia%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Georgia Music Hall of Fame</a> in 1990.

In his recording of "Statesboro Blues," he pronounces his surname "MacTell", with the stress on the first syllable.

One of McTell's most famous songs, "<a href="Statesboro%20Blues">Statesboro Blues</a>," was frequently covered by the <a href="The%20Allman%20Brothers%20Band">Allman Brothers Band</a> and was one of their earliest signature songs; it also contributes to Canned Heat's "Goin' Up the Country." A short list of some of the artists who have performed the song includes <a href="Taj%20Mahal%20%28musician%29">Taj Mahal</a>, <a href="David%20Bromberg">David Bromberg</a>, <a href="Dave%20Van%20Ronk">Dave Van Ronk</a>, <a href="The%20Devil%20Makes%20Three%20%28band%29">The Devil Makes Three</a> and <a href="Ralph%20McTell">Ralph McTell</a>, who changed his name on account of liking the song. <a href="Ry%20Cooder">Ry Cooder</a> covered McTell's "Married Man's a Fool" on his 1973 album, "<a href="Paradise%20and%20Lunch">Paradise and Lunch</a>". <a href="Jack%20White%20%28musician%29">Jack White</a>, of the <a href="The%20White%20Stripes">White Stripes</a> considers McTell an influence; the White Stripes album "<a href="De%20Stijl%20%28album%29">De Stijl</a>" (2000) is dedicated to him and features a cover of his song "Southern Can Is Mine." The White Stripes also covered McTell's "<a href="Lord%2C%20Send%20Me%20an%20Angel">Lord, Send Me an Angel</a>", releasing it as a single in 2000. In 2013 Jack White's Third Man Records teamed up with Document Records to issue "The Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order of Charley Patton, Blind Willie McTell and the Mississippi Sheiks".

<a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> paid tribute to McTell on at least four occasions. In his 1965 song "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>," the second verse begins, "Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose," a reference to one of McTell's many recording names. Dylan's song "<a href="Blind%20Willie%20McTell%20%28song%29">Blind Willie McTell</a>" was recorded in 1983 and released in 1991 on "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Volumes%201-3">The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3</a>". Dylan also recorded covers of McTell's "Broke Down Engine" and "Delia" on his 1993 album, "<a href="World%20Gone%20Wrong">World Gone Wrong</a>"; Dylan's song "Po' Boy", on the album "<a href="Love%20and%20Theft%20%28Bob%20Dylan%20album%29">Love and Theft</a>" (2001), contains the lyric "had to go to Florida dodging them Georgia laws," which comes from McTell's "Kill It Kid."

The Bath-based band <a href="Kill%20It%20Kid">Kill It Kid</a> is named after the song of the same title.

A blues bar in Atlanta is named after McTell and regularly features blues musicians and bands. The Blind Willie McTell Blues Festival is held annually in Thomson, Georgia.

BDSM

BDSM is a variety of often <a href="Eroticism">erotic</a> practices or <a href="Sexual%20roleplay">roleplaying</a> involving <a href="bondage%20%28BDSM%29">bondage</a>, <a href="discipline%20%28BDSM%29">discipline</a>, <a href="dominance%20and%20submission">dominance and submission</a>, <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a>, and other related interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent upon <a href="self-identification">self-identification</a> and shared experience.
The term "BDSM" is first recorded in a <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> posting from 1991, and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and submission), and S/M (Sadism and Masochism). BDSM is now used as a catch-all phrase covering a wide range of activities, forms of <a href="interpersonal%20relationship">interpersonal relationship</a>s, and distinct subcultures. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include <a href="cross-dresser">cross-dresser</a>s, <a href="body%20modification">body modification</a> enthusiasts, <a href="animal%20roleplay">animal roleplay</a>ers, <a href="rubber%20fetishism">rubber fetishists</a>, and others.

Activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of <a href="informed%20consent">informed consent</a> of both the partners becomes essential. The terms "submissive" and "dominant" are often used to distinguish these roles: the dominant partner ("dom") takes psychological control over the submissive ("sub"). The terms "top" and "bottom" are also used: the top is the instigator of an action while the bottom is the receiver of the action. The two sets of terms are subtly different: for example, someone may choose to act as bottom to another person, for example, by being whipped, purely recreationally, without any implication of being psychologically dominated by them.

The abbreviations "sub" and "dom" are frequently used instead of "submissive" and "dominant". Sometimes the female-specific term "domme" is used to describe a dominant woman, instead of the gender-neutral term "dom"; both terms are pronounced the same. Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as "switches". The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.

"BDSM" is an umbrella term for certain kinds of erotic behavior between consenting adults. There are distinct <a href="subculture">subculture</a>s under this umbrella term. Terminology for roles varies widely among the subcultures. "<a href="Top%20%28BDSM%29">Top</a>" and "<a href="Top%20%28BDSM%29">dominant</a>" are widely used for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically active or controlling participants. "<a href="Bottom%20%28BDSM%29">Bottom</a>" and "<a href="Bottom%20%28BDSM%29">submissive</a>" are widely used for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically receptive or controlled participants. The interaction between tops and bottoms—where physical or mental control of the bottom is surrendered to the top—is sometimes known as "power exchange", whether in the context of an encounter or a relationship.

BDSM actions can often take place during a specific period of time agreed to by both parties, referred to as "play", a "scene", or a "session". Participants usually derive pleasure from this, even though many of the practices—such as inflicting pain or <a href="humiliation">humiliation</a> or being restrained—would be unpleasant under other circumstances. Explicit <a href="Human%20sexual%20activity">sexual activity</a>, such as <a href="sexual%20penetration">sexual penetration</a>, may occur within a session, but is not essential. Such explicit sexual interaction is, for legal reasons, seen only rarely in public play spaces, and it is sometimes specifically banned by the rules of a party or playspace. Whether it is a public "playspace"—ranging from a party at an established community dungeon to a hosted play "zone" at a nightclub or social event—the parameters of allowance can vary. Some have a policy of panties/nipple tape for women (underwear for men) and some allow full nudity with explicit sexual interaction allowed.

The fundamental principles for the exercise of BDSM require that it should be performed with the informed consent of all involved parties. Since the 1980s, many practitioners and organizations have adopted the motto (originally from the statement of purpose of GMSMA—a gay SM activist organization) "safe, sane and consensual", commonly abbreviated as "SSC", which means that everything is based on safe activities, that all participants be of sufficiently sound/sane mind to consent, and that all participants do consent. It is mutual consent that makes a clear legal and ethical distinction between BDSM and such crimes as sexual assault or <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a>.

Some BDSM practitioners prefer a code of behavior that differs from "SSC" and is described as "<a href="risk-aware%20consensual%20kink">risk-aware consensual kink</a>" (RACK), indicating a preference for a style in which the "individual" responsibility of the involved parties is emphasized more strongly, with each participant being responsible for his or her own well-being. Advocates of RACK argue that SSC can hamper discussion of risk because no activity is truly "safe", and that discussion of even low-risk possibilities is necessary for truly informed consent. They further argue that setting a discrete line between "safe" and "not-safe" activities ideologically denies consenting adults the right to evaluate risks vs rewards for themselves; that some adults will be drawn to certain activities regardless of the risk; and that BDSM play—particularly higher-risk play or <a href="edgeplay">edgeplay</a>—should be treated with the same regard as extreme sports, with both respect and the demand that practitioners educate themselves and practice the higher-risk activities to decrease risk. RACK may be seen as focusing primarily upon awareness and informed consent, rather than accepted safe practices. Consent is the most important criterion here. The consent and compliance for a sadomasochistic situation can be granted only by people who can judge the potential results. For their consent, they must have relevant information (extent to which the scene will go, potential risks, if a safeword will be used, what that is, and so on) at hand and the necessary mental capacity to judge. The resulting consent and understanding is occasionally summarized in a written "<a href="Contract%20%28BDSM%29">contract</a>", which is an agreement of what can and cannot take place.

In general, BDSM play is usually structured such that it is possible for the consenting partner to withdraw his or her consent during a scene; for example, by using a <a href="safeword">safeword</a> that was agreed on in advance. Use of the agreed safeword (or occasionally a "safe symbol" such as dropping a ball or ringing a bell, especially when speech is restricted) is seen by some as an explicit withdrawal of consent. Failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime, depending on the relevant law, since the bottom or top has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions that follow the use of the safeword (see <a href="BDSM%23Legal%20status">Legal status</a>). For other scenes, particularly in established relationships, a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning ("this is getting too intense") rather than explicit withdrawal of consent; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all. This is sometimes the case for "punishment scenes" between master/slave couples or for some extreme or edgeplay scenes which may include abductions, rape play, or interrogation. This scene dynamic may be referred to as "consensual nonconsent". In some scenes or relationships, it may be impossible for consent to be withdrawn in the middle of a scene, or the bottom may have the ability to revoke consent for a relationship as a whole, but not for a particular scene.

The initialism "BDSM" includes psychological and physiological facets:

This model for differentiating among these aspects of BDSM is increasingly used in literature today. Nevertheless, it is only an attempt at phenomenological differentiation. Individual tastes and preferences in the area of sexuality may overlap among these areas, which are discussed separately here.

Bondage and discipline are two aspects of BDSM that do not seem to relate to each other because of the type of activities involved, but they have conceptual similarities, and that is why they appear jointly. Contrary to the other two types, B&D does not define the tops and bottoms itself, and is used to describe the general activities with either partner being the receiver and the giver.

The term "bondage" describes the practice of physical restraint. Bondage is usually, but not always, a sexual practice. While bondage is a very popular variation within the larger field of BDSM, it is nevertheless sometimes differentiated from the rest of this field. Studies among BDSM practitioners in the US have shown that about half of all men find the idea of bondage to be erotic; and many women do as well. Strictly speaking, bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together; for example, by the use of handcuffs or ropes, or by lashing their arms to an object. Bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains or ropes to a <a href="Saint%20Andrew%27s%20Cross%20%28BDSM%29">St. Andrew's cross</a> or <a href="spreader%20bar">spreader bar</a>s.

The term "discipline" describes psychological restraining, with the use of rules and punishment to control overt behavior. Punishment can be pain caused physically (such as caning), humiliation caused psychologically (such as a public flagellation) or loss of freedom caused physically (for example, chaining the submissive partner to the foot of a bed). Another aspect is the structured training of the bottom.

"<a href="Dominance%20and%20submission%20%28BDSM%29">Dominance and submission</a>" (also known as D&s, Ds or D/s) is a set of behaviors, customs and rituals relating to the giving and accepting of control of one individual over another in an erotic or lifestyle context. It explores the more mental aspect of BDSM. This is also the case in many relationships not considering themselves as sadomasochistic; it is considered to be a part of BDSM if it is practiced purposefully. The range of its individual characteristics is thereby wide.
Often, "<a href="Contract%20%28BDSM%29">contracts</a>" are set out in writing to record the formal consent of the parties to the power exchange, stating their common vision of the relationship dynamic. The purpose of this kind of agreement is primarily to encourage discussion and negotiation in advance, and then to document that understanding for the benefit of all parties. Such documents have not been recognized as being legally binding, nor are they intended to be. These agreements are binding in the sense that the parties have the expectation that the negotiated rules will be followed. Often other friends and community members may witness the signing of such a document in a ceremony, and so parties violating their agreement can result in loss of face, respect or status with their friends in the community.

In general, as compared to conventional relationships, BDSM participants go to great lengths to negotiate the important aspects of their relationships in advance, and to take great care in learning about and following safe practices.

In D/S, the dominant is the top and the submissive is the bottom. In S/M, the sadist is usually the top and the masochist the bottom, but these roles are frequently more complicated or jumbled (as in the case of being dominant, masochists who may arrange for their submissive to carry out S/M activities on them). As in B/D, the declaration of the top/bottom may be required, though sadomasochists may also play without any power exchange at all, with both partners equally in control of the play.

The term "<a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a>" is derived from the words "sadism" and "masochism". These terms differ somewhat from the same terms used in psychology, since those require that the sadism or masochism cause significant distress or involve non-consenting partners. "Sadomasochism" refers to the aspects of BDSM surrounding the exchange of physical or emotional pain. Sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting <a href="pain">pain</a>, degradation, humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys being hurt, humiliated, or suffering within the consensual scenario. Sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appear more extreme or cruel than other forms of BDSM—for example, when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised—and is occasionally unwelcome at BDSM events or parties. Sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures).

The terms "sadism" and "masochism" are derived from the names of the <a href="Marquis%20de%20Sade">Marquis de Sade</a> and <a href="Leopold%20von%20Sacher-Masoch">Leopold von Sacher-Masoch</a>, based on the content of the authors' works. Although the names of de Sade and Sacher-Masoch are attached to the terms sadism and masochism respectively, the scenes described in de Sade's works do not meet modern BDSM standards of informed consent. BDSM is solely based on consensual activities, and based on its system and laws, the concepts presented by de Sade are not agreed upon the BDSM culture, even though they are sadistic in nature. In 1843 the Ruthenian physician Heinrich Kaan published "Psychopathia sexualis" ("Psychopathy of Sex"), a writing in which he converts the sin conceptions of Christianity into medical diagnoses. With his work the originally theological terms "perversion", "aberration" and "deviation" became part of the scientific terminology for the first time. The German psychiatrist <a href="Richard%20Freiherr%20von%20Krafft-Ebing">Richard von Krafft Ebing</a> introduced the terms "sadism" and "masochism" to the medical community in his work "Neue Forschungen auf dem Gebiet der Psychopathia sexualis" ("New research in the area of Psychopathy of Sex") in 1890.

In 1905, <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> described "sadism" and "masochism" in his "<a href="Three%20Essays%20on%20the%20Theory%20of%20Sexuality">Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</a>" as diseases developing from an incorrect development of the child psyche and laid the groundwork for the scientific perspective on the subject in the following decades. This led to the first time use of the compound term "sado-masochism" (German "sado-masochismus") by the Viennese psychoanalytic <a href="Isidor%20Isaak%20Sadger">Isidor Isaak Sadger</a> in their work, "Über den sado-masochistischen Komplex" ("Regarding the sadomasochistic complex") in 1913.

In the later 20th century, BDSM activists have protested against these conceptual models, as they were derived from the philosophies of two singular historical figures. Both Freud and Krafft-Ebing were psychiatrists; their observations on sadism and masochism were dependent on psychiatric patients, and their models were built on the assumption of <a href="psychopathology">psychopathology</a>. BDSM activists argue that it is illogical to attribute human behavioural phenomena as complex as sadism and masochism to the 'inventions' of two historic individuals. Advocates of BDSM have sought to distinguish themselves from widely held notions of antiquated psychiatric theory by the adoption of the initialized term, "BDSM" as a distinction from the now common usage of those psychological terms, abbreviated as "S&M".

On a physical level, BDSM is commonly misconceived to be "all about pain". Most often, though, BDSM practitioners are primarily concerned with power, humiliation, and pleasure. Of the three categories of BDSM, only sadomasochism specifically requires pain, but this is typically a means to an end, as a vehicle for feelings of humiliation, dominance, etc. The aspects of D/S and B/D may not include physical suffering at all, but include the sensations experienced by different emotions of the mind.

Dominance & submission of power is an entirely different experience, and is not always psychologically associated with physical pain. Many BDSM activities might not involve any kind of pain or humiliation, but just the exchange of power and control. During the activities, the practitioners may feel <a href="endorphin">endorphin</a>s comparable to the so-called "runner's high" or to the afterglow of <a href="orgasm">orgasm</a>. The corresponding <a href="trance">trance</a>-like mental state is also known as "<a href="Subspace%20%28BDSM%29">subspace</a>" for the submissive, or "<a href="topspace">topspace</a>" for the dominant. Some use the term "body stress" to describe this physiological sensation. This experience of <a href="algolagnia">algolagnia</a> is important, but is not the only motivation for many BDSM practitioners. The philosopher <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a> defines this sensation of pleasure derived from pain by the word "sublime". Research has shown that couples engaging in consensual BDSM tend to show hormonal changes that indicate decreases in stress and increases in emotional bonding.

There is a wide array of BDSM practitioners who take part in sessions for which they do not receive any personal gratification. They enter such situations solely with the intention to allow their partners to fulfill their own needs or <a href="Sexual%20fetishism">fetishes</a>. <a href="Professional%20dominant">Professional dominant</a>s do this in exchange of money for the session activities, but non-professionals do it for the sake of their partners.

In some BDSM sessions, the top exposes the bottom to a wide range of sensual experiences, for example: pinching, biting, scratching with fingernails, <a href="erotic%20spanking">erotic spanking</a> or the use of objects such as <a href="Crop%20%28implement%29">crops</a>, <a href="whip">whip</a>s, liquid <a href="wax">wax</a>, <a href="ice%20cube">ice cube</a>s, <a href="Wartenberg%20wheel">Wartenberg wheel</a>s, and <a href="erotic%20electrostimulation">erotic electrostimulation</a> devices. Fixation by <a href="handcuffs">handcuffs</a>, <a href="rope">rope</a>s or <a href="chain">chain</a>s may be used as well. The repertoire of possible "toys" is limited only by the imagination of both partners. To some extent, everyday items like <a href="Clothespin">clothes-pins</a>, <a href="wooden%20spoon">wooden spoon</a>s or <a href="plastic%20wrap">plastic wrap</a> are used as pervertables. It is commonly considered that a pleasurable BDSM experience during a session is very strongly dependent upon the top's competence and experience and the bottom's physical and mental state at the time of the session. Trust and <a href="sexual%20arousal">sexual arousal</a> help the partners enter a shared mindset.

Some types of BDSM play include, but are not limited to:

Aside from the general advice related to <a href="safe%20sex">safe sex</a>, BDSM sessions often require a wider array of safety precautions than <a href="vanilla%20sex">vanilla sex</a> (sexual behaviour without BDSM elements). In theory, to ensure consent related to BDSM activity, pre-play <a href="Negotiation%20%28BDSM%29">negotiations</a> are commonplace, especially among partners who do not know each other very well. In practice, pick-up scenes at clubs or parties may sometimes be low in negotiation (much as pick-up sex from singles bars may not involve much negotiation or disclosure). These negotiations concern the interests and fantasies of each partner and establish a framework of both acceptable and unacceptable activities. This kind of discussion is a typical "unique selling proposition" of BDSM sessions and quite commonplace. Additionally, <a href="safeword">safeword</a>s are often arranged to provide for an immediate stop of any activity if any participant should so desire.

Safewords are words or phrases that are called out when things are either not going as planned or have crossed a threshold one cannot handle. They are something both parties can remember and recognize and are, by definition, not words commonly used playfully during any kind of scene. Words such as "no", "stop", and "don't", are often inappropriate as a safeword if the roleplaying aspect includes the illusion of non-consent. The most commonly used safewords are "red" and "yellow", with "red" meaning that play must stop immediately, and "yellow" meaning that the activity needs to slow down. At most clubs and group-organized BDSM parties and events, <a href="Dungeon%20Monitor">dungeon monitors</a> (DMs) provide an additional safety net for the people playing there, ensuring that house rules are followed and safewords respected.

BDSM participants are expected to understand practical safety aspects. For instance, they are expected to recognize that parts of the body can be damaged, such as nerves and blood vessels by <a href="contusion">contusion</a>, or that skin that can be scarred. Using crops, whips, or <a href="Cat%20of%20nine%20tails">floggers</a>, the top's fine motor skills and anatomical knowledge can make the difference between a satisfying session for the bottom and a highly unpleasant experience that may even entail severe physical harm. The very broad range of <a href="Sex%20toy">BDSM "toys"</a> and physical and psychological control techniques often requires a far-reaching knowledge of details related to the requirements of the individual session, such as <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a>, <a href="physics">physics</a>, and <a href="psychology">psychology</a>. Despite these risks, BDSM activities usually result in far less severe injuries than sports like boxing and football, and BDSM practitioners do not visit emergency rooms any more often than the general population.

It is necessary to be able to identify each person's psychological "<a href="wikt%3Asquick">squicks</a>" or triggers in advance to avoid them. Such losses of emotional balance due to sensory or emotional overload are a fairly commonly discussed issue. It is important to follow participants' reactions <a href="Empathy">empathetically</a> and continue or stop accordingly. For some players, sparking "freakouts" or deliberately using triggers may be a desired outcome. Safewords are one way for BDSM practices to protect both parties. However, partners should be aware of each other's psychological states and behaviors to prevent instances where the "freakouts" prevent the use of safewords.

At one end of the spectrum are those who are indifferent to, or even reject physical stimulation. At the other end of the spectrum are bottoms who enjoy discipline and <a href="erotic%20humiliation">erotic humiliation</a> but are not willing to be subordinate to the person who applies it. The bottom is frequently the partner who specifies the basic conditions of the session and gives instructions, directly or indirectly, in the negotiation, while the top often respects this guidance. Other bottoms often called "brats" try to incur punishment from their tops by provoking them or "misbehaving". Nevertheless, a purist "school" exists within the BDSM community, which regards such "topping from the bottom" as rude or even incompatible with the standards of BDSM relations.

BDSM practitioners sometimes regard the practice of BDSM in their sex life as <a href="sexual%20roleplaying">roleplaying</a> and so often use the terms "play" and "playing" to describe activities where in their roles. Play of this sort for a specified period of time is often called a "session", and the contents and the circumstances of play are often referred to as the "scene". It is also common in personal relationships to use the term "kink play" for BDSM activities, or more specific terms for the type of activity. The relationships can be of varied types.

Early writings on BDSM both by the academic and BDSM community spoke little of long-term relationships with some in the gay leather community suggesting short-term play relationships to be the only feasible relationship models, and recommending people to get married and "play" with BDSM outside of marriage. In recent times though writers of BDSM and sites for BDSM have been more focused on long-term relationships.

A 2003 study, the first to look at these relationships, fully demonstrated that "quality long-term functioning relationships" exist among practitioners of BDSM, with either sex being the top or bottom (homosexual couples were not looked at). Respondents in the study expressed their BDSM orientation to be built into who they are, but considered exploring their BDSM interests an ongoing task, and showed flexibility and adaptability in order to match their interests with their partners. The "perfect match" where both in the relationship shared the same tastes and desires was rare, and most relationships required both partners to take up or put away some of their desires. The BDSM activities that the couples partook in varied in sexual to nonsexual significance for the partners who reported doing certain BDSM activities for "couple bonding, stress release, and spiritual quests". The most reported issue amongst respondents was not finding enough time to be in role with most adopting a lifestyle wherein both partners maintain their dominant or submissive role throughout the day.

Amongst the respondents it was typically the bottoms who wanted to play harder, and be more restricted into their roles when there was a difference in desire to play in the relationship. The author of the study, Bert Cutler, speculated that tops may be less often in the mood to play due to the increased demand for responsibility on their part: being aware of the safety of the situation and prepared to remove the bottom from a dangerous scenario, being conscious of the desires and limits of the bottom, and so on. The author of the study stressed that successful long-term BDSM relationships came after "early and thorough disclosure" from both parties of their BDSM interests.

Many of those engaged in long-term BDSM relationships learned their skills from larger BDSM organizations and communities There was a lot of discussion by the respondents on the amount of control the top possessed in the relationships with almost non-existent discussion of the top "being better, or smarter, or of more value" than the bottom.
Couples were generally of the same mind of whether or not they were in an ongoing relationship, but in such cases the bottom was not locked up constantly, but that their role in the context of the relationship was always present, even when the top was doing non-dominant activities such as household chores, or the bottom being in a more dominant position. In its conclusion the study states:

The respondents valued themselves, their partners, and their relationships. All couples expressed considerable good will toward their partners. The power exchange between the cohorts appears to be serving purposes beyond any sexual satisfaction, including experiencing a sense of being taken care of and bonding with a partner.

The study further goes on to list three aspects that made the successful relationships work: early disclosure of interests and continued transparency, a commitment to personal growth, and the use of the dominant/submissive roles as a tool to maintain the relationship. In his closing remarks the author of the study theorizes that due to the serious potential for harm that couples in BDSM relationships develop increased communication that may be higher than in mainstream relationships

A professional <a href="dominatrix">dominatrix</a> or <a href="professional%20dominant">professional dominant</a>, often referred to within the culture as a "pro-dom(me)", offers services encompassing the range of bondage, discipline, and dominance in exchange for money. The term "dominatrix" is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene. A non-professional dominant woman is more commonly referred to simply as a "domme", "dominant", or "femdom". There are also services provided by professional female submissives ("pro-subs"). A professional submissive consents to her client's dominant behavior within negotiated limits, and often works within a professional <a href="dungeon%20%28BDSM%29">dungeon</a>. <a href="Professional%20submissive">Professional submissive</a>s, although far more rare, do exist. Most of the people who work as subs normally have tendencies towards such activities, especially when sadomasochism is involved. Males also work as professional "tops" in BDSM, and are called "masters" or "doms". However it is much more rare to find a male in this profession. A male "pro-dom" typically only works with male clientele.

In BDSM, a "scene" is the stage or setting where BDSM activity takes place, as well as the activity itself. The physical place where a BDSM activity takes place is usually called a <a href="Dungeon%20%28BDSM%29">dungeon</a>, though some prefer less dramatic terms, including "playspace", or "club". A BDSM activity can, but need not, involve <a href="Human%20sexual%20activity">sexual activity</a> or <a href="sexual%20roleplay">sexual roleplay</a>. A characteristic of many <a href="BDSM%20relationship">BDSM relationship</a>s is the <a href="Power%20exchange%20%28BDSM%29">power exchange</a> from the bottom to the dominant partner, and bondage features prominently in BDSM scenes and sexual roleplay.

'The Scene' (including use of the definite article 'the') is also used in the BDSM community to refer to the BDSM community as a whole. Thus someone who is on 'the Scene', and prepared to play in public, might take part in 'a scene' at a public play party.

A scene can take place in private between two or more people, and can involve a domestic arrangement, such as <a href="servitude%20%28BDSM%29">servitude</a> or a casual or committed lifestyle <a href="Master/slave%20%28BDSM%29">master/slave relationship</a>. BDSM elements may involve settings of <a href="Master/slave%20%28BDSM%29%23Slave%20training">slave training</a> or punishment for breaches of instructions.

A scene can also take place in a club, where the <a href="Play%20%28BDSM%29">play</a> can be viewed by others. When a scene takes place in a public setting, it may be because the participants enjoy being watched by others, or because of the <a href="bondage%20equipment">equipment</a> available, or because having third parties present adds safety for play partners who have only recently met.

Standard social etiquette rules still apply when at a BDSM event, such as not intimately touching someone you do not know, not touching someone else's belongings (including toys), and abiding by dress codes. Many events open to the public also have rules addressing alcohol consumption, recreational drugs, cell phones, and photography.

A specific scene takes place within the general conventions and <a href="etiquette">etiquette</a> of BDSM, such as requirements for mutual <a href="Consent%20%28BDSM%29">consent</a> and agreement as to the <a href="Limits%20%28BDSM%29">limits</a> of any BDSM activity. This agreement can be incorporated into a <a href="Contract%20%28BDSM%29">formal contract</a>. In addition, most clubs have additional rules which regulate how onlookers may interact with the actual participants in a scene.

BDSM parties are events on which BDSM practitioners and other similarly interested people meet in order to communicate, share experiences and knowledge, and to "play" in an erotic atmosphere. The parties show similarities with ones in the <a href="dark%20culture">dark culture</a>, being based on a more or less strictly enforced <a href="dress%20code">dress code</a>; most often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on., emphasizing the body's shape and the primary and secondary sexual characteristic. The requirement for such dress codes differ. While some events have none, others have a policy in order to create a more coherent atmosphere and to prevent onlookers from taking part.

At these parties, BDSM can be publicly performed on a stage, or more privately in separate "dungeons". A reason for the relatively fast spread of this kind of event is the opportunity to use a wide range of "playing equipment", which in most apartments or houses is unavailable. Slings, St. Andrew's crosses (or similar restraining constructs), spanking benches, and punishing supports or cages are often made available. The problem of noise disturbance is also lessened at these events, while in the home setting many BDSM activities can be limited by this factor. In addition, such parties offer both <a href="Exhibitionism">exhibitionists</a> and <a href="Voyeurism">voyeurs</a> a forum to indulge their inclinations without social criticism. Sexual intercourse is not permitted within most public BDSM play spaces or not often seen in others, because it is not the emphasis of this kind of play. In order to ensure the maximum safety and comfort for the participants certain standards of behavior have evolved; these include aspects of <a href="courtesy">courtesy</a>, <a href="privacy">privacy</a>, respect and safewords. Today BDSM parties are taking place in most of the larger cities in the Western world.

This scene appears particularly on the Internet, in publications, and in meetings such as SM parties, gatherings called <a href="Munch%20%28BDSM%29">munches</a>, and erotic fairs. The annual <a href="Folsom%20Street%20Fair">Folsom Street Fair</a> is the world's largest BDSM event and is held in San Francisco. It has its roots in the gay leather movement. The weekend long festivities include a wide range of sadomasochistic erotica in a public clothing optional space between 8th and 13th streets with nightly parties associated with the organization.

There are also conventions such as <a href="National%20Leather%20Association%20International">Living in Leather</a>, <a href="Shibaricon">Shibaricon</a>, <a href="Spankfest">Spankfest</a>, and <a href="Black%20Rose%20%28BDSM%20organization%29">Black Rose</a>. North American cities that have large BDSM communities include New York City, Washington D.C., <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, San Francisco, <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, and <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. European cities with large BDSM communities include London, Paris, Berlin, <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, Munich, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Hamburg, Moscow and Rome.

It has often been assumed that a preference for BDSM is a consequence of childhood abuse. Research indicates that there is no evidence for this claim. Some reports suggest that people abused as children may have more BDSM injuries and have difficulty with safe words being recognized as meaning stop the previously consensual behavior, thus, it is possible that people choosing BDSM as part of their lifestyle, who also were previously abused, may have had more police or hospital reports of injuries. There is also a link between transgender individuals who have been abused and violence occurring in BDSM activities

There are a number of reasons commonly given for why a sadomasochist finds the practice of S&M enjoyable, and the answer is largely dependent on the individual. For some, taking on a role of compliance or helplessness offers a form of therapeutic escape; from the stresses of life, from responsibility, or from guilt. For others, being under the power of a strong, controlling presence may evoke the feelings of safety and protection associated with childhood. They likewise may derive satisfaction from earning the approval of that figure "(see: <a href="Servitude%20%28BDSM%29">Servitude (BDSM)</a>)". A sadist, on the other hand, may enjoy the feeling of power and authority that comes from playing the dominant role, or receive pleasure vicariously through the suffering of the masochist. It is poorly understood, though, what ultimately connects these emotional experiences to sexual gratification, or how that connection initially forms.
Joseph Merlino, author and psychiatry adviser to the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>", said in an interview that a sadomasochistic relationship, as long as it is consensual, is not a psychological problem:

It is agreed on by some psychologists that experiences during early <a href="Psychosexual%20development">sexual development</a> can have a profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life. Sadomasochistic desires, however, seem to form at a variety of ages. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to one study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterwards (Breslow, Evans, and Langley 1985). The prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males. The results of such studies demonstrate that one's sex does not determine preference for sadism.

Following a phenomenological study of nine individuals involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain as central to their experience, sexual masochism was described as an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal. It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much as described in the descriptive literature on addiction. The addictive pattern presented in this study suggests an association with <a href="behavioral%20spin">behavioral spin</a> as found in problem gamblers.

BDSM is practiced in all social strata and is common in both heterosexual and homosexual men and women in varied occurrences and intensities. The spectrum ranges from couples with no connections to the subculture outside of their bedrooms or homes, without any awareness of the concept of BDSM, playing "tie-me-up-games", to public scenes on <a href="Saint%20Andrew%27s%20Cross%20%28BDSM%29">St. Andrew's crosses</a> at large events such as the <a href="Folsom%20Street%20Fair">Folsom Street Fair</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco</a>. Estimation on the overall percentage of BDSM related sexual behaviour vary but it is no longer assumed to be uncommon.

<a href="Alfred%20Kinsey">Alfred Kinsey</a> stated in his 1953 nonfiction book "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female" that 12% of females and 22% of males reported having an erotic response to a sadomasochistic story. In that book erotic responses to being bitten were given as:
A non-representative survey on the sexual behaviour of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had a response rate of about 8–9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies. In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women. Even though this study was not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.

A representative study done from 2001 to 2002 in Australia found that 1.8% of sexually active people (2.2% men, 1.3% women but no significant sex difference) had engaged in BDSM activity in the previous year. Of the entire sample, 1.8% men and 1.3% women had been involved in BDSM. BDSM activity was significantly more likely among bisexuals and homosexuals of both sexes. But among men in general, there was no relationship effect of age, education, language spoken at home, or relationship status. Among women, in this study, activity was most common for those between 16 and 19 years of age and least likely for females over 50 years. Activity was also significantly more likely for women who had a regular partner they did not live with, but was not significantly related with speaking a language other than English or education.

Another representative study, published in 1999 by the German Institut für rationale Psychologie, found that about 2/3 of the interviewed women stated a desire to be at the mercy of their sexual partners from time to time. 69% admitted to fantasies dealing with sexual submissiveness, 42% stated interest in explicit BDSM techniques, 25% in bondage. A 1976 study in the general US population suggests three percent have had positive experiences with Bondage or master-slave roleplaying. Overall 12% of the interviewed females and 18% of the males were willing to try it. A 1990 <a href="Kinsey%20Institute">Kinsey Institute</a> report stated that 5% to 10% of Americans occasionally engage in sexual activities related to BDSM. 11% of men and 17% of women reported trying bondage. Some elements of BDSM have been popularized through increased media coverage since the middle 1990s. Thus both black leather clothing, sexual jewellery such as chains and dominance roleplay appear increasingly outside of BDSM contexts.
According to yet another survey of 317,000 people in 41 countries, about 20% of the surveyed have at least used masks, blindfolds or other bondage utilities once, and 5% explicitly connected themselves with BDSM. In 2004, 19% mentioned spanking as one of their practices and 22% confirmed the use of blindfolds or handcuffs.

A 1985 study found 52 out of 182 female respondents (28%) were involved in sadomasochistic activities.

A 2009 study on two separate samples of male undergraduate students in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> found that 62 to 65%, depending on the sample, had entertained sadistic fantasies, and 22 to 39% engaged in sadistic behaviors during sex. The figures were 62 and 52% for bondage fantasies, and 14 to 23% for bondage behaviors. A 2014 study involving a mixed sample of Canadian college students and online volunteers, both male and female, reported that 19% of male samples and 10% of female samples rated the sadistic scenarios described in a questionnaire as being at least "slightly arousing" on a scale that ranged from "very repulsive" to "very arousing"; the difference was statistically significant. The corresponding figures for the masochistic scenarios were 15% for male students and 17% for female students, a non-significant difference. In a 2011 study on 367 middle-aged and elderly men recruited from the broader community in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, 21.8% of the men self-reported sadistic fantasies and 15.5% sadistic behaviors; 24.8% self-reported any such fantasy and/or behavior. The corresponding figures for self-reported masochism were 15.8% for fantasy, 12.3% for behavior, and 18.5% for fantasy and/or behavior. In a 2008 study on gay men in <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, 14.8% of the over 425 community volunteers reported any sadistic fantasy, desire or behavior in their lifetime; the corresponding figure for masochism was 15.7%.

The current version of the <a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a>'s manual, <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>, excludes consensual BDSM from diagnosis when the sexual interests cause no harm or distress. Section F65 of the International Classification of Diseases (<a href="ICD-10">ICD-10</a>) indicates that "mild degrees of sadomasochistic stimulation are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity". The diagnostic guidelines for the ICD-10 state that this class of diagnosis should only be made "if sadomasochistic activity is the most important source of stimulation or necessary for sexual gratification".

In Europe, an organization called ReviseF65 has worked to remove sadomasochism from the ICD. In 1995, Denmark became the first <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> country to have completely removed sadomasochism from its national classification of diseases. This was followed by Sweden in 2009, Norway in 2010 and Finland 2011. Recent surveys on the spread of BDSM fantasies and practices show strong variations in the range of their results. Nonetheless, researchers assume that 5 to 25 percent of the population practices sexual behavior related to pain or dominance and submission. The population with related fantasies is believed to be even larger.

The ICD is in the process of revision, and recent drafts have reflected these changes in social norms. , the beta version of the <a href="ICD-11">ICD-11</a> has de-pathologised most things listed in ICD-10 section F65, characterizing as pathological only those activities which are either coercive or distressing to the individual committing them, and specifically excluding "consensual sexual sadism and masochism" from being regarded as pathological.

Some people who feel attracted by the situations usually compiled under the term BDSM reach a point where they decide to come out of the closet, though many sadomasochists keep themselves <a href="closet%28ed%29">closeted</a>. Even so, depending upon a survey's participants, about 5 to 25 percent of the US population show affinity to the subject. Other than a few artists and writers, practically no celebrities are publicly known as sadomasochists.

Public knowledge of one's BDSM lifestyle can have devastating vocational and social effects ("<a href="persona%20non%20grata">persona non grata</a>") for sadomasochists. Many face severe professional consequences if they are exposed, either voluntarily or involuntarily, as sadomasochists.

Within feminist circles the discussion has been split roughly into two camps: some who see BDSM as an aspect or reflection of oppression (for example, <a href="Alice%20Schwarzer">Alice Schwarzer</a>) and, on the other side, pro-BDSM feminists, often grouped under the banner of <a href="sex-positive%20feminism">sex-positive feminism</a> (see <a href="Samois">Samois</a>); both of them can be traced back to the 1970s.

Some feminists have criticized BDSM for eroticizing power and violence, and for reinforcing <a href="misogyny">misogyny</a>. They argue that women who engage in BDSM are making a choice that is ultimately bad for women. Feminist defenders of BDSM argue that consensual BDSM activities are enjoyed by many women and validate the sexual inclinations of these women. They argue that there is no connection between consensual kinky activities and sex crimes, and that feminists should not attack other women's sexual desires as being "anti-feminist". They also state that the main point of feminism is to give an individual woman free choices in her life; which includes her sexual desire. While some feminists suggest connections between consensual BDSM <a href="Scene%20%28BDSM%29">scenes</a> and non-consensual rape and <a href="sexual%20assault">sexual assault</a>, other sex-positive ones find the notion insulting to women.

It is often mentioned that in BDSM, roles are not fixed to <a href="gender">gender</a>, but personal preferences. The dominant partner in a heterosexual relationship may be the woman rather than the man; or BDSM may be part of male/male or female/female sexual relationships. Finally, some people <a href="Switch%20%28BDSM%29">switch</a>, taking either a dominant or submissive role on different occasions. Several studies investigating the possibility of correlation between BDSM pornography and the violence against women also indicate a lack of correlation. As an example, Japan is listed as the country with the lowest sexual crime rate out of all the industrialized nations, despite being known for its distinct BDSM and bondage pornography (see <a href="Pornography%20in%20Japan">Pornography in Japan</a>). In 1991 a lateral survey came to the conclusion that between 1964 and 1984, despite the increase in amount and availability of sadomasochistic pornography in the US, Germany, Denmark and Sweden there is no correlation with the national number of rapes to be found.

<a href="Operation%20Spanner">Operation Spanner</a> in the UK proves that BDSM practitioners still run the risk of being <a href="Social%20stigma">stigmatized</a> as criminals. In 2003, the media coverage of <a href="Jack%20McGeorge">Jack McGeorge</a> showed that simply participating and working in BDSM support groups poses risks to one's job, even in countries where no law restricts it. Here a clear difference can be seen to the situation of homosexuality. The psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public. Nevertheless, it leads to a difficult psychological situation in which the person concerned can be exposed to high levels of emotional stress.

In the stages of "self awareness", he or she realizes their desires related to BDSM scenarios or decides to be open for such. Some authors call this "internal coming-out". Two separate surveys on this topic independently came to the conclusion that 58 percent and 67 percent of the sample respectively, had realized their disposition before their 19th birthday. Other surveys on this topic show comparable results. Independent of age, coming-out can potentially result in a difficult life crisis, sometimes leading to thoughts or acts of suicide. While homosexuals have created support networks in the last decades, sadomasochistic support networks are just starting to develop in most countries. In German speaking countries they are only moderately more developed. The Internet is the prime contact point for support groups today, allowing for local and international networking. In the US Kink Aware Professionals (KAP) a privately funded, non-profit service provides the community with referrals to psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the BDSM, fetish, and leather community. In the US and the UK, the <a href="Woodhull%20Freedom%20Foundation%20%26amp%3B%20Federation">Woodhull Freedom Foundation & Federation</a>, <a href="National%20Coalition%20for%20Sexual%20Freedom">National Coalition for Sexual Freedom</a> (NCSF) and <a href="Sexual%20Freedom%20Coalition">Sexual Freedom Coalition</a> (SFC) have emerged to represent the interests of sadomasochists. The German Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus e.V. is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations. In 1996 the website and mailing list <a href="Datenschlag">Datenschlag</a> went online in German and English providing the largest <a href="bibliography">bibliography</a>, as well as one of the most extensive historical collections of sources related to BDSM.

Richters et al. (2008) study also found that people who engaged in BDSM were more likely to have experienced a wider range of sexual practices (e.g. <a href="Oral%20sex">oral</a> or <a href="anal%20sex">anal sex</a>, more than one partner, <a href="group%20sex">group sex</a>, <a href="phone%20sex">phone sex</a>, viewed <a href="pornography">pornography</a>, used a <a href="sex%20toy">sex toy</a>, <a href="fisting">fisting</a>, <a href="Anilingus">rimming</a>, etc.). They were, however, not any more likely to have been coerced, unhappy, anxious, or experiencing <a href="Sexual%20dysfunction">sexual difficulties</a>. On the contrary, men who had engaged in BDSM scored lower on a psychological distress scale than men who did not.

There have been few studies on the psychological aspects of BDSM using modern scientific standards. Psychotherapist <a href="Charles%20Allen%20Moser">Charles Moser</a> said there is no evidence for the theory that BDSM has common symptoms or any common psychopathology, emphasizing that there is no evidence that BDSM practitioners have any special psychiatric other problems based on their sexual preferences.

Problems do sometimes occur in the area of self classification by the person concerned. During the phase of the "coming-out", self-questioning related to one's own "normality" is quite common. According to Moser, the discovery of BDSM preferences "can" result in fear of the current non-BDSM relationship's destruction. This, combined with the fear of discrimination in everyday life, leads in some cases to a double life which can be highly burdensome. At the same time, the denial of BDSM preferences can induce stress and dissatisfaction with one's own "vanilla"-lifestyle, feeding the apprehension of finding no partner. Moser states that BDSM practitioners having problems finding BDSM partners would probably have problems in finding a non-BDSM partner as well. The wish to remove BDSM preferences is another possible reason for psychological problems since it is not possible in most cases. Finally, the scientist states that BDSM practitioners seldom commit violent crimes. From his point of view, crimes of BDSM practitioners usually have no connection with the BDSM components existing in their life. Moser's study comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence, which could give reason to refuse members of this group work- or safety certificates, adoption possibilities, custody or other social rights or privileges. The Swiss psychoanalyst Fritz Morgenthaler shares a similar perspective in his book, "Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion" (1988). He states that possible problems result not necessarily from the non-normative behavior, but in most cases primarily from the real or feared reactions of the social environment towards their own preferences. In 1940 psychoanalyst <a href="Theodor%20Reik">Theodor Reik</a> reached implicitly the same conclusion in his standard work "<a href="Aus%20Leiden%20Freuden.%20Masochismus%20und%20Gesellschaft">Aus Leiden Freuden. Masochismus und Gesellschaft</a>".

Moser's results are further supported by Richters et al.'s (2008) study on the demographic and psychosocial features of participants in BDSM done in Australia. Richters et al. (2008) found that BDSM practitioners were no more likely to have experienced sexual assault than the control group, and were not more likely to feel unhappy or anxious. The BDSM males reported higher levels of psychological well-being than the controls. It was concluded that "BDSM is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority, not a pathological symptom of past abuse or difficulty with 'normal' sex."

Not much empirical research has been done on gender differences or prevalence rates of categorized roles within BDSM. Though, one Australian demographic study found higher rates of female participants than males, it can not be generalized.

One common misconception of BDSM and kink is that women are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about <a href="femininity">femininity</a>; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like <a href="Feminization%20%28activity%29">feminization</a> of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.

Baumeister (2010) found that masochistic males experienced greater: severity of pain, frequency of humiliation (status-loss, degrading, oral), partner infidelity, active participation by other persons, and <a href="Cross-dressing">cross dressing</a>. Trends also suggested that male masochism included more bondage and oral sex than female (though the data was not significant). Female masochists, on the other hand, experienced greater: frequency in pain, pain as punishment for 'misdeeds' in the relationship context, display humiliation, genital intercourse, and presence of non-participating audiences. The exclusiveness of dominant males in a heterosexual relationship should be noted because, historically, men in power preferred multiple partners. Finally, Baumeister (2010) observes a contrast between the 'intense sensation' focus of male masochism to a more 'meaning and emotion' centred female masochistic script.

Prior argues that although some of these women may appear to be engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles, BDSM allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities. In a study that she conducted in 2013, she found that the majority of the women she interviewed identified as bottom, submissive, captive, or slave. In turn, Prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an incongruity between their sexual identities and feminist identity. Her research found that these women saw little to no incongruity, and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave. For them these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that, in some cases, feed other aspects of their lives. Prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in BDSM communities to express their sexual identities fully, even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism. Furthermore, women who do identify as submissive, sexually or otherwise, find a space within BDSM where they can fully express themselves as integrated, well-balanced, and powerful women.

Levitt, Moser, & Jamison's 1994 study provides a general, if outdated, description of characteristics of women in the sadomasochistic (S/M) subculture. They state that women in S/M tend to have higher education, become more aware of their desires as a young adult, are less likely to be married than the general population. The researchers found the majority of females identified as heterosexual and submissive, a substantial minority were versatile—able to switch between dominant and submissive roles—and a smaller minority identified with the dominant role exclusively. Oral sex, bondage and master-slave script were among the most popular activities, while feces/watersports were the least popular.

Though BDSM in itself can be considered a sexual orientation or identity, and is considered one by some of its practitioners, the BDSM and kink scene is more often seen as a diverse pansexual community. Often this is a non-judgmental community where gender, sexuality, orientation, preferences are accepted as is or worked at to become something a person can be happy with. In research, studies have focused on bisexuality and its parallels with BDSM, as well as gay-straight differences between practitioners.

Demographically, Nordling et al.'s (2006) study found no differences in age, but 43% of gay male respondents compared to 29% of straight males had university level education. The gay men also had higher incomes than the general population, and tended to work in white collar jobs while straight men tended toward blue collar ones. Because there were not enough female respondents (22), no conclusions could be drawn from them.

Sexually speaking, the same 2006 study by Nordling et al. found that gay males were aware of their S/M preferences and took part in them at an earlier age, preferring <a href="Leather%20subculture">leather</a>, <a href="anal%20sex">anal sex</a>, <a href="rimming">rimming</a>, <a href="dildo">dildo</a>s and special equipment or uniform scenes. In contrast, straight men preferred verbal humiliation, mask and blindfolds, <a href="Gag%20%28BDSM%29">gags</a>, <a href="Latex%20and%20PVC%20fetishism">rubber/latex</a> outfits, <a href="caning">caning</a>, <a href="vaginal%20sex">vaginal sex</a>, and <a href="cross-dressing">cross-dressing</a> among other activities. From the questionnaire, researchers were able to identify four separate sexual themes: <a href="Hypermasculinity">hyper-masculinity</a>, giving and receiving pain, physical restriction (i.e. bondage), and psychological humiliation. Gay men preferred activities that tended towards hyper-masculinity while straight men showed greater preference for humiliation. Though there were not enough female respondents to draw a similar conclusion with, the fact that there is a difference in gay and straight men suggests strongly that S/M (and BDSM in general) can not be considered a homogenous phenomenon. As Nordling et al. (2006) puts it, "People who identify as sadomasochists mean different things by these identifications." (54)

In Steve Lenius' original 2001 paper he explored the acceptance of <a href="bisexuality">bisexuality</a> in a supposedly <a href="Pansexuality">pansexual</a> BDSM community. The reasoning behind this is that 'coming-out' had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.

Brandy Lin Simula (2012), on the other hand, argues that BDSM actively resists gender conforming and identified three different types of BDSM bisexuality: <a href="Genderqueer">gender-switching</a>, gender-based styles (taking on a different gendered style depending on gender of partner when playing), and rejection of gender (resisting the idea that gender matters in their play partners). Simula (2012) explains that practitioners of BDSM routinely challenge our concepts of sexuality by pushing the limits on pre-existing ideas of sexual orientation and gender norms. For some, BDSM and kink provides a platform in creating identities that are fluid, ever-changing.

Psychiatry has an insensitive history in the area of BDSM. There have been many involvements by institutions of political power to marginalize subgroups and sexual minorities. Mental health professionals have a long history of holding negative assumptions and stereotypes about the BDSM community. Beginning with the <a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">DSM</a>-II, Sexual Sadism and Sexual Masochism have been listed as sexually deviant behaviours. Sadism and masochism were also found in the personality disorder section. This negative assumption has not changed significantly which is evident in the continued inclusion of Sexual Sadism and Sexual Masochism as <a href="paraphilia">paraphilia</a>s in the <a href="DSM-IV-TR">DSM-IV-TR</a>. The <a href="DSM-5">DSM-V</a>, however, has depathologized the language around <a href="paraphilia">paraphilia</a>s in a way that signifies "the APA's intent to not demand treatment for healthy consenting adult sexual expression". These biases and misinformation can result in pathologizing and unintentional harm to clients who identify as sadists and/or masochists and medical professionals who have been trained under older editions of the DSM can be slow to change in their ways of clinical practice.

According to Kolmes et al. (2006), major themes of biased and inadequate care to BDSM clients are:


These same researchers suggested that therapists should be open to learning more about BDSM, to show comfort in talking about BDSM issues, and to understand and promote "safe, sane, consensual" BDSM.

There has also been research which suggests BDSM can be a beneficial way for victims of sexual assault to deal with their trauma, most notably by Corie Hammers, but this work is limited in scope and to date, has not undergone empirical testing as a treatment.

Both terms were introduced to the medical field by German <a href="psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> <a href="Richard%20von%20Krafft-Ebing">Richard von Krafft-Ebing</a> in his 1886 compilation of case studies "Psychopathia Sexualis". Pain and physical violence are not essential in Krafft-Ebing's conception, and he defined "masochism" (German "masochismus") entirely in terms of control. <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, a psychoanalyst and a contemporary of Krafft-Ebing, noted that both were often found in the same individuals, and combined the two into a single dichotomous entity known as "sadomasochism" (German "sadomasochismus", often abbreviated as "S&M" or "S/M"). This observation is commonly verified in both literature and practice; many sadists and masochists define themselves as "<a href="switch%20%28BDSM%29">switchable</a>"—capable of taking pleasure in either role. However it has also been argued (Deleuze, "Coldness and Cruelty") that the concurrence of sadism and masochism in Freud's model should not be taken for granted.

Freud introduced the terms "primary" and "secondary" masochism. Though this idea has come under a number of interpretations, in a primary masochism the masochist undergoes a complete, not just a partial, rejection by the model or courted object (or sadist), possibly involving the model taking a rival as a preferred mate. This complete rejection is related to the death drive ("todestrieb") in Freud's psychoanalysis. In a secondary masochism, by contrast, the masochist experiences a less serious, more feigned rejection and punishment by the model. Secondary masochism, in other words, is the relatively casual version, more akin to a charade, and most commentators are quick to point out its contrivedness.

Rejection is not desired by a primary masochist in quite the same sense as the feigned rejection occurring within a mutually consensual relationship—or even where the masochist happens to be the one having actual initiative power (this is the confusion of the distinctions of casual appearance and discrete motives which underlies the analyses of <a href="Deleuze">Deleuze</a> and <a href="Sartre">Sartre</a>, for example). In "<a href="Things%20Hidden%20Since%20the%20Foundation%20of%20the%20World">Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World</a>", <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Girard">René Girard</a> attempts to resuscitate and reinterpret Freud's distinction of primary and secondary masochism, in connection with his own philosophy.

Both Krafft-Ebing and Freud assumed that sadism in men resulted from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct. Masochism in men, however, was seen as a more significant aberration, contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Freud doubted that masochism in men was ever a primary tendency, and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of sadism. Sadomasochism in women received comparatively little discussion, as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men. Both also assumed that masochism was so inherent to female sexuality that it would be difficult to distinguish as a separate inclination.

<a href="Havelock%20Ellis">Havelock Ellis</a>, in "Studies in the Psychology of Sex", argued that there is no clear distinction between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.

Here, Ellis touches upon the often paradoxical nature of widely reported consensual S&M practices. It is described as not simply pain to initiate pleasure, but violence—"or the simulation of involuntary violent acts"—said to express love. This irony is highly evident in the observation by many, that not only are popularly practiced sadomasochistic activities usually performed at the express request of the masochist, but that it is often the designated masochist who may direct such activities, through subtle emotional cues perceived or mutually understood and consensually recognized by the designated sadist.

In his essay "Coldness and Cruelty", (originally "Présentation de Sacher-Masoch", 1967) <a href="Gilles%20Deleuze">Gilles Deleuze</a> rejects the term "sadomasochism" as artificial, especially in the context of the quintessentially modern masochistic work, Sacher-Masoch's "Venus In Furs". Deleuze's counterargument is that the tendency toward masochism is based on intensified desire brought on or enhanced by the acting out of frustration at the delay of gratification. Taken to its extreme, an intolerably indefinite delay is 'rewarded' by punitive perpetual delay, manifested as unwavering coldness. The masochist derives pleasure from, as Deleuze puts it, the "Contract": the process by which he can control another individual and turn the individual into someone cold and callous. The sadist, in contrast, derives pleasure from the "Law": the unavoidable power that places one person below another. The sadist attempts to destroy the <a href="Id%2C%20ego%2C%20and%20super-ego%23Ego">ego</a> in an effort to unify the <a href="Id%2C%20ego%2C%20and%20super-ego%23Id">id</a> and <a href="Id%2C%20ego%2C%20and%20super-ego%23Super-ego">super-ego</a>, in effect gratifying the most base desires the sadist can express while ignoring or completely suppressing the will of the ego, or of the conscience. Thus, Deleuze attempts to argue that masochism and sadism arise from such different impulses that the combination of the two terms is meaningless and misleading. A masochist's perception of their own self-subjugating sadistic desires and capacities are treated by Deleuze as reactions to prior experience of sadistic objectification. (E.g. in terms of psychology, compulsively defensive appeasement of pathological guilt feelings as opposed to the volition of a strong free will.) The epilogue of "Venus In Furs" shows the character of Severin has become embittered by his experiment in the alleged control of masochism, and advocates instead the domination of women.

Before Deleuze, however, <a href="Sartre">Sartre</a> had presented his own theory of sadism and masochism, at which Deleuze's deconstructive argument, which took away the symmetry of the two roles, was probably directed. Because the pleasure or power in looking at the victim figures prominently in sadism and masochism, Sartre was able to link these phenomena to his famous philosophy of the "Look of the Other". Sartre argued that masochism is an attempt by the "For-itself" (consciousness) to reduce itself to nothing, becoming an object that is drowned out by the "abyss of the Other's subjectivity". By this Sartre means that, given that for the "for-itself" desire to attain a point of view in which it is both subject and object, one possible strategy is to gather and intensify every feeling and posture in which the self appears as an object to be rejected, tested, and humiliated; and in this way the for-itself strives toward a point of view in which there is only one subjectivity in the relationship, which would be both that of the abuser and the abused. Conversely, Sartre held sadism to be the effort to annihilate the subjectivity of the victim. That means that the sadist is exhilarated by the emotional distress of the victim because they seek a subjectivity that views the victim as both subject and object.

This argument may appear stronger if it is understood that this "look of the other" theory is either only an aspect of the faculties of desire, or somehow its primary faculty. This does not account for the turn that Deleuze took for his own theory of these matters, but the premise of "desire as 'look'" is associated with theoretical distinctions always detracted by Deleuze, in what he regarded as its essential error to recognize "desire as lack"—which he identified in the philosophical temperament of Plato, Socrates, and <a href="Jacques%20Lacan">Lacan</a>. For Deleuze, insofar as desire is a lack it is reducible to the "look".

Finally, after Deleuze, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Girard">René Girard</a> included his account of sado-masochism in "Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World", originally "Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde", 1978, making the chapter on masochism a coherent part of his theory of <a href="mimetic%20desire">mimetic desire</a>. In this view of sado-masochism, the violence of the practices are an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love-object. There is clearly a similarity to Deleuze, since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance, and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by Deleuze, there is an understanding of the value of the love object in terms of the processes of its valuation, acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor.

Nichols (2006) compiled some common clinical issues: countertransference, non-disclosure, coming-out, partner/families, and bleed-through.

<a href="Countertransference">Countertransference</a> is a common problem in clinical settings. Despite having no evidence, therapists may find themselves believing that their client’s pathology is "self-evident". Therapists may feel intense disgust and aversive reactions. Feelings of countertransference can interfere with therapy. Another common problem is when clients conceal their sexual preferences from their therapists. This can compromise any therapy. To avoid non-disclosure, therapists are encouraged to communicate their openness in indirect ways with literatures and artworks in the waiting room. Therapists can also deliberately bring up BDSM topics during the course of therapy. With less informed therapists, sometimes they over-focus on clients’ sexuality which detracts from original issues such as family relationships, depression, etc. A special subgroup that needs counselling is the "newbie". Individuals just coming out might have internalized shame, fear, and self-hatred about their sexual preferences. Therapists need to provide acceptance, care, and model positive attitude; providing reassurance, <a href="psychoeducation">psychoeducation</a>, and <a href="bibliotherapy">bibliotherapy</a> for these clients is crucial. The average age when BDSM individuals realize their sexual preference is around 26 years. Many people hide their sexuality until they can no longer contain their desires. However, they may have married or had children by this point. Therefore, therapists need to facilitate couple's counselling and disclosure. It is important for therapists to consider fairness to partner and family of clients. In situations when boundaries between roles in the bedroom and roles in the rest of the relationship blurs, a "bleed-through" problem has occurred. Therapists need to help clients resolve distress and deal with any underlying problems that led to the initial bleed-through.

Practices of BDSM survive from some of the oldest textual records in the world, associated with rituals to the Goddess <a href="Inanna">Inanna</a> (<a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a> in <a href="Akkadian">Akkadian</a>). <a href="Cuneiform%20script">Cuneiform</a> texts dedicated to Inanna which incorporate domination rituals. In particular she points to ancient writings such as Inanna and Ebih (in which the Goddess dominates Ebih), and Hymn to Inanna describing cross-dressing transformations and rituals "imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initation and journeys of altered states of consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves in weeping and grief."

During the ninth century BC, <a href="Flagellation%23Association%20with%20religion">ritual flagellations</a> were performed in <a href="Artemis%20Orthia">Artemis Orthia</a>, one of the most important religious areas of ancient <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, where the <a href="Cult%20of%20Orthia">Cult of Orthia</a>, a pre<a href="Olympic%20Gods">olympic</a> religion, was practiced. Here ritual flagellation called "diamastigosis" took place, in which young adolescent men were whipped in a ceremony overseen by the priestess. These are referred to by a number of ancient authors, including Pausanius (III, 16: 10-11).

One of the oldest graphical proofs of sadomasochistic activities is found in the <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscan</a> <a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Whipping">Tomb of the Whipping</a> near <a href="Tarquinia">Tarquinia</a>, which dates to the fifth century BC. Inside the tomb there is <a href="fresco">fresco</a> which portrays two men who flagellate a woman with a cane and a hand during an erotic situation. Another reference related to flagellation is to be found in the sixth book of the "Satires" of the ancient Roman Poet <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a> (1st–2nd century A.D.), further reference can be found in <a href="Petronius">Petronius</a>'s "<a href="Satyricon">Satyricon</a>" where a delinquent is whipped for sexual arousal. Anecdotal narratives related to humans who have had themselves voluntary bound, flagellated or whipped as a substitute for sex or as part of foreplay reach back to the third and fourth century.

In Pompeii, a whip-mistress figure with wings is depicted on the wall of the <a href="Villa%20of%20the%20Mysteries">Villa of Mysteries</a>, as part of an initiation of a young woman into the <a href="Mystery%20religion">Mysteries</a>. The whip-mistress role drove the sacred initiation of ceremonial death and rebirth. The archaic Greek <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> may too once have been armed with an implement, with archaeological evidence of armed Aphrodites () known from a number of locations in Cythera, Acrocorinth and Sparta, and which may have been a whip.

The "<a href="Kama%20Sutra">Kama Sutra</a>" of India describes four different kinds of hitting during lovemaking, the allowed regions of the human body to target and different kinds of joyful "cries of pain" practiced by bottoms. The collection of historic texts related to sensuous experiences explicitly emphasizes that <a href="impact%20play">impact play</a>, biting and pinching during sexual activities should only be performed consensually since only some women consider such behavior to be joyful. From this perspective the Kama Sutra can be considered as one of the first written resources dealing with sadomasochistic activities and safety rules. Further texts with sadomasochistic connotation appear worldwide during the following centuries on a regular basis.

There are anecdotal reports of people willingly being bound or whipped, as a prelude to or substitute for sex, during the 14th century. The medieval phenomenon of <a href="courtly%20love">courtly love</a> in all of its slavish devotion and ambivalence has been suggested by some writers to be a precursor of BDSM. Some sources claim that BDSM as a distinct form of sexual behavior originated at the beginning of the 18th century when Western civilization began medically and legally categorizing sexual behavior (see <a href="BDSM%23Etymology">Etymology</a>).

Flagellation practiced within an erotic setting has been recorded from at least the 1590s evidenced by a <a href="John%20Davies%20%28poet%29">John Davies</a> epigram, and references to "flogging schools" in <a href="Thomas%20Shadwell">Thomas Shadwell</a>'s "<a href="The%20Virtuoso">The Virtuoso</a>" (1676) and Tim Tell-Troth's "Knavery of Astrology" (1680). Visual evidence such as mezzotints and print media is also identified revealing scenes of flagellation, such as "The Cully Flaug'd" from the British Museum collection.

<a href="John%20Cleland">John Cleland</a>'s novel "<a href="Fanny%20Hill">Fanny Hill</a>", published in 1749, incorporates a flagellation scene between the character's protagonist Fanny Hill and Mr Barville. A large number of flagellation publications followed, including "" (c1761), promoting the names of ladies offering the service in a lecture room with rods and cat o' nine tails.

Other sources give a broader definition, citing BDSM-like behavior in earlier times and other cultures, such as the medieval flagellates and the physical <a href="ordeal%20ritual">ordeal ritual</a>s of some <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> societies.

BDSM ideas and imagery have existed on the fringes of Western culture throughout the twentieth century. Robert Bienvenu attributes the origins of modern BDSM to three sources, which he names as "European Fetish" (from 1928), "American Fetish" (from 1934), and "Gay Leather" (from 1950). Another source are the <a href="sexual%20game">sexual game</a>s played in <a href="brothel">brothel</a>s, which go back into the 19th century if not earlier. <a href="Irving%20Klaw">Irving Klaw</a>, during the 1950s and 1960s, produced some of the first commercial film and photography with a BDSM theme (most notably with <a href="Bettie%20Page">Bettie Page</a>) and published comics by the now-iconic bondage artists <a href="John%20Willie">John Willie</a> and <a href="Eric%20Stanton">Eric Stanton</a>.

Stanton's model <a href="Bettie%20Page">Bettie Page</a> became at the same time one of the first successful models in the area of fetish photography and one of the most famous <a href="pin-up%20girl">pin-up girl</a>s of American mainstream culture. Italian author and designer <a href="Guido%20Crepax">Guido Crepax</a> was deeply influenced by him, coining the style and development of European adult comics in the second half of the twentieth century. The artists <a href="Helmut%20Newton">Helmut Newton</a> and <a href="Robert%20Mapplethorpe">Robert Mapplethorpe</a> are the most prominent examples of the increasing use of BDSM-related motives in modern photography and the public discussions still resulting from this.

<a href="Alfred%20Binet">Alfred Binet</a> first coined the term erotic fetishism in his 1887 book, "Du fétichisme dans l’amour"

<a href="Richard%20von%20Krafft-Ebing">Richard von Krafft-Ebing</a> saw BDSM interests as the end of a continuum.

Leather has been a predominantly gay male term to refer to one <a href="sexual%20fetishism">fetish</a>, but it can stand for many more. Members of the gay male leather community may wear leathers such as Motorcycle leathers, or may be attracted to men wearing leather. Leather and BDSM are seen as two parts of one whole. Much of the BDSM culture can be traced back to the gay male <a href="leather%20subculture">leather culture</a>, which formalized itself out of the group of men who were soldiers returning home after World War II (1939–1945). WWII was the setting where countless homosexual men and women tasted the life among homosexual peers. Post-war, homosexual individuals congregated in larger cities such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. They formed leather clubs and bike clubs, some were fraternal services. The establishment of Mr. Leather Contest and Mr. Drummer Contest were made around this time. This was the genesis of the gay male leather community. Many of the members were attracted to extreme forms of sexuality, for which peak expression was in the pre-AIDS 1970s. This subculture is epitomized by the "Leatherman's Handbook" by <a href="Larry%20Townsend">Larry Townsend</a>, published in 1972, which describes in detail the practices and culture of gay male sadomasochists in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
In the early 1980s, lesbians also joined the leathermen as a recognizable element of the gay leather community. They also formed leather clubs, but there were some gender differences such as the absence of leatherwomen’s bar. In 1981, the publication of "<a href="Coming%20to%20Power">Coming to Power</a>" by lesbian-feminist group <a href="Samois">Samois</a> led to a greater knowledge and acceptance of BDSM in the lesbian community. By the 1990s, the gay men's and women's leather communities were no longer underground and played an important role in the kink community.

Today the Leather Movement is generally seen as a part of the BDSM-culture instead of as a development deriving from gay subculture, even if a huge part of the BDSM-subculture was gay in the past. In the 1990s the so-called <a href="New%20Guard%20%28leather%20subculture%29">New Guard</a> leather subculture evolved. This new orientation started to integrate psychological aspects into their play.

In the late-eighties, the Internet provided a way of finding people with specialized interests around the world as well as on a local level, and communicating with them anonymously. This brought about an explosion of interest and knowledge of BDSM, particularly on the <a href="usenet">usenet</a> group <a href="alt.sex.bondage">alt.sex.bondage</a>. When that group became too cluttered with <a href="spamming">spam</a>, the focus moved to <a href="https%3A//groups.google.com/groups%3Fq%3Dsoc.subculture.bondage-bdsm%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3BbtnG%3DGoogle%2BSearch">soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm</a>. With an increased focus on forms of social media, <a href="FetLife">FetLife</a> was formed, which advertises itself as "a social network for the BDSM and fetish community". It operates similarly to other social media sites, with the ability to make friends with other users, events, and pages of shared interests.

In addition to traditional sex shops, which sell sex paraphernalia, there has also been an explosive growth of online <a href="adult%20toy">adult toy</a> companies that specialize in leather/latex gear and BDSM toys. Once a very <a href="niche%20market">niche market</a>, there are now very few sex toy companies that do not offer some sort of BDSM or <a href="Sexual%20fetishism">fetish</a> gear in their catalog. Kinky elements seem to have worked their way into "<a href="Vanilla%20sex">vanilla</a>" markets. The former niche expanded to an important pillar of the business with adult accessories. Today practically all suppliers of sex toys do offer items which originally found usage in the BDSM subculture. Padded handcuffs, latex and leather garments, as well as more exotic items like soft whips for fondling and TENS for erotic electro stimulation can be found in catalogs aiming on classical vanilla target groups, indicating that former boundaries increasingly seem to shift.

During the last years the Internet also provides a central platform for networking among individuals who are interested in the subject. Besides countless private and commercial choices there is an increasing number of local networks and support groups emerging. These groups often offer comprehensive background and health related information for people who have been unwillingly outed as well as contact lists with information on <a href="psychologist">psychologist</a>s, physicians and lawyers who are familiar with BDSM related topics.

Section 90 of the criminal code declares bodily injury (§§ 83-84) or the endangerment of physical security (§ 89) to not be subject to penalty in cases in which the victim has consented and the injury or endangerment does not offend moral sensibilities. Case law from the Austrian Supreme Court has consistently shown that bodily injury is only offensive to moral sensibilities, thus it is only punishable when a "serious injury" (a damage to health or an employment disability lasting more than 24 days) or the death of the "victim" results. A "light injury" is generally considered "permissible" when the "victim" has consented to it. In cases of threats to bodily well being the standard depends on the probability that an injury will actually occur. If serious injury or even death would be a likely result of a threat being carried out, then even the threat itself is considered punishable.

In 2004 a judge in Canada ruled that videos seized by the police featuring BDSM activities were not obscene, and did not constitute violence, but a "normal and acceptable" sexual activity between two consenting adults.

In 2011, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> ruled in "<a href="R.%20v.%20J.A.">R. v. J.A.</a>" that a person must have an active mind during the specific sexual activity in order to legally consent. The Court ruled that it is a criminal offence to perform a sexual act on an unconscious person—whether or not that person consented in advance.

According to § 194 the charge of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the defamed person chooses to press charges. False imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in his or her rights of free movement. According to § 228 of the German criminal code a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases where the act can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given. On 26 May 2004 the Criminal Panel No. 2 of the <a href="Bundesgerichtshof">Bundesgerichtshof</a> (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to § 228.

Following cases in which sado-masochistic practices had been repeatedly used as pressure tactics against former partners in custody cases, the Appeals Court of <a href="Hamm">Hamm</a> ruled in February 2006 that sexual inclinations toward sado-masochism are no indication of a lack of capabilities for successful child-raising.

In Italian law BDSM is right on the border between crime and legality, and everything lies in the interpretation of the legal code by the judge. This concept is that anyone willingly causing "injury" to another person is to be punished. In this context though "injury" is legally defined as "anything causing a condition of illness", and "illness" is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is "any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism" (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is "a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy". This could make it somewhat risky to play with someone as later the "victim" may call foul play citing even an insignificant mark as evidence against the partner. Also any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it.

In September 2010 a Swedish court acquitted a 32-year-old man of assault for engaging in consensual BDSM play with a 16-year-old woman (the <a href="age%20of%20consent">age of consent</a> in Sweden is 15). Norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position, that safe and consensual BDSM play should not be subject to criminal prosecution. This parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the Nordic countries which have removed sadomasochism from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses.

The age of consent in Switzerland is 16 years which also applies for BDSM play. Minors (i.e. those under 16) are not subject to punishment for BDSM play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years. Certain practices however require granting consent for light injuries with only those over 18 permitted to give consent. On 1 April 2002 Articles 135 and 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code were tightened to make ownership of ""objects or demonstrations [...] which depict sexual acts with violent content"" a punishable offense. This law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochism since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media which fulfills this criterion. Critics also object to the wording of the law which puts sado-masochists in the same category as <a href="pedophilia">pedophiles</a> and <a href="pederasty">pederasts</a>.

In British law, consent is an absolute defence to common assault, but not necessarily to actual bodily harm, where courts may decide that consent is not valid, as occurred in the case of <a href="R%20v%20Brown">R v Brown</a>. Accordingly, consensual activities in the UK may not constitute "assault occasioning actual or grievous bodily harm" in law. The <a href="Spanner%20Trust">Spanner Trust</a> states that this is defined as activities which have caused injury "of a lasting nature" but that only a slight duration or injury might be considered "lasting" in law. The decision contrasts with the later case of R v Wilson in which conviction for non-sexual consensual branding within a marriage was overturned, the appeal court ruling that R v Brown was not an authority in all cases of consensual injury and criticizing the decision to prosecute.

Following <a href="Operation%20Spanner">Operation Spanner</a> the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> ruled in January 1999 in <a href="Laskey%2C%20Jaggard%20and%20Brown%20v.%20United%20Kingdom">Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. United Kingdom</a> that no violation of <a href="Article%208%20of%20the%20European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">Article 8</a> occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people, even consenting adults, is to be determined by the <a href="jurisdiction%20%28area%29">jurisdiction</a> the individuals live in, as it is the State's responsibility to balance the concerns of <a href="public%20health">public health</a> and well-being with the amount of control a State should be allowed to exercise over its citizens. In the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill 2007, the British Government cited the Spanner case as justification for criminalizing images of consensual acts, as part of its proposed criminalization of possession of ""<a href="extreme%20pornography">extreme pornography</a>"". Another contrasting case was that of Stephen Lock in 2013, who was cleared of actual bodily harm on the grounds that the woman consented. In this case, the act was deemed to be sexual.

The United States Federal law does not list a specific criminal determination for consensual BDSM acts. Many BDSM practitioners cite the legal decision of <a href="People%20v.%20Jovanovic">People v. Jovanovic</a>, 95 N.Y.2d 846 (2000), or the "Cybersex Torture Case", which was the first U.S. appellate decision to hold (in effect) that one does not commit assault if the victim consents. However, many individual states do criminalize specific BDSM actions within their state borders. Some states specifically address the idea of "consent to BDSM acts" within their assault laws, such as the state of New Jersey, which defines "simple assault" to be "a disorderly persons offense unless committed in a fight or scuffle "entered into by mutual consent", in which case it is a petty disorderly persons offense".

<a href="Oregon%20Ballot%20Measure%209">Oregon Ballot Measure 9</a> was a <a href="initiative">ballot measure</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> in 1992, concerning sadism, masochism, <a href="gay%20rights">gay rights</a>, pedophilia, and <a href="public%20education">public education</a>, that drew widespread national attention. It would have added the following text to the <a href="Oregon%20Constitution">Oregon Constitution</a>:

It was defeated in 3 November 1992 <a href="general%20election">general election</a> with 638,527 votes in favor, 828,290 votes against.

The <a href="National%20Coalition%20for%20Sexual%20Freedom">National Coalition for Sexual Freedom</a> collects reports about punishment for sexual activities engaged in by <a href="consenting%20adults">consenting adults</a>, and about its use in <a href="child%20custody">child custody</a> cases.

Today the BDSM culture exists in most western countries. This offers BDSM practitioners the opportunity to discuss BDSM relevant topics and problems with like-minded people. This culture is often viewed as a <a href="subculture">subculture</a>, mainly because BDSM is often still regarded as "unusual" by some of the public. Many people hide their leaning from society since they are afraid of the incomprehension and of social exclusion. It is commonly known in the BDSM culture that there are practitioners living on all continents, but there is no documented evidence for many countries (due to restrictive laws and censorship motivated by politics or religion) except their presence in online BDSM communities and dating sites.

In contrast to frameworks seeking to explain sadomasochism through psychological, psychoanalytic, medical or forensic approaches, which seek to categorize behaviour and desires and find a root "cause", Romana Byrne suggests that such practices can be seen as examples of "aesthetic sexuality", in which a founding physiological or psychological impulse is irrelevant. Rather, sadism and masochism may be practiced through choice and deliberation, driven by certain aesthetic goals tied to style, pleasure, and identity. These practices, in certain circumstances and contexts, can be compared with the creation of art.

One of the most commonly used symbols of the BDSM community is a derivation of a <a href="triskelion">triskelion</a> shape within a circle. Various forms of triskele have had many uses and many meanings in many cultures; its BDSM usage derives from the "Ring of O" in the classic book "<a href="Story%20of%20O">Story of O</a>". The BDSM Emblem Project claims copyright over one particular specified form of the triskelion symbol; other variants of the triskelion are free from such copyright claims.

The <a href="leather%20pride%20flag">leather pride flag</a> is a symbol for the <a href="leather%20subculture">leather subculture</a> and also widely used within BDSM. In continental Europe, the "<a href="Ring%20of%20O">Ring of O</a>" is widespread among BDSM practitioners.

The <a href="triskelion">triskelion</a> as a BDSM symbol can easily be perceived as the three separate parts of the acronym BDSM; which are BD, DS, and SM (Bondage & Discipline, Dominance & Submission, Sadism & Masochism). They are three separate items, that are normally associated together.

The BDSM rights flag, shown to the right, is intended to represent the belief that people whose sexuality or relationship preferences include BDSM practises deserve the same human rights as everyone else, and should not be discriminated against for pursuing BDSM with consenting adults.

The flag is inspired by the leather pride flag and BDSM emblem, but is specifically intended to represent the concept of BDSM rights and to be without the other symbols' restrictions against commercial use. It is designed to be recognisable by people familiar with either the leather pride flag or BDSM triskelion (or triskele) as "something to do with BDSM"; and to be distinctive whether reproduced in full colour, or in black and white (or another pair of colours).

BDSM and fetish items and styles have been spread widely in western societies' everyday life by different factors, such as <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> fashion, <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>, <a href="goth%20subculture">goth subculture</a>, and science fiction TV series, and are often not consciously connected with their BDSM roots by many people. While it was mainly confined to the <a href="Punk%20subculture">Punk</a> and BDSM subcultures in the 1990s, it has since spread into wider parts of western societies.



Although it would be possible to establish certain elements related to BDSM in classical theater, not until the emergence of contemporary theatre would some plays have BDSM as the main theme. Exemplifying this are two works: one Austrian, one German, in which BDSM is not only incorporated, but integral to the storyline of the play.

Although examples of literature catering to BDSM and fetishistic tastes were created in earlier periods, BDSM literature as it exists today cannot be found much earlier than <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

The word Sadism originates from the works of <a href="Donatien%20Alphonse%20Fran%C3%A7ois%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Sade">Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade</a>, and the word Masochism originates from <a href="Leopold%20von%20Sacher-Masoch">Leopold von Sacher-Masoch</a>, the author of "<a href="Venus%20in%20Furs">Venus in Furs</a>". However, it is worth noting that the Marquis de Sade describes unconsented abuse in his works, such as in "<a href="Justine%20%28Sade%20novel%29">Justine</a>". "Venus in Furs" describes a consented domme-sub relationship.

A central work in modern BDSM literature is undoubtedly the "<a href="Story%20of%20O">Story of O</a>" (1954) by <a href="Anne%20Desclos">Anne Desclos</a> under the pseudonym <a href="Pauline%20R%C3%A9age">Pauline Réage</a>.

Other notable works include "<a href="9%C2%BD%20Weeks%20%28book%29">9½ Weeks</a>" (1978) by <a href="Elizabeth%20McNeill">Elizabeth McNeill</a>, some works of the writer <a href="Anne%20Rice">Anne Rice</a> ("<a href="Exit%20to%20Eden">Exit to Eden</a>", and her "<a href="The%20Claiming%20of%20Sleeping%20Beauty">Claiming of Sleeping Beauty</a>" series of books), <a href="Jeanne%20de%20Berg">Jeanne de Berg</a> ("<a href="The%20Image%20%28novel%29">L'Image</a>" (1956) dedicated to <a href="Pauline%20R%C3%A9age">Pauline Réage</a>). Works from the <a href="Gor">Gor</a> series by <a href="John%20Norman">John Norman</a>, and naturally all the works of <a href="Patrick%20Califia">Patrick Califia</a>, <a href="Gloria%20Brame">Gloria Brame</a>, the group <a href="Samois">Samois</a> and many of the writer <a href="Georges%20Bataille">Georges Bataille</a> (Histoire de l'oeil-Story of the Eye, Madame Edwarda, 1937), as well as <a href="Bob%20Flanagan">Bob Flanagan</a>: "Slave Sonnets" (1986), "Fuck Journal" (1987), "A Taste of Honey" (1990). A common part of many of the poems of <a href="Pablo%20Neruda">Pablo Neruda</a> is a reflection on feelings and sensations arising from the relations of EPE or erotic exchange of power. The "<a href="Fifty%20Shades%20trilogy">Fifty Shades</a>" trilogy is a series of very popular erotic romance novels by <a href="E.%20L.%20James">E. L. James</a> which involve BDSM; however the novels have been criticized for their inaccurate and harmful depiction of BDSM.

Bash (Unix shell)

Bash is a <a href="Unix%20shell">Unix shell</a> and <a href="command%20language">command language</a> written by <a href="Brian%20Fox%20%28computer%20programmer%29">Brian Fox</a> for the <a href="GNU%20Project">GNU Project</a> as a <a href="free%20software">free software</a> replacement for the <a href="Bourne%20shell">Bourne shell</a>. First released in 1989, it has been distributed widely as the default <a href="login">login</a> shell for most <a href="Linux">Linux</a> distributions and <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple's</a> <a href="macOS">macOS</a> (formerly ). A version <a href="Windows%20Subsystem%20for%20Linux">is also available for Windows 10</a>.

Bash is a <a href="Command-line%20interpreter">command processor</a> that typically runs in a text window, where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a <a href="Shell%20script">script</a>. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename <a href="glob%20%28programming%29">globbing</a> (wildcard matching), <a href="Pipeline%20%28Unix%29">piping</a>, <a href="here%20document">here document</a>s, <a href="command%20substitution">command substitution</a>, <a href="Variable%20%28programming%29">variables</a>, and <a href="control%20flow">control structures</a> for <a href="Conditional%20%28programming%29">condition-testing</a> and <a href="iteration">iteration</a>. The <a href="Keyword%20%28computer%20programming%29">keywords</a>, <a href="Syntax%20%28programming%20languages%29">syntax</a> and other basic features of the <a href="Language%20%28computer%20science%29">language</a> are all copied from <a href="Bourne%20shell">sh</a>. Other features, e.g., <a href="C%20shell%23History">history</a>, are copied from <a href="C%20shell">csh</a> and <a href="Korn%20shell">ksh</a>. Bash is a <a href="POSIX">POSIX</a>-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.

The shell's name is an acronym for "Bourne-again shell", <a href="pun">pun</a>ning on the name of the Bourne shell that it replaces
and on the term "<a href="born%20again">born again</a>" that denotes spiritual rebirth in contemporary American Christianity.

A <a href="shellshock_%28software_bug%29">security hole</a> in Bash dating from version 1.03 (August 1989), dubbed <a href="Shellshock%20%28software%20bug%29">Shellshock</a>, was discovered in early September 2014 and quickly led to a range of <a href="Attack%20%28computing%29">attacks</a> across the Internet. Patches to fix the bugs were made available soon after the bugs were identified, but not all computers have been updated.

<a href="Brian%20Fox%20%28computer%20programmer%29">Brian Fox</a> began <a href="Computer%20programming">coding</a> Bash on January 10, 1988 after <a href="Richard%20Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> became dissatisfied with the lack of progress being made by a prior developer. Stallman and the <a href="Free%20Software%20Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a> (FSF) considered a free shell that could run existing shell scripts so strategic to a completely free system built from BSD and GNU code that this was one of the few projects they funded themselves, with Fox undertaking the work as an employee of FSF. Fox released Bash as a beta, version .99, on June 8, 1989 and remained the primary maintainer until sometime between mid-1992 and mid-1994, when he was laid off from FSF and his responsibility was transitioned to another early contributor, Chet Ramey.

Since then, Bash has become by far the most popular shell among users of Linux, becoming the default interactive shell on that operating system's various distributions (although <a href="Almquist%20shell">Almquist shell</a> may be the default scripting shell) and on Apple's macOS. Bash has also been ported to <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and distributed with <a href="Cygwin">Cygwin</a> and <a href="MinGW">MinGW</a>, to <a href="DOS">DOS</a> by the <a href="DJGPP">DJGPP</a> project, to <a href="Novell%20NetWare">Novell NetWare</a> and to <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> via various terminal emulation applications.

In September 2014, Stéphane Chazelas, a Unix/Linux, network and telecom specialist working in the UK, discovered a <a href="security%20bug">security bug</a> in the program. The bug, first disclosed on September 24, was named <a href="Shellshock%20%28software%20bug%29">Shellshock</a> and assigned the numbers <a href="http%3A//cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi%3Fname%3DCVE-2014-6271">CVE-2014-6271</a>, CVE-2014-6277 and <a href="http%3A//cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi%3Fname%3DCVE-2014-7169">CVE-2014-7169</a>. The bug was regarded as severe, since <a href="Common%20Gateway%20Interface">CGI</a> scripts using Bash could be vulnerable, enabling <a href="arbitrary%20code%20execution">arbitrary code execution</a>. The bug was related to how Bash passes function definitions to subshells through <a href="environment%20variable">environment variable</a>s.

The Bash <a href="command%20%28computing%29">command</a> syntax is a <a href="superset">superset</a> of the Bourne shell command syntax. Bash can execute the vast majority of Bourne shell scripts without modification, with the exception of Bourne shell scripts stumbling into fringe syntax behavior interpreted differently in Bash or attempting to run a system command matching a newer Bash builtin, etc. Bash command syntax includes ideas drawn from the <a href="Korn%20shell">Korn shell</a> (ksh) and the <a href="C%20shell">C shell</a> (csh) such as command line editing, <a href="command%20history">command history</a>, the directory stack, the codice_1 and codice_2 variables, and POSIX <a href="command%20substitution">command substitution</a> syntax codice_3.

When a user presses the <a href="tab%20key">tab key</a> within an interactive command-shell, Bash automatically uses <a href="command%20line%20completion">command line completion</a> to match partly typed program names, filenames and variable names. The Bash command-line completion system is very flexible and customizable, and is often packaged with functions that complete arguments and filenames for specific programs and tasks.

Bash's syntax has many extensions lacking in the Bourne shell. Bash can perform integer calculations ("arithmetic evaluation") without spawning external processes. It uses the codice_4 command and the codice_5 variable syntax for this purpose. Its syntax simplifies <a href="redirection%20%28computing%29">I/O redirection</a>. For example, it can redirect <a href="standard%20out">standard out</a>put (stdout) and <a href="Standard%20error%20stream">standard error</a> (stderr) at the same time using the codice_6 operator. This is simpler to type than the Bourne shell equivalent 'codice_7'. Bash supports <a href="process%20substitution">process substitution</a> using the codice_8 and codice_9syntax, which substitutes the output of (or input to) a command where a filename is normally used. (This is implemented through "/proc/fd/" unnamed pipes on systems that support that, or via temporary <a href="named%20pipe">named pipe</a>s where necessary).

When using the 'function' keyword, Bash function declarations are not compatible with Bourne/Korn/POSIX scripts (the Korn shell has the same problem when using 'function'), but Bash accepts the same function declaration syntax as the Bourne and Korn shells, and is POSIX-conformant. Because of these and other differences, Bash shell scripts are rarely runnable under the Bourne or Korn shell interpreters unless deliberately written with that compatibility in mind, which is becoming less common as Linux becomes more widespread. But in POSIX mode, Bash conforms with POSIX more closely.

Bash supports <a href="here%20document">here document</a>s. Since version 2.05b Bash can redirect <a href="Stdin">standard input</a> (stdin) from a "here string" using the codice_10 operator.

Bash 3.0 supports in-process <a href="regular%20expression">regular expression</a> matching using a syntax reminiscent of <a href="Perl">Perl</a>.

Bash 4.0 introduced support for associative arrays. Associative arrays allow a fake support for multi-dimensional (indexed) arrays, in a similar way to <a href="AWK">AWK</a>:

Brace expansion, also called alternation, is a feature copied from the <a href="C%20shell">C shell</a>. It generates a set of alternative combinations. Generated results need not exist as files. The results of each expanded string are not sorted and left to right order is preserved:
Users should not use brace expansions in portable shell scripts, because the Bourne shell does not produce the same output.

When brace expansion is combined with wildcards, the braces are expanded first, and then the resulting wildcards are substituted normally. Hence, a listing of JPEG and PNG images in the current directory could be obtained using:

In addition to alternation, brace expansion can be used for sequential ranges between two integers or characters separated by double dots. Newer versions of Bash allow a third integer to specify the increment.

When brace expansion is combined with variable expansion the variable expansion is performed after the brace expansion, which in some cases may necessitate the use of the codice_11 built-in, thus:

When Bash starts, it executes the commands in a variety of <a href="Hidden%20file%20and%20hidden%20directory%23Unix%20and%20Unix-like%20environments">dot files</a>. Though similar to Bash shell script commands, which have execute permission enabled and an <a href="interpreter%20directive">interpreter directive</a> like codice_12, the initialization files used by Bash require neither.

Elements of Bash derive from the <a href="Bourne%20shell">Bourne shell</a> and <a href="C%20shell">csh</a>. These allow limited startup file sharing with the Bourne shell and provide some startup features familiar to csh users.

The skeleton codice_13 below is compatible with the Bourne shell and gives semantics similar to csh for the codice_14 and codice_15. The codice_16 are tests to see if the "filename" exists and is readable, simply skipping the part after the codice_17 if it's not.

Some versions of <a href="Unix">Unix</a> and <a href="Linux">Linux</a> contain Bash system startup scripts, generally under the codice_18 directories. Bash calls these as part of its standard initialization, but other startup files can read them in a different order than the documented Bash startup sequence. The default content of the root user's files may also have issues, as well as the skeleton files the system provides to new user accounts upon setup. The startup scripts that launch the <a href="X%20window%20system">X window system</a> may also do surprising things with the user's Bash startup scripts in an attempt to set up user-environment variables before launching the <a href="window%20manager">window manager</a>. These issues can often be addressed using a codice_19 or codice_20 file to read the codice_21 — which provides the environment variables that Bash shell windows spawned from the window manager need, such as <a href="xterm">xterm</a> or <a href="Gnome%20Terminal">Gnome Terminal</a>.

Invoking Bash with the codice_22 option or stating codice_23 in a script causes Bash to conform very closely to the <a href="Posix%23POSIX.2">POSIX 1003.2 standard</a>.
Bash shell scripts intended for <a href="portability%20%28computer%20science%29">portability</a> should at least take into account the Bourne shell it intends to replace. Bash has certain features that the traditional Bourne shell lacks. They include:


A "bashism" is a portion of bash code that does not run properly on other Unix shells.

Bash uses readline to provide keyboard shortcuts for command line editing using the default (<a href="Emacs">Emacs</a>) key bindings. <a href="Vi-binding">Vi-binding</a>s can be enabled by running codice_24.

The Bash shell has two modes of execution for commands: <a href="batch%20%28Unix%29">batch</a>, and concurrent mode.

To execute commands in batch (i.e., in sequence) they must be separated by the character ";", or on separate lines:

in this example, when command1 is finished, command2 is executed.

To have a concurrent execution of command1 and command2, they must be executed in the Bash shell in the following way:

In this case command1 is executed in the background (symbol &), returning immediately control to the shell that executes command2 in the foreground.

Besides foreground and background, a process can be stopped. This is achieved by typing while the process is running in the foreground. A list of all processes, both in the background and stopped, can be achieved by running codice_25:

In the output, the number in brackets refers to the job id. The plus sign signifies the default process for codice_26 and codice_27. The text "Running" and "Stopped" refer to the <a href="Process%20state">Process state</a>. The last string is the command that started the process. 

The state of a process can be changed using various commands. The codice_27 command brings a process to the foreground, while the codice_26 sets a stopped process running in the background. codice_26 and codice_27 can take a job id as their first argument, to specify the process to act on. Without one, they use the default process, identified by a plus sign in the output of codice_25. The codice_33 command can be used to end a process prematurely, by sending it a <a href="Unix%20signal">Unix signal</a>. The job id must be specified after a percent sign:

Bash supplies "conditional execution" command separators that make execution of a command contingent on the <a href="Exit%20status">exit code</a> set by a precedent command. For example:

Where "./do_something" is only executed if the "cd" (change directory) command was "successful" (returned an exit status of zero) and the "echo" command would only be executed if either the "cd" or the "./do_something" command return an "error" (non-zero exit status).

For all commands the exit status is stored in the special variable codice_34. Bash also supports and forms of conditional command evaluation.

An external command called "bashbug" reports Bash shell bugs. When the command is invoked, it brings up the user's default editor with a form to fill in. The form is mailed to the Bash maintainers (or optionally to other email addresses).

Blizzard

A blizzard is a severe <a href="snow">snow</a><a href="Winter%20storm">storm</a> characterized by strong sustained winds of at least and lasting for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more. A <a href="ground%20blizzard">ground blizzard</a> is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds.
In the United States, the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> defines a blizzard as a severe <a href="Snow">Snow</a> <a href="Winter%20storm">storm</a> characterized by strong winds causing <a href="blowing%20snow">blowing snow</a> that results in low visibilities. The difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind, not the amount of snow. To be a blizzard, a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are greater than or equal to with blowing or drifting snow which reduces <a href="visibility">visibility</a> to or less and must last for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more.

While severe cold and large amounts of <a href="snowdrift">drifting snow</a> may accompany blizzards, they are not required. Blizzards can bring <a href="Whiteout%20%28weather%29">whiteout</a> conditions, and can paralyze regions for days at a time, particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare.

A severe blizzard has winds over , near zero visibility, and temperatures of or lower. In <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of .

<a href="Ground%20blizzard">Ground blizzard</a> refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. The primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time, but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface.

The Australia Bureau of <a href="Meteorology">Meteorology</a> describes a blizzard as, "Violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow, some part, at least, of which has been raised from snow covered ground."
The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" concludes the term "blizzard" is likely onomatopoeic, derived from the same sense as "blow, blast, blister, and bluster"; the first recorded use of it for weather dates to 1829, when it was defined as a "violent blow". It achieved its modern definition by 1859, when it was in use in the western United States. The term became common in the press during the harsh winter of 1880–81.

In the United States, storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the <a href="jet%20stream">jet stream</a> dips far to the south, allowing cold, dry polar air from the north to clash with warm, humid air moving up from the south. They are most common in the Great Plains, the Great Lakes states, and the northeastern states along the coast, and less common in the Pacific Northwest.

When cold, moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward to the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a>, and warmer, moist air moves north from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the <a href="Texas%20Panhandle">Texas Panhandle</a> to the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>.

Another storm system occurs when a cold core low over the <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a> area in Canada is displaced southward over southeastern Canada, the Great Lakes, and <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. When the rapidly moving cold front collides with warmer air coming north from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, strong surface winds, significant cold air <a href="advection">advection</a>, and extensive wintry precipitation occur.

<a href="Low%20pressure%20systems">Low pressure systems</a> moving out of the Rocky Mountains onto the Great Plains, a broad expanse of flat land, much of it covered in <a href="prairie">prairie</a>, <a href="steppe">steppe</a> and <a href="grassland">grassland</a>, can cause thunderstorms and rain to the south and heavy snows and strong winds to the north. With few trees or other obstructions to reduce wind and blowing, this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to blizzards with very low temperatures and <a href="whiteout%20%28weather%29">whiteout</a> conditions. In a true whiteout there is no visible horizon. People can become lost in their own front yards, when the door is only away, and they would have to feel their way back. Motorists have to stop their cars where they are, as the road is impossible to see.

A <a href="nor%27easter">nor'easter</a> is a macro-scale <a href="storm">storm</a> along the upper <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a> and <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a>. It gets its name from the direction the wind is coming from. The usage of the term in North America comes from the wind associated with many different types of storms some of which can form in the North Atlantic Ocean and some of which form as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The term is most often used in the coastal areas of <a href="New%20England">New England</a> and <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a>. This type of storm has characteristics similar to a <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>. More specifically it describes a <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure area</a> whose center of <a href="rotation">rotation</a> is just off the East Coast and whose leading winds in the left-forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast. High storm waves may sink ships at sea and cause coastal flooding and beach erosion. Notable nor'easters include The <a href="Great%20Blizzard%20of%201888">Great Blizzard of 1888</a>, one of the worst blizzards in U.S. history. It dropped of snow and had sustained winds of more than that produced snowdrifts in excess of . Railroads were shut down and people were confined to their houses for up to a week. It killed 400 people, mostly in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>.

The <a href="1972%20Iran%20blizzard">1972 Iran Blizzard</a>, which caused 4,000 reported deaths, was the deadliest blizzard in recorded history. Dropping as much as of snow, it completely covered 200 villages. After a snowfall lasting nearly a week, an area the size of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> was entirely buried in snow.

The winter of 1880–1881 is widely considered the most severe winter ever known in the United States. Many children—and their parents—learned of "The Snow Winter" through the children's book "<a href="The%20Long%20Winter%20%28novel%29">The Long Winter</a>" by <a href="Laura%20Ingalls%20Wilder">Laura Ingalls Wilder</a>, in which the author tells of her family's efforts to survive. The snow arrived in October 1880 and blizzard followed blizzard throughout the winter and into March 1881, leaving many areas snowbound throughout the entire winter. Accurate details in Wilder's novel include the blizzards' frequency and the deep cold, the <a href="Chicago%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">Chicago and North Western Railway</a> stopping trains until the spring thaw because the snow made the tracks impassable, the near-starvation of the townspeople, and the courage of her future husband Almanzo and another man, who ventured out on the open prairie in search of a cache of wheat that no one was even sure existed.

The October blizzard brought snowfalls so deep that two-story homes had snow up to the second floor windows. No one was prepared for the deep snow so early in the season and farmers all over the region were caught before their crops had even been harvested, their grain milled, or with their fuel supplies for the winter in place. By January the train service was almost entirely suspended from the region. Railroads hired scores of men to dig out the tracks but it was a wasted effort: As soon as they had finished shoveling a stretch of line, a new storm arrived, filling up the line and leaving their work useless.

There were no winter thaws and on February 2, 1881, a second massive blizzard struck that lasted for nine days. In the towns the streets were filled with solid drifts to the tops of the buildings and tunneling was needed to secure passage about town. Homes and barns were completely covered, compelling farmers to tunnel to reach and feed their stock.

When the snow finally melted in late spring of 1881, huge sections of the plains were flooded. Massive ice jams clogged the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> and when they broke the downstream areas were ravaged. Most of the town of <a href="Yankton%2C%20South%20Dakota">Yankton</a>, in what is now South Dakota, was washed away when the river overflowed its banks.

The <a href="1993%20Storm%20of%20the%20Century">Storm of the Century</a>, also known as the Great Blizzard of 1993, was a large <a href="cyclone">cyclonic</a> storm that formed over the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> on March 12, 1993, and dissipated in the North Atlantic Ocean on March 15. It is unique for its intensity, massive size and wide-reaching effect. At its height, the storm stretched from Canada towards Central America, but its main impact was on the Eastern United States and Cuba. The cyclone moved through the Gulf of Mexico, and then through the Eastern United States before moving into Canada. Areas as far south as central Alabama and Georgia received of snow and areas such as <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>, received up to with isolated reports of . Even the <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> reported up to , with <a href="Wind%23Wind%20force%20scale">hurricane-force</a> wind gusts and record low <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a>s. Between Louisiana and Cuba, hurricane-force winds produced high storm surges across northwestern Florida, which along with scattered <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es killed dozens of people. Record cold temperatures were seen across portions of the South and East in the wake of this storm. In the United States, the storm was responsible for the loss of <a href="electricity">electric power</a> to over 10 million customers. It is purported to have been directly experienced by nearly 40 percent of the country's population at that time. A total of 310 people, including 10 from Cuba, perished during this storm.

Bikini

A bikini is usually a women's abbreviated two-piece <a href="swimsuit">swimsuit</a> with a <a href="brassiere">bra top</a> for the chest and <a href="undergarments">underwear</a> cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's <a href="breast">breast</a>s and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the <a href="groin">groin</a> in front and the <a href="buttocks">buttocks</a> in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing <a href="thong%20%28clothing%29">thong</a> or <a href="G-string">G-string</a> design.

The name for the "bikini" design was coined in 1946 by <a href="Paris">Paris</a>ian engineer <a href="Louis%20R%C3%A9ard">Louis Réard</a>, the designer of the bikini. He named the swimsuit after <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a>, where testing on the <a href="nuclear%20bomb">nuclear bomb</a> was taking place. Fashion designer <a href="Jacques%20Heim">Jacques Heim</a>, also from Paris, re-released a similar design earlier that same year, the Atome. Due to its controversial and revealing design, the bikini was slow to be adopted. In many countries it was banned from beaches and public places. While still considered risqué, the bikini gradually became a part of popular culture when <a href="film%20star">film star</a>s—<a href="Brigitte%20Bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a>, <a href="Raquel%20Welch">Raquel Welch</a>, <a href="Ursula%20Andress">Ursula Andress</a> and others—began wearing them on public beaches and in film.

The bikini design became common in most Western countries by the mid-1960s as <a href="beachwear">beachwear</a>, <a href="swimwear">swimwear</a> and <a href="underwear">underwear</a>. By the late 20th century it had become common as <a href="Sportswear%20%28activewear%29">sportswear</a> in sports such as <a href="beach%20volleyball">beach volleyball</a> and <a href="bodybuilding">bodybuilding</a>. Variations of the term are used to describe <a href="Bikini%20variant">stylistic variations</a> for promotional purposes and industry classifications, including <a href="monokini">monokini</a>, <a href="microkini">microkini</a>, <a href="tankini">tankini</a>, <a href="trikini">trikini</a>, <a href="pubikini">pubikini</a>, and <a href="skirtini">skirtini</a>. A man's <a href="Swim%20briefs">brief swimsuit</a> may also be referred to as a bikini. Similarly, a variety of men's and women's underwear types are described as bikini underwear.

The bikini has gradually grown to gain wide acceptance in <a href="Western%20world">Western society</a>. By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, and boosted spin-off services such as <a href="bikini%20waxing">bikini waxing</a> and <a href="sun%20tanning">sun tanning</a>.

While the two-piece swimsuit as a design existed in <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>, the modern design first attracted public notice in Paris on July 5, 1946. French mechanical engineer <a href="Louis%20R%C3%A9ard">Louis Réard</a> introduced a design he named the "bikini", taking the name from the <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> in the Pacific Ocean, which was the colonial name the Germans gave to the atoll, transliterated from the <a href="Marshallese%20language">Marshallese</a> name for the island, . Four days earlier, the United States had initiated its first peace-time <a href="nuclear%20weapon%20design">nuclear weapons</a> <a href="nuclear%20testing">test</a> <a href="Nuclear%20testing%20at%20Bikini%20Atoll">at Bikini Atoll</a> as part of <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>. Réard hoped his swimsuit's revealing style would create an "explosive commercial and cultural reaction" similar to the explosion at Bikini Atoll.

By making an analogy with words like "bilingual" and "bilateral" containing the Latin prefix "<a href="bi-">bi-</a>" (meaning "two" in Latin), the word "bikini" was first <a href="Back-derivation">back-derived</a> as consisting of two parts, ["bi" + "kini"] by <a href="Rudi%20Gernreich">Rudi Gernreich</a>, who introduced the <a href="monokini">monokini</a> in 1964. Later swimsuit designs like the <a href="tankini">tankini</a> and <a href="trikini">trikini</a> further cemented this derivation. Over time the ""–kini" family" (as dubbed by author <a href="William%20Safire">William Safire</a>), including the ""–ini" sisters" (as dubbed by designer Anne Cole), expanded into a variety of swimwear including the monokini (also known as a numokini or unikini), seekini, <a href="tankini">tankini</a>, camikini, hikini (also hipkini), minikini, face-kini, burkini, and microkini. The "<a href="Language%20Report">Language Report</a>", compiled by lexicographer <a href="Susie%20Dent">Susie Dent</a> and published by the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> (OUP) in 2003, considers lexicographic inventions like bandeaukini and camkini, two variants of the tankini, important to observe. Although "bikini" was originally a registered trademark of Réard, it has since become <a href="generic%20trademark">genericized</a>.

Variations of the term are used to describe <a href="Bikini%20variant">stylistic variations</a> for promotional purposes and industry classifications, including monokini, <a href="microkini">microkini</a>, <a href="tankini">tankini</a>, <a href="trikini">trikini</a>, <a href="pubikini">pubikini</a>, <a href="bandeaukini">bandeaukini</a> and <a href="skirtini">skirtini</a>. A man's <a href="Swim%20briefs">brief swimsuit</a> may also be referred to as a bikini. Similarly, a variety of men's and women's underwear types are described as bikini underwear.

Archaeologist <a href="James%20Mellaart">James Mellaart</a> described the earliest bikini-like costume in <a href="%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Çatalhöyük</a>, <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> in the <a href="Chalcolithic">Chalcolithic</a> era (around 5600 BC), where a mother goddess is depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume somewhat like a bikini. The two-piece swimsuit can be traced back to the <a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Greco-Roman world</a>, where bikini-like garments worn by women athletes are depicted on <a href="urns">urns</a> and paintings dating back to 1400 BC.

In "Coronation of the Winner," a <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> in the floor of a <a href="Roman%20villa">Roman villa</a> in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> that dates from the <a href="Diocletianic%20Persecution">Diocletian period</a> (286–305 AD), young women participate in weightlifting, discus throwing, and running ball games dressed in bikini-like garments (technically bandeaukinis in modern lexicon). The mosaic, found in the <a href="Sicily">Sicilian</a> <a href="Villa%20Romana%20del%20Casale">Villa Romana del Casale</a>, features ten maidens who have been anachronistically dubbed the "<a href="Villa%20Romana%20del%20Casale%23Bikini%20girls">Bikini Girls</a>". Other <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> archaeological finds depict the goddess <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> in a similar garment. In <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, depictions of Venus wearing a bikini were discovered in the Casa della Venere, in the "<a href="tablinum">tablinum</a>" of the <a href="House%20of%20Julia%20Felix">House of Julia Felix</a>, and in an <a href="Atrium%20%28architecture%29">atrium</a> garden of <a href="House%20of%20Loreius%20Tiburtinus">Via Dell'Abbondanza</a>.

Swimming or bathing outdoors was discouraged in the <a href="Christian%20West">Christian West</a>, so there was little demand or need for swimming or bathing costumes until the 18th century. The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve <a href="chemise">chemise</a>-type gown made of wool or flannel that retained coverage and modesty.

In 1907, Australian swimmer and performer <a href="Annette%20Kellerman">Annette Kellerman</a> was arrested on a <a href="Boston">Boston</a> beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. In 1913, designer <a href="Carl%20Jantzen">Carl Jantzen</a> made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired by the introduction of females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.

During the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from "taking in the water" to "taking in the sun", at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. <a href="Rayon">Rayon</a> was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits, but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic. <a href="Jersey%20%28fabric%29">Jersey</a> and <a href="silk">silk</a> were also sometimes used. By the 1930s, manufacturers had lowered necklines in the back, removed sleeves, and tightened the sides. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly <a href="latex">latex</a> and <a href="nylon">nylon</a>, swimsuits gradually began hugging the body through the 1930s, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning.

Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of <a href="midriff%20exposure">midriff exposure</a>.The 1932 Hollywood film Three on a Match featured a midriff baring two piece bathing suit. Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured similar designs of midriff-baring suits and tops. However, midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public. Hollywood endorsed the new glamor in films like 1949's "<a href="Neptune%27s%20Daughter%20%281949%20film%29">Neptune's Daughter</a>" in which <a href="Esther%20Williams">Esther Williams</a> wore provocatively named costumes such as "Double Entendre" and "Honey Child".

Wartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. In 1942, the United States <a href="War%20Production%20Board">War Production Board</a> issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction in the amount of fabric in women's beachwear. To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers removed skirt panels and other attachments, while increasing production of the two-piece swimsuit with bare midriffs. At the same time, demand for all swimwear declined as there was not much interest in going to the beach, especially in Europe.

With the fabric shortage still in place and in an endeavour to resurrect swimwear sales, two French designers – <a href="Jacques%20Heim">Jacques Heim</a> and <a href="Louis%20R%C3%A9ard">Louis Réard</a>  – almost simultaneously launched their new two-piece swimsuit ranges in 1946. Heim launched his two-piece swimsuit in Paris which he called the "atome", after the smallest known particle of matter. He advertised the Atome as the world's "smallest bathing suit". At about the same time, Louis Réard created a competing two-piece swimsuit design, which he called the "bikini".

Although briefer than the two-piece swimsuits of the 1930s, the bottom of Heim's new two-piece beach costume still covered the wearer's navel. Réard's "bikini" undercut Heim's "atome" in its brevity. His initial design consisted of a bra and two triangular pieces of newspaper-type print fabric connected by strips of material. He sliced the top off Heim's bottoms. The Bikini, with a total area of of cloth, was advertised as "smaller than the smallest swimsuit". When he was unable to find a model willing to showcase his revealing design, Réard hired <a href="Micheline%20Bernardini">Micheline Bernardini</a>, a 19-year old <a href="Striptease">nude dancer</a> from the <a href="Casino%20de%20Paris">Casino de Paris</a>. Bernardini received 50,000 fan letters, many of them from men.

Réard said that "like the [atom] bomb, the bikini is small and devastating". Fashion writer <a href="Diana%20Vreeland">Diana Vreeland</a> described the bikini as the "atom bomb of fashion". In advertisements he declared the swimsuit could not be a genuine bikini "unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring." French newspaper "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>" wrote, "People were craving the simple pleasures of the sea and the sun. For women, wearing a bikini signaled a kind of second liberation. There was really nothing sexual about this. It was instead a celebration of freedom and a return to the joys in life."

Heim's "atome" was more attuned to the sense of propriety of the 1940s and a bigger hit than Réard's design but Réard's was the design that won the public's imagination over time. Though Heim's design was the first worn on the beach and sold more swimsuits, it was Réard's description of the two-piece swimsuit as a "bikini" that stuck. Modern bikinis were first made of <a href="cotton">cotton</a> and <a href="Jersey%20%28fabric%29">jersey</a>.

Despite the garment's initial success in France, worldwide women still stuck to traditional one-piece swimsuits, and, his sales stalling, Réard went back to designing and selling orthodox knickers. In 1950, American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, owner of mass market swimwear firm Cole of California, told "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" that he had "little but scorn for France's famed Bikinis." Réard himself would later describe it as a "two-piece bathing suit which reveals everything about a girl except for her mother's maiden name." Fashion magazine "Modern Girl Magazine" in 1957 stated that "it is hardly necessary to waste words over the so-called bikini since it is inconceivable that any girl with tact and decency would ever wear such a thing".

In 1951, <a href="Eric%20Morley">Eric Morley</a> organized the "Festival Bikini Contest", a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a>. The press, welcoming the spectacle, referred to it as "Miss World", a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was <a href="Kiki%20H%C3%A5kansson">Kiki Håkansson</a> of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a>, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by <a href="evening%20gown">evening gown</a>s. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other <a href="beauty%20pageant">beauty pageant</a>s worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some <a href="feminist">feminist</a>s as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.

The bikini was banned on the French Atlantic coastline, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Australia, and was prohibited or discouraged in a number of US states. The <a href="United%20States%20Motion%20Picture%20Production%20Code%20of%201930">United States Motion Picture Production Code</a>, also known as the Hays Code, enforced from 1934, allowed two-piece gowns but prohibited the display of navels in Hollywood films. The <a href="National%20Legion%20of%20Decency">National Legion of Decency</a>, a Roman Catholic body guarding over American media content, also pressured Hollywood and foreign film producers to keep bikinis from being featured in Hollywood movies. As late as 1959, Anne Cole, one of the United States' largest swimsuit designers, said, "It's nothing more than a G-string. It's at the razor's edge of decency." The Hays Code was abandoned by the mid-1960s, and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure, as well as other restrictions. The influence of the National Legion of Decency also waned by the 1960s.

Increasingly common <a href="glamour%20photography">glamour shots</a> of popular actresses and models on either side of the Atlantic played a large part in bringing the bikini into the mainstream. During the 1950s, Hollywood stars such as <a href="Ava%20Gardner">Ava Gardner</a>, <a href="Rita%20Hayworth">Rita Hayworth</a>, <a href="Lana%20Turner">Lana Turner</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, <a href="Tina%20Louise">Tina Louise</a>, <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, <a href="Esther%20Williams">Esther Williams</a>, and <a href="Betty%20Grable">Betty Grable</a> took advantage of the risqué publicity associated with the bikini by posing for photographs wearing them—<a href="Pin-up%20girl">pin-ups</a> of Hayworth and Williams in costume were especially widely distributed in the United States. In 1950, <a href="Elvira%20Pag%C3%A3">Elvira Pagã</a> walked at the <a href="Rio%20Carnival">Rio Carnival</a>, Brazil in a golden bikini, starting the bikini tradition of the carnival.

In Europe, 17-year-old <a href="Brigitte%20Bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a> wore scanty bikinis (by contemporary standards) in the French film "Manina, la fille sans voiles" ("Manina, the girl unveiled"). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew more attention to Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled "<a href="Manina%2C%20the%20Girl%20in%20the%20Bikini">Manina, the Girl in the Bikini</a>". Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. Working with her husband and agent <a href="Roger%20Vadim">Roger Vadim</a> she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.

Similar photographs were taken of <a href="Anita%20Ekberg">Anita Ekberg</a> and <a href="Sophia%20Loren">Sophia Loren</a>, among others. According to "The Guardian", Bardot's photographs in particular turned <a href="Saint-Tropez">Saint-Tropez</a> into the beachwear capital of the world, with Bardot identified as the original Cannes bathing beauty. Bardot's photography helped to enhance the public profile of the festival, and Cannes in turn played a crucial role in her career.

<a href="Brian%20Hyland">Brian Hyland</a>'s novelty-song hit "<a href="Itsy%20Bitsy%20Teenie%20Weenie%20Yellow%20Polka%20Dot%20Bikini">Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini</a>" became a "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" No. 1 hit during the summer of 1960: the song tells a story about a young girl who is too shy to wear her new bikini on the beach, thinking it too risqué. "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" first featured a bikini on its cover in 1962; the "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated%20Swimsuit%20Issue">Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue</a>" debut two years later featured <a href="Babette%20March">Babette March</a> in a white bikini on the cover.

<a href="Ursula%20Andress">Ursula Andress</a>, appearing as <a href="Honey%20Rider">Honey Rider</a> in the 1962 British <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> film, "<a href="Dr.%20No%20%28film%29">Dr. No</a>", wore a <a href="White%20bikini%20of%20Ursula%20Andress">white bikini</a>, which became known as the "<a href="White%20bikini%20of%20Ursula%20Andress">Dr. No bikini</a>". It became one of the most famous bikinis of all time and an iconic moment in cinematic and fashion history. Andress said that she owed her career to that white bikini, remarking, "This bikini made me into a success. As a result of starring in "Dr. No" as the first <a href="Bond%20girl">Bond girl</a>, I was given the freedom to take my pick of future roles and to become financially independent."

The bikini finally caught on, and by 1963, the movie "<a href="Beach%20Party">Beach Party</a>", starring <a href="Annette%20Funicello">Annette Funicello</a> and <a href="Frankie%20Avalon">Frankie Avalon</a>, led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol, though Funicello was barred from wearing Réard's bikini unlike the other young females in the films. In 1965, a woman told "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" that it was "almost square" not to wear a bikini; the magazine wrote two years later that "65% of the young set had already gone over".

<a href="Raquel%20Welch">Raquel Welch</a>'s <a href="Fur%20bikini%20of%20Raquel%20Welch">fur bikini</a> in "<a href="One%20Million%20Years%20B.C.">One Million Years B.C.</a>" (1966) gave the world the most iconic bikini shot of all time and the poster image became an iconic moment in cinema history. Her deer skin bikini in "<a href="One%20Million%20Years%20B.C.">One Million Years B.C.</a>", advertised as "mankind's first bikini", (1966) was later described as a "definitive look of the 1960s". Her role wearing the leather bikini raised Welch to a fashion icon and the photo of her in the bikini became a best-selling pinup poster.

Stretch <a href="nylon">nylon</a> bikini briefs and bras complemented the adolescent boutique fashions of the 1960s, allowing those to be minimal. <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> introduced <a href="lycra">lycra</a> (DuPont's name for <a href="spandex">spandex</a>) in the same decade. Spandex expanded the range of novelty fabrics available to designers which meant suits could be made to fit like a second skin without heavy linings. "The advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini," wrote <a href="Kelly%20Killoren%20Bensimon">Kelly Killoren Bensimon</a>, a former model and author of "The Bikini pageRank.Book", "It didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't so much like lingerie anymore." Increased reliance on stretch fabric led to simplified construction. It allowed designers to create the <a href="string%20bikini">string bikini</a>, and allowed Rudi Gernreich to create the topless monokini. Alternative swimwear fabrics such as <a href="velvet">velvet</a>, <a href="leather">leather</a>, and <a href="crochet">crochet</a>ed squares surfaced in the early '70s.

Réard's company folded in 1988, four years after his death. By the end of the century, the bikini had become the most popular beachwear around the globe. According to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard, this was due to "the power of women, and not the power of fashion". As he explains, "The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women", though one survey indicates 85% of all bikinis never touch the water. By 1988 the bikini made up nearly 20% of swimsuit sales, more than any other model in the US, though one-piece suits made a comeback during the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1997, Miss Maryland Jamie Fox became the first contestant in 50 years to compete in a two-piece swimsuit at the <a href="Miss%20America%20Pageant">Miss America Pageant</a>. Actresses in <a href="action%20film">action film</a>s like "<a href="Blue%20Crush">Blue Crush</a>" (2002) and "" (2003) made the two-piece "the millennial equivalent of the power suit", according to Gina Bellafonte of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>",

According to Beth Dincuff Charleston, research associate at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, "The bikini represents a social leap involving body consciousness, moral concerns, and sexual attitudes." By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a $811 million business annually, according to the <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>, a consumer and retail information company, and had boosted spin-off services like <a href="bikini%20wax">bikini wax</a>ing and the sun tanning industries.

The 1967 film "<a href="An%20Evening%20in%20Paris">An Evening in Paris</a>" is mostly remembered because it featured <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> actress <a href="Sharmila%20Tagore">Sharmila Tagore</a> as the first Indian actress to wear a bikini on film. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" magazine. The costume shocked a conservative Indian audience, but it also set in motion a trend carried forward by <a href="Zeenat%20Aman">Zeenat Aman</a> in "<a href="Heera%20Panna">Heera Panna</a>" (1973) and "<a href="Qurbani%20%281980%20film%29">Qurbani</a>" (1980), <a href="Dimple%20Kapadia">Dimple Kapadia</a> in "<a href="Bobby%20%281973%20film%29">Bobby</a>" (1973), and <a href="Parveen%20Babi">Parveen Babi</a> in "Yeh Nazdeekiyan" (1982).

Indian women wear bikinis when they vacation abroad or in <a href="Goa">Goa</a> without the family. Despite the conservative ideas prevalent in India, bikinis have become more popular. In summer, when women take up swimming, often in a public space, a lot of tankinis, shorts and single-piece swimsuits are sold. The maximum sales for bikinis happen in the winter, the honeymoon season.

By the end of the first decade of 21st century, the Chinese bikini industry became a serious international threat for the Brazilian bikini industry. <a href="Huludao">Huludao</a>, <a href="Liaoning">Liaoning</a>, China set the world record for the largest bikini parade in 2012, with 1,085 participants and a photo shoot involving 3,090 women.

For most parts of the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, bikinis are either banned or is highly controversial. In 1966, In 1973, when <a href="Lebanon">Lebanese</a> magazine "Ash-Shabaka" printed a bikini-clad woman on the cover they had to make a second version with only the face of the model. In 2011, <a href="Huda%20Naccache">Huda Naccache</a> (<a href="Miss%20Earth">Miss Earth</a> 2011), when she posed for the cover of "Lilac" (based in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>) became the first bikini-clad Arab model on the cover of an Arabic magazine.

While the name "bikini" was at first applied only to beachwear that revealed the wearer's navel, today the fashion industry considers any two-piece swimsuit a bikini. Modern bikini fashions are characterized by a simple, brief design: two triangles of fabric that form a bra and cover the woman's <a href="breast">breast</a>s and a third that forms a panty cut below the navel that covers the <a href="groin">groin</a> and the <a href="buttocks">buttocks</a>.

Bikinis can and have been made out of almost every possible clothing material, and the fabrics and other materials used to make bikinis are an essential element of their design. Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey. <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a>'s introduction of Lycra (<a href="spandex">spandex</a>) in the 1960s completely changed how bikinis were designed and worn, as according to Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of "The Bikini pageRank.Book", "the advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini...it didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't so much like lingerie anymore." Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early 1970s.

In a single fashion show in 1985, there were two-piece suits with <a href="Crop%20top">cropped tank tops</a> instead of the usual skimpy bandeaux, suits that resembled bikinis from the front and one-pieces from the back, <a href="Suspenders">suspender straps</a>, <a href="ruffle">ruffle</a>s, and deep navel-baring cutouts. Metal and stone jewelery pieces are now often used to dress up look and style according to tastes. To meet the fast pace of demands, some manufacturers now offer made-to-order bikinis ready in as few as seven minutes. The world's most expensive bikini was designed in February 2006 by Susan Rosen; containing of diamond, it was valued at £20 million.

Bikini variations have grown to include a large number of more or less revealing styles — <a href="string%20bikini">string bikini</a>s, <a href="monokini">monokini</a>s (topless or top and bottom connected), Trikinis (three pieces instead of two), <a href="tankini">tankini</a>s (<a href="Sleeveless%20shirt">tank top</a>, bikini bottom), camikinis (<a href="Camisole">camisole top</a>, bikini bottom), bandeaukini (<a href="bandeau">bandeau</a> top, bikini bottom), skirtini (bikini top, skirt bottom), "granny bikini" (bikini top, boy shorts bottom), hikinis (also hipkini), seekinis (transparent), minikinis, microkinis, miniminis, slingshots (or suspender bikinis), <a href="thong%20%28clothing%29">thong</a> bottoms, tie-sides (a variety of string bikini) and teardrops.

Bikinis have become a major component of marketing various women's sports. It is an official uniform for beach volleyball and is widely worn in athletics and other sports. Sports bikinis have gained popularity since the 1990s. However, the trend has raised some criticism as an attempt to sell sex. Female swimmers do not normally wear bikinis in competitive swimming. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) voted to prohibit female swimmers from racing in bikinis in its meeting at Rome in 1960.

In 1994, the bikini became the official uniform of <a href="Beach%20volleyball%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics%23Women%27s%20beach%20volleyball">women's Olympic beach volleyball</a>. In 1999, the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20Volleyball">International Volleyball Federation</a> (FIVB) standardized beach volleyball uniforms, with the bikini becoming the required uniform for women. That regulation bottom is called a "bun-hugger", and players names are often written on the back of the bottom.

The uniform made its Olympic debut at Sydney's <a href="Bondi%20Beach%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bondi Beach</a> in the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a> amid some criticism. It was the fifth largest television audience of all the sports at the 2000 Games. Much of the interest was because of the sex appeal of bikini-clad players along with their athletic ability. Bikini-clad dancers and cheerleaders entertain the audience during match breaks in many beach volleyball tournaments, including the Olympics. Even <a href="Volleyball">indoor volleyball</a> costumes followed suit to become smaller and tighter.

However, the FIVB's mandating of the bikini ran into problems. Some sports officials consider it exploitative and impractical in colder weather. It also drew the ire of some athletes. At the <a href="2006%20Asian%20Games">2006 Asian Games</a> at Doha, Qatar, only one Muslim country – Iraq – fielded a team in the beach volleyball competition because of concerns that the uniform was inappropriate. They refused to wear bikinis. The weather during the evening games in <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 London Olympics</a> was so cold that the players sometimes had to wear shirts and leggings. Earlier in 2012, FIVB had announced it would allow shorts (maximum length above the knee) and sleeved tops at the games. Richard Baker, the federation spokesperson, said that "many of these countries have religious and cultural requirements so the uniform needed to be more flexible".

The bikini remains preferred by most players and corporate sponsors. Competitors <a href="Natalie%20Cook">Natalie Cook</a> and <a href="Holly%20McPeak">Holly McPeak</a> support the bikini as a practical uniform for a sport played on sand during the heat of summer. Olympic gold medal winner <a href="Kerry%20Walsh">Kerry Walsh</a> said, "I love our uniforms." According to fellow gold medalist <a href="Misty%20May-Treanor">Misty May-Treanor</a> and Walsh it does not restrict movement.

One feminist viewpoint sees the bikini uniform as objectification of women athletes. US beach volleyball player <a href="Gabrielle%20Reece">Gabrielle Reece</a> described the bikini bottoms as uncomfortable with constant "yanking and fiddling." Many female beach volleyball players have suffered injuries by over-straining the <a href="abdominal%20muscles">abdominal muscles</a> while many others have gone through <a href="augmentation%20mammoplasty">augmentation mammoplasty</a> to look appealing in their uniforms. Australian competitor <a href="Nicole%20Sanderson">Nicole Sanderson</a> said about match break entertainment that "it's kind of disrespectful to the female players. I'm sure the male spectators love it, but I find it a little bit offensive."

Sports journalism expert Kimberly Bissell conducted a study on the camera angles used during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games beach volleyball games. Bissell found that 20% of the camera angles were focused on the women's chests, and 17% on their buttocks. Bissell theorized that the appearance of the players draws fans attention more than their actual athleticism.
Sports commentator <a href="Jeanne%20Moos">Jeanne Moos</a> commented, "Beach volleyball has now joined go-go girl dancing as perhaps the only two professions where a bikini is the required uniform." British Olympian <a href="Denise%20Johns">Denise Johns</a> argues that the regulation uniform is intended to be "sexy" and to attract attention. Rubén Acosta, president of the FIVB, says that it makes the game more appealing to spectators.

From the 1950s to mid-1970s, men's contest formats were often supplemented with women's beauty contests or bikini shows. The winners earned titles like Miss Body Beautiful, Miss Physical Fitness and Miss Americana, and also presented trophies to the winners of the men's contest. In the 1980s, the Ms Olympia competition started in the USA and in the UK the NABBA (National Amateur Body Building Association) renamed Miss Bikini International to Ms Universe. In 1986, the Ms Universe competition was divided into two sections – "physique" (for a more muscular physique) and "figure" (traditional feminine presentation in high heels). In November 2010 the IFBBF (International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness) introduced a women's bikini contest for women who do not wish to build their muscles to figure competition levels.

Costumes are regulation "posing trunks" (bikini briefs) for both men and women. <a href="Female%20bodybuilder">Female bodybuilder</a>s in America are prohibited from wearing thongs or T-back swimsuits in contests filmed for television, though they are allowed to do so by certain fitness organizations in closed events. For men, the dress code specifies "swim trunks only (no shorts, cut-off pants, or Speedos)."

Women in <a href="Sport%20of%20athletics">athletics</a> often wear bikinis of similar size as those worn in <a href="beach%20volleyball">beach volleyball</a>. <a href="Amy%20Acuff">Amy Acuff</a>, a US high-jumper, wore a black leather bikini instead of a track suit at the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a>. Runner <a href="Florence%20Griffith-Joyner">Florence Griffith-Joyner</a> mixed bikini bottoms with one-legged <a href="tights">tights</a> at the <a href="1988%20Summer%20Olympics">1988 Summer Olympics</a>, earning her more attention than her record breaking performance in the women's 200 meters event. In the 2007 <a href="South%20Pacific%20Games">South Pacific Games</a>, the rules were adjusted to allow players to wear less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops instead of bikinis. At the <a href="West%20Asian%20Games">West Asian Games</a> in 2006, organizers banned bikini-bottoms for female athletes and asked them to wear long shorts.

String bikinis and other revealing clothes are common in <a href="surfing">surfing</a>, though most surfing bikinis are more robust with more coverage than sunning bikinis. "<a href="Surfing%20Magazine">Surfing Magazine</a>" printed a pictorial of <a href="Kymberly%20Herrin">Kymberly Herrin</a>, <a href="Playboy%20Playmate">"Playboy" Playmate</a> March 1981, surfing in a revealing bikini, and eventually started an annual bikini issue. The <a href="Association%20of%20Surfing%20Professionals">Association of Surfing Professionals</a> often pairs female surf meets with <a href="bikini%20contests">bikini contests</a>, an issue that divides the female pro-surfing community into two parts. It has often been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event.

In 1950, American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, owner of Cole of California, told "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" that bikinis were designed for "diminutive Gallic women", as because "French girls have short legs... swimsuits have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer." In 1961, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported the opinion that the bikini is permissible for people are not "too fat or too thin". In the 1960s etiquette writer <a href="Emily%20Post">Emily Post</a> decreed that "[A bikini] is for perfect figures only, and for the very young." In "The Bikini pageRank.Book" by <a href="Kelly%20Killoren%20Bensimon">Kelly Killoren Bensimon</a>, swimwear designer <a href="Norma%20Kamali">Norma Kamali</a> says, "Anyone with a tummy" should not wear a bikini. Since then, a number of bikini designers including Malia Mills have encouraged women of all ages and body types to take up the style. The 1970s saw the rise of the <a href="The%20Thin%20Ideal">lean ideal</a> of female body and figures like <a href="Cheryl%20Tiegs">Cheryl Tiegs</a>. Her figure remained in vogue in the 21st century.

The fitness boom of the 1980s led to one of the biggest leaps in the evolution of the bikini. According to Mills, "The leg line became superhigh, the front was superlow, and the straps were superthin." Women's magazines used terms like "Bikini Belly", and workout programs were launched to develop a "bikini-worthy body". The tiny "fitness-bikinis" made of <a href="lycra">lycra</a> were launched to cater to this hardbodied ideal. Movies like "<a href="Blue%20Crush">Blue Crush</a>" and TV <a href="reality%20show">reality show</a>s like "<a href="Surf%20Girls">Surf Girls</a>" merged the concepts of bikini models and athletes together, further accentuating the toned body ideal. Some women, motivated by yearly <a href="Spring%20Break">Spring Break</a> festivities that mark the start of the bikini season in North America, engage in <a href="eating%20disorders">eating disorders</a> in an attempt to achieve the ideal bikini body.

In 1993, <a href="Suzy%20Menkes">Suzy Menkes</a>, then Fashion Editor of the "<a href="International%20Herald%20Tribune">International Herald Tribune</a>", suggested that women had begun to "revolt" against the "body ideal" and bikini "exposure." She wrote, "Significantly, on the beaches as on the streets, some of the youngest and prettiest women (who were once the only ones who dared to bare) seem to have decided that exposure is over." Nevertheless, professional beach volleyball player <a href="Gabrielle%20Reece">Gabrielle Reece</a>, who competes in a bikini, claims that "confidence" alone can make a bikini sexy. One survey commissioned by Diet Chef, a UK home delivery service, reported by "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" and "The <a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">Today Show</a>" and ridiculed by "<a href="More%20%28magazine%29">More</a>" magazine, showed that women should stop wearing bikinis by the age of 47.

Certain types of underwear are described as bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the <a href="midriff">midriff</a> than <a href="Lingerie">traditional underwear</a>, <a href="panties">panties</a> or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as <a href="crop%20top">crop top</a>s. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular <a href="briefs">briefs</a>. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch but not at the waistband, with no fabric on the side of the legs.

Swimwear and underwear have similar design considerations, both being <a href="form-fitting%20garment">form-fitting garment</a>s. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear is open to public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and at about the same time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.

As the swimsuit was evolving, the underwear started to change. Between 1900 and 1940, swimsuit lengths followed the changes in underwear designs. In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the "breast girdle". During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By 1930s underwear styles for both women and men were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties for the rest of the century. Warner standardized the concept of <a href="Cup%20size">Cup size</a> in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938. Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband. <a href="Howard%20Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> designed a push-up bra to be worn by <a href="Jane%20Russell">Jane Russell</a> in "<a href="The%20Outlaw">The Outlaw</a>" in 1943, although Russell stated in interviews that she never wore the 'contraption'. In 1950 <a href="Maidenform">Maidenform</a> introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.

By the 1960s, the bikini swimsuit influenced panty styles and coincided with the cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, with the emergence of skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline and the rise of the leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as <a href="Calvin%20Klein">Calvin Klein</a>, particularly by photographers <a href="Bruce%20Weber%20%28photographer%29">Bruce Weber</a> and <a href="Herb%20Ritts">Herb Ritts</a>. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech <a href="skin-tight%20garment">skin-tight garment</a>s, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.

The term "men's bikini" is sometimes used to describe <a href="swim%20briefs">swim briefs</a>. Men's bikinis can have high or low side panels, and string sides or tie sides. Most lack a button or flap front. Unlike swim briefs, bikinis are not designed for drag reduction and generally lack a visible waistband. Suits less than 1.5 inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and <a href="sun%20tanning">sun tanning</a>. The posing brief standard to <a href="bodybuilding">bodybuilding</a> competitions is an example of this style. Male <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs. The 2000 <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film "<a href="Hera%20Pheri%20%282000%20film%29">Hera Pheri</a>" shows men sunbathing in bikinis, who were mistakenly believed to be women from a distance.

Male bikini tops also exist and are often used as <a href="visual%20gag">visual gag</a>s. A "mankini" is a type of sling swimsuit worn by men. The term is inspired by the word bikini. It was popularized by <a href="Sacha%20Baron%20Cohen">Sacha Baron Cohen</a> when he donned one in the film "<a href="Borat">Borat</a>".

Child-sized bikinis appeared shortly after the introduction of the swimsuit in the 1950s. In many European countries, it is typical for girls to wear only the bottom part of the bikini until breast development starts and swimsuits under size 11 are commonly not sold with a top part, but in the United States, Britain, and Canada, it has often been considered unacceptable for girls in late childhood (ages 7–11) to go topless even if there is no breast development. Several incidents of families being evicted from public pools due to their child being topless have been reported. In 2002, clothing retailer <a href="Abercrombie%20%26amp%3B%20Fitch">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> came under criticism for selling child-sized thong bikinis and underwear.

Bikini waxing is the <a href="hair%20removal">epilation</a> of <a href="pubic%20hair">pubic hair</a> beyond the bikini line by use of <a href="waxing">waxing</a>. The bikini line delineates the part of a woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be <a href="Embarrassment">embarrassing</a>, and often removed.

The <a href="tan%20line">tan line</a>s created by the wearing of a bikini while tanning are known as a bikini tan. A 1969 innovation of tan-through swimwear uses fabric which is perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, but which let enough sunlight through to produce a line-free tan.

As bikinis leave most of the body exposed to potentially dangerous <a href="ultraviolet">UV</a> radiation, overexposure can cause <a href="sunburn">sunburn</a>, <a href="skin%20cancer">skin cancer</a>, as well as other acute and chronic <a href="Health%20effects%20of%20sun%20exposure">health effects</a> on the skin, eyes, and <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum <a href="sunscreen">sunscreen</a>, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.

Babur

Babur (; 14 February 148326 December 1530), born Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn Muhammad (), was a conqueror from Central Asia who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the base for the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal dynasty</a> in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> and became the first Mughal emperor. He was a direct descendant of <a href="Turco-Mongol">Turco-Mongol</a> conqueror <a href="Timur">Timur</a> (Tamurlane) from the <a href="Barlas">Barlas</a> clan, through his father, and also a descendant of <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a> through his mother. He was also influenced by the <a href="Persian%20culture">Persian culture</a> and this affected both his own actions and those of his successors, giving rise to a significant expansion of the <a href="Persianate%20society">Persianate</a> ethos in the Indian subcontinent.

Babur was the eldest son of <a href="Umar%20Sheikh%20Mirza">Umar Sheikh Mirza</a>. He ascended the throne of <a href="Fergana">Fergana</a> in 1495 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion from his own relatives. He conquered <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a> two years later, only to lose the city of Fergana soon after. In his attempt to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501, his attempt to recapture both cities went in vain as he was defeated by <a href="Muhammad%20Shaybani%20Khan">Muhammad Shaybani Khan</a>. In 1504, he conquered <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a>, which was under the rule of the infant heir of <a href="Ulugh%20Begh">Ulugh Begh</a>. Babur formed a partnership with <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid</a> ruler <a href="Ismail%20I">Ismail I</a> and reconquered parts of central Asia, including Samarkand, only to again lose it and the other newly conquered lands to the Uzbeks.

After losing Samarkand for the third time, Babur turned his attention to creating his empire in <a href="north%20India">north India</a>. At that time, the <a href="Indo-Gangetic%20Plain">Indo-Gangetic Plain</a> of the northern Indian Subcontinent was ruled by <a href="Ibrahim%20Lodi">Ibrahim Lodi</a> of the Afghan <a href="Lodi%20dynasty">Lodi dynasty</a>, whereas <a href="Rajputana">Rajputana</a> was ruled by a Hindu <a href="Rajput">Rajput Confederacy</a>, led by <a href="Rana%20Sanga">Rana Sanga</a> of <a href="Mewar">Mewar</a>. In 1524, <a href="Daulat%20Khan%20Lodi">Daulat Khan Lodi</a>, a rebel of the Lodhi dynasty, invited Babur to overthrow Ibrahim and become ruler. Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Panipat">First Battle of Panipat</a> in 1526 and founded the Mughal empire. However, he again faced opposition, this time from Rana Sanga of Mewar who considered Babur a foreigner. The Rana was defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Khanwa">Battle of Khanwa</a>.

Babur married several times. Notable among his sons are <a href="Humayun">Humayun</a>, <a href="Kamran%20Mirza">Kamran Mirza</a> and <a href="Hindal%20Mirza">Hindal Mirza</a>. Babur died in 1530 and was succeeded by Humayun. According to Babur's wishes, he was buried in <a href="Gardens%20of%20Babur">Bagh-e-Babur</a> in Kabul, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Being a patrilineal descendant of Timur, Babur considered himself a Timurid and Turk, though Uzbek sources claim him as an ethnic Uzbek. He is considered a national hero in <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> and <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>. Many of his poems also have become popular folk songs. He wrote his autobiography, "<a href="Baburnama">Baburnama</a>", in <a href="Chaghatai%20language">Chaghatai Turkic</a> and this was translated into Persian during <a href="Akbar">Akbar</a>'s reign.

"<a href="Zahir%20al-Din%20%28disambiguation%29">Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn</a>" is <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> for "Defender of the Faith" (of <a href="Islam">Islam</a>), and "<a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>" honours the <a href="Prophets%20and%20messengers%20in%20Islam">Islamic prophet</a>.

The difficulty of pronouncing the name for his Central Asian Turco-Mongol army may have been responsible for the greater popularity of his nickname Babur, also variously spelled Baber, Babar, and Bābor. The name is generally taken in reference to the <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> "babr", meaning "tiger". The word repeatedly appears in <a href="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</a>'s "<a href="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</a>" and was borrowed into the <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic languages</a> of Central Asia. <a href="Wheeler%20Thackston">Thackston</a> argues for an alternate derivation from the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">PIE</a> word "<a href="beaver">beaver</a>", pointing to similarities between the pronunciation "Bābor" and the Russian "bobr" (, "beaver").

Babur bore the royal titles "<a href="Padshah">Badshah</a>" and "al-ṣultānu 'l-ʿazam wa 'l-ḫāqān al-mukkarram pādshāh-e <a href="ghazi%20%28warrior%29">ġāzī</a>". He and later <a href="Mughal%20emperors">Mughal emperors</a> used the title of "<a href="mirza">mirza</a>" when they were princes ("see" <a href="imperial%20and%20royal%20titles%20of%20the%20Mughal%20emperors">imperial and royal titles of the Mughal emperors</a>).

Babur's memoirs form the main source for details of his life. They are known as the "<a href="Baburnama">Baburnama</a>" and were written in <a href="Chaghatai%20language">Chaghatai Turkic</a>, his mother-tongue, though, according to Dale, "his Turkic prose is highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology or word formation and vocabulary." "Baburnama" was translated into Persian during the rule of Babur's grandson Akbar.

Babur was born on 14 February 1483 in the city of <a href="Andijan">Andijan</a>, <a href="Andijan%20Province">Andijan Province</a>, <a href="Fergana%20Valley">Fergana Valley</a>, contemporary Uzbekistan. He was the eldest son of <a href="Umar%20Sheikh%20Mirza">Umar Sheikh Mirza</a>, ruler of the Fergana Valley, the son of <a href="Abu%20Sa%27id%20%28Timurid%20dynasty%29">Abū Saʿīd Mirza</a> (and grandson of <a href="Miran%20Shah">Miran Shah</a>, who was himself son of <a href="Timur">Timur</a>) and his wife <a href="Qutlugh%20Nigar%20Khanum">Qutlugh Nigar Khanum</a>, daughter of <a href="Yunus%20Khan">Yunus Khan</a>, the ruler of <a href="Moghulistan">Moghulistan</a> (and great-great grandson of <a href="Tughlugh%20Timur">Tughlugh Timur</a>, the son of <a href="Esen%20Buqa%20I">Esen Buqa I</a>, who was the great-great-great grandson of <a href="Chaghatai%20Khan">Chaghatai Khan</a>, the second-born son of Genghis Khan).

Babur hailed from the Barlas tribe, which was of <a href="Mongol">Mongol</a> origin and had embraced <a href="Turkic%20people">Turkic</a> and Persian culture. They had also converted to Islam centuries earlier and resided in <a href="Turkestan">Turkestan</a> and <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khorasan</a>. Aside from the Chaghatai language, Babur was equally fluent in Persian, the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of the Timurid elite.

Hence, Babur, though nominally a Mongol (or "Moghul" in Persian language), drew much of his support from the local Turkic and Iranian people of Central Asia, and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup. It included <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a> (known to Babur as "<a href="Sart">Sart</a>s" and "<a href="T%C4%81jik%20people">Tajiks</a>"), <a href="Pashtun%20people">ethnic Afghans</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Arabs%20in%20Afghanistan">Arabs</a>, as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turko-Mongols from Central Asia.

In 1494, at eleven years old, Babur became the ruler of Fergana, in present-day Uzbekistan, after Umar Sheikh Mirza died "while tending pigeons in an ill-constructed dovecote that toppled into the ravine below the palace". During this time, two of his uncles from the neighbouring kingdoms, who were hostile to his father, and a group of nobles who wanted his younger brother Jahangir to be the ruler, threatened his succession to the throne. His uncles were relentless in their attempts to dislodge him from this position as well as from many of his other territorial possessions to come. Babur was able to secure his throne mainly because of help from his maternal grandmother, <a href="Aisan%20Daulat%20Begum">Aisan Daulat Begum</a>, although there was also some luck involved.

Most territories around his kingdom were ruled by his relatives, who were descendants of either Timur or Genghis Khan, and were constantly in conflict. At that time, rival princes were fighting over the city of Samarkand to the west, which was ruled by his paternal cousin. Babur had a great ambition to capture the city. In 1497 he <a href="Siege%20of%20Samarkand%20%281497%29">besieged Samarkand</a> for seven months before eventually gaining control over it. He was fifteen years old and for him the campaign was a huge achievement. Babur was able to hold the city despite desertions in his army, but he later fell seriously ill. Meanwhile, a rebellion back home, approximately away, amongst nobles who favoured his brother, robbed him of Fergana. As he was marching to recover it, he lost Samarkand to a rival prince, leaving him with neither. He had held Samarkand for 100 days, and he considered this defeat as his biggest loss, obsessing over it even later in his life after his conquests in India.

In 1501, Babur laid <a href="Siege%20of%20Samarkand%20%281501%29">siege to Samarkand</a> once more, but was soon defeated by his most formidable rival, <a href="Muhammad%20Shaybani">Muhammad Shaybani</a>, <a href="Khan%20%28title%29">Khan</a> of the Uzbeks. Samarkand, his lifelong obsession, was lost again. He tried to reclaim Fergana but lost it too and escaping with a small band of followers, he wandered to the mountains of central Asia and took refuge with hill tribes. Thus, during the ten years since becoming the ruler of Fergana, Babur suffered many short-lived victories and was without shelter and in exile, aided by friends and peasants. He finally stayed in <a href="Tashkent">Tashkent</a>, which was ruled by his maternal uncle. Babur wrote, "During my stay in Tashkent, I endured much poverty and humiliation. No country, or hope of one!" For three years Babur concentrated on building up a strong army, recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of <a href="Badakhshan">Badakhshan</a> in particular. By 1502, he had resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana; he was left with nothing and was forced to try his luck someplace else.

Kabul was ruled by Ulugh Begh Mirza of the <a href="Arghun%20Dynasty">Arghun Dynasty</a>, who died leaving only an infant as heir. The city was then claimed by Mukin Begh, who was considered to be a usurper and was opposed by the local populace. In 1504, Babur was able to cross the snowy <a href="Hindu%20Kush">Hindu Kush</a> mountains and <a href="Siege%20of%20Kabul%20%281504%29">capture Kabul</a> from the remaining Arghunids, who were forced to retreat to <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>. With this move, he gained a new kingdom, re-established his fortunes and would remain its ruler until 1526. In 1505, because of the low revenue generated by his new mountain kingdom, Babur began his first expedition to India; in his memoirs, he wrote, "My desire for Hindustan had been constant. It was in the month of Shaban, the Sun being in Aquarius, that we rode out of Kabul for Hindustan". It was a brief raid across the <a href="Khyber%20Pass">Khyber Pass</a>.

In the same year, Babur united with <a href="Sultan%20Husayn%20Mirza%20Bayqarah">Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah</a> of <a href="Herat">Herat</a>, a fellow Timurid and distant relative, against their common enemy, the Uzbek Shaybani. However, this venture did not take place because Husayn Mirza died in 1506 and his two sons were reluctant to go to war. Babur instead stayed at Herat after being invited by the two Mirza brothers. It was then the cultural capital of the eastern Muslim world. Though he was disgusted by the vices and luxuries of the city, he marvelled at the intellectual abundance there, which he stated was "filled with learned and matched men". He became acquainted with the work of the Chagatai poet <a href="Mir%20Ali%20Shir%20Nava%27i">Mir Ali Shir Nava'i</a>, who encouraged the use of Chagatai as a <a href="literary%20language">literary language</a>. Nava'i's proficiency with the language, which he is credited with founding, may have influenced Babur in his decision to use it for his memoirs. He spent two months there before being forced to leave because of diminishing resources; it later was overrun by Shaybani and the Mirzas fled.

Babur became the only reigning ruler of the Timurid dynasty after the loss of Herat, and many princes sought refuge from him at Kabul because of Shaybani's invasion in the west. He thus assumed the title of "<a href="Padshah">Padshah</a>" (emperor) among the Timurids—though this tile was insignificant since most of his ancestral lands were taken, Kabul itself was in danger and Shaybani continued to be a threat. Babur prevailed during a potential rebellion in Kabul, but two years later a revolt among some of his leading generals drove him out of Kabul. Escaping with very few companions, Babur soon returned to the city, capturing Kabul again and regaining the allegiance of the rebels. Meanwhile, Shaybani was defeated and killed by <a href="Ismail%20I">Ismail I</a>, Shah of <a href="Shia">Shia</a> Safavid Persia, in 1510.

Babur and the remaining Timurids used this opportunity to reconquer their ancestral territories. Over the following few years, Babur and Shah Ismail formed a partnership in an attempt to take over parts of Central Asia. In return for Ismail's assistance, Babur permitted the Safavids to act as a suzerain over him and his followers. Thus, in 1513, after leaving his brother Nasir Mirza to rule Kabul, he managed to take Samarkand for the third time; he also took Bokhara but lost both again to the Uzbeks. Shah Ismail reunited Babur with his sister <a href="Khanzada%20Begum">Khānzāda</a>, who had been imprisoned by and forced to marry the recently deceased Shaybani. Babur returned to Kabul after three years in 1514. The following 11 years of his rule mainly involved dealing with relatively insignificant rebellions from Afghan tribes, his nobles and relatives, in addition to conducting raids across the eastern mountains. Babur began to modernise and train his army despite it being, for him, relatively peaceful times.

Babur began relations with the Safavids when he met <a href="Ali%20Mirza%20Safavi">Ali Mirza Safavi</a> at Samarkand; their good relations lasted even after Babur was approached by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottomans</a>. The Safavids army led by <a href="Najm-e%20Sani">Najm-e Sani</a> massacred civilians in Central Asia and then sought the assistance of Babur, who advised the Safavids to withdraw. The Safavids, however, refused and were defeated during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ghazdewan">Battle of Ghazdewan</a> by the warlord Ubaydullah Khan.

Babur's early relations with the Ottomans were poor because the Ottoman <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> <a href="Selim%20I">Selim I</a> provided his rival Ubaydullah Khan with powerful <a href="matchlock">matchlock</a>s and <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s. In 1507, when ordered to accept Selim I as his rightful <a href="suzerainty">suzerain</a>, Babur refused and gathered <a href="Qizilbash">Qizilbash</a> servicemen in order to counter the forces of Ubaydullah Khan during the Battle of Ghazdewan. In 1513, Selim I reconciled with Babur (fearing that he would join the Safavids), dispatched <a href="Ustad%20Ali%20Quli">Ustad Ali Quli</a> the artilleryman and <a href="Mustafa%20Rumi">Mustafa Rumi</a> the matchlock marksman, and many other Ottoman Turks, in order to assist Babur in his conquests; this particular assistance proved to be the basis of future Mughal-Ottoman relations. From them, he also adopted the tactic of using matchlocks and cannons in field (rather than only in <a href="siege">siege</a>s), which would give him an important advantage in India.

Babur still wanted to escape from the Uzbeks, and he chose India as a refuge instead of <a href="Badakhshan">Badakhshan</a>, which was to the north of Kabul. He wrote, "In the presence of such power and potency, we had to think of some place for ourselves and, at this crisis and in the crack of time there was, put a wider space between us and the strong foeman." After his third loss of Samarkand, Babur gave full attention to the conquest of North India, launching a campaign; he reached <a href="Chenab">Chenab</a>, now in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, in 1519. Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab</a>, mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire. At the time parts of north India were under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim. He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, claiming himself the rightful heir to the throne, but the ambassador was detained at <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a> and released months later.

Babur started for Lahore, Punjab, in 1524 but found that Daulat Khan Lodi had been driven out by forces sent by Ibrahim Lodi. When Babur arrived at Lahore, the Lodi army marched out and his army was routed. In response, Babur burned Lahore for two days, then marched to Dipalpur, placing Alam Khan, another rebel uncle of Lodi, as governor. Alam Khan was quickly overthrown and fled to Kabul. In response, Babur supplied Alam Khan with troops who later joined up with Daulat Khan Lodi, and together with about 30,000 troops, they besieged Ibrahim Lodi at Delhi. He easily defeated and drove off Alam's army and Babur realised Lodi would not allow him to occupy the Punjab.

In November 1525 Babur got news at <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a> that Daulat Khan Lodi had switched sides, and he drove out Ala-ud-Din. Babur then marched onto Lahore to confront Daulat Khan Lodi, only to see Daulat's army melt away at their approach. Daulat surrendered and was pardoned. Thus within three weeks of crossing the <a href="Indus%20River">Indus River</a> Babur had become the master of Punjab.

Babur marched on to Delhi via Sirhind. He reached <a href="Panipat">Panipat</a> on 20 April 1526 and there met Ibrahim Lodi's numerically superior army of about 100,000 soldiers and 100 elephants. In the battle that began on the following day, Babur used the tactic of "Tulugma", encircling Ibrahim Lodi's army and forcing it to face artillery fire directly, as well as frightening its war elephants. Ibrahim Lodi died during the battle, thus ending the Lodi dynasty.

Babur wrote in his memoirs about his victory:

After the battle, Babur occupied Delhi and Agra, took the throne of Lodi, and laid the foundation for the eventual rise of Mughal rule in India. However, before he became North India's ruler, he had to fend off challengers, such as Rana Sanga.

The Battle of Khanwa was fought between Babur and the Rajput ruler Rana Sanga on 17 March 1527. Rana Sanga wanted to overthrow Babur, whom he considered to be a foreigner ruling in India, and also to extend the Rajput territories by annexing <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> and <a href="Agra">Agra</a>. He was supported by Afghan chiefs who felt Babur had been deceptive by refusing to fulfill promises made to them. Upon receiving news of Rana Sangha's advance towards Agra, Babur took a defensive position at <a href="Khanwa">Khanwa</a> (currently in the Indian state of <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>), from where he hoped to launch a counterattack later. According to K.V. Krishna Rao, Babur won the battle because of his "superior generalship" and modern tactics: the battle was one of the first in India that featured cannons. Rao also notes that Rana Sanga faced "treachery" when a Silhadi man converted to Islam and joined Babur's army with a garrison of 6,000 soldiers.

There are no descriptions about Babur's physical appearance, except from the paintings in the translation of the "<a href="Baburnama">Baburnama</a>" prepared during the reign of <a href="Akbar">Akbar</a>. In his autobiography, Babur claimed to be strong and physically fit, and claimed to have swum across every major river he encountered, including twice across the <a href="Ganges%20River">Ganges River</a> in <a href="North%20India">North India</a>. Unlike his father, he had <a href="%3Awikt%3Aascetic">ascetic</a> tendencies and did not have any great interest in women. In his first marriage, he was "bashful" towards <a href="Aisha%20Sultan%20Begum">Aisha Sultan Begum</a>, later losing his affection for her. However, he acquired several more wives and concubines over the years, and as required for a prince, he was able to ensure the continuity of his line; Babur treated them and his other women relatives well. In his memoirs, there is a mention of his infatuation for a younger boy when Babur was 16 years old. According to the historian <a href="Abraham%20Eraly">Abraham Eraly</a>, <a href="bisexuality">bisexuality</a> was common and <a href="pederasty">pederasty</a> high fashion among the central Asian aristocrats of the time.
Babur's first wife, Aisha Sultan Begum, was his paternal cousin, the daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza, his father's brother. She was an infant when betrothed to Babur, who was himself five years old. They married eleven years later, . The couple had one daughter, <a href="Fakhr-un-Nissa">Fakhr-un-Nissa</a>, who died within a year in 1500. Three years later, after Babur's first defeat at Fergana, Aisha left him and returned to her father's household. In 1504, Babur married Zaynab Sultan Begum, who died childless within two years. In the period 1506–08, Babur married four women, <a href="Maham%20Begum">Maham Begum</a> (in 1506), <a href="Masuma%20Sultan%20Begum">Masuma Sultan Begum</a>, Gulrukh Begum and Dildar Begum. Babur had four children by Maham Begum, of whom only one survived infancy. This was his eldest son and heir, <a href="Humayun">Humayun</a>. Masuma Sultan Begum died during childbirth; the year of her death is disputed (either 1508 or 1519). Gulrukh bore Babur two sons, <a href="Kamran%20Mirza">Kamran</a> and <a href="Askari%20Mirza">Askari</a>, and Dildar Begum was the mother of Babur's youngest son, <a href="Hindal%20Mirza">Hindal</a>. Babur later married <a href="Mubaraka%20Yusufzai">Mubaraka Yusufzai</a>, a <a href="Pashtuns">Pashtun</a> woman of the <a href="Yusufzai">Yusufzai</a> tribe. Gulnar Aghacha and Nargul Aghacha were two <a href="Circassian%20beauties">Circassian slaves</a> given to Babur as gifts by Tahmasp Shah Safavi, the Shah of Persia. They became "recognized ladies of the royal household."

During his rule in Kabul, when there was a time of relative peace, Babur pursued his interests in literature, art, music and gardening. Previously, he never drank alcohol and avoided it when he was in Herat. In Kabul, he first tasted it at the age of thirty. He then began to drink regularly, host wine parties and consume preparations made from <a href="opium">opium</a>. Though religion had a central place in his life, Babur also approvingly quoted a line of poetry by one of his contemporaries: "I am drunk, officer. Punish me when I am sober". He quit drinking for health reasons before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Khanwa">Battle of Khanwa</a>, just two years before his death, and demanded that his court do the same. But he did not stop chewing narcotic preparations, and did not lose his sense of irony. He wrote, "Everyone regrets drinking and swears an oath (of <a href="abstinence">abstinence</a>); I swore the oath and regret that."

Babur died at the age of 47 on and was succeeded by his eldest son, Humayun After death, his body was moved to Kabul, Afghanistan, where it lies in <a href="Bagh-e%20Babur">Bagh-e Babur</a> (Babur Gardens).

It is generally agreed that, as a Timurid, Babur was not only significantly influenced by the Persian culture, but that his empire also gave rise to the expansion of the <a href="Persianate">Persianate</a> ethos in the Indian subcontinent.

For example, F. Lehmann states in the "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Iranica">Encyclopædia Iranica</a>":
Although all applications of modern Central Asian ethnicities to people of Babur's time are anachronistic, Soviet and Uzbek sources regard Babur as an ethnic Uzbek. At the same time, during the Soviet Union Uzbek scholars were censored for idealising and praising Babur and other historical figures such as <a href="Ali-Shir%20Nava%27i">Ali-Shir Nava'i</a>.

Babur is considered a national hero in Uzbekistan. On 14 February 2008, stamps in his name were issued in the country to commemorate his 525th birth anniversary. Many of Babur's poems have become popular Uzbek folk songs, especially by <a href="Sherali%20Jo%27rayev">Sherali Jo'rayev</a>. Some sources claim that Babur is a national hero in <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> too. In October 2005, Pakistan developed the <a href="Babur%20%28cruise%20missile%29">Babur Cruise Missile</a>, named in his honour.

One of the enduring features of Babur's life was that he left behind the lively and well-written autobiography known as "<a href="Baburnama">Baburnama</a>". Quoting <a href="Henry%20Beveridge">Henry Beveridge</a>, <a href="Stanley%20Lane-Poole">Stanley Lane-Poole</a> writes:
In his own words, "The cream of my testimony is this, do nothing against your brothers even though they may deserve it." Also, "The new year, the spring, the wine and the beloved are joyful. Babur make merry, for the world will not be there for you a second time."

<a href="Babri%20Masjid">Babri Masjid</a> ("Babur's Mosque") in <a href="Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a>, India was constructed on the orders of <a href="Mir%20Baqi">Mir Baqi</a>, one of Babur's generals who led forces sent to the region during his reign. In 2003, by the order of an Indian Court, the <a href="Archaeological%20Survey%20of%20India">Archaeological Survey of India</a> (ASI) was asked to conduct a more indepth study and an excavation to ascertain the type of structure that was beneath the mosque. The excavation was conducted from 12 March 2003 to 7 August 2003, resulting in 1360 discoveries. The ASI submitted its report to the Allahabad high court.

The summary of the ASI report indicated the presence of a 10th-century temple under the mosque. According to the ASI team, the human activity at the site dates back to the 13th century BCE. The next few layers date back to the <a href="Shunga%20dynasty">Shunga</a> period (second-first century BCE) and the <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushan</a> period. During the early medieval period (11–12th century CE), a huge but short-lived structure of nearly 50 metres north-south orientation was constructed. On the remains of this structure, another massive structure was constructed: this structure had at least three structural phases and three successive floors attached with it. The report concluded that it was over the top of this construction that the disputed structure was constructed during the early 16th century.

Bernard of Clairvaux

Bernard of Clairvaux (), <a href="Cistercians">O.Cist</a> (109020 August 1153) was a <a href="French%20people">French</a> <a href="abbot">abbot</a> and the primary reformer of the <a href="Cistercian%20order">Cistercian order</a>.

After the death of his mother, Bernard sought admission into the Cistercian order. "Three years later, he was sent to found a new abbey at an isolated clearing in a glen known as the "Val d'Absinthe", about southeast of <a href="Bar-sur-Aube">Bar-sur-Aube</a>. According to tradition, Bernard founded the monastery on 25 June 1115, naming it "Claire Vallée", which evolved into "Clairvaux." There Bernard would preach an immediate faith, in which the intercessor was the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>." In the year 1128, Bernard attended the <a href="Council%20of%20Troyes">Council of Troyes</a>, at which he traced the outlines of the Rule of the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>, which soon became the ideal of Christian nobility.

On the death of <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20II">Pope Honorius II</a> on 13 February 1130, a schism broke out in the Church. King <a href="Louis%20VI%20of%20France">Louis VI of France</a> convened a national council of the French bishops at <a href="%C3%89tampes">Étampes</a> in 1130, and Bernard was chosen to judge between the rivals for pope. After the council of Étampes, Bernard spoke with King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a>, also known as Henry Beauclerc, about Henry I's reservations regarding <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Pope Innocent II</a>. Henry I was sceptical because most of the bishops of England supported <a href="Antipope%20Anacletus%20II">Antipope Anacletus II</a>; Bernard persuaded him to support Innocent. <a href="Germany">Germany</a> had decided to support Innocent through <a href="Norbert%20of%20Xanten">Norbert of Xanten</a>, who was a friend of Bernard's. However, Innocent insisted on Bernard's company when he met with <a href="Lothair%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Lothair III became Innocent's strongest ally among the nobility. Although the councils of Étampes, <a href="Wurzburg">Wurzburg</a>, <a href="Council%20of%20Clermont">Clermont</a>, and <a href="Rheims">Rheims</a> all supported Innocent, large portions of the Christian world still supported Anacletus. At the end of 1131, the kingdoms of France, England, Germany, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>, and <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a> supported Innocent; however, most of Italy, southern France, and <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, with the supported Anacletus. Bernard set out to convince these other regions to rally behind Innocent. The first person he went to was Gerard of Angoulême. He proceeded to write a letter, known as Letter 126, which questioned Gerard's reasons for supporting Anacletus. Bernard would later comment that Gerard was his most formidable opponent during the whole schism. After persuading Gerard, Bernard traveled to visit <a href="William%20X%2C%20Duke%20of%20Aquitaine">William X, Duke of Aquitaine</a>. He was the hardest for Bernard to convince. He did not pledge allegiance to Innocent until 1135. After that, Bernard spent most of his time in <a href="Italy">Italy</a> persuading the Italians to pledge allegiance to Innocent. He traveled to Sicily in 1137 to convince the king of Sicily to follow Innocent. The whole conflict ended when Anacletus died on 25 January 1138. In 1139, Bernard assisted at the <a href="Second%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Second Council of the Lateran</a>.
Bernard denounced the teachings of <a href="Peter%20Abelard">Peter Abelard</a> to the pope, who called a <a href="council%20at%20Sens">council at Sens</a> in 1141 to settle the matter. Bernard soon saw one of his disciples elected <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20III">Pope Eugene III</a>. Having previously helped end the schism within the church, Bernard was now called upon to combat heresy. In June 1145, Bernard traveled in southern France and his preaching there helped strengthen support against heresy.

After the Christian defeat at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Edessa">Siege of Edessa</a>, the pope commissioned Bernard to preach the <a href="Second%20Crusade">Second Crusade</a>. The last years of Bernard's life were saddened by the failure of the crusaders, the entire responsibility for which was thrown upon him. Bernard died at the age of 63, after 40 years as a monk. He was the first Cistercian placed on the <a href="calendar%20of%20saints">calendar of saints</a>, and was <a href="canonized">canonized</a> by <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Pope Alexander III</a> on 18 January 1174. In 1830 <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VIII">Pope Pius VIII</a> bestowed upon Bernard the title "<a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctor of the Church</a>".

Bernard's parents were <a href="Tescelin%20de%20Fontaine">Tescelin de Fontaine</a>, lord of <a href="Fontaine-l%C3%A8s-Dijon">Fontaine-lès-Dijon</a>, and , both members of the highest nobility of <a href="Burgundy%20%28region%29">Burgundy</a>. Bernard was the third of seven children, six of whom were sons. At the age of nine years, he was sent to a school at <a href="Ch%C3%A2tillon-sur-Seine">Châtillon-sur-Seine</a> run by the <a href="secular%20canons">secular canons</a> of Saint-Vorles. Bernard had a great taste for literature and devoted himself for some time to poetry. His success in his studies won the admiration of his teachers. He wanted to excel in literature in order to take up the study of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. He had a special devotion to the <a href="Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary%20%28Roman%20Catholic%29">Virgin Mary</a>, and he would later write several works about the <a href="Queen%20of%20Heaven">Queen of Heaven</a>.
Bernard would expand upon <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>'s role in transmuting the sacramentally ritual Christianity of the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Middle Ages</a> into a new, more personally held faith, with the life of Christ as a model and a new emphasis on the Virgin Mary. In opposition to the rational approach to divine understanding that the <a href="scholastics">scholastics</a> adopted, Bernard would preach an immediate faith, in which the intercessor was the Virgin Mary.

Bernard was only nineteen years of age when his mother died. During his youth, he did not escape trying temptations and around this time he thought of retiring from the world and living a life of solitude and prayer.

In 1098 Saint <a href="Robert%20of%20Molesme">Robert of Molesme</a> had founded <a href="C%C3%AEteaux%20Abbey">Cîteaux Abbey</a>, near <a href="Dijon">Dijon</a>, with the purpose of restoring the <a href="Rule%20of%20St%20Benedict">Rule of St Benedict</a> in all its rigour. Returning to Molesme, he left the government of the new abbey to Saint <a href="Alberic%20of%20C%C3%AEteaux">Alberic of Cîteaux</a>, who died in the year 1109. At the age of 22, while Bernard was at prayer in a church, he felt the calling of God to enter the Cistercian Monks of Cîteaux. In 1113 Saint <a href="Stephen%20Harding">Stephen Harding</a> had just succeeded Saint Alberic as third <a href="Abbot%20of%20C%C3%AEteaux">Abbot of Cîteaux</a> when Bernard and thirty other young noblemen of Burgundy sought admission into the Cistercian order. Bernard's testimony was so irresistible that 30 of his friends, brothers, and relatives followed him into the monastic life.

The little community of reformed <a href="Benedictines">Benedictines</a> at <a href="C%C3%AEteaux">Cîteaux</a>, which would have so profound an influence on Western <a href="monasticism">monasticism</a>, grew rapidly. Three years later, Bernard was sent with a band of twelve monks to found a new house at Vallée d'Absinthe, in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Langres">Diocese of Langres</a>. This Bernard named "Claire Vallée", or "Clairvaux", on 25 June 1115, and the names of Bernard and Clairvaux would soon become inseparable. During the absence of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Langres">Bishop of Langres</a>, Bernard was blessed as <a href="abbot">abbot</a> by <a href="William%20of%20Champeaux">William of Champeaux</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ch%C3%A2lons-sur-Marne">Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne</a>. From that moment a strong friendship sprang up between the abbot and the bishop, who was professor of theology at <a href="Notre%20Dame%20of%20Paris">Notre Dame of Paris</a>, and the founder of the <a href="Abbey%20of%20St.%20Victor%2C%20Paris">Abbey of St. Victor, Paris</a>.

The beginnings of <a href="Clairvaux%20Abbey">Clairvaux Abbey</a> were trying and painful. The regime was so austere that Bernard became ill, and only the influence of his friend William of Champeaux and the authority of the <a href="Chapter%20%28religion%29">general chapter</a> could make him mitigate the austerities. The monastery, however, made rapid progress. Disciples flocked to it in great numbers and put themselves under the direction of Bernard. The reputation of his holiness soon attracted 130 new monks, including his own father. His father and all his brothers entered Clairvaux to pursue religious life, leaving only Humbeline, his sister, in the secular world. She, with the consent of her husband, soon took the veil in the <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> <a href="nunnery">nunnery</a> of <a href="Jully-les-Nonnains">Jully-les-Nonnains</a>. <a href="Gerard%20of%20Clairvaux">Gerard of Clairvaux</a>, Bernard's older brother, became the <a href="Obedientiaries">cellarer</a> of Citeaux. The abbey became too small for its members and it was necessary to send out bands to found new houses. In 1118 <a href="Trois-Fontaines%20Abbey">Trois-Fontaines Abbey</a> was founded in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Ch%C3%A2lons">diocese of Châlons</a>; in 1119 <a href="Fontenay%20Abbey">Fontenay Abbey</a> in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Autun">Diocese of Autun</a>; and in 1121 <a href="Foigny%20Abbey">Foigny Abbey</a> near <a href="Vervins">Vervins</a>, in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Laon">diocese of Laon</a>. In addition to these victories, Bernard also had his trials. During an absence from Clairvaux, the Grand Prior of the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Cluny">Abbey of Cluny</a> went to Clairvaux and enticed away Bernard's cousin, <a href="Robert%20of%20Ch%C3%A2tillon">Robert of Châtillon</a>. This was the occasion of the longest and most emotional of Bernard's letters.
In the year 1119, Bernard was present at the first general chapter of the order convoked by Stephen of Cîteaux. Though not yet 30 years old, Bernard was listened to with the greatest attention and respect, especially when he developed his thoughts upon the revival of the primitive spirit of regularity and fervour in all the monastic orders. It was this general chapter that gave definitive form to the constitutions of the order and the regulations of the "Charter of Charity", which <a href="Pope%20Callixtus%20II">Pope Callixtus II</a> confirmed on 23 December 1119. In 1120, Bernard wrote his first work, ', and his homilies which he entitled '. The monks of the abbey of Cluny were unhappy to see Cîteaux take the lead role among the religious orders of the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason, the <a href="Black%20Monks">Black Monks</a> attempted to make it appear that the rules of the new order were impracticable. At the solicitation of William of St. Thierry, Bernard defended the order by publishing his "Apology" which was divided into two parts. In the first part, he proved himself innocent of the charges of Cluny and in the second he gave his reasons for his counterattacks. He protested his profound esteem for the Benedictines of Cluny whom he declared he loved equally as well as the other religious orders. <a href="Peter%20the%20Venerable">Peter the Venerable</a>, <a href="abbot%20of%20Cluny">abbot of Cluny</a>, answered Bernard and assured him of his great admiration and sincere friendship. In the meantime Cluny established a reform, and <a href="Abbot%20Suger">Abbot Suger</a>, the minister of <a href="Louis%20VI%20of%20France">Louis VI of France</a>, was converted by the "Apology" of Bernard. He hastened to terminate his worldly life and restore discipline in his monastery. The zeal of Bernard extended to the bishops, the clergy, and lay people. Bernard's letter to the <a href="archbishop%20of%20Sens">archbishop of Sens</a> was seen as a real treatise, ""De Officiis Episcoporum."" About the same time he wrote his work on "Grace and Free Will".

In the year 1128 AD, Bernard participated in the <a href="Council%20of%20Troyes">Council of Troyes</a>, which had been convoked by <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20II">Pope Honorius II</a>, and was presided over by Cardinal <a href="Matthew%20of%20Albano">Matthew of Albano</a>. The purpose of this council was to settle certain disputes of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Paris">bishops of Paris</a>, and regulate other matters of the <a href="Church%20of%20France">Church of France</a>. The bishops made Bernard secretary of the council, and charged him with drawing up the synodal statutes. After the council, the <a href="bishop%20of%20Verdun">bishop of Verdun</a> was deposed. It was at this council that Bernard traced the outlines of the Rule of the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a> who soon became the ideal of Christian nobility. Around this time, he praised them in his "<a href="Liber%20ad%20milites%20templi%20de%20laude%20novae%20militiae">Liber ad milites templi de laude novae militiae</a>".

Again reproaches arose against Bernard and he was denounced, even in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. He was accused of being a monk who meddled with matters that did not concern him. Cardinal Harmeric, on behalf of the pope, wrote Bernard a sharp letter of remonstrance stating, "It is not fitting that noisy and troublesome frogs should come out of their marshes to trouble the Holy See and the cardinals."

Bernard answered the letter by saying that, if he had assisted at the council, it was because he had been dragged to it by force. In his response Bernard wrote,

This letter made a positive impression on Harmeric, and in the <a href="Holy%20See">Vatican</a>.

Bernard's influence was soon felt in provincial affairs. He defended the rights of the Church against the encroachments of kings and princes, and recalled to their duty <a href="Henri%20Sanglier">Henri Sanglier</a>, archbishop of Sens and <a href="Stephen%20of%20Senlis">Stephen of Senlis</a>, bishop of Paris. On the death of Honorius II, which occurred on 14 February 1130, a <a href="Papal%20schism%20of%201130">schism</a> broke out in the Church by the election of two popes, <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Pope Innocent II</a> and Antipope Anacletus II. Innocent II, having been banished from Rome by Anacletus, took refuge in France. Louis VI convened a national council of the French bishops at <a href="%C3%89tampes">Étampes</a>, and Bernard, summoned there by consent of the bishops, was chosen to judge between the rival popes. He decided in favour of <a href="Innocent%20II">Innocent II</a>. This caused the pope to be recognized by all the great powers. He then went with him into Italy and reconciled <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a> with <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, and <a href="Milan">Milan</a> with the pope. The same year Bernard was again at the <a href="Council%20of%20Reims">Council of Reims</a> at the side of Innocent II. He then went to <a href="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a> where he succeeded for the time in detaching <a href="William%20X%2C%20Duke%20of%20Aquitaine">William X, Duke of Aquitaine</a>, from the cause of Anacletus.
In 1132, Bernard accompanied Innocent II into Italy, and at Cluny the pope abolished the dues which Clairvaux used to pay to that abbey. This action gave rise to a quarrel between the <a href="Cistercians">White Monks</a> and the Black Monks which lasted 20 years. In May of that year, the pope, supported by the army of Lothair III, entered Rome, but Lothair III, feeling himself too weak to resist the partisans of Anacletus, retired beyond the Alps, and Innocent sought refuge in Pisa in September 1133. Bernard had returned to France in June and was continuing the work of peacemaking which he had commenced in 1130. Towards the end of 1134, he made a second journey into Aquitaine, where William X had relapsed into schism. Bernard invited William to the Mass which he celebrated in the Church of La Couldre. At the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, he "admonished the Duke not to despise God as he did His servants". William yielded and the schism ended. Bernard went again to Italy, where <a href="Roger%20II%20of%20Sicily">Roger II of Sicily</a> was endeavouring to withdraw the Pisans from their allegiance to Innocent. He recalled the city of Milan to obedience to the pope as they had followed the deposed <a href="Anselm%20V%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Milan">Anselm V, Archbishop of Milan</a>. For this, he was offered, and he refused, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Milan">archbishopric of Milan</a>. He then returned to Clairvaux. Believing himself at last secure in his cloister, Bernard devoted himself with renewed vigour to the composition of the works which would win for him the title of "Doctor of the Church". He wrote at this time his sermons on the "<a href="Song%20of%20Songs">Song of Songs</a>". In 1137, he was again forced to leave his solitude by order of the pope to put an end to the quarrel between Lothair and Roger of Sicily. At the conference held at Palermo, Bernard succeeded in convincing Roger of the rights of Innocent II. He also silenced the final supporters who sustained the schism. Anacletus died of "grief and disappointment" in 1138, and with him the schism ended.

In 1139, Bernard assisted at the <a href="Second%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Second Council of the Lateran</a>, in which the surviving adherents of the schism were definitively condemned. About the same time, Bernard was visited at Clairvaux by <a href="Saint%20Malachy">Saint Malachy</a>, <a href="Primate%20of%20All%20Ireland">Primate of All Ireland</a>, and a very close friendship formed between them. Malachy wanted to become a Cistercian, but the pope would not give his permission. Malachy would die at Clairvaux in 1148.

Towards the close of the 11th century, a spirit of independence flourished within schools of <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="theology">theology</a>. This led for a time to the exaltation of human reason and rationalism. The movement found an ardent and powerful advocate in <a href="Peter%20Abelard">Peter Abelard</a>. Abelard's treatise on the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> had been condemned as heretical in 1121, and he was compelled to throw his own book into the fire. However, Abelard continued to develop his teachings, which were controversial in some quarters. Bernard, informed of this by <a href="William%20of%20St-Thierry">William of St-Thierry</a>, is said to have held a meeting with Abelard intending to persuade him to amend his writings, during which Abelard repented and promised to do so. But once out of Bernard's presence, he reneged. Bernard then denounced Abelard to the pope and cardinals of the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Curia</a>. Abelard sought a debate with Bernard, but Bernard initially declined, saying he did not feel matters of such importance should be settled by logical analyses. Bernard's letters to William of St-Thierry also express his apprehension about confronting the preeminent logician. Abelard continued to press for a public debate, and made his challenge widely known, making it hard for Bernard to decline. In 1141, at the urgings of Abelard, the archbishop of Sens called a council of bishops, where Abelard and Bernard were to put their respective cases so Abelard would have a chance to clear his name. Bernard lobbied the prelates on the evening before the debate, swaying many of them to his view. The next day, after Bernard made his opening statement, Abelard decided to retire without attempting to answer. The council found in favour of Bernard and their judgment was confirmed by the pope. Abelard submitted without resistance, and he retired to Cluny to live under the protection of Peter the Venerable, where he died two years later.

Bernard had occupied himself in sending bands of monks from his overcrowded monastery into Germany, Sweden, England, Ireland, Portugal, Switzerland, and Italy. Some of these, at the command of Innocent II, took possession of Tre Fontane Abbey, from which Eugene III would be chosen in 1145. Pope Innocent II died in the year 1143. His two successors, <a href="Pope%20Celestine%20II">Pope Celestine II</a> and <a href="Pope%20Lucius%20II">Pope Lucius II</a>, reigned only a short time, and then Bernard saw one of his disciples, Bernard of Pisa, and known thereafter as Eugene III, raised to the <a href="Chair%20of%20Saint%20Peter">Chair of Saint Peter</a>. Bernard sent him, at the pope's own request, various instructions which comprise the "pageRank.Book of Considerations," the predominating idea of which is that the reformation of the Church ought to commence with the sanctity of the pope. Temporal matters are merely accessories; the principles according to Bernard's work were that piety and meditation were to precede action.

Having previously helped end the schism within the Church, Bernard was now called upon to combat heresy. <a href="Henry%20of%20Lausanne">Henry of Lausanne</a>, a former <a href="Cluny%20Abbey">Cluniac</a> monk, had adopted the teachings of the Petrobrusians, followers of <a href="Peter%20of%20Bruys">Peter of Bruys</a> and spread them in a modified form after Peter's death. Henry of Lausanne's followers became known as Henricians. In June 1145, at the invitation of Cardinal <a href="Alberic%20of%20Ostia">Alberic of Ostia</a>, Bernard traveled in southern France. His preaching, aided by his ascetic looks and simple attire, helped doom the new sects. Both the Henrician and the Petrobrusian faiths began to die out by the end of that year. Soon afterwards, Henry of Lausanne was arrested, brought before the <a href="bishop%20of%20Toulouse">bishop of Toulouse</a>, and probably imprisoned for life. In a letter to the people of Toulouse, undoubtedly written at the end of 1146, Bernard calls upon them to extirpate the last remnants of the heresy. He also preached against <a href="Catharism">Catharism</a>.

News came at this time from the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> that alarmed <a href="Christendom">Christendom</a>. Christians had been defeated at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Edessa">Siege of Edessa</a> and most of the county had fallen into the hands of the <a href="Seljuq%20dynasty">Seljuk Turks</a>. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a> and the other <a href="Crusader%20states">Crusader states</a> were threatened with similar disaster. Deputations of the bishops of <a href="Armenian%20Kingdom%20of%20Cilicia">Armenia</a> solicited aid from the pope, and the King of France also sent ambassadors. In 1144 Eugene III commissioned Bernard to preach the Second Crusade and granted the same indulgences for it which <a href="Pope%20Urban%20II">Pope Urban II</a> had accorded to the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>.
There was at first virtually no popular enthusiasm for the crusade as there had been in 1095. Bernard found it expedient to dwell upon taking the cross as a potent means of gaining absolution for sin and attaining grace. On 31 March, with King <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII of France</a> present, he preached to an enormous crowd in a field at <a href="V%C3%A9zelay">Vézelay</a>.
James Meeker Ludlow describes the scene romantically in his book "The Age of the Crusades":

When Bernard was finished the crowd enlisted en masse; they supposedly ran out of cloth to make crosses. Bernard is said to have given his own outer garments to be cut up to make more. Unlike the First Crusade, the new venture attracted royalty, such as <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine, Queen of France</a>; <a href="Thierry%20of%20Alsace">Thierry of Alsace</a>, <a href="Count%20of%20Flanders">Count of Flanders</a>; <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20Champagne">Henry, the future Count of Champagne</a>; Louis's brother <a href="Robert%20I%20of%20Dreux">Robert I of Dreux</a>; <a href="Alphonse%20I%20of%20Toulouse">Alphonse I of Toulouse</a>; <a href="William%20II%20of%20Nevers">William II of Nevers</a>; <a href="William%20de%20Warenne%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey</a>; <a href="Hugh%20VII%20of%20Lusignan">Hugh VII of Lusignan</a>, <a href="Yves%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Soissons">Yves II, Count of Soissons</a>; and numerous other nobles and bishops. But an even greater show of support came from the common people. Bernard wrote to the pope a few days afterwards, "Cities and castles are now empty. There is not left one man to seven women, and everywhere there are widows to still-living husbands."

Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. <a href="Conrad%20III%20of%20Germany">Conrad III of Germany</a> and his nephew <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, received the cross from the hand of Bernard. Pope Eugenius came in person to France to encourage the enterprise. As in the First Crusade, the preaching led to attacks on <a href="Jews">Jews</a>; a fanatical French monk named <a href="Radulphe">Radulphe</a> was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a>, <a href="Worms%2C%20Germany">Worms</a>, and <a href="Speyer">Speyer</a>, with Radulphe claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. The <a href="archbishop%20of%20Cologne">archbishop of Cologne</a> and the <a href="archbishop%20of%20Mainz">archbishop of Mainz</a> were vehemently opposed to these attacks and asked Bernard to denounce them. This he did, but when the campaign continued, Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problems in person. He then found Radulphe in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.

The last years of Bernard's life were saddened by the failure of the Second Crusade he had preached, the entire responsibility for which was thrown upon him. Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ""pageRank.Book of Considerations."" There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.

Moved by his burning words, many Christians embarked for the Holy Land, but the crusade ended in miserable failure.

The death of his contemporaries served as a warning to Bernard of his own approaching end. The first to die was Suger in 1152, of whom Bernard wrote to Eugene III, "If there is any precious vase adorning the palace of the King of Kings it is the soul of the venerable Suger". Conrad III and his son Henry died the same year. From the beginning of the year 1153, Bernard felt his death approaching. The passing of Pope Eugenius had struck the fatal blow by taking from him one whom he considered his greatest friend and consoler. Bernard died at age sixty-three on 20 August 1153, after forty years spent in the cloister. He was buried at the Clairvaux Abbey, but after its dissolution in 1792 by the <a href="French%20Revolution">French revolutionary government</a>, his remains were transferred to <a href="Troyes%20Cathedral">Troyes Cathedral</a>.

Bernard was named a Doctor of the Church in 1830. At the 800th anniversary of his death, <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a> issued an encyclical on Bernard, "<a href="Doctor%20Mellifluus">Doctor Mellifluus</a>", in which he labeled him "The Last of the Fathers." Bernard did not reject human philosophy which is genuine philosophy, which leads to God; he differentiates between different kinds of knowledge, the highest being theological. The central elements of Bernard's Mariology are how he explained the <a href="virginity">virginity</a> of Mary, "the "Star of the Sea"", and her role as <a href="Mediatrix">Mediatrix</a>.

Bernard, like <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>, denied the doctrine of the <a href="Immaculate%20Conception%20of%20Mary">Immaculate Conception of Mary</a>. <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a> quotes Bernard several times in support of the doctrine of "<a href="Sola%20Fide">Sola Fide</a>", which <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> described as the article upon which the church stands or falls. Calvin also quotes him in setting forth his doctrine of a forensic alien righteousness, or as it is commonly called <a href="imputed%20righteousness">imputed righteousness</a>.

One day, to cool down his lustful temptation, Bernard threw himself into ice-cold water. Another time, while sleeping in an inn, a prostitute was introduced naked beside him, and he saved his chastity by running.

Many miracles were attributed to his intercession. One time he restored the power of speech to an old man that he might confess his sins before he died. Another time, an immense number of flies, that had infested the Church of Foigny, died instantly after the <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a> he made on them.

So great was his reputation that princes and <a href="Pope">Pope</a>s sought his advice, and even the enemies of the Church admired the holiness of his life and the greatness of his writings.

Bernard was instrumental in re-emphasizing the importance of "<a href="lectio%20divina">lectio divina</a>" and contemplation on Scripture within the Cistercian order. Bernard had observed that when "lectio divina" was neglected monasticism suffered. Bernard considered "lectio divina" and contemplation guided by the <a href="Holy%20Spirit%20%28Christianity%29">Holy Spirit</a> the keys to nourishing Christian spirituality.

Bernard "noted centuries ago: the people who are their own <a href="spiritual%20director">spiritual director</a>s have fools for disciples."

Bernard's theology and <a href="Mariology%28RC%29">Mariology</a> continue to be of major importance, particularly within the Cistercian and Trappist orders. Bernard led to the foundation of 163 monasteries in different parts of Europe. At his death, they numbered 343. His influence led Alexander III to launch reforms that would lead to the establishment of <a href="Canon%20law%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">canon law</a>. He was the first Cistercian monk placed on the <a href="calendar%20of%20saints">calendar of saints</a> and was <a href="canonized">canonized</a> by Alexander III 18 January 1174. <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VIII">Pope Pius VIII</a> bestowed on him the title "Doctor of the Church". He is labeled the "Mellifluous Doctor" for his eloquence. Cistercians honour him as the founder of the order because of the widespread activity which he gave to the order.

Saint Bernard's "<a href="Prayer%20to%20the%20Shoulder%20Wound%20of%20Jesus">Prayer to the Shoulder Wound of Jesus</a>" is often published in Catholic prayer books.

Bernard is <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a>'s last guide, in "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>", as he travels through the <a href="Empyrean">Empyrean</a>. Dante's choice appears to be based on Bernard's contemplative mysticism, his devotion to Mary, and his reputation for eloquence.

He is also the attributed author of the poems often translated in English hymnals as "<a href="O%20Sacred%20Head%2C%20Now%20Wounded">O Sacred Head, Now Wounded</a>" and "Jesus the Very Thought of Thee".

The <a href="Couvent%20et%20Basilique%20Saint-Bernard">Couvent et Basilique Saint-Bernard</a>, a collection of buildings dating from the 12th, 17th and 19th centuries, is dedicated to Bernard and stands in his birthplace of <a href="Fontaine-l%C3%A8s-Dijon">Fontaine-lès-Dijon</a>.

The modern critical edition is "" (1957–1977), edited by <a href="Jean%20Leclercq%20%28monk%29">Jean Leclercq</a>.

Bernard's works include:


His sermons are also numerous:

Many letters, treatises, and other works, falsely attributed to him survive, and are now referred to as works by pseudo-Bernard. These include:

Bishkek

Bishkek (, "Bişkek", بىشکەک; ; ), formerly Pishpek and Frunze, is the capital and largest city of <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> (Kyrgyz Republic). Bishkek is also the administrative center of the <a href="Chuy%20Region">Chuy Region</a>. The province surrounds the city, although the city itself is not part of the province, but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.

Post-Soviet research suggests the name derives from a <a href="Kyrgyz%20language">Kyrgyz</a> word for a churn used to make fermented mare's milk (<a href="kumis">kumis</a>), the Kyrgyz national drink – although not all sources agree on this.
In 1825 <a href="Khokand">Khokand</a> authorities established the fortress of "Pishpek" in order to control local caravan-routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz tribes. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz, Russian forces led by Colonel Zimmermann destroyed the fortress. 
In 1868 a Russian settlement was established on the site of the fortress under its original name, "Pishpek". It lay within the General Governorship of <a href="Russian%20Turkestan">Russian Turkestan</a> and its <a href="Semirechye%20Oblast">Semirechye Oblast</a>.

In 1925 the <a href="Kara-Kirghiz%20Autonomous%20Oblast">Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast</a> was established in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek to its capital. In 1926 the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> renamed the city as "Frunze", after the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> military leader <a href="Mikhail%20Frunze">Mikhail Frunze</a> (1885–1925), who was born there. In 1936, the city of Frunze became the capital of the <a href="Kirghiz%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic</a>, during the final stages of the <a href="national%20delimitation%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">national delimitation in the Soviet Union</a>.

In 1991 the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital's name to "Bishkek".

Bishkek is situated at an altitude of about , just off the northern fringe of the <a href="Kyrgyz%20Ala-Too">Kyrgyz Ala-Too</a> range, an extension of the <a href="Tian%20Shan">Tian Shan</a> mountain range. These mountains rise to a height of and provide a spectacular backdrop to the city. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>. The <a href="Chui%20River">Chui River</a> drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the <a href="Turkestan-Siberia%20Railway">Turkestan-Siberia Railway</a> by a <a href="spur%20line">spur line</a>.

Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous <a href="Khrushchyovka">Soviet-style</a> apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards. There are also thousands of smaller privately built houses – mostly outside the city center. Streets follow a grid pattern, with most flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels which water the innumerable trees that provide shade in the hot summers.

Originally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the <a href="Sogdians">Sogdians</a>) on one of the branches of the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> through the <a href="Tian%20Shan">Tian Shan</a> range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbek</a> khan of <a href="Kokhand">Kokhand</a> with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule, the fortress was led by Atabek, the Datka.

In 1860, the fort was conquered and razed by the military forces of Colonel Zimmermann when <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Tsarist Russia</a> annexed the area. Colonel <a href="Zimmermann">Zimmermann</a> rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and put field Poruchik Titov as head of a new Russian garrison. The site was redeveloped from 1877 onward by the Russian government, which encouraged the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.

In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established <a href="Kara-Kirghiz%20Autonomous%20Oblast">Kirghiz ASSR</a> and was renamed "Frunze" after <a href="Mikhail%20Frunze">Mikhail Frunze</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Lenin's</a> close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201905">revolutions of 1905</a> and <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">1917</a> and during the <a href="Russian%20civil%20war">Russian civil war</a> of the early 1920s.

The early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan that threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29">breakup of the Soviet Union</a>. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek's population were ethnic <a href="Russian%20people">Russians</a>. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population, and about in 2011.

Today, Bishkek is a modern city with many restaurants and cafes, and with many second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. However, streets and sidewalks have fallen into disrepair since the 1990s. At the same time, Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.

Bishkek is also the country's financial center, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks headquartered there. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or now operate on a much reduced scale. One of Bishkek's largest employment centers today is the <a href="Dordoy%20Bazaar">Dordoy Bazaar open market</a>, where many of the Chinese goods imported to <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">CIS</a> countries are sold.

Though the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating to prehistorical times. There are also sites from the <a href="Greco-Buddhist">Greco-Buddhist</a> period, the period of <a href="Nestorian%20Church">Nestorian</a> influence, the era of the Central Asian "<a href="khanate">khanate</a>s", and the Soviet period.

The central part of the city is laid out on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east–west Chui Avenue (<a href="Chuy%20Prospekti">Chuy Prospekti</a>), named after the region's <a href="Chui%20River">main river</a>. In the Soviet era, it was called <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Lenin</a> Avenue. Along or near it are many of the most important government buildings and universities. These include the <a href="Kyrgyz%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Academy of Sciences</a> compound. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as <a href="Deng%20Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a> Avenue.

The main north–south street is <a href="Yusup%20Abdrakhmanov">Yusup Abdrakhmanov</a> Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, Sovietskaya Street. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centers are located along it, and in the north it provides access to <a href="Dordoy%20Bazaar">Dordoy Bazaar</a>.

Erkindik ("Freedom") Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard, named after a Communist revolutionary, <a href="Felix%20Edmundovich%20Dzerzhinsky">Felix Dzerzhinsky</a>, and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.

An important east–west street is Jibek Jolu ('<a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about north of it, and is part of the main east–west road of <a href="Chui%20Province">Chui Province</a>. Both the eastern and western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.

There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). It is the only Catholic cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.


The <a href="Dordoy%20Bazaar">Dordoy Bazaar</a>, just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.

The <a href="Kyrgyz%20Ala-Too">Kyrgyz Ala-Too</a> mountain range, some away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the <a href="Ala%20Archa%20National%20Park">Ala Archa National Park</a> is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.

Bishkek has a dry summer <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "<a href="Humid%20continental%20climate%23Hot/warm%20summer%20subtype">Dsa</a>"). Average <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> is around per year. Average daily high temperatures range from in January to about during July. The summer months are dominated by dry periods, punctuated by the occasional <a href="thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a>, which produces strong gusty winds and rare <a href="dust%20storm">dust storm</a>s. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary and protection from much of the damaging weather, as does the smaller mountain chain which runs north-west to south-east. In the winter months, sparse <a href="Winter%20storm">snow storms</a> and frequent heavy <a href="fog">fog</a> are the dominating features. There are sometimes temperature inversions, during which the fog can last for days at a time.

Bishkek is the most populated city in Kyrgyzstan. Its population, estimated in 2015, was 937,400. From the foundation of the city to the mid-1990s, ethnic Russians and other peoples of European descent (Ukrainians, Tatars, Germans) comprised the majority of the city's population. According to the 1970 census, the ethnic Kyrgyz were only 12.3%, while whites were more than 80% of Frunze population. Now Bishkek is a predominantly Kyrgyz city, with around 66% of its residents Kyrgyz, while European peoples make up less than 20% of the population. Despite this fact, Russian is the main language while Kyrgyz continues losing ground especially among the younger generations 

Emissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010. Among all cities in Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest, occasionally exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city center. For example, concentrations of <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> occasionally exceed maximum allowable limits by a factor of four.

Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies with the Kyrgyz State Agency of Hydrometeorology. There are seven air quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>.

Bishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the <a href="Kyrgyzstani%20som">som</a>. The som's value fluctuates regularly, but averaged around 61 som per U.S. dollar as of February 2015. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural, and agricultural products are sometimes bartered in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market style venue. In most of the downtown area there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets and malls. Sought after goods include hand-crafted artisan pieces, such as statues, carvings, paintings and many nature-based sculptures.

As with many cities in Post-Soviet states, housing in Bishkek has undergone extensive changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union. While housing was formerly distributed to citizens in the Soviet-era, housing in Bishkek has since become privatized.

Though single family houses are slowly becoming more popular, the majority of the residents live in Soviet-era apartments. Despite the Kyrgyz economy experiencing growth, increases in available housing has been slow with very little new construction. As a result of this growing prosperity and the lack of new formal housing, prices has been rising significantly – doubling from 2001 to 2002.

Those unable to afford the high price of housing within Bishkek, notably internal migrants from rural villages and small provincial towns often have to resort to informal squatter settlements on the outskirts of the city. These settlements are estimated to house 400,000 people or about 30 percent of Bishkek’s population. While many of the settlements have lacked basic necessities such as electricity and running water, recently there has been a push by the local government to provide these services.

Local government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office. <a href="Askarbek%20Salymbekov">Askarbek Salymbekov</a> was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, after which his deputy, <a href="Arstanbek%20Nogoev">Arstanbek Nogoev</a>, took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President <a href="Kurmanbek%20Bakiyev">Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister <a href="Daniar%20Usenov">Daniar Usenov</a>. In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways <a href="Nariman%20Tuleyev">Nariman Tuleyev</a> was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010. From April 2010 to February 2011 Isa Omurkulov, also a former head of the Kyrgyz Railways, was an interim mayor, and from 4 February 2011 to 14 December 2013 he was re-elected the mayor of Bishkek. Kubanychbek Kulmatov was nominated for election by parliamentary group of <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Kyrgyzstan">Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan</a> in city kenesh, and he was elected as a new mayor on 15 January 2014, and stepped down on 9 February 2016 
The new major Albek Sabirbekovich Ibraimov was also nominated for election by parliamentary group of Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan in city kenesh, and he was elected by Bishkek City Kenesh on 27 February 2016.

Bishkek city covers and is administered separately and not part of any region. Besides the city proper, one <a href="urban-type%20settlement">urban-type settlement</a> and one village are administered by the city: <a href="Chong-Aryk%2C%20Bishkek">Chong-Aryk</a> and <a href="Orto-Say">Orto-Say</a>. The city is divided into 4 districts: <a href="Birinchi%20May%20District%2C%20Bishkek">Birinchi May</a>, <a href="Lenin%20District%2C%20Bishkek">Lenin</a>, <a href="Oktyabr%20District%2C%20Bishkek">Oktyabr</a> and <a href="Sverdlov%20District%2C%20Bishkek">Sverdlov</a>. Chong-Aryk and Orto-Say are part of Lenin District.

Bishkek is home to <a href="Spartak%20Stadium%20%28Kyrgyzstan%29">Spartak</a>, the largest <a href="association%20football">football</a> stadium in Kyrgyzstan and the only one eligible to host international matches. Several Bishkek-based football teams play on this pitch, including six-time Kyrgyzstan League champions, <a href="Dordoi-Dynamo%20Naryn">Dordoi-Dynamo</a>.

Bishkek hosted the <a href="2014%20IIHF%20Challenge%20Cup%20of%20Asia%20%E2%80%93%20Division%20I">2014 IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia – Division I</a>.

Educational institutions in Bishkek include:
In addition, the following international schools serve the expatriate community in Bishkek:

Public transportation includes buses, electric <a href="trolley%20bus">trolley bus</a>es, and public vans (known in Russian as "<a href="marshrutka">marshrutka</a>"). The first bus and trolley bus services in Bishkek were introduced in 1934 and 1951, respectively.

Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.

There is no subway in Bishkek, but the city is considering designing and building a light rail system ().

There are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibuses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as <a href="Kant%2C%20Kyrgyzstan">Kant</a>, <a href="Tokmok">Tokmok</a>, <a href="Kemin">Kemin</a>, <a href="Issyk%20Ata">Issyk Ata</a>, or the <a href="Korday">Korday</a> border crossing.

Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to <a href="Almaty">Almaty</a> (the largest city in neighboring <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>) and <a href="Kashgar">Kashgar</a>, China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller number run from the Eastern Station.

The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibuses to suburban towns in all directions (from <a href="Sokuluk">Sokuluk</a> in the west to <a href="Tokmok">Tokmak</a> in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia.

, the Bishkek railway station sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.

There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia (<a href="Novosibirsk">Novosibirsk</a> and <a href="Novokuznetsk">Novokuznetsk</a>), via <a href="Almaty">Almaty</a>, over the <a href="Turksib">Turksib</a> route, and to <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a> (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via <a href="Astana">Astana</a>. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a before they enter the main <a href="Turksib">Turksib</a> line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the <a href="Shu%2C%20Jambyl">Shu</a> junction—a distance of some by rail, and less than half of that by road.

The city is served by <a href="Manas%20International%20Airport">Manas International Airport</a> (<a href="International%20Air%20Transport%20Association">IATA</a> code FRU), located approximately northwest of the city centre, and readily reachable by taxi.

In 2002, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an <a href="Manas%20Air%20Base">air base</a> for its military operations in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>. Russia subsequently (2003) established an air base of its own (<a href="Kant%20%28air%20base%29">Kant Air Base</a>) near <a href="Kant%2C%20Kyrgyzstan">Kant</a>, some east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, <a href="Hosni%20Mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a>, later became president of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>.


In the video game , GLA forces held this city, capital of a unified <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>. They reinforced their forces by railways connected to other areas and locals enraged at the Chinese presence in the area. Black Lotus and her strike team had to destroy the bridge and a sports stadium before they were overrun. Due to the nature of the mission, a covert operation, they were reduced to minimal strength.

<a href="Sister%20cities">Sister cities</a> of Bishkek include:

Braveheart

Braveheart is a 1995 American <a href="epic%20film">epic</a> <a href="war%20film">war film</a> directed by and starring <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>. Gibson portrays <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a>, a late 13th-century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the <a href="First%20War%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">First War of Scottish Independence</a> against King <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I of England</a>. The story is inspired by <a href="Blind%20Harry">Blind Harry</a>'s <a href="epic%20poetry">epic poem</a> "<a href="The%20Wallace%20%28poem%29">The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace</a>" and was <a href="film%20adaptation">adapted</a> for the screen by <a href="Randall%20Wallace">Randall Wallace</a>.

The film was nominated for ten <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>s at the <a href="68th%20Academy%20Awards">68th Academy Awards</a> and won five: <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Makeup%20and%20Hairstyling">Best Makeup</a>, and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Sound%20Editing">Best Sound Editing</a>.

In 1280, <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">King Edward "Longshanks"</a> invades and conquers <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> following the death of <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">Alexander III of Scotland</a>, who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father and brother, and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle, where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including "Prima Nocte". Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough, and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to <a href="Action%20at%20Lanark">slaughter the English garrison</a> in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.

Longshanks orders his son <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Prince Edward</a> to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stirling%20Bridge">Battle of Stirling Bridge</a> and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a>, the son of nobleman <a href="Robert%20de%20Brus%2C%206th%20Lord%20of%20Annandale">Robert the Elder</a> and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife <a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Isabella of France</a> to try to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction for the landing of another invasion force in Scotland.

After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan and Mornay, having been bribed by Longshanks, betray Wallace, causing the Scots to lose the <a href="Battle%20of%20Falkirk">battle</a>. As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, he is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert the Bruce, but filled with remorse, Bruce gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him that his bloodline will be destroyed upon his death as she is now pregnant with Wallace's child.

In London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being <a href="hanged%2C%20drawn%20and%20quartered">hanged, drawn and quartered</a>, Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, "Mercy", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, "Freedom!", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being <a href="decapitation">decapitated</a>, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him. Wallace then dies.

In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of <a href="Battle%20of%20Bannockburn">Bannockburn</a>, where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom.

Gibson's production company, <a href="Icon%20Productions">Icon Productions</a>, had difficulty raising enough money even if he were to star in the film. <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> was willing to fund the project on the condition that Gibson sign for another "<a href="Lethal%20Weapon">Lethal Weapon</a>" sequel, which he refused. <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> only agreed to American and Canadian distribution of "Braveheart" after <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> partnered for international rights. The production budget has been estimated by IMDb at US$72 million.

While the crew spent six weeks shooting on location in Scotland, the major battle scenes were shot in <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> using members of the <a href="Reserve%20Defence%20Forces">Irish Army Reserve</a> as extras. To lower costs, Gibson had the same extras, up to 1,600 in some scenes, portray both armies. The reservists had been given permission to grow beards and swapped their military uniforms for medieval garb.

"Braveheart" was shot in the <a href="anamorphic%20format">anamorphic format</a> with <a href="Panavision">Panavision</a> C- and E-Series lenses.

Gibson toned down the film's battle scenes to avoid an <a href="NC-17">NC-17</a> rating from the <a href="MPAA">MPAA</a>; the final version was rated R for "brutal <a href="medieval%20warfare">medieval warfare</a>".

The score was composed and conducted by <a href="James%20Horner">James Horner</a> and performed by the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>. It is Horner's second of three collaborations with <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> as director. The score has gone on to be one of the most commercially successful soundtracks of all time. It received considerable acclaim from film critics and audiences and was nominated for a number of awards, including the <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>, <a href="Saturn%20Award">Saturn Award</a>, <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">BAFTA Award</a>, and <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>.

On its opening weekend, "Braveheart" grossed $9,938,276 in the United States and $75.6 million in its box office run in the U.S. and Canada. Worldwide, the film grossed $210,409,945 and was the thirteenth highest-grossing film of 1995.

"Braveheart" met with generally positive reviews. Review aggregator <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave the film a score of 78% with an average score of 7.2/10. In his review, <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film 3.5 stars out of four, writing, "An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of "The Road Warrior"."

The film's depiction of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stirling%20Bridge">Battle of Stirling Bridge</a> was listed by <a href="CNN">CNN</a> as one of the best battles in cinema history.

In a 2005 poll by British film magazine "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>", "Braveheart" was No. 1 on their list of "The Top 10 Worst Pictures to Win Best Picture Oscar". Ironically, Empire Magazine's readers also voted "Braveheart" the best film of 1995.

The European premiere was on September 3, 1995 in Stirling.

In 1996, the year after the film was released, the annual three-day "Braveheart Conference" at <a href="Stirling%20Castle">Stirling Castle</a> attracted fans of "Braveheart", increasing the conference's attendance to 167,000 from 66,000 in the previous year. In the following year, research on visitors to the <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a> area indicated that 55% of the visitors had seen "Braveheart". Of visitors from outside Scotland, 15% of those who saw "Braveheart" said it influenced their decision to visit the country. Of all visitors who saw "Braveheart", 39% said the film influenced in part their decision to visit Stirling, and 19% said the film was one of the main reasons for their visit. In the same year, a tourism report said that the ""Braveheart" effect" earned Scotland ₤7 million to ₤15 million in tourist revenue, and the report led to various national organizations encouraging international film productions to take place in Scotland.

The film generated huge interest in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and in <a href="Scottish%20history">Scottish history</a>, not only around the world, but also in Scotland itself. Fans came from all over the world to see the places in Scotland where William Wallace fought, also to the places in Scotland and Ireland used as locations in the film. At a "Braveheart" Convention in 1997, held in <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a> the day after the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%23History">Scottish Devolution</a> vote and attended by 200 delegates from around the world, "Braveheart" author Randall Wallace, Seoras Wallace of the Wallace Clan, Scottish historian David Ross and Bláithín FitzGerald from Ireland gave lectures on various aspects of the film. Several of the actors also attended including James Robinson (Young William), Andrew Weir (Young Hamish), Julie Austin (the young bride) and Mhairi Calvey (Young Murron).

"Braveheart" was nominated for many awards during the 1995 Oscar season, though it was not viewed by many as a major contender such as "<a href="Apollo%2013%20%28film%29">Apollo 13</a>", "", "<a href="Leaving%20Las%20Vegas">Leaving Las Vegas</a>", "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility%20%28film%29">Sense and Sensibility</a>", and "<a href="The%20Usual%20Suspects">The Usual Suspects</a>". It wasn't until after the film won the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Golden Globe Award for Best Director</a> at the <a href="53rd%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards">53rd Golden Globe Awards</a> that it was viewed as a serious Oscar contender. When the nominations were announced for the <a href="68th%20Academy%20Awards">68th Academy Awards</a>, "Braveheart" received ten Academy Award nominations, and a month later, won five. In 2010, the "<a href="Independent%20Film%20%26amp%3B%20Television%20Alliance">Independent Film & Television Alliance</a>" selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years


<a href="Lin%20Anderson">Lin Anderson</a>, author of "Braveheart: From Hollywood To Holyrood", credits the film with playing a significant role in affecting the <a href="Scottish%20political%20landscape">Scottish political landscape</a> in the mid to late 1990s.

In 1997, a 12-ton <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> statue depicting Mel Gibson as William Wallace in "Braveheart" was placed in the car park of the <a href="Wallace%20Monument">Wallace Monument</a> near <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The statue, which was the work of Tom Church, a <a href="Stonemasonry">monumental mason</a> from <a href="Brechin">Brechin</a>, included the word "Braveheart" on Wallace's shield. The installation became the cause of much controversy; one local resident stated that it was wrong to "desecrate the main memorial to Wallace with a lump of crap". In 1998, someone wielding a hammer vandalized the statue's face. After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed, as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned. The statue was described as "among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland". In 2008, the statue was returned to its sculptor to make room for a new visitor centre being built at the foot of the Wallace Monument.

Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged <a href="Blind%20Harry">Blind Harry</a>'s 15th century <a href="epic%20poem">epic poem</a> "The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie" as a major inspiration for the film. In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, "Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart." Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film that are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the <a href="Barns%20of%20Ayr">hanging of Scottish nobles</a> at the start), there are large parts that are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella).

Elizabeth Ewan describes "Braveheart" as a film that "almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure". The "brave heart" refers in Scottish history to that of <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a>, and an attribution by <a href="William%20Edmondstoune%20Aytoun">William Edmondstoune Aytoun</a>, in his poem "Heart of Bruce", to <a href="Sir%20James%20the%20Good">Sir James the Good</a> Douglas: "Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!", prior to Douglas' demise at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Teba">Battle of Teba</a> in <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.

Sharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of <a href="belted%20plaid">belted plaid</a> by Wallace and his men. In that period "no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone <a href="kilt">kilt</a>s of any kind)." Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not "in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film". She compares the inaccuracy to "a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around." "The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate—in short, just about nothing is accurate." The belted plaid ("feileadh mór léine") was not introduced until the 16th century. Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace's "farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with <a href="woad">woad</a> (1,000 years too late) running amok in a <a href="tartan">tartan</a> kilt (500 years too early)." 

Irish historian Seán Duffy remarked "the <a href="battle%20of%20Stirling%20Bridge">battle of Stirling Bridge</a> could have done with a bridge." 

In 2009, the film was second on a list of "most historically inaccurate movies" in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>". In the humorous non-fictional historiography "An Utterly Impartial History of Britain" (2007), author <a href="John%20O%27Farrell%20%28author%29">John O'Farrell</a> notes that "Braveheart" could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a "<a href="Plasticine">Plasticine</a> dog" had been inserted in the film and the title changed to "William <a href="Wallace%20and%20Gromit">Wallace and Gromit</a>".

In the DVD audio commentary of "Braveheart", Mel Gibson acknowledges many of the historical inaccuracies but defends his choices as director, noting that the way events were portrayed in the film was much more "cinematically compelling" than the historical fact or conventional mythos.

<a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward Longshanks</a>, King of England, is shown invoking "<a href="Droit%20du%20seigneur">Jus primae noctis</a>", allowing the Lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serfs' maiden daughters on their wedding nights. Critical medieval scholarship regards this supposed right as a myth, "the simple reason why we are dealing with a myth here rests in the surprising fact that practically all writers who make any such claims have never been able or willing to cite any trustworthy source, if they have any."

The film suggests Scotland had been under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace’s childhood, and in the run-up to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Falkirk">Battle of Falkirk</a> Wallace says to the younger Bruce, “[W]e'll have what none of us have ever had before, a country of our own.” In fact Scotland had been <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence%23Background">invaded by England</a> only the year before Wallace's rebellion; prior to the death of <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">King Alexander III</a> it had been a fully separate kingdom.

As <a href="John%20Shelton%20Lawrence">John Shelton Lawrence</a> and <a href="Robert%20Jewett">Robert Jewett</a> write, "Because [William] Wallace is one of Scotland's most important national heroes and because he lived in the very distant past, much that is believed about him is probably the stuff of legend. But there is a factual strand that historians agree to", summarized from Scots scholar <a href="Matt%20Ewart">Matt Ewart</a>:
<a href="Canitz">A.E. Christa Canitz</a> writes about the historical William Wallace further: "[He] was a younger son of the Scottish gentry, usually accompanied by his own chaplain, well-educated, and eventually, having been appointed <a href="Guardian%20of%20Scotland">Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland</a>, engaged in diplomatic correspondence with the <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic cities</a> of <a href="Free%20City%20of%20L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a> and <a href="History%20of%20Hamburg">Hamburg</a>". She finds that in "Braveheart", "any hint of his descent from the lowland gentry (i.e., the lesser nobility) is erased, and he is presented as an economically and politically marginalized Highlander and 'a farmer'—as one with the common peasant, and with a strong spiritual connection to the land which he is destined to liberate."

<a href="Colin%20McArthur">Colin McArthur</a> writes that "Braveheart" "constructs Wallace as a kind of modern, <a href="nationalist">nationalist</a> <a href="guerrilla">guerrilla</a> leader in a period half a millennium before the appearance of nationalism on the historical stage as a concept under which disparate classes and interests might be mobilised within a nation state." Writing about "Braveheart"s "omissions of verified historical facts", McArthur notes that Wallace made "overtures to Edward I seeking less severe treatment after his defeat at Falkirk", as well as "the well-documented fact of Wallace's having resorted to <a href="conscription">conscription</a> and his willingness to hang those who refused to serve." Canitz posits that depicting "such lack of class solidarity" as the conscriptions and related hangings "would contaminate the movie's image of Wallace as the morally irreproachable "<a href="primus%20inter%20pares">primus inter pares</a>" among his peasant fighters."

<a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Isabella of France</a> is shown having an affair with Wallace after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Falkirk">Battle of Falkirk</a>. She later tells Edward I she is pregnant, implying that her son, <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>, was a product of the affair. In reality, Isabella was three years old and living in France at the time of the Battle of Falkirk, was not married to Edward II until he was already king, and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died.

<a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a> did change sides between the Scots loyalists and the <a href="England">English</a> more than once in the earlier stages of the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a>, but he never betrayed Wallace directly, and he probably did not fight on the English side at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Falkirk">Battle of Falkirk</a> (although this claim does appear in a few medieval sources). Later, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bannockburn">Battle of Bannockburn</a> was not a spontaneous battle; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years. His title before becoming king was <a href="Earl%20of%20Carrick">Earl of Carrick</a>, not Earl of Bruce.

The actual Edward I was ruthless and temperamental, but the film exaggerates his character for effect. Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Castile">Eleanor of Castile</a>, and as a religious man he gave generously to charity. The film's scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Also, Edward died on campaign two years after Wallace's execution, not in bed at his home.

The depiction of the future <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward II</a> as an <a href="effeminate">effeminate</a> homosexual drew accusations of <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a> against Gibson. The actual Edward II, who fathered five children by two different women, was rumoured to have had sexual affairs with men, including <a href="Piers%20Gaveston%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Piers Gaveston</a>, on whom the Prince's male lover Phillip was loosely based.

Gibson defended his depiction of Prince Edward as weak and ineffectual, saying:
In response to Longshanks's murder of the Prince's male lover Phillip, Gibson replied: "The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody."
Gibson asserted that the reason Longshanks kills his son's lover is because the king is a "<a href="Psychopathy">psychopath</a>". Gibson expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers would laugh at this murder.

"MacGregors from the next glen" joining Wallace shortly after the <a href="action%20at%20Lanark">action at Lanark</a> is dubious, since it is questionable whether <a href="Clan%20Gregor">Clan Gregor</a> existed at that stage, and when they did emerge their traditional home was <a href="Glen%20Orchy">Glen Orchy</a>, some distance from Lanark.

Wallace did win an important victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stirling%20Bridge">Battle of Stirling Bridge</a>, but the version in "Braveheart" is highly inaccurate, as it was filmed without a bridge (and without <a href="Andrew%20Moray">Andrew Moray</a>, joint commander of the Scots army, who was fatally injured in the battle). Later, Wallace did carry out a large-scale raid into the north of England, but he did not get as far south as York, nor did he kill Longshanks' nephew. (However this was not as wide of the mark as Blind Harry, who has Wallace making it as far south as <a href="St.%20Albans">St. Albans</a>, and only refraining from attacking London after the English queen came out to meet him.) Edward's nephew <a href="John%20of%20Brittany%2C%20Earl%20of%20Richmond">John of Brittany</a> did take part in the Wars of Scottish Independence, but he was not killed at York.

The "Irish conscripts" at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Falkirk">Battle of Falkirk</a> are also unhistorical; there were no Irish troops at Falkirk (although many of the English army were actually <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a>), and it is anachronistic to refer to conscripts in the Middle Ages (although there were <a href="feudal">feudal</a> levies).

The two-handed long swords used by Gibson in the film were not in wide use in the period. A one-handed sword and shield would be more accurate.

Sections of the English media accused the film of harbouring <a href="Anglophobia">Anglophobia</a>. "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" called it "<a href="Xenophobia">xenophobic</a>", and <a href="John%20Sutherland%20%28author%29">John Sutherland</a> writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" stated that: ""Braveheart" gave full rein to a toxic Anglophobia".

In "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", MacArthur said "the political effects are truly pernicious. It’s a xenophobic film." Ian Burrell of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" has noted, "The "Braveheart" phenomenon, a Hollywood-inspired rise in <a href="Scottish%20nationalism">Scottish nationalism</a>, has been linked to a rise in anti-English prejudice".

Brian Aldiss

Brian Wilson Aldiss, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a> (; 18 August 1925 – 19 August 2017) was an <a href="English%20people">English</a> writer and <a href="anthologies">anthologies</a> editor, best known for <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> novels and short stories. His byline reads either Brian W. Aldiss or simply Brian Aldiss, except for occasional pseudonyms during the mid-1960s.

Greatly influenced by science fiction pioneer <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, Aldiss was a vice-president of the international <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells%20Society">H. G. Wells Society</a>. He was (with <a href="Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29">Harry Harrison</a>) co-president of the <a href="Birmingham%20Science%20Fiction%20Group">Birmingham Science Fiction Group</a>. Aldiss was named a Grand Master by the <a href="Science%20Fiction%20Writers%20of%20America">Science Fiction Writers of America</a> in 2000 and inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. He received two <a href="Hugo%20Awards">Hugo Awards</a>, one <a href="Nebula%20Award">Nebula Award</a>, and one <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell%20Memorial%20Award">John W. Campbell Memorial Award</a>. He wrote the short story "<a href="Super-Toys%20Last%20All%20Summer%20Long">Super-Toys Last All Summer Long</a>" (1969), the basis for the <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>-developed <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> film "<a href="A.I.%20Artificial%20Intelligence">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</a>" (2001). Aldiss was associated with the <a href="New%20Wave%20science%20fiction">British New Wave</a> of science fiction.

Aldiss was born on 18 August 1925, above his paternal grandfather's draper's shop in <a href="Dereham">Dereham</a>, <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. When Aldiss' grandfather died, his father, Bill (the younger of two sons), sold his share in the shop and the family left Dereham. Aldiss' mother, Dot, was the daughter of a builder. He had an older sister who was stillborn, and a younger sister. As a 3-year-old, Aldiss started to write stories which his mother would bind and put on a shelf. At the age of 6, he went to <a href="Framlingham%20College">Framlingham College</a> but moved to Devon and was sent to board at <a href="West%20Buckland%20School">West Buckland School</a> in <a href="Devon">Devon</a> in 1939 after the outbreak of the war. As a child he discovered the pulp magazine "<a href="Astounding%20Science%20Fiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a>", and read all the novels by <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> and <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>, and later <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>. In 1943, during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, he joined the <a href="Royal%20Signals">Royal Signals</a> and saw action in <a href="Burma">Burma</a>.

His Army experience inspired the Horatio Stubbs second and third books, "A Soldier Erect" and "A Rude Awakening", respectively.

After the war, he worked as a bookseller in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. He also wrote a number of short pieces for a booksellers' trade journal about life in a fictitious bookshop, which attracted the attention of Charles Monteith, an editor at the publisher <a href="Faber%20and%20Faber">Faber and Faber</a>. As a result, Faber and Faber published Aldiss' first book, "The Brightfount Diaries" (1955), a 200-page novel in diary form about the life of a sales assistant in a bookshop.

About this time he also began to write science fiction for various magazines. According to <a href="ISFDB">ISFDB</a>, his first <a href="speculative%20fiction">speculative fiction</a> in print was the <a href="short%20story">short story</a> "Criminal Record", published by <a href="John%20Carnell">John Carnell</a> in the July 1954 issue of "<a href="Science%20Fantasy%20%28magazine%29">Science Fantasy</a>". Several of his stories appeared in 1955, including three in monthly issues of "<a href="New%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">New Worlds</a>", a more important magazine also edited by Carnell.

In 1954, "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" newspaper ran a competition for a short story set in the year 2500. Aldiss' story "Not For An Age" was ranked third following a reader vote.

"The Brightfount Diaries" had been a minor success, and Faber asked Aldiss if he had any more writing they could look at with a view to publishing. Aldiss confessed to being a science fiction author, to the delight of the publishers, who had a number of <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fans</a> in high places, and so his first science fiction book was published, a collection of short stories entitled "Space, Time and Nathaniel" (Faber, 1957). By this time, his earnings from writing matched his wages in the bookshop, and he made the decision to become a full-time writer.

Aldiss led the voting for Most Promising New Author of 1958 at the next year's <a href="Worldcon">World Science Fiction Convention</a>, but finished behind "no award". He was elected president of the <a href="British%20Science%20Fiction%20Association">British Science Fiction Association</a> in 1960. He was the literary editor of the "Oxford Mail" newspaper from 1958 to 1969. Around 1964, he and long-time collaborator <a href="Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29">Harry Harrison</a> started the first ever journal of science fiction criticism, "Science Fiction Horizons", which during its brief span of two issues published articles and reviews by such authors as <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>, and featured a discussion among Aldiss, <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>, and <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a> in the first issue and an interview with <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a> in the second.
Besides his own writings, he had great success as an anthologist. For Faber he edited "Introducing SF", a collection of stories typifying various themes of science fiction, and "Best Fantasy Stories". In 1961, he edited an anthology of reprinted short science fiction for the British paperback publisher <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> under the title "Penguin Science Fiction". This was remarkably successful, went into numerous reprints, and was followed up by two further anthologies: "More Penguin Science Fiction" (1963) and "Yet More Penguin Science Fiction" (1964). The later anthologies enjoyed the same success as the first, and all three were eventually published together as "The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus" (1973), which also went into a number of reprints. In the 1970s, he produced several large collections of classic grand-scale science fiction, under the titles "Space Opera" (1974), "Space Odysseys" (1975), "Galactic Empires" (1976), "Evil Earths" (1976), and "Perilous Planets" (1978) which were quite successful. Around this time, he edited a large-format volume "Science Fiction Art" (1975), with selections of artwork from the magazines and <a href="pulp%20magazines">pulps</a>.

In response to the results from the <a href="space%20probe">planetary probes</a> of the 1960s and 1970s, which showed that <a href="Venus">Venus</a> was completely unlike the hot, tropical jungle usually depicted in science fiction, Aldiss and Harrison edited an anthology "<a href="Farewell%2C%20Fantastic%20Venus">Farewell, Fantastic Venus</a>!", reprinting stories based on the pre-probe ideas of Venus. He also edited, with Harrison, a series of anthologies "The Year's Best Science Fiction" (Nos. 1–9, 1968–1976).

Aldiss invented a form of extremely short story called the "<a href="minisaga">mini-saga</a>". "The Daily Telegraph" hosted a competition for the best mini-saga for several years, and Aldiss was the judge. He has edited several anthologies of the best mini'sagas.
Aldiss travelled to Yugoslavia, where he met fans in <a href="Ljubljana%2C%20Slovenia">Ljubljana, Slovenia</a> and published a travel book about Yugoslavia entitled "Cities and Stones" (1966), his only work in the genre. He published an alternative-history fantasy story, "The Day of the Doomed King" (1968), about Serbian kings in the Middle Ages, and wrote a novel called "<a href="The%20Malacia%20Tapestry">The Malacia Tapestry</a>", about an alternative Dalmatia.

In addition to a highly successful career as a writer, Aldiss was an accomplished artist. His first solo exhibition, "The Other Hemisphere", was held in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, August–September 2010, and the exhibition's centrepiece "Metropolis" (see figure) has since been released as a limited edition fine art print.(The exhibition title denotes the writer/artist's notion, "words streaming from one side of his brain inspiring images in what he calls 'the other hemisphere'.")

In 1948, Aldiss married Olive Fortescue, secretary to the owner of Sanders' bookseller's in Oxford, where he had worked since 1947. He had two children from his first marriage: Clive in 1955 and Caroline Wendy in 1957, but the marriage "finally collapsed" in 1959 and dissolved in 1965.

In 1965, he married his second wife, Margaret Manson, a Scottish woman and secretary to the editor of the "<a href="Oxford%20Mail">Oxford Mail</a>"; Aldiss was 40, and she 31. They lived in Oxford and had two children together, Tim and Charlotte. She died in 1997.

Aldiss died on 19 August 2017, the day after his 92nd birthday.

He was elected a Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Literature">Royal Society of Literature</a> in 1990.

Aldiss was the "Permanent Special Guest" at the annual International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts (ICFA) from 1989 through 2008. He was also the Guest of Honor at the conventions in 1986 and 1999.

The <a href="Science%20Fiction%20Writers%20of%20America">Science Fiction Writers of America</a> made him its 18th <a href="SFWA%20Grand%20Master">SFWA Grand Master</a> in 2000 and the <a href="EMP%20Museum%23Science%20Fiction%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame</a> inducted him in 2004.

He was awarded the title of Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) for services to literature in the <a href="2005%20Birthday%20Honours">2005 Birthday Honours</a> list.

In January 2007 he appeared on "<a href="Desert%20Island%20Discs">Desert Island Discs</a>". His choice of record to 'save' was "Old Rivers" sung by <a href="Walter%20Brennan">Walter Brennan</a>, his choice of book was <a href="John%20Heilpern">John Heilpern</a>'s biography of <a href="John%20Osborne">John Osborne</a>, and his luxury a banjo. The full selection of eight favourite records is on the BBC website.

On 1 July 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool in recognition of his contribution to literature. The Brian W Aldiss Archive at the University holds manuscripts from the period 1943–1995.

In 2013, Aldiss was recipient of the <a href="World%20Fantasy%20Convention%20Award">World Fantasy Convention Award</a> at the <a href="World%20Fantasy%20Convention">World Fantasy Convention</a> in Brighton, England.

Aldiss sat on the Council of <a href="the%20Society%20of%20Authors">the Society of Authors</a>.

He won two Hugo awards: in 1962 for the "Hothouse" series; and in 1987 for "Trillion Year Spree". Aldiss also won a Nebula award in 1965 for "The Saliva Tree: And Other Strange Growths".

Aldiss was the author of over 80 books and 300 short stories. he also wrote several volumes of poetry.

Battle of Jutland

The Battle of Jutland (, the Battle of <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a>) was a <a href="naval%20battle">naval battle</a> fought by the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> under Admiral <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">Sir John Jellicoe</a>, against the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>'s <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> under Vice-Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. The battle unfolded in extensive maneuvering and three main engagements (the battlecruiser action, the fleet action and the night action), from 31 May to 1 June 1916, off the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> coast of Denmark's <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> Peninsula. It was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s in that war. Jutland was the third <a href="fleet%20action">fleet action</a> between steel battleships, following the smaller but more decisive battles of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea (1904)</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Tsushima (1905)</a> during the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>. Jutland was the last major battle in world history fought primarily by battleships.

Germany's High Seas Fleet intended to lure out, trap, and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, as the German naval force was insufficient to openly engage the entire British fleet. This formed part of a larger strategy to break the British <a href="blockade%20of%20Germany">blockade of Germany</a> and to allow German naval vessels access to the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Great Britain's Royal Navy pursued a strategy of engaging and destroying the High Seas Fleet, thereby keeping German naval forces contained and away from Britain and her <a href="Sea%20lines%20of%20communication">shipping lanes</a>.

The Germans planned to use Vice-Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz Hipper</a>'s fast scouting group of five modern <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s to lure Vice-Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">Sir David Beatty's</a> battlecruiser squadrons into the path of the main German fleet. They stationed submarines in advance across the likely routes of the British ships. However, the British learned from signal intercepts that a major fleet operation was likely, so on 30 May Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty, passing over the locations of the German submarine <a href="Picket%20%28military%29">picket lines</a> while they were unprepared. The German plan had been delayed, causing further problems for their submarines, which had reached the limit of their endurance at sea.

On the afternoon of 31 May, Beatty encountered Hipper's battlecruiser force long before the Germans had expected. In a running battle, Hipper successfully drew the British <a href="vanguard">vanguard</a> into the path of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Beatty sighted the larger force and turned back towards the British main fleet, he had lost two battlecruisers from a force of six battlecruisers and four powerful battleships – though he had sped ahead of his battleships of <a href="5th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%23Battle%20of%20Jutland">5th Battle Squadron</a> earlier in the day, effectively losing them as an integral component for much of this opening action against the five ships commanded by Hipper. Beatty's withdrawal at the sight of the High Seas Fleet, which the British had not known were in the open sea, would reverse the course of the battle by drawing the German fleet in pursuit towards the British Grand Fleet. Between 18:30, when the sun was lowering on the western horizon, back-lighting the German forces, and nightfall at about 20:30, the two fleets – totalling 250 ships between them – directly engaged twice.

Fourteen British and eleven German ships sank, with great loss of life. After sunset, and throughout the night, Jellicoe manoeuvred to cut the Germans off from their base, hoping to continue the battle the next morning, but under the cover of darkness Scheer broke through the British light forces forming the rearguard of the Grand Fleet and returned to port.

Both sides claimed victory. The British lost more ships and twice as many sailors but succeeded in containing the German fleet. However, the British press criticised the Grand Fleet's failure to force a decisive outcome, while Scheer's plan of destroying a substantial portion of the British fleet also failed. Finally, the British strategy of denying Germany access to both the United Kingdom and the Atlantic did succeed, which was the British long-term goal. The Germans' "<a href="fleet%20in%20being">fleet in being</a>" continued to pose a threat, requiring the British to keep their battleships concentrated in the North Sea, but the battle reinforced the German policy of avoiding all fleet-to-fleet contact. At the end of 1916, after further unsuccessful attempts to reduce the Royal Navy's numerical advantage, the German Navy accepted that its surface ships had been successfully contained, subsequently turning its efforts and resources to <a href="unrestricted%20submarine%20warfare">unrestricted submarine warfare</a> and the destruction of Allied and neutral shipping, which - along with the <a href="Zimmermann%20Telegram">Zimmermann Telegram</a> - by April 1917 triggered the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a>'s declaration of war on Germany.

Subsequent reviews commissioned by the Royal Navy generated strong disagreement between supporters of Jellicoe and Beatty concerning the two admirals' performance in the battle. Debate over their performance and the significance of the battle continues to this day.

With 16 <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>-type battleships, compared with the Royal Navy's 28, the German <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> stood little chance of winning a head-to-head clash. The Germans therefore adopted a <a href="Defeat%20in%20detail">divide-and-conquer strategy</a>. They would stage raids into the North Sea and bombard the English coast, with the aim of luring out small British squadrons and pickets, which could then be destroyed by superior forces or submarines.

In January 1916, Admiral <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">von Pohl</a>, commander of the German fleet, fell ill. He was replaced by Scheer, who believed that the fleet had been used too defensively, had better ships and men than the British, and ought to take the war to them. According to Scheer, the German <a href="naval%20strategy">naval strategy</a> should be:

On 25 April 1916, a decision was made by the German admiralty to halt indiscriminate attacks by submarine on merchant shipping. This followed protests from neutral countries, notably the United States, that their nationals had been the victims of attacks. Germany agreed that future attacks would only take place in accord with internationally agreed prize rules, which required an attacker to give a warning and allow the crews of vessels time to escape, and not to attack neutral vessels at all. Scheer believed that it would not be possible to continue attacks on these terms, which took away the advantage of secret approach by submarines and left them vulnerable to even relatively small guns on the target ships. Instead, he set about deploying the submarine fleet against military vessels.

It was hoped that, following a successful German submarine attack, fast British escorts, such as <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, would be tied down by anti-submarine operations. If the Germans could catch the British in the expected locations, good prospects were thought to exist of at least partially redressing the balance of forces between the fleets. "After the British sortied in response to the raiding attack force", the Royal Navy's centuries-old instincts for aggressive action could be exploited to draw its weakened units towards the main German fleet under Scheer. The hope was that Scheer would thus be able to ambush a section of the British fleet and destroy it.

A plan was devised to station submarines offshore from British naval bases, and then stage some action that would draw out the British ships to the waiting submarines. The battlecruiser had been damaged in a previous engagement, but was due to be repaired by mid May, so an operation was scheduled for 17 May 1916. At the start of May, difficulties with condensers were discovered on ships of the third battleship squadron, so the operation was put back to 23 May. Ten submarines—, , , , , , , , , and —were given orders first to patrol in the central North Sea between 17 and 22 May, and then to take up waiting positions. "U-43" and "U-44" were stationed in the <a href="Pentland%20Firth">Pentland Firth</a>, which the Grand Fleet was likely to cross leaving <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, while the remainder proceeded to the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>, awaiting battlecruisers departing <a href="Rosyth%20Dockyard">Rosyth</a>. Each boat had an allocated area, within which it could move around as necessary to avoid detection, but was instructed to keep within it. During the initial North Sea patrol the boats were instructed to sail only north–south so that any enemy who chanced to encounter one would believe it was departing or returning from operations on the west coast (which required them to pass around the north of Britain). Once at their final positions, the boats were under strict orders to avoid premature detection that might give away the operation. It was arranged that a coded signal would be transmitted to alert the submarines exactly when the operation commenced: "Take into account the enemy's forces may be putting to sea".

Additionally, "UB-27" was sent out on 20 May with instructions to work its way into the Firth of Forth past <a href="Isle%20of%20May">May Island</a>. "U-46" was ordered to patrol the coast of <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a>, which had been chosen for the diversionary attack, but because of engine problems it was unable to leave port and "U-47" was diverted to this task. On 13 May, "U-72" was sent to lay mines in the Firth of Forth; on the 23rd, "U-74" departed to lay mines in the Moray Firth; and on the 24th, "U-75" was dispatched similarly west of the Orkney Islands. "UB-21" and "UB-22" were sent to patrol the Humber, where (incorrect) reports had suggested the presence of British warships. "U-22", "U-46" and "U-67" were positioned north of Terschelling to protect against intervention by British light forces stationed at Harwich.

On 22 May 1916, it was discovered that "Seydlitz" was still not watertight after repairs and would not now be ready until the 29th. The ambush submarines were now on station and experiencing difficulties of their own: visibility near the coast was frequently poor due to fog, and sea conditions were either so calm the slightest ripple, as from the periscope, could give away their position, or so rough as to make it very hard to keep the vessel at a steady depth. The British had become aware of unusual submarine activity, and had begun counter patrols that forced the submarines out of position. "UB-27" passed Bell Rock on the night of 23 May on its way into the Firth of Forth as planned, but was halted by engine trouble. After repairs it continued to approach, following behind merchant vessels, and reached Largo Bay on 25 May. There the boat became entangled in nets that fouled one of the propellers, forcing it to abandon the operation and return home. "U-74" was detected by four armed trawlers on 27 May and sunk south-east of Peterhead. "U-75" laid its mines off the Orkney Islands, which, although they played no part in the battle, were responsible later for sinking the cruiser carrying <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> (head of the army) on a mission to Russia on 5 June. "U-72" was forced to abandon its mission without laying any mines when an oil leak meant it was leaving a visible surface trail astern.

The Germans maintained a fleet of <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>s that they used for aerial reconnaissance and occasional bombing raids. The planned raid on Sunderland intended to use Zeppelins to watch out for the British fleet approaching from the north, which might otherwise surprise the raiders.

By 28 May, strong north-easterly winds meant that it would not be possible to send out the Zeppelins, so the raid again had to be postponed. The submarines could only stay on station until 1 June before their supplies would be exhausted and they had to return, so a decision had to be made quickly about the raid.

It was decided to use an alternative plan, abandoning the attack on Sunderland but instead sending a patrol of battlecruisers to the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a>, where it was likely they would encounter merchant ships carrying British cargo and British cruiser patrols. It was felt this could be done without air support, because the action would now be much closer to Germany, relying instead on cruiser and torpedo boat patrols for reconnaissance.

Orders for the alternative plan were issued on 28 May, although it was still hoped that last-minute improvements in the weather would allow the original plan to go ahead. The German fleet assembled in the <a href="Jade%20%28river%29">Jade River</a> and at <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> and was instructed to raise steam and be ready for action from midnight on 28 May.

By 14:00 on 30 May, the wind was still too strong and the final decision was made to use the alternative plan. The coded signal "31 May G.G.2490" was transmitted to the ships of the fleet to inform them the Skagerrak attack would start on 31 May. The pre-arranged signal to the waiting submarines was transmitted throughout the day from the E-Dienst radio station at <a href="Brugge">Brugge</a>, and the U-boat tender "Arcona" anchored at <a href="Emden">Emden</a>. Only two of the waiting submarines, and , received the order.

Unfortunately for the German plan, the British had obtained a copy of the main German codebook from the light cruiser , which had been boarded by the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a> after the ship ran aground in Russian <a href="territorial%20waters">territorial waters</a> in 1914. German naval radio communications could therefore often be quickly deciphered, and the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> usually knew about German activities.

The British Admiralty's <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> maintained <a href="direction%20finding">direction finding</a> and interception of German naval signals. It had intercepted and decrypted a German signal on 28 May that provided "ample evidence that the German fleet was stirring in the North Sea." Further signals were intercepted, and although they were not decrypted it was clear that a major operation was likely. At 11:00 on 30 May, Jellicoe was warned that the German fleet seemed prepared to sail the following morning. By 17:00, the Admiralty had intercepted the signal from Scheer, "31 May G.G.2490", making it clear something significant was imminent.

Not knowing the Germans' objective, Jellicoe and his staff decided to position the fleet to head off any attempt by the Germans to enter the North Atlantic, or the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> through the Skagerrak, by taking up a position off Norway where they could possibly cut off any German raid into the shipping lanes of the Atlantic, or prevent the Germans from heading into the Baltic. A position further west was unnecessary, as that area of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> could be patrolled by air using blimps and scouting aircraft.
Consequently, Admiral Jellicoe led the sixteen dreadnought battleships of the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons of the Grand Fleet and three battlecruisers of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron eastwards out of <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> at 22:30 on 30 May. He was to meet the 2nd Battle Squadron of eight dreadnought battleships commanded by Vice-Admiral <a href="Martyn%20Jerram">Martyn Jerram</a> coming from <a href="Cromarty">Cromarty</a>. Hipper's raiding force did not leave the <a href="Jade%20Estuary">Outer Jade Roads</a> until 01:00 on 31 May, heading west of Heligoland Island following a cleared channel through the minefields, heading north at . The main German fleet of sixteen dreadnought battleships of 1st and 3rd Battle Squadrons left the Jade at 02:30, being joined off Heligoland at 04:00 by the six pre-dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron coming from the Elbe River. Beatty's faster force of six ships of the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons plus the <a href="5th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%23Battle%20of%20Jutland">5th Battle Squadron</a> of four fast battleships left the Firth of Forth on the next day; Jellicoe intended to rendezvous with him west of the mouth of the Skagerrak off the coast of Jutland and wait for the Germans to appear or for their intentions to become clear. The planned position would give him the widest range of responses to likely German moves.

The principle of <a href="Force%20concentration">concentration of force</a> was fundamental to the fleet tactics of this time (as in earlier periods). Tactical doctrine called for a fleet approaching battle to be in a compact formation of parallel columns, allowing relatively easy manoeuvring, and giving shortened sight lines within the formation, which simplified the passing of the signals necessary for command and control.

A fleet formed in several short columns could change its heading faster than one formed in a single long column. Since most command signals were made with <a href="flag">flag</a>s or <a href="Aldis%20lamp">signal lamps</a> between ships, the flagship was usually placed at the head of the centre column so that its signals might be more easily seen by the many ships of the formation. Wireless telegraphy was in use, though security (radio direction finding), encryption, and the limitation of the radio sets made their extensive use more problematic. Command and control of such huge fleets remained difficult.

Thus, it might take a very long time for a signal from the flagship to be relayed to the entire formation. It was usually necessary for a signal to be confirmed by each ship before it could be relayed to other ships, and an order for a fleet movement would have to be received and acknowledged by every ship before it could be executed. In a large single-column formation, a signal could take 10 minutes or more to be passed from one end of the line to the other, whereas in a formation of parallel columns, visibility across the diagonals was often better (and always shorter) than in a single long column, and the diagonals gave signal "redundancy", increasing the probability that a message would be quickly seen and correctly interpreted.

However, before battle was joined the heavy units of the fleet would, if possible, deploy into a single column. To form the battle line in the correct orientation relative to the enemy, the commanding admiral had to know the enemy fleet's distance, bearing, heading, and speed. It was the task of the scouting forces, consisting primarily of <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s and <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, to find the enemy and report this information in sufficient time, and, if possible, to deny the enemy's scouting forces the opportunity of obtaining the equivalent information.

Ideally, the battle line would cross the intended path of the enemy column so that the maximum number of guns could be brought to bear, while the enemy could fire only with the forward guns of the leading ships, a manoeuvre known as "<a href="crossing%20the%20T">crossing the T</a>". Admiral <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō</a>, commander of the Japanese battleship fleet, had achieved this against Admiral <a href="Zinovy%20Rozhestvensky">Zinovy Rozhestvensky</a>'s Russian battleships in 1905 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a>, with devastating results. Jellicoe achieved this twice in one hour against the High Seas Fleet at Jutland, but on both occasions, Scheer managed to turn away and disengage, thereby avoiding a decisive action. 

Within the existing technological limits, a trade-off had to be made between the weight and size of guns, the weight of armour protecting the ship, and the maximum speed. Battleships sacrificed speed for armour and heavy naval guns ( or larger). British battlecruisers sacrificed weight of armour for greater speed, while their German counterparts were armed with lighter guns and heavier armour. These weight savings allowed them to escape danger or catch other ships. Generally, the larger guns mounted on British ships allowed an engagement at greater range. In theory, a lightly armoured ship could stay out of range of a slower opponent while still scoring hits. The fast pace of development in the pre-war years meant that every few years, a new generation of ships rendered its predecessors obsolete. Thus, fairly young ships could still be obsolete compared to the newest ships, and fare badly in an engagement against them.

<a href="John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">Admiral John Fisher</a>, responsible for reconstruction of the British fleet in the pre-war period, favoured large guns, oil fuel, and speed. <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Admiral Tirpitz</a>, responsible for the German fleet, favoured ship survivability and chose to sacrifice some gun size for improved armour. The German battlecruiser had <a href="belt%20armour">belt armour</a> equivalent in thickness—though not as comprehensive—to the British battleship , significantly better than on the British battlecruisers such as "Tiger". German ships had better internal subdivision and had fewer doors and other weak points in their <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a>, but with the disadvantage that space for crew was greatly reduced. As they were designed only for sorties in the North Sea they did not need to be as habitable as the British vessels and their crews could live in barracks ashore when in harbour.

Warships of the period were armed with guns firing projectiles of varying weights, bearing <a href="high%20explosive">high explosive</a> warheads. The sum total of weight of all the projectiles fired by all the ship's guns is referred to as "weight of broadside". At Jutland, the total of the British ships' weight of broadside was , while the German fleet's total was . This does not take into consideration the ability of some ships and their crews to fire more or less rapidly than others, which would increase or decrease amount of fire that one combatant was able to bring to bear on their opponent for any length of time.

Jellicoe's Grand Fleet was split into two sections. The dreadnought Battle Fleet, with which he sailed, formed the main force and was composed of 24 battleships and three battlecruisers. The battleships were formed into three squadrons of eight ships, further subdivided into divisions of four, each led by a <a href="flag%20officer">flag officer</a>. Accompanying them were eight <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a>s (classified by the Royal Navy since 1913 as "cruisers"), eight <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, four <a href="scout%20cruiser">scout cruiser</a>s, 51 <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, and one <a href="HMS%20Abdiel%20%281915%29">destroyer-minelayer</a>.
The Grand Fleet sailed without three of its battleships: in refit at Invergordon, dry-docked at <a href="Rosyth%20Dockyard">Rosyth</a> and in refit at Devonport. The brand new was left behind; with only three weeks in service, her untrained crew was judged unready for battle.

British <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> was provided by the Battlecruiser Fleet under David Beatty: six battlecruisers, four fast s, 14 light cruisers and 27 destroyers. Air scouting was provided by the attachment of the <a href="seaplane%20tender">seaplane tender</a> , one of the first <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s in history to participate in a naval engagement.

The German High Seas Fleet under Scheer was also split into a main force and a separate reconnaissance force. Scheer's main battle fleet was composed of 16 battleships and six <a href="Pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought</a> battleships arranged in an identical manner to the British. With them were six light cruisers and 31 <a href="torpedo-boat">torpedo-boat</a>s, (the latter being roughly equivalent to a British destroyer).

The German scouting force, commanded by Franz Hipper, consisted of five battlecruisers, five light cruisers and 30 torpedo-boats. The Germans had no equivalent to "Engadine" and no <a href="aircraft">heavier-than-air aircraft</a> to operate with the fleet but had the Imperial German Naval Airship Service's force of <a href="rigid%20airship">rigid airship</a>s available to patrol the North Sea.

All of the battleships and battlecruisers on both sides carried <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es of various sizes, as did the lighter craft. The British battleships carried three or four underwater torpedo tubes. The battlecruisers carried from two to five. All were either 18-inch or 21-inch diameter. The German battleships carried five or six underwater torpedo tubes in three sizes from 18 to 21 inch and the battlecruisers carried four or five tubes.

The German battle fleet was hampered by the slow speed and relatively poor armament of the six pre-dreadnoughts of II Squadron, which limited maximum fleet speed to , compared to maximum British fleet speed of . On the British side, the eight armoured cruisers were deficient in both speed and armour protection. Both of these obsolete squadrons were notably vulnerable to attacks by more modern enemy ships.

The route of the British battlecruiser fleet took it through the patrol sector allocated to "U-32". After receiving the order to commence the operation, the U-boat moved to a position east of May Island at dawn on 31 May. At 03:40, it sighted the cruisers and leaving the Forth at . It launched one torpedo at the leading cruiser at a range of , but its periscope jammed 'up', giving away the position of the submarine as it manoeuvred to fire a second. The lead cruiser turned away to dodge the torpedo, while the second turned towards the submarine, attempting to ram. "U-32" <a href="crash%20dive">crash dive</a>d, and on raising its periscope at 04:10 saw two battlecruisers (the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron) heading south-east. They were too far away to attack, but "<a href="Captain%20lieutenant">Kapitänleutnant</a>" von Spiegel reported the sighting of two battleships and two cruisers to Germany.

"U-66" was also supposed to be patrolling off the Firth of Forth but had been forced north to a position off Peterhead by patrolling British vessels. This now brought it into contact with the 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from the Moray Firth. At 05:00, it had to crash dive when the cruiser appeared from the mist heading toward it. It was followed by another cruiser, , and eight battleships. "U-66" got within of the battleships preparing to fire, but was forced to dive by an approaching destroyer and missed the opportunity. At 06:35, it reported eight battleships and cruisers heading north.

The courses reported by both submarines were incorrect, because they reflected one leg of a zigzag being used by British ships to avoid submarines. Taken with a wireless intercept of more ships leaving Scapa Flow earlier in the night, they created the impression in the German High Command that the British fleet, whatever it was doing, was split into separate sections moving apart, which was precisely as the Germans wished to meet it.

Jellicoe's ships proceeded to their rendezvous undamaged and undiscovered. However, he was now misled by an Admiralty <a href="intelligence%20%28information%20gathering%29">intelligence</a> report advising that the German main battle fleet was still in port. The Director of Operations Division, Rear Admiral <a href="Thomas%20Jackson%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Jackson</a>, had asked the intelligence division, <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a>, for the current location of German call sign DK, used by Admiral Scheer. They had replied that it was currently transmitting from <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>. It was known to the intelligence staff that Scheer deliberately used a different call sign when at sea, but no one asked for this information or explained the reason behind the query – to locate the German fleet.

The German battlecruisers cleared the minefields surrounding the <a href="Amrum">Amrum</a> swept channel by 09:00. They then proceeded north-west, passing west of the <a href="Horns%20Rev">Horn's Reef</a> lightship heading for the <a href="Fisher%20Bank">Little Fisher Bank</a> at the mouth of the Skagerrak. The High Seas Fleet followed some behind. The battlecruisers were in line ahead, with the four cruisers of the II scouting group plus supporting torpedo boats ranged in an arc ahead and to either side. The IX torpedo boat flotilla formed close support immediately surrounding the battlecruisers. The High Seas Fleet similarly adopted a line-ahead formation, with close screening by torpedo boats to either side and a further screen of five cruisers surrounding the column away. The wind had finally moderated so that Zeppelins could be used, and by 11:30 five had been sent out: "L14" to the Skagerrak, "L23" east of Noss Head in the Pentland Firth, "L21" off Peterhead, "L9" off Sunderland, and "L16" east of Flamborough Head. Visibility, however, was still bad, with clouds down to .

By around 14:00, Beatty's ships were proceeding eastward at roughly the same latitude as Hipper's squadron, which was heading north. Had the courses remained unchanged, Beatty would have passed between the two German fleets, south of the battlecruisers and north of the High Seas Fleet at around 16:30, possibly trapping his ships just as the German plan envisioned. His orders were to stop his scouting patrol when he reached a point east of Britain and then turn north to meet Jellicoe, which he did at this time. Beatty's ships were divided into three columns, with the two battlecruiser squadrons leading in parallel lines apart. The 5th Battle Squadron was stationed to the north-west, on the side furthest away from any expected enemy contact, while a screen of cruisers and destroyers was spread south-east of the battlecruisers. After the turn, the 5th Battle Squadron was now leading the British ships in the westernmost column, and Beatty's squadron was centre and rearmost, with the 2nd BCS to the west.

At 14:20 on 31 May, despite heavy haze and <a href="Scud%20%28cloud%29">scuds</a> of fog giving poor visibility, scouts from Beatty's force reported enemy ships to the south-east; the British light units, investigating a neutral Danish <a href="Steamboat">steamer</a> ("N J Fjord"), which was stopped between the two fleets, had found two German destroyers engaged on the same mission ( and ). The first shots of the battle were fired at 14:28 when and of the British 1st Light <a href="Cruiser%20Squadron">Cruiser Squadron</a> opened on the German torpedo boats, which withdrew toward their approaching light cruisers. At 14:36, the Germans scored the first hit of the battle when , of Rear-Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20Boedicker">Friedrich Boedicker</a>'s Scouting Group II, hit her British counterpart "Galatea" at extreme range.

Beatty began to move his battlecruisers and supporting forces south-eastwards and then east to cut the German ships off from their base and ordered "Engadine" to launch a <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> to try to get more information about the size and location of the German forces. This was the first time in history that a carrier-based aeroplane was used for reconnaissance in naval combat. "Engadine"s aircraft did locate and report some German light cruisers just before 15:30 and came under anti-aircraft gunfire but attempts to relay reports from the aeroplane failed.

Unfortunately for Beatty, his initial course changes at 14:32 were not received by <a href="Hugh%20Evan-Thomas">Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas's</a> 5th Battle Squadron (the distance being too great to read his flags), because the battlecruiser —the last ship in his column—was no longer in a position where she could relay signals by searchlight to Evan-Thomas, as she had previously been ordered to do. Whereas before the north turn, "Tiger" had been the closest ship to Evan-Thomas, she was now further away than Beatty in "Lion". Matters were aggravated because Evan-Thomas had not been briefed regarding standing orders within Beatty's squadron, as his squadron normally operated with the Grand Fleet. Fleet ships were expected to obey movement orders precisely and not deviate from them. Beatty's standing instructions expected his officers to use their initiative and keep station with the flagship. As a result, the four s—which were the fastest and most heavily armed in the world at that time—remained on the previous course for several minutes, ending up behind rather than five. Beatty also had the opportunity during the previous hours to concentrate his forces, and no reason not to do so, whereas he steamed ahead at full speed, faster than the battleships could manage. Dividing the force had serious consequences for the British, costing them what would have been an overwhelming advantage in ships and firepower during the first half-hour of the coming battle.

With visibility favouring the Germans, Hipper's battlecruisers at 15:22, steaming approximately north-west, sighted Beatty's squadron at a range of about , while Beatty's forces did not identify Hipper's battlecruisers until 15:30. (position 1 on map). At 15:45, Hipper turned south-east to lead Beatty toward Scheer, who was south-east with the main force of the High Seas Fleet.

Beatty's conduct during the next 15 minutes has received a great deal of criticism, as his ships out-ranged and outnumbered the German squadron, yet he held his fire for over 10 minutes with the German ships in range. He also failed to use the time available to rearrange his battlecruisers into a fighting formation, with the result that they were still manoeuvring when the battle started.

At 15:48, with the opposing forces roughly parallel at , with the British to the south-west of the Germans (i.e., on the right side), Hipper opened fire, followed by the British ships as their guns came to bear upon targets (position 2). Thus began the opening phase of the battlecruiser action, known as the "Run to the South", in which the British chased the Germans, and Hipper intentionally led Beatty toward Scheer. During the first minutes of the ensuing battle, all the British ships except "Princess Royal" fired far over their German opponents, due to adverse visibility conditions, before finally getting the range. Only "Lion" and "Princess Royal" had settled into formation, so the other four ships were hampered in aiming by their own turning. Beatty was to windward of Hipper, and therefore funnel and gun smoke from his own ships tended to obscure his targets, while Hipper's smoke blew clear. Also, the eastern sky was overcast and the grey German ships were indistinct and difficult to range.

Beatty had ordered his ships to engage in a line, one British ship engaging with one German and his <a href="flagship">flagship</a> doubling on the German flagship . However, due to another mistake with signalling by flag, and possibly because "Queen Mary" and "Tiger" were unable to see the German lead ship because of smoke, the second German ship, "Derfflinger", was left un-engaged and free to fire without disruption. drew fire from two of Beatty's battlecruisers, but still fired with great accuracy during this time, hitting "Tiger" 9 times in the first 12 minutes. The Germans drew first blood. Aided by superior visibility, Hipper's five battlecruisers quickly registered hits on three of the six British battlecruisers. Seven minutes passed before the British managed to score their first hit.

The first near-kill of the Run to the South occurred at 16:00, when a shell from "Lützow" wrecked the "Q" turret amidships on Beatty's flagship "Lion". Dozens of crewmen were instantly killed, but far larger destruction was averted when the mortally wounded turret commander – Major <a href="Francis%20John%20William%20Harvey">Francis Harvey</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> – promptly ordered the magazine doors shut and the magazine flooded. This prevented a magazine explosion at 16:28, when a flash fire ignited ready cordite charges beneath the turret and killed everyone in the chambers outside "Q" magazine. "Lion" was saved. was not so lucky; at 16:02, just 14 minutes into the gunnery exchange, she was hit aft by three shells from , causing damage sufficient to knock her out of line and detonating "X" magazine aft. Soon after, despite the near-maximum range, "Von der Tann" put another shell on "Indefatigable"s "A" turret forward. The plunging shells probably pierced the thin upper armour, and seconds later "Indefatigable" was ripped apart by another magazine explosion, sinking immediately with her crew of 1,019 officers and men, leaving only two survivors. (position 3).

Hipper's position deteriorated somewhat by 16:15 as the 5th Battle Squadron finally came into range, so that he had to contend with gunfire from the four battleships astern as well as Beatty's five remaining battlecruisers to starboard. But he knew his baiting mission was close to completion, as his force was rapidly closing with Scheer's main body. At 16:08, the lead battleship of the 5th Battle Squadron, , caught up with Hipper and opened fire at extreme range, scoring a hit on "Von der Tann" within 60 seconds. Still, it was 16:15 before all the battleships of the 5th were able to fully engage at long range.

At 16:25, the battlecruiser action intensified again when was hit by what may have been a combined salvo from "Derfflinger" and ; she disintegrated when both forward magazines exploded, sinking with all but nine of her 1,275 man crew lost. (position 4). Commander von Hase, the first gunnery officer aboard "Derfflingler", noted:

During the Run to the South, from 15:48 to 16:54, the German battlecruisers made an estimated total of forty-two hits on the British battlecruisers (nine on "Lion", six on "Princess Royal", seven on "Queen Mary", 14 on "Tiger", one on "New Zealand", five on "Indefatigable"), and two more on the battleship "Barham", compared with only eleven hits by the British battlecruisers (four on "Lützow", four on "Seydlitz", two on "Moltke", one on "von der Tann"), and six hits by the battleships (one on "Seydlitz", four on "Moltke", one on "von der Tann").

Shortly after 16:26, a salvo struck on or around , which was obscured by spray and smoke from shell bursts. A signalman promptly leapt on to the bridge of "Lion" and announced ""Princess Royal"s blown up, Sir." Beatty famously turned to his <a href="flag%20captain">flag captain</a>, saying "<a href="Ernle%20Chatfield%2C%201st%20Baron%20Chatfield">Chatfield</a>, there seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today." (In popular legend, Beatty also immediately ordered his ships to "turn two points to port", i.e., two <a href="Compass%20point">points</a> nearer the enemy, but there is no official record of any such command or course change.) "Princess Royal", as it turned out, was still afloat after the spray cleared.

At 16:30, Scheer's leading battleships sighted the distant battlecruiser action; soon after, of Beatty's 2nd <a href="Light%20Cruiser">Light Cruiser</a> Squadron led by Commodore <a href="William%20Goodenough">William Goodenough</a> sighted the main body of Scheer's High Seas Fleet, dodging numerous heavy-calibre salvos to report in detail the German strength: 16 dreadnoughts with six older battleships. This was the first news that Beatty and Jellicoe had that Scheer and his battle fleet were even at sea. Simultaneously, an all-out destroyer action raged in the space between the opposing battlecruiser forces, as British and German destroyers fought with each other and attempted to torpedo the larger enemy ships. Each side fired many torpedoes, but both battlecruiser forces turned away from the attacks and all escaped harm except "Seydlitz", which was hit forward at 16:57 by a torpedo fired by the British destroyer . Though taking on water, "Seydlitz" maintained speed. The destroyer , under the command of <a href="Edward%20Bingham">Captain Barry Bingham</a>, led the British attacks. The British disabled the German torpedo boat , which the Germans soon abandoned and sank, and "Petard" then torpedoed and sank , her second score of the day. and rescued the crews of their sunken sister ships. But "Nestor" and another British destroyer – – were immobilised by shell hits, and were later sunk by Scheer's passing dreadnoughts. Bingham was rescued, and won the Victoria Cross for his leadership in the destroyer action.

As soon as he himself sighted the vanguard of Scheer's distant battleship line away, at 16:40, Beatty turned his battlecruiser force 180°, heading north to draw the Germans toward Jellicoe. (position 5). Beatty's withdrawal toward Jellicoe is called the "Run to the North", in which the tables turned and the Germans chased the British. Because Beatty once again failed to signal his intentions adequately, the battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron – which were too far behind to read his flags – found themselves passing the battlecruisers on an opposing course and heading directly toward the approaching main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 16:48, at extreme range, Scheer's leading battleships opened fire.

Meanwhile, at 16:47, having received Goodenough's signal and knowing that Beatty was now leading the German battle fleet north to him, Jellicoe signalled to his own forces that the fleet action they had waited so long for was finally imminent; at 16:51, by radio, he informed the Admiralty so in London.

The difficulties of the 5th Battle Squadron were compounded when Beatty gave the order to Evan-Thomas to "turn in succession" (rather than "turn together") at 16:48 as the battleships passed him. Evan-Thomas acknowledged the signal, but <a href="Lieutenant-Commander">Lieutenant-Commander</a> <a href="Ralph%20Seymour%20%28naval%20officer%29">Ralph Seymour</a>, Beatty's <a href="flag%20lieutenant">flag lieutenant</a>, aggravated the situation when he did not haul down the flags (to execute the signal) for some minutes. At 16:55, when the 5BS had moved within range of the enemy battleships, Evan-Thomas issued his own flag command warning his squadron to expect sudden manoeuvres and to follow his lead, before starting to turn on his own initiative. The order to turn in succession would have resulted in all four ships turning in the same patch of sea as they reached it one by one, giving the High Seas Fleet repeated opportunity with ample time to find the proper range. However, the captain of the trailing ship () turned early, mitigating the adverse results.

For the next hour, the 5th Battle Squadron acted as Beatty's rearguard, drawing fire from all the German ships within range, while by 17:10 Beatty had deliberately eased his own squadron out of range of Hipper's now-superior battlecruiser force. Since visibility and firepower now favoured the Germans, there was no incentive for Beatty to risk further battlecruiser losses when his own gunnery could not be effective. Illustrating the imbalance, Beatty's battlecruisers did not score any hits on the Germans in this phase until 17:45, but they had rapidly received five more before he opened the range (four on "Lion", of which three were by "Lützow", and one on "Tiger" by "Seydlitz"). Now the only targets the Germans could reach, the ships of the 5th Battle Squadron, received simultaneous fire from Hipper's battlecruisers to the east (which HMS "Barham" and engaged) and Scheer's leading battleships to the south-east (which and engaged). Three took hits: "Barham" (four by "Derfflinger"), "Warspite" (two by "Seydlitz"), and "Malaya" (seven by the German battleships). Only "Valiant" was unscathed.

The four battleships were far better suited to take this sort of pounding than the battlecruisers, and none were lost, though "Malaya" suffered heavy damage, an ammunition fire, and heavy crew casualties. At the same time, the fire of the four British ships was accurate and effective. As the two British squadrons headed north at top speed, eagerly chased by the entire German fleet, the 5th Battle Squadron scored 13 hits on the enemy battlecruisers (four on "Lützow", three on "Derfflinger", six on "Seydlitz") and five on battleships (although only one, on , did any serious damage). (position 6).

Jellicoe was now aware that full fleet engagement was nearing, but had insufficient information on the position and course of the Germans. To assist Beatty, early in the battle at about 16:05, Jellicoe had ordered <a href="Rear-Admiral">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="Horace%20Hood">Horace Hood</a>'s <a href="3rd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron">3rd Battlecruiser Squadron</a> to speed ahead to find and support Beatty's force, and Hood was now racing SSE well in advance of Jellicoe's northern force. <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Arbuthnot%2C%204th%20Baronet">Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot</a>'s 1st Cruiser Squadron patrolled the van of Jellicoe's main battleship force as it advanced steadily to the south-east.

At 17:33, the armoured cruiser of Arbuthnot's squadron, on the far southwest flank of Jellicoe's force, came within view of , which was about ahead of Beatty with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, establishing the first visual link between the converging bodies of the Grand Fleet. At 17:38, the scout cruiser , screening Hood's oncoming battlecruisers, was intercepted by the van of the German scouting forces under Rear-Admiral Boedicker.

Heavily outnumbered by Boedicker's four light cruisers, "Chester" was pounded before being relieved by Hood's heavy units, which swung westward for that purpose. Hood's flagship disabled the light cruiser shortly after 17:56. "Wiesbaden" became a sitting target for most of the British fleet during the next hour, but remained afloat and fired some torpedoes at the passing enemy battleships from long range. Meanwhile, Boedicker's other ships turned toward Hipper and Scheer in the mistaken belief that Hood was leading a larger force of British capital ships from the north and east. A chaotic destroyer action in mist and smoke ensued as German torpedo boats attempted to blunt the arrival of this new formation, but Hood's battlecruisers dodged all the torpedoes fired at them. In this action, after leading a torpedo counter-attack, the British destroyer was disabled, but continued to return fire at numerous passing enemy ships for the next hour.

In the meantime, Beatty and Evan-Thomas had resumed their engagement with Hipper's battlecruisers, this time with the visual conditions to their advantage. With several of his ships damaged, Hipper turned back toward Scheer at around 18:00, just as Beatty's flagship "Lion" was finally sighted from Jellicoe's flagship "Iron Duke". Jellicoe twice demanded the latest position of the German battlefleet from Beatty, who could not see the German battleships and failed to respond to the question until 18:14. Meanwhile, Jellicoe received confused sighting reports of varying accuracy and limited usefulness from light cruisers and battleships on the starboard (southern) flank of his force.

Jellicoe was in a worrying position. He needed to know the location of the German fleet to judge when and how to deploy his battleships from their cruising formation (six columns of four ships each) into a single battle line. The deployment could be on either the westernmost or the easternmost column, and had to be carried out before the Germans arrived; but early deployment could mean losing any chance of a decisive encounter. Deploying to the west would bring his fleet closer to Scheer, gaining valuable time as dusk approached, but the Germans might arrive before the manoeuvre was complete. Deploying to the east would take the force away from Scheer, but Jellicoe's ships might be able to <a href="crossing%20the%20T">cross the "T"</a>, and visibility would strongly favour British gunnery – Scheer's forces would be silhouetted against the setting sun to the west, while the Grand Fleet would be indistinct against the dark skies to the north and east, and would be hidden by reflection of the low sunlight off intervening haze and smoke. Deployment would take twenty irreplaceable minutes, and the fleets were closing at full speed. In one of the most critical and difficult tactical command decisions of the entire war, Jellicoe ordered deployment to the east at 18:15.

Meanwhile, Hipper had rejoined Scheer, and the combined High Seas Fleet was heading north, directly toward Jellicoe. Scheer had no indication that Jellicoe was at sea, let alone that he was bearing down from the north-west, and was distracted by the intervention of Hood's ships to his north and east. Beatty's four surviving battlecruisers were now crossing the van of the British dreadnoughts to join Hood's three battlecruisers; at this time, Arbuthnot's flagship, the armoured cruiser , and her squadron-mate both charged across Beatty's bows, and "Lion" narrowly avoided a collision with "Warrior". Nearby, numerous British light cruisers and destroyers on the south-western flank of the deploying battleships were also crossing each other's courses in attempts to reach their proper stations, often barely escaping collisions, and under fire from some of the approaching German ships. This period of peril and heavy traffic attending the merger and deployment of the British forces later became known as "Windy Corner".

Arbuthnot was attracted by the drifting hull of the crippled "Wiesbaden". With "Warrior", "Defence" closed in for the kill, only to blunder right into the gun sights of Hipper's and Scheer's oncoming capital ships. "Defence" was deluged by heavy-calibre gunfire from many German battleships, which detonated her magazines in a spectacular explosion viewed by most of the deploying Grand Fleet. She sank with all hands (903 officers and men). "Warrior" was also hit badly, but was spared destruction by a mishap to the nearby battleship "Warspite". "Warspite" had her steering gear overheat and jam under heavy load at high speed as the 5th Battle Squadron made a turn to the north at 18:19. Steaming at top speed in wide circles, "Warspite" appeared as a juicy target to the German dreadnoughts and took 13 hits, inadvertently drawing fire from the hapless "Warrior". "Warspite" was brought back under control and survived the onslaught, but was badly damaged, had to reduce speed, and withdrew northward; later (at 21:07), she was ordered back to port by Evan-Thomas. "Warspite" went on to a long and illustrious career, serving also in World War II. "Warrior", on the other hand, was abandoned and sank the next day after her crew was taken off at 08:25 on 1 June by "Engadine", which towed the sinking armoured cruiser during the night.
As "Defence" sank and "Warspite" circled, at about 18:19, Hipper moved within range of Hood's 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron, but was still also within range of Beatty's ships. At first, visibility favoured the British: hit "Derfflinger" three times and "Seydlitz" once, while "Lützow" quickly took 10 hits from "Lion", and "Invincible", including two below-waterline hits forward by "Invincible" that would ultimately doom Hipper's flagship. But at 18:30, "Invincible" abruptly appeared as a clear target before "Lützow" and "Derfflinger". The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at "Invincible", and sank her in 90 seconds. A shell from the third salvo struck "Invincible"s Q-turret amidships, detonating the magazines below and causing her to blow up and sink. All but six of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Rear-Admiral Hood, were killed. Of the remaining British battlecruisers, only "Princess Royal" received heavy-calibre hits at this time (two by the battleship "Markgraf"). "Lützow", flooding forward and unable to communicate by radio, was now out of action and began to attempt to withdraw; therefore Hipper left his flagship and transferred to the torpedo boat , hoping to board one of the other battlecruisers later.

By 18:30, the main battle fleet action was joined for the first time, with Jellicoe effectively "crossing Scheer's T". The officers on the lead German battleships, and Scheer himself, were taken completely by surprise when they emerged from drifting clouds of smoky mist to suddenly find themselves facing the massed firepower of the entire Grand Fleet main battle line, which they did not know was even at sea. Jellicoe's flagship "Iron Duke" quickly scored seven hits on the lead German dreadnought, but in this brief exchange, which lasted only minutes, as few as 10 of the Grand Fleet's 24 dreadnoughts actually opened fire. The Germans were hampered by poor visibility, in addition to being in an unfavourable tactical position, just as Jellicoe had intended. Realising he was heading into a death trap, Scheer ordered his fleet to turn and disengage at 18:33. Under a pall of smoke and mist, Scheer's forces succeeded in disengaging by an expertly executed 180° turn in unison ("battle about turn to starboard", German "Gefechtskehrtwendung nach Steuerbord"), which was a well-practised emergency manoeuvre of the High Seas Fleet. Scheer declared:

Conscious of the risks to his capital ships posed by torpedoes, Jellicoe did not chase directly but headed south, determined to keep the High Seas Fleet west of him. Starting at 18:40, battleships at the rear of Jellicoe's line were in fact sighting and avoiding torpedoes, and at 18:54 was hit by a torpedo (probably from the disabled "Wiesbaden"), which reduced her speed to . Meanwhile, Scheer, knowing that it was not yet dark enough to escape and that his fleet would suffer terribly in a stern chase, doubled back to the east at 18:55. In his memoirs he wrote, "the manoeuvre would be bound to surprise the enemy, to upset his plans for the rest of the day, and if the blow fell heavily it would facilitate the breaking loose at night." But the turn to the east took his ships, again, directly towards Jellicoe's fully deployed battle line.

Simultaneously, the disabled British destroyer "HMS Shark" fought desperately against a group of four German torpedo boats and disabled with gunfire, but was eventually torpedoed and sunk at 19:02 by the German destroyer . "Shark"s <a href="Loftus%20William%20Jones">Captain Loftus Jones</a> won the Victoria Cross for his heroism in continuing to fight against all odds.

Commodore Goodenough's 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron dodged the fire of German battleships for a second time to re-establish contact with the High Seas Fleet shortly after 19:00. By 19:15, Jellicoe had crossed Scheer's "T" again. This time his arc of fire was tighter and deadlier, causing severe damage to the German battleships, particularly Rear-Admiral Behncke's leading 3rd Squadron (SMS "König", , "Markgraf", and all being hit, along with of the 1st Squadron), while on the British side, only the battleship was hit (twice, by but with little damage done).

At 19:17, for the second time in less than an hour, Scheer turned his outnumbered and out-gunned fleet to the west using the "battle about turn" (German: "Gefechtskehrtwendung"), but this time it was executed only with difficulty, as the High Seas Fleet's lead squadrons began to lose formation under concentrated gunfire. To deter a British chase, Scheer ordered a major torpedo attack by his destroyers and a potentially sacrificial charge by Scouting Group I's four remaining battlecruisers. Hipper was still aboard the torpedo boat "G39" and was unable to command his squadron for this attack. Therefore, , under Captain Hartog, led the already badly damaged German battlecruisers directly into "the greatest concentration of naval gunfire any fleet commander had ever faced", at ranges down to .

In what became known as the "death ride", all the battlecruisers except were hit and further damaged, as 18 of the British battleships fired at them simultaneously. "Derfflinger" had two main gun turrets destroyed. The crews of Scouting Group I suffered heavy casualties, but survived the pounding and veered away with the other battlecruisers once Scheer was out of trouble and the German destroyers were moving in to attack. In this brief but intense portion of the engagement, from about 19:05 to about 19:30, the Germans sustained a total of 37 heavy hits while inflicting only two; "Derfflinger" alone received 14.

While his battlecruisers drew the fire of the British fleet, Scheer slipped away, laying smoke screens. Meanwhile, from about 19:16 to about 19:40, the British battleships were also engaging Scheer's torpedo boats, which executed several waves of torpedo attacks to cover his withdrawal. Jellicoe's ships turned away from the attacks and successfully evaded all 31 of the torpedoes launched at them – though, in several cases, only just barely – and sank the German destroyer . British light forces also sank "V48", which had previously been disabled by HMS "Shark". This action, and the turn away, cost the British critical time and range in the last hour of daylight – as Scheer intended, allowing him to get his heavy ships out of immediate danger.

The last major exchanges between capital ships in this battle took place just after sunset, from about 20:19 to about 20:35, as the surviving British battlecruisers caught up with their German counterparts, which were briefly relieved by Rear-Admiral Mauve's obsolete pre-dreadnoughts (the German 2nd Squadron). The British received one heavy hit on "Princess Royal" but scored five more on "Seydlitz" and three on other German ships. As twilight faded to night and exchanged a few final shots with , neither side could have imagined that the only encounter between British and German dreadnoughts in the entire war was already concluded. 

At 21:00, Jellicoe, conscious of the Grand Fleet's deficiencies in night fighting, decided to try to avoid a major engagement until early dawn. He placed a screen of cruisers and destroyers behind his battle fleet to patrol the rear as he headed south to guard Scheer's expected escape route. In reality, Scheer opted to cross Jellicoe's wake and escape via <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a>. Luckily for Scheer, most of the light forces in Jellicoe's rearguard failed to report the seven separate encounters with the German fleet during the night; the very few radio reports that were sent to the British flagship were never received, possibly because the Germans were jamming British frequencies. Many of the destroyers failed to make the most of their opportunities to attack discovered ships, despite Jellicoe's expectations that the destroyer forces would, if necessary, be able to block the path of the German fleet.

Jellicoe and his commanders did not understand that the furious gunfire and explosions to the north (seen and heard for hours by all the British battleships) indicated that the German heavy ships were breaking through the screen astern of the British fleet. Instead, it was believed that the fighting was the result of night attacks by German destroyers. The most powerful British ships of all (the 15-inch-guns of the <a href="5th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%23Battle%20of%20Jutland">5th Battle Squadron</a>) directly observed German battleships crossing astern of them in action with British light forces, at ranges of or less, and gunners on HMS "Malaya" made ready to fire, but her captain declined, deferring to the authority of Rear-Admiral Evan-Thomas – and neither commander reported the sightings to Jellicoe, assuming that he could see for himself and that revealing the fleet's position by radio signals or gunfire was unwise.

While the nature of Scheer's escape, and Jellicoe's inaction, indicate the overall German superiority in night fighting, the results of the night action were no more clear-cut than were those of the battle as a whole. In the first of many surprise encounters by darkened ships at point-blank range, "Southampton", Commodore Goodenough's flagship, which had scouted so proficiently, was heavily damaged in action with a German Scouting Group composed of light cruisers, but managed to torpedo , which went down at 22:23 with all hands (320 officers and men).

From 23:20 to approximately 02:15, several British destroyer <a href="flotilla">flotilla</a>s launched torpedo attacks on the German battle fleet in a series of violent and chaotic engagements at extremely short range (often under ). At the cost of five destroyers sunk and some others damaged, they managed to torpedo the light cruiser , which sank several hours later, and the pre-dreadnought , which blew up and sank with all hands (839 officers and men) at 03:10 during the last wave of attacks before dawn. Three of the British destroyers collided in the chaos, and the German battleship rammed the British destroyer , blowing away most of the British ship's superstructure merely with the muzzle blast of its big guns, which could not be aimed low enough to hit the ship. "Nassau" was left with a hole in her side, reducing her maximum speed to , while the removed plating was left lying on "Spitfire"s deck. "Spitfire" survived and made it back to port. Another German cruiser, , was accidentally rammed by the dreadnought and abandoned, sinking early the next day. Of the British destroyers, , , , and were lost during the night fighting.

Just after midnight on 1 June, and other German battleships sank of the ill-fated 1st Cruiser Squadron, which had blundered into the German battle line. Deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the Grand Fleet, "Black Prince" had lost contact in the darkness and took a position near what she thought was the British line. The Germans soon identified the new addition to its line and opened fire. Overwhelmed by point-blank gunfire, "Black Prince" blew up, (857 officers and men – all hands – were lost), as her squadron leader "Defence" had done hours earlier. Lost in the darkness, the battlecruisers and had similar point-blank encounters with the British battle line and were recognised, but were spared the fate of "Black Prince" when the captains of the British ships, again, declined to open fire, reluctant to reveal their fleet's position.

At 01:45, the sinking battlecruiser "Lützow" – fatally damaged by "Invincible" during the main action – was torpedoed by the destroyer on orders of "Lützow"s Captain Viktor von Harder after the surviving crew of 1,150 transferred to destroyers that came alongside. At 02:15, the German torpedo boat suddenly had its bow blown off; "V2" and "V6" came alongside and took off the remaining crew, and the "V2" then sank the hulk. Since there was no enemy nearby, it was assumed that she had hit a mine or had been torpedoed by a submarine.

At 02:15, five British ships of the 13th Destroyer Flotilla under Captain James Uchtred Farie regrouped and headed south. At 02:25, they sighted the rear of the German line. inquired of the leader as to whether he thought they were British or German ships. Answering that he thought they were German, Farie then veered off to the east and away from the German line. All but "Moresby" in the rear followed, as through the gloom she sighted what she thought were four pre-dreadnought battleships away. She hoisted a flag signal indicating that the enemy was to the west and then closed to firing range, letting off a torpedo set for high running at 02:37, then veering off to rejoin her flotilla. The four pre-dreadnought battleships were in fact two pre-dreadnoughts, "Schleswig-Holstein" and , and the battlecruisers "Von der Tann" and "Derfflinger". "Von der Tann" sighted the torpedo and was forced to steer sharply to starboard to avoid it as it passed close to her bows. "Moresby" rejoined "Champion" convinced she had scored a hit.

Finally, at 05:20, as Scheer's fleet was safely on its way home, the battleship struck a British mine on her starboard side, killing one man and wounding ten, but was able to make port. "Seydlitz", critically damaged and very nearly sinking, barely survived the return voyage: after grounding and taking on even more water on the evening of 1 June, she had to be assisted stern first into port, where she dropped anchor at 07:30 on the morning of 2 June.

The Germans were helped in their escape by the failure of the British Admiralty in London to pass on seven critical radio intercepts obtained by naval intelligence indicating the true position, course and intentions of the High Seas Fleet during the night. One message was transmitted to Jellicoe at 23:15 that accurately reported the German fleet's course and speed as of 21:14. However, the erroneous signal from earlier in the day that reported the German fleet still in port, and an intelligence signal received at 22:45 giving another unlikely position for the German fleet, had reduced his confidence in intelligence reports. Had the other messages been forwarded, which confirmed the information received at 23:15, or had British ships reported accurately sightings and engagements with German destroyers, cruisers and battleships, then Jellicoe could have altered course to intercept Scheer at the Horns Reef. The unsent intercepted messages had been duly filed by the junior officer left on duty that night, who failed to appreciate their significance. By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer's whereabouts at 04:15, the German fleet was too far away to catch and it was clear that the battle could no longer be resumed.

At midday on 2 June, German authorities released a press statement claiming a victory, including the destruction of a battleship, two battlecruisers, two armoured cruisers, a light cruiser, a submarine and several destroyers, for the loss of "Pommern" and "Wiesbaden". News that "Lützow", "Elbing" and "Rostock" had been scuttled was withheld, on the grounds this information would not be known to the enemy. The victory of the Skagerrak was celebrated in the press, children were given a holiday and the nation celebrated. The Kaiser announced a new chapter in world history. Post-war, the official German history hailed the battle as a victory and it continued to be celebrated until after World War II.

In Britain, the first official news came from German wireless broadcasts. Ships began to arrive in port, their crews sending messages to friends and relatives both of their survival and the loss of some 6,000 others. Authorities considered suppressing the news, but it had already spread widely. Some crews coming ashore found rumours had already reported them dead to relatives, while others were jeered for the defeat they had suffered. At 19:00 on 2 June, the Admiralty released a statement based on information from Jellicoe containing the bare news of losses on each side. The following day British newspapers reported a German victory. The "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" described the German Director of the Naval Department telling the "Reichstag": "The result of the fighting is a significant success for our forces against a much stronger adversary". The British population was shocked that the long anticipated battle had been a victory for Germany. On 3 June, the Admiralty issued a further statement expanding on German losses, and another the following day with exaggerated claims. However, on 7 June the German admission of the losses of "Lützow" and "Rostock" started to redress the sense of the battle as a loss. International perception of the battle began to change towards a qualified British victory, the German attempt to change the balance of power in the North Sea having been repulsed. In July, bad news from the "<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Somme campaign</a>" swept concern over Jutland from the British consciousness.

At Jutland, the Germans, with a 99-strong fleet, sank of British ships, while a 151-strong British fleet sank of German ships. The British lost 6,094 seamen; the Germans 2,551. Several other ships were badly damaged, such as and .

As of the summer of 1916, the High Seas Fleet's strategy was to whittle away the numerical advantage of the Royal Navy by bringing its full strength to bear against isolated squadrons of enemy capital ships whilst declining to be drawn into a general fleet battle until it had achieved something resembling parity in heavy ships. In tactical terms, the High Seas Fleet had clearly inflicted significantly greater losses on the Grand Fleet than it had suffered itself at Jutland and the Germans never had any intention of attempting to hold the site of the battle, so some historians support the German claim of victory at Jutland.

However, Scheer seems to have quickly realised that further battles with a similar rate of attrition would exhaust the High Seas Fleet long before it reduced the Grand Fleet. Further, after the 19 August advance was nearly intercepted by the Grand Fleet, he no longer believed that it would be possible to trap a single squadron of Royal Navy warships without having the Grand Fleet intervene before he could return to port. Therefore, the High Seas Fleet abandoned its forays into the North Sea and turned its attention to the Baltic for most of 1917 whilst Scheer switched tactics against Britain to unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic.

At a strategic level, the outcome has been the subject of a huge amount of literature with no clear consensus. The battle was widely viewed as indecisive in the immediate aftermath and this view remains influential.

Despite numerical superiority, the British had been disappointed in their hopes for a decisive victory comparable to <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Trafalgar</a> and the objective of the influential strategic doctrines of <a href="Alfred%20Mahan">Alfred Mahan</a>. The High Seas Fleet survived as a <a href="fleet%20in%20being">fleet in being</a>. Most of its losses were made good within a month – even "Seydlitz", the most badly damaged ship to survive the battle, was repaired by October and officially back in service by November. However, the Germans had failed in their objective of destroying a substantial portion of the British Fleet, and no progress had been made towards the goal of allowing the High Seas Fleet to operate in the Atlantic Ocean.

Subsequently, there has been considerable support for the view of Jutland as a strategic victory for the British. While the British had not destroyed the German fleet and had lost more ships than their enemy, the Germans had retreated to harbour; at the end of the battle the British were in command of the area.

The German fleet would only sortie into the North Sea thrice more, with a <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">raid on 19 August</a>, one in October 1916 and another in April 1918. All three were unopposed by capital ships and quickly aborted as neither side were prepared to take the risks of mines and submarines.

Apart from these three abortive operations the High Seas Fleet – unwilling to risk another encounter with the British fleet – confined its activities to the Baltic Sea for the remainder of the war. Jellicoe issued an order prohibiting the Grand Fleet from steaming south of the line of Horns Reef owing to the threat of mines and U-boats. A German naval expert, writing publicly about Jutland in November 1918, commented, "Our Fleet losses were severe. On 1 June 1916, it was clear to every thinking person that this battle must, and would be, the last one".

There is also significant support for viewing the battle as a German tactical victory, due to the much higher losses sustained by the British. The Germans declared a great victory immediately afterwards, while the British by contrast had only reported short and simple results. In response to public outrage, the First Lord of the Admiralty <a href="Arthur%20Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a> asked <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> to write a second report that was more positive and detailed.
At the end of the battle, the British had maintained their numerical superiority and had 23 dreadnoughts ready and four battlecruisers still able to fight, while the Germans had only 10 dreadnoughts. One month after the battle, the Grand Fleet was stronger than it had been before sailing to Jutland. "Warspite" was dry docked at Rosyth, returning to the fleet on 22 July, while "Malaya" was repaired in the floating dock at Invergordon, returning to duty on 11 July. "Barham" was docked for a month at Devonport before undergoing speed trials and returning to Scapa on 8 July. "Princess Royal" stayed initially at Rosyth but transferred to dry dock at Portsmouth before returning to duty at Rosyth 21 July. "Tiger" was dry docked at Rosyth and ready for service 2 July. "Queen Elizabeth", "Emperor of India" and , which had been undergoing maintenance at the time of the battle, returned to the fleet immediately, followed shortly after by "Resolution" and "Ramillies". "Lion" initially remained ready for sea duty despite the damaged turret, then underwent a month's repairs in July when Q turret was removed temporarily and replaced in September.

A third view, presented in a number of recent evaluations, is that Jutland, the last major fleet action between battleships, illustrated the irrelevance of battleship fleets following the development of the submarine, mine and torpedo. In this view, the most important consequence of Jutland was the decision of the Germans to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. Although large numbers of battleships were constructed in the decades between the wars, it has been argued that this outcome reflected the social dominance among naval decision-makers of battleship advocates who constrained technological choices to fit traditional paradigms of fleet action. Battleships played a relatively minor role in World War II, in which the submarine and aircraft carrier emerged as the dominant offensive weapons of naval warfare.

The official British Admiralty examination of the Grand Fleet's performance recognised two main problems:

German <a href="Armour-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armour-piercing shells</a> were far more effective than the British ones, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour. The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range. Germany had adopted <a href="trinitrotoluene">trinitrotoluene</a> (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a <a href="picric%20acid">picric acid</a> mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of <a href="fuze">fuze</a> function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the armour plate.

The issue of poorly performing shells had been known to Jellicoe, who as Third Sea Lord from 1908 to 1910 had ordered new shells to be designed. However, the matter had not been followed through after his posting to sea and new shells had never been thoroughly tested. Beatty discovered the problem at a party aboard "Lion" a short time after the battle, when a Swedish Naval officer was present. He had recently visited Berlin, where the German navy had scoffed at how British shells had broken up on their ships' armour. The question of shell effectiveness had also been raised after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a>, but no action had been taken. Hipper later commented, "It was nothing but the poor quality of their bursting charges which saved us from disaster."

Admiral Dreyer, writing later about the battle, during which he had been captain of the British flagship "Iron Duke", estimated that effective shells as later introduced would have led to the sinking of six more German capital ships, based upon the actual number of hits achieved in the battle. The system of testing shells, which remained in use up to 1944, meant that, statistically, a batch of shells of which 70% were faulty stood an even chance of being accepted. Indeed, even shells that failed this relatively mild test had still been issued to ships. Analysis of the test results afterwards by the Ordnance Board suggested the likelihood that 30–70% of shells would not have passed the standard penetration test specified by the Admiralty.

Efforts to replace the shells were initially resisted by the Admiralty, and action was not taken until Jellicoe became First Sea Lord in December 1916. As an initial response, the worst of the existing shells were withdrawn from ships in early 1917 and replaced from reserve supplies. New shells were designed, but did not arrive until April 1918, and were never used in action.

British battlecruisers were designed to chase and destroy enemy cruisers from out of the range of those ships. They were not designed to be <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> and exchange <a href="broadside">broadside</a>s with the enemy. One German and three British battlecruisers were sunk—but none were destroyed by enemy shells penetrating the belt armour and detonating the magazines. Each of the British battlecruisers was penetrated through a turret roof and her magazines ignited by flash fires passing through the turret and shell-handling rooms. "Lützow" sustained 24 hits and her flooding could not be contained. She was eventually sunk by her escorts' torpedoes after most of her crew had been safely removed (though six trapped stokers died when the ship was scuttled). "Derfflinger" and "Seydlitz" sustained 22 hits each but reached port (although in "Seydlitz"'s case only just).

Jellicoe and Beatty, as well as other senior officers, gave an impression that the loss of the battlecruisers was caused by weak armour, despite reports by two committees and earlier statements by Jellicoe and other senior officers that Cordite and its management were to blame. This led to calls for armour to be increased, and an additional was placed over the relatively thin decks above magazines. To compensate for the increase in weight, ships had to carry correspondingly less fuel, water and other supplies. Whether or not thin deck armour was a potential weakness of British ships, the battle provided no evidence that it was the case. At least amongst the surviving ships, no enemy shell was found to have penetrated deck armour anywhere. The design of the new battlecruiser (which had started building at the time of the battle) was altered to give her of additional armour.

British and German <a href="propellant">propellant</a> charges differed in packaging, handling, and chemistry. The British propellant was of two types, MK1 and MD. The Mark 1 cordite had a formula of 37% nitrocellulose, 58% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. It was a good propellant but burned hot and caused an erosion problem in gun barrels. The petroleum jelly served as both a lubricant and a stabiliser. Cordite MD was developed to reduce barrel wear, its formula being 65% nitrocellulose, 30% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. While cordite MD solved the gun-barrel erosion issue, it did nothing to improve its storage properties, which were poor. Cordite was very sensitive to variations of temperature, and acid propagation/cordite deterioration would take place at a very rapid rate. Cordite MD also shed micro-dust particles of nitrocellulose and iron pyrite. While cordite propellant was manageable, it required a vigilant gunnery officer, strict cordite lot control, and frequent testing of the cordite lots in the ships' magazines.

British <a href="cordite">cordite</a> propellant (when uncased and exposed in the silk bag) tended to burn violently, causing uncontrollable "flash fires" when ignited by nearby shell hits. In 1945, a test was conducted by the U.S.N. Bureau of Ordnance (Bulletin of Ordnance Information, No.245, pp. 54–60) testing the sensitivity of cordite to then-current U.S. Naval propellant powders against a measurable and repeatable flash source. It found that cordite would ignite at 530 mm/22" from the flash, the current U.S. powder at 120 mm, /5", and the U.S. flashless powder at 25 mm./1"/

This meant that about 75 times the propellant would immediately ignite when exposed to flash, as compared to the U.S. powder. British ships had inadequate protection against these flash fires. German propellant ("RP C/12", handled in brass cartridge cases) was less vulnerable and less volatile in composition. German propellants were not that different in composition from cordite—with one major exception: <a href="centralite">centralite</a>. This was symmetrical Diethyl Diphenyl Urea, which served as a stabiliser that was superior to the petroleum jelly used in British practice. It stored better and burned but did not explode. Stored and used in brass cases, it proved much less sensitive to flash. RP C/12 was composed of 64.13% nitrocellulose, 29.77% nitroglycerine, 5.75% centralite, 0.25% magnesium oxide and 0.10% graphite.

The Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet had also emphasised speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, cordite could not be supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open that should have been shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions. This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices. Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.

The British cordite charges were stored two silk bags to a metal cylindrical container, with a 16-oz gunpowder igniter charge, which was covered with a thick paper wad, four charges being used on each projectile. The gun crews were removing the charges from their containers and removing the paper covering over the gunpowder igniter charges. The effect of having eight loads at the ready was to have of exposed explosive, with each charge leaking small amounts of gunpowder from the igniter bags. In effect, the gun crews had laid an explosive train from the turret to the magazines, and one shell hit to a battlecruiser turret was enough to end a ship.

A diving expedition during the summer of 2003 provided corroboration of this practice. It examined the wrecks of "Invincible", "Queen Mary", "Defence", and "Lützow" to investigate the cause of the British ships' tendency to suffer from internal explosions. From this evidence, a major part of the blame may be laid on lax handling of the cordite propellant for the shells of the main guns. The wreck of the "Queen Mary" revealed cordite containers stacked in the working chamber of the X turret instead of the magazine.

There was a further difference in the propellant itself. While the German "RP C/12" burned when exposed to fire, it did not explode, as opposed to cordite. "RP C/12" was extensively studied by the British and, after World War I, would form the basis of the later Cordite SC.

The memoirs of Alexander Grant, Gunner on "Lion", suggest that some British officers were aware of the dangers of careless handling of cordite:

Grant had already introduced measures onboard "Lion" to limit the number of cartridges kept outside the magazine and to ensure doors were kept closed, probably contributing to her survival.

On 5 June 1916, the First Lord of the Admiralty advised Cabinet Members that the three battlecruisers had been lost due to unsafe cordite management.

On 22 November 1916, following detailed interviews of the survivors of the destroyed battlecruisers, the Third Sea Lord, Rear Admiral Tudor, issued a report detailing the stacking of charges by the gun crews in the handling rooms to speed up loading of the guns.

After the battle, the B.C.F. Gunnery Committee issued a report (at the command of Admiral David Beatty) advocating immediate changes in flash protection and charge handling. It reported, among other things, that:

The United States Navy in 1939 had quantities of Cordite N, a Canadian propellant that was much improved, yet its <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a> objected strongly to its use onboard U.S. warships, considering it unsuitable as a naval propellant due to its inclusion of nitroglycerin.

British gunnery control systems, based on <a href="Dreyer%20Fire%20Control%20Table">Dreyer tables</a>, were well in advance of the German ones, as demonstrated by the proportion of main calibre hits made on the German fleet. Because of its demonstrated advantages, it was installed on ships progressively as the war went on, had been fitted to a majority of British capital ships by May, 1916, and had been installed on the main guns of all but two of the Grand Fleet's capital ships. The Royal Navy used centralised <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>s on their capital ships, directed from a point high up on the ship where the fall of shells could best be seen, utilising a director sight for both training and elevating the guns. In contrast, the German battlecruisers controlled the fire of turrets using a training-only director, which also did not fire the guns at once. The rest of the German capital ships were without even this innovation. German range-finding equipment was generally superior to the British FT24, as its operators were trained to a higher standard due to the complexity of the Zeiss range finders. Their <a href="Stereoscopic%20rangefinder">stereoscopic</a> design meant that in certain conditions they could range on a target enshrouded by smoke. The German equipment was not superior in range to the British <a href="Barr%20%26amp%3B%20Stroud">Barr & Stroud</a> rangefinder found in the newest British capital ships, and, unlike the British range finders, the German range takers had to be replaced as often as every thirty minutes, as their eyesight became impaired, affecting the ranges provided to their gunnery equipment.

The results of the battle confirmed the value of firing guns by centralised director. The battle prompted the Royal Navy to install director firing systems in cruisers and destroyers, where it had not thus far been used, and for secondary armament on battleships.

German ships were considered to have been quicker in determining the correct range to targets, thus obtaining an early advantage. The British used a 'bracket system', whereby a salvo was fired at the best-guess range and, depending where it landed, the range was progressively corrected up or down until successive shots were landing in front of and behind the enemy. The Germans used a 'ladder system', whereby an initial volley of three shots at different ranges was used, with the centre shot at the best-guess range. The ladder system allowed the gunners to get ranging information from the three shots more quickly than the bracket system, which required waiting between shots to see how the last had landed. British ships adopted the German system.

It was determined that range finders of the sort issued to most British ships were not adequate at long range and did not perform as well as the range finders on some of the most modern ships. In 1917, range finders of base lengths of were introduced on the battleships to improve accuracy.

Throughout the battle, British ships experienced difficulties with communications, whereas the Germans did not suffer such problems. The British preferred signalling using ship-to-ship flag and lamp signals, avoiding wireless, whereas the Germans used wireless successfully. One conclusion drawn was that flag signals were not a satisfactory way to control the fleet. Experience using lamps, particularly at night when issuing challenges to other ships, demonstrated this was an excellent way to advertise your precise location to an enemy, inviting a reply by gunfire. Recognition signals by lamp, once seen, could also easily be copied in future engagements.

British ships both failed to report engagements with the enemy but also, in the case of cruisers and destroyers, failed to actively seek out the enemy. A culture had arisen within the fleet of not acting without orders, which could prove fatal when any circumstances prevented orders being sent or received. Commanders failed to engage the enemy because they believed other, more senior officers must also be aware of the enemy nearby, and would have given orders to act if this was expected. Wireless, the most direct way to pass messages across the fleet (although it was being jammed by German ships), was avoided either for perceived reasons of not giving away the presence of ships or for fear of cluttering up the airwaves with unnecessary reports.

Naval operations were governed by standing orders issued to all the ships. These attempted to set out what ships should do in all circumstances, particularly in situations where ships would have to react without referring to higher authority, or when communications failed. A number of changes were introduced as a result of experience gained in the battle.

A new signal was introduced instructing squadron commanders to act independently as they thought best while still supporting the main fleet, particularly for use when circumstances would make it difficult to send detailed orders. The description stressed that this was not intended to be the only time commanders might take independent action, but was intended to make plain times when they definitely should. Similarly, instructions on what to do if the fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away with the rest of the fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer's destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy.

A number of opportunities to attack enemy ships by torpedo had presented themselves but had been missed. All ships, not just the destroyers armed principally with torpedoes but also battleships, were reminded that they carried torpedoes intended to be used whenever an opportunity arose. Destroyers were instructed to close the enemy fleet to fire torpedoes as soon as engagements between the main ships on either side would keep enemy guns busy directed at larger targets. Destroyers should also be ready to immediately engage enemy destroyers if they should launch an attack, endeavouring to disrupt their chances of launching torpedoes and keep them away from the main fleet.

To add some flexibility when deploying for attack, a new signal was provided for deploying the fleet to the centre, rather than as previously only either to left or right of the standard closed-up formation for travelling. The fast and powerful 5th Battle Squadron was moved to the front of the cruising formation so it would have the option of deploying left or right depending upon the enemy position. In the event of engagements at night, although the fleet still preferred to avoid night fighting, a destroyer and cruiser squadron would be specifically detailed to seek out the enemy and launch destroyer attacks.

At the time, Jellicoe was criticised for his caution and for allowing Scheer to escape. Beatty, in particular, was convinced that Jellicoe had missed a tremendous opportunity to annihilate the High Seas Fleet and win what would amount to another <a href="battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Trafalgar</a>. Jellicoe was promoted away from active command to become First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy, while Beatty replaced him as commander of the Grand Fleet.

The controversy raged within the navy and in public for about a decade after the war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the south-east, and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. Supporters of Jellicoe, including the historian <a href="Cyril%20Falls">Cyril Falls</a>, pointed to the folly of risking defeat in battle when one already has <a href="command%20of%20the%20sea">command of the sea</a>. Jellicoe himself, in a letter to the Admiralty seventeen months before the battle, said that he intended to turn his fleet away from any mass torpedo attack (that being the universally accepted proper tactical response to such attacks, practised by all the major navies of the world). He said that, in the event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away, he would assume they intended to draw him over mines or submarines, and he would decline to be so drawn. The Admiralty approved this plan and expressed full confidence in Jellicoe at the time (October 1914).

The stakes were high, the pressure on Jellicoe immense, and his caution certainly understandable. His judgement might have been that even 90% odds in favour were not good enough to bet the British Empire. The former <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> said of the battle that Jellicoe "was the only man on either side who could have lost the war in an afternoon."

The criticism of Jellicoe also fails to sufficiently credit Scheer, who was determined to preserve his fleet by avoiding the full British battle line, and who showed great skill in effecting his escape.

On the other hand, some of Jellicoe's supporters condemned the actions of Beatty for the British failure to achieve a complete victory. Although Beatty was undeniably brave, his mismanagement of the initial encounter with Hipper's squadron and the High Seas Fleet cost considerable advantage in the first hours of the battle. His most glaring failure was in not providing Jellicoe with periodic information on the position, course, and speed of the High Seas Fleet. Beatty, aboard the battlecruiser "Lion", left behind the four fast battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron – the most powerful warships in the world at the time – engaging with six ships when better control would have given him 10 against Hipper's five. Though Beatty's larger guns out-ranged Hipper's guns by thousands of yards, Beatty held his fire for 10 minutes and closed the German squadron until within range of the Germans' superior gunnery, under lighting conditions that favoured the Germans. Most of the British losses in tonnage occurred in Beatty's force.

The total loss of life was 9,823 men, of which the British losses were 6,784 and German losses were 3,039. Counted among the British losses are 2 members of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>, and 1 member of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Royal Canadian Navy</a>. 6 Australian nationals serving in the Royal Navy were also killed.

In the years following the battle the wrecks were slowly discovered. was found by the Royal Navy minesweeper in 1919. After the Second World War some of the wrecks seem to have been commercially salvaged. For instance, the Hydrographic Office record for SMS "Lützow" (No.32344) shows that salvage operations were taking place on the wreck in 1960.

During 2000–2016 a series of diving and marine survey expeditions involving veteran shipwreck historian and archaeologist <a href="Innes%20McCartney">Innes McCartney</a> has located all of the wrecks sunk in the battle. It was discovered that over 60% of them had suffered from metal theft. In 2003 McCartney led a detailed survey of the wrecks for the <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> documentary "Clash of the Dreadnoughts". The film examined the last minutes of the lost ships and revealed for the first time how both 'P' and 'Q' turrets of had been blasted out of the ship and tossed into the sea before she broke in half. This was followed by the <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> documentary "Jutland: WWI's Greatest Sea Battle", broadcast in May 2016, which showed how several of the major losses at Jutland had actually occurred and just how accurate the "Harper Record" actually was.

On the 90th anniversary of the battle, in 2006, the UK Ministry of Defence belatedly announced that the 14 British vessels lost in the battle were being designated as "protected places" under the <a href="Protection%20of%20Military%20Remains%20Act%201986">Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</a>. This legislation only affects British ships and citizens and in practical terms offers no real protection from non-British salvors of the wreck sites. In May 2016 a number of British newspapers named the Dutch salvage company "Friendship Offshore" as one of the main salvors of the Jutland wrecks in recent years and depicted leaked photographs revealing the extent of their activities on the wreck of .

The last surviving veteran of the battle, <a href="Henry%20Allingham">Henry Allingham</a>, a British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> (originally <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">RNAS</a>) airman, died on 18 July 2009, aged 113, by which time he was the oldest documented man in the world and one of the last surviving veterans of the whole war. Also among the combatants was the then 20-year-old <a href="George%20VI">Prince Albert</a>, second in the line to the British throne, who would reign as King George VI of the United Kingdom from 1936 until his death in 1952. He served as a junior officer in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>.

In 2013, one ship from the battle survives and is still afloat, the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> . Decommissioned in 2011, she is docked at the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">Royal Naval Reserve</a> depot in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, Northern Ireland.

The Battle of Jutland was annually celebrated as a great victory by the right wing in <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Germany</a>. This victory was used to repress the memory of the German navy's initiation of the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%931919">German Revolution of 1918–1919</a>, as well as the memory of the defeat in World War I in general. (The celebrations of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tannenberg">Battle of Tannenberg</a> played a similar role.) This is especially true for the city of <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, where wreath-laying ceremonies and torch-lit parades were performed until the end of the 1960s.
In 1916 Contreadmiral Friedrich von Kühlwetter (1865-1931) wrote a detailed analysis of the battle and published it in a book under the title "Skagerrak" (first anonymously published), which was reprinted in large numbers until after WWII and had a huge influence in keeping the battle in public memory amongst Germans as it was not tainted by the ideology of the Third Reich. Kühlwetter built the School for Naval Officers at Mürwik near Flensburg where he is still remembered.

In May 2016, the 100th Anniversary commemoration of the Battle of Jutland was held. On 29 May, a commemorative service was held at St Mary's Church, Wimbledon, where the ensign from HMS Inflexible is on permanent display. On 31 May, the main service was held at <a href="St%20Magnus%20Cathedral">St Magnus Cathedral</a> in <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>, attended by the British Prime Minister, <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>, and the German President, <a href="Joachim%20Gauck">Joachim Gauck</a>, along with <a href="Anne%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Princess Anne</a> and Vice Admiral <a href="Timothy%20Laurence">Sir Tim Laurence</a>.

Bambara language

The Bambara (Bamana) language, Bamanankan, is a <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> and <a href="national%20language">national language</a> of <a href="Mali">Mali</a> spoken by perhaps 15 million people, natively by 5 million <a href="Bambara%20people">Bambara people</a> and about 10 million <a href="Second%20language">second-language</a> users. It is estimated that about 80 percent of the population of Mali speak Bambara as a first or second language. It has a <a href="subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb">subject–object–verb</a> clause structure and two lexical <a href="tone%20%28tonal%20language%29">tone</a>s.

Bambara is a variety of a group of closely related languages called <a href="Manding%20languages">Manding</a>, whose native speakers trace their cultural history to the medieval <a href="Mali%20Empire">Mali Empire</a>. Varieties of Manding are generally considered (among native speakers) to be mutually intelligible – dependent on exposure or familiarity with dialects between speakers – and spoken by 30 to 40 million people in the countries <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>, <a href="Guinea%20Bissau">Guinea Bissau</a>, <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>, <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a> and <a href="the%20Gambia">the Gambia</a>. Manding is part of the larger <a href="Mande%20languages">Mandé</a> family of languages.

It uses seven vowels a, e, ɛ, i, o, ɔ and u (the letters approximate their equivalents).
Writing began during the <a href="French%20West%20Africa">French</a> occupation, and the first orthography was introduced in 1967. Literacy is limited, especially in rural areas. Although written literature is only slowly evolving (due to the predominance of French as the "language of the educated"), there exists a wealth of <a href="oral%20history">oral literature</a>, which is often tales of kings and heroes. This oral literature is mainly tradited by the <a href="griot">griot</a>s ("Jeliw" in Bambara) who are a mixture of <a href="storytelling">storyteller</a>s, <a href="praise%20singer">praise singer</a>s, and human history books who have studied the trade of singing and reciting for many years. Many of their songs are very old and are said to date back to the old kingdom of Mali.

Bambara is spoken throughout Mali as a lingua franca. The language is most widely spoken in the areas east, south, and north of Bamako, where native speakers and/or those that identify as members of the Bambara ethnic group are most densely populated. These regions are also usually considered to be the historical geographical origin of Bambara people, particularly <a href="Segou">Segou</a>, after diverging from other Manding groups.

The main dialect is Standard Bamara, which has significant influence from Maninkakan. Bambara has many local dialects: Kaarta, Tambacounda (west); Beledugu, Bananba, Mesekele (north); Jitumu, Jamaladugu, Segu (center); Cakadugu, Keleyadugu, Jalakadougu, Kurulamini, Banimɔncɛ, Cɛmala, Cɛndugu, Baninkɔ, Shɛndugu, Ganadugu (south); Kala, Kuruma, Saro, dialects to the northeast of Mopti (especially Bɔrɛ); Zegedugu, Bɛndugu, Bakɔkan, Jɔnka (southeast).,

Since 1967, Bambara has mostly been written in the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>, using <a href="African%20reference%20alphabet">some additional phonetic characters</a>. The vowels are "a, e, <a href="%C9%9B">ɛ</a>" (formerly "<a href="%C3%A8">è</a>"), "i, o, <a href="%C9%94">ɔ</a>" (formerly "<a href="%C3%B2">ò</a>"), "u"; accents can be used to indicate tonality. The former digraph "ny" is now written "<a href="%C9%B2">ɲ</a>" when it designates a palatal nasal glide; the "ny" spelling is kept for the combination of a nasal vowel with a subsequent oral palatal glide. Following the 1966 Bamako spelling conventions, a nasal velar glide "<a href="%C5%8B">ŋ</a>" is written as "<a href="%C5%8B">ŋ</a>", although in early publications it was often transcribed as "ng" or "nk".

The <a href="N%27Ko%20script">N'Ko</a> () alphabet is a script devised by <a href="Solomana%20Kante">Solomana Kante</a> in 1949 as a writing system for the Manding languages of West Africa; N’Ko means 'I say' in all Manding languages. Kante created N’Ko in response to what he felt were beliefs that Africans were a "cultureless people" since prior to this time there had been no indigenous African writing system for his language. N'ko came first into use in Kankan, Guinea as a Maninka alphabet and disseminated from there into other Manding-speaking parts of West Africa. N'ko and the <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic script</a> are still in use for Bambara, although the Latin script is much more common.

Each consonant represents a single sound. Although, there are some exceptions:

Like Turkish and Japanese, it is an agglutinative language, meaning that morphemes are glued together to form a word.

The basic sentence structure is Subject Object Verb. Take the phrase, "n t'a don" (I don't know [it]). "n" is the subject (me), "a" is the object (it), and "[ka] don" is the verb ([to] know). The "t'" is from the present tense marker "té." "té" is the negative present tense marker and "bé" is the affirmative present tense marker. Therefore, "n b'a don" would mean "I know it".

Bambara is an <a href="subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb">SOV</a> language and has two (mid/standard and high) <a href="tone%20%28tonal%20language%29">tone</a>s; e.g. "sa" 'die' vs. "sá" 'snake.' The typical argument structure of the language consists of a subject, followed by an aspectival auxiliary, followed by the direct object, and finally a transitive verb. Naturally, if the verb is intransitive, the direct object is absent.

Bambara does not inflect for gender. Gender for a noun can be specified by adding an adjective, "-cɛ" or "-kɛ" for male and "-muso" for female. The plural is formed by attaching a vocalic suffix "-u", most often with a low tone (in the orthography, "-w") to nouns or adjectives.

Bambara uses postpositions in much the same manner as languages like English and French use prepositions. These postpositions are found after the verb and are used to express direction, location, and in some cases, possession.

In urban areas, many Bambara conjunctions have been replaced in everyday use by French borrowings that often mark code-switches. The <a href="Bamako">Bamako</a> dialect makes use of sentences like: "N taara Kita mais il n'y avait personne là-bas." : "I went to Kita [Bambara] but there was no one there [French]." The sentence in Bambara alone would be "N taara Kita nka mɔgɔsi tuntɛ yen." The French proposition "est-ce que" is also used in Bambara; however, it is pronounced more slowly and as three syllables, .

Bambara uses many French loan words. For example, some people might say:
"I ka kulosi ye jauni ye": "Your skirt is yellow" (using a derivation of the French word for yellow, jaune.)

However, one could also say:
"I ka kulosi ye neremuguman ye", also meaning "your skirt is yellow." The original Bambara word for yellow comes from ""neremugu"," being flour ("mugu") made from <a href="Parkia%20biglobosa">néré</a> (locust bean), a seed from a long seed pod. Neremugu is often used in sauces in Southern Mali.

Most French loan words are suffixed with the sound 'i'; this is particularly common when using French words which have a meaning not traditionally found in Mali. For example, the Bambara word for <a href="snow">snow</a> is "niegei", based on the French word for snow "neige". As there has never been snow in Mali, there has not been a traditional meaning for the word and thus no unique word in Bambara to describe it.

Malian artists such as <a href="Oumou%20Sangar%C3%A9">Oumou Sangaré</a>, <a href="Sidiki%20Diabat%C3%A9">Sidiki Diabaté</a>, <a href="Rokia%20Traor%C3%A9">Rokia Traoré</a>, <a href="Ali%20Farka%20Tour%C3%A9">Ali Farka Touré</a>, <a href="Salif%20Keita">Salif Keita</a>, <a href="Habib%20Koit%C3%A9">Habib Koité</a>, and the married duo <a href="Amadou%20%26amp%3B%20Mariam">Amadou & Mariam</a> often sing in Bambara. Aïda of the band <a href="M%C3%A9tisse%20%28band%29">Métisse</a> often sings in <a href="Dyula%20language">Dioula</a>, as does <a href="Mory%20Kante">Mory Kante</a>, born in Guinea to a Malian mother; his most famous song to date is "Yeke Yeke" (<a href="Alpha%20Blondy">Alpha Blondy</a>). Lyrics in Bambara occur on <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>'s soundtrack "<a href="Journey%20through%20the%20Secret%20Life%20of%20Plants">Journey through the Secret Life of Plants</a>".
<a href="Tiken%20Jah%20Fakoly">Tiken Jah Fakoly</a> (reggae) often sings in Dioula and French.

Additionally, in 2010, <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> rock group <a href="Dover%20%28band%29">Dover</a> released its 7th studio album <a href="I%20Ka%20Ken%C3%A9">I Ka Kené</a>, with the majority of lyrics in the language. American rapper <a href="Nas">Nas</a> also released a track titled "Sabali" in 2010, which featured <a href="Damian%20Marley">Damian Marley</a>. "Sabali" is a Bambara word that means patience.

Bambara is one of several languages designated by Mali as a <a href="national%20language">national language</a>.

Baku

Baku ( , ; , ) is the capital and largest city of <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, as well as the largest city on the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> and of the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> region. Baku is located below <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, which makes it the <a href="List%20of%20capital%20cities%20by%20altitude">lowest lying national capital in the world</a> and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. It is located on the southern shore of the <a href="Absheron%20Peninsula">Absheron Peninsula</a>, alongside the <a href="Bay%20of%20Baku">Bay of Baku</a>. At the beginning of 2009, Baku's <a href="urban%20population">urban population</a> was estimated at just over two million people. Officially, about 25 percent of all inhabitants of the country live in Baku's <a href="metropolitan%20area">metropolitan area</a>.

Baku is divided into <a href="Baku%23Administrative%20divisions">twelve administrative districts</a> (raions) and 48 townships. Among these are the townships on the islands of the <a href="Baku%20Archipelago">Baku Archipelago</a>, and the town of <a href="Oil%20Rocks">Oil Rocks</a> built on stilts in the Caspian Sea, away from Baku. The <a href="Old%20City%20%28Baku%29">Inner City of Baku</a>, along with the <a href="Palace%20of%20the%20Shirvanshahs">Shirvanshah's Palace</a> and <a href="Maiden%20Tower%20%28Baku%29">Maiden Tower</a>, were inscribed as a UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> in 2000. According to the <a href="Lonely%20Planet">Lonely Planet</a>'s ranking, Baku is also among the world's top ten destinations for urban nightlife.

The city is the scientific, cultural and industrial center of Azerbaijan. Many sizeable Azerbaijani institutions have their headquarters there. The <a href="Baku%20International%20Sea%20Trade%20Port">Baku International Sea Trade Port</a> is capable of handling two million tons of general and dry bulk cargoes per year. In recent years, Baku has become an important venue for international events. It hosted the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202012">57th Eurovision Song Contest</a> in 2012, the <a href="2015%20European%20Games">2015 European Games</a>, the 2016 <a href="European%20Grand%20Prix">European Grand Prix</a>, 4th <a href="Islamic%20Solidarity%20Games">Islamic Solidarity Games</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan%20Grand%20Prix">Azerbaijan Grand Prix</a> in 2017, and will host <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202020">UEFA Euro 2020</a>.

The city is renowned for its harsh winds, which is reflected in its nickname, the "<a href="City%20of%20Winds">City of Winds</a>".

Baku is derived from the <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> name of the city باد-کوبه "Bād-kube", meaning "Wind-pounded city", in which "bād" means "wind" and "kube" is rooted in the verb کوبیدن "kubidan", "to pound", thus referring to a place where wind is strong and pounding. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds. This is also reflected in the city's nickname as the "<a href="City%20of%20Winds">City of Winds</a>". A less probable <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a> explains the name as deriving from "Baghkuy", meaning "God's town". "Baga" (now "بغ" "bagh") and "kuy" are the <a href="Old%20Persian%20language">Old Persian</a> words for "god" and "town" respectively; the name "Baghkuy" may be compared with "<a href="Baghdad">Baghdād</a>" ("God-given") in which "dād" is the Old Persian word for "give". <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> sources refer to the city as "Baku", "Bakukh", "Bakuya", and "Bakuye", all of which seem to come from a Persian name.

During <a href="Azerbaijan%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Soviet rule</a>, the city was spelled in Cyrillic as "Бакы". Nowadays, when Azerbaijan is using the Latin alphabet, it is spelled as "Bakı".

Around 100,000 years ago, the territory of modern Baku and <a href="Absheron%20Rayon">Absheron</a> was <a href="savanna">savanna</a> with rich flora and fauna. Traces of human settlement go back to the <a href="Stone%20age">Stone age</a>. From the <a href="Bronze%20age">Bronze age</a> there have been rock carvings discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish discovered in the territory of the Old City. These have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze Age settlement within the city's territory. Near <a href="Nardaran">Nardaran</a>, in a place called Umid Gaya, a prehistoric observatory was discovered, where on the rock the images of sun and various constellations are carved together with a primitive astronomic table. Further archeological excavations revealed various prehistoric settlements, native temples, statues and other artifacts within the territory of the modern city and around it.

In the 1st century CE, the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a> organized two Caucasian campaigns and reached Baku. Near the city, in <a href="Gobustan%20National%20Park">Gobustan</a>, Roman inscriptions dating from 84–96 CE were discovered. This is one of the earliest written evidences for Baku.

Baku was the realm of the <a href="Shirvanshahs">Shirvanshahs</a> during the 8th century CE. The city frequently came under assault of the <a href="Khazars">Khazars</a> and (starting from the 10th century) the <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Rus</a>. <a href="Akhsitan%20I%20ibn%20Minuchihr%20III">Shirvanshah Akhsitan I</a> built a navy in Baku and successfully repelled another Rus assault in 1170. After a devastating earthquake struck <a href="Shamakhi">Shamakhi</a>, the capital of <a href="Shirvan">Shirvan</a>, Shirvanshah’s court moved to Baku in 1191.
The Shirvan era greatly influenced Baku and the remainder of what is present-day Azerbaijan. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, massive fortifications were undertaken in Baku and the surrounding towns. The <a href="Maiden%20Tower%20%28Baku%29">Maiden Tower</a>, the <a href="Ramana%20Tower">Ramana Tower</a>, the <a href="Nardaran%20Fortress">Nardaran Fortress</a>, the Shagan Castle, the <a href="Quadrangular%20castle%20%28Mardakan%29">Mardakan Castle</a>, the <a href="Round%20Castle%20%28Mardakan%29">Round Castle</a> and also the famous <a href="Sabayil%20Castle">Sabayil Castle</a> on the island of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Baku">Bay of Baku</a> was built during this period. The <a href="Old%20City%20%28Baku%29">city walls of Baku</a> were also rebuilt and strengthened.

By the early 16th century Baku's wealth and strategic position attracted the focus of its larger neighbors; in the previous two centuries, it was under the rule of the in Iran-centred <a href="Kara%20Koyunlu">Kara Koyunlu</a> and <a href="Ak%20Koyunlu">Ak Koyunlu</a>. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed Iranian <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid dynasty</a>, led by king ("<a href="shah">shah</a>") <a href="Ismail%20I">Ismail I</a> (r. 1501-1524). Ismail I laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it; he allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty. His successor, king <a href="Tahmasp%20I">Tahmasp I</a> (r. 1524-1576), completely removed the Shirvanshahs from power, and made Baku a part of the <a href="Safavid%20Shirvan">Shirvan</a> province. Baku remained as an integral part of his empire and the successive Iranian dynasties to come for the next centuries, until the irrevocable cession in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Gulistan">first half of the 19th century</a>. The House of Shirvan, who ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished in the course of the Safavid rule.

At this time the city was enclosed within the lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. The Ottomans briefly gained control over Baku as a result of the <a href="Ottoman-Safavid%20War%20%281578-1590%29">Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590</a>; by 1603, it was again put under Iranian control. In 1604 the Baku fortress was destroyed by Shah <a href="Abbas%20I%20of%20Persia">Abbas I</a> (r. 1588-1629).

In the wake of the demise of the Safavids, the Russians took advantage of the situation <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281722-1723%29">and invaded</a>; the Safavids were forced to cede Baku to Russia for a few years. By 1730, the situation had deteriorated for the Russians; the successes of <a href="Nader%20Shah">Nader Shah</a> (r. 1736-1747) forced them to make an <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ganja">agreement</a> near <a href="Ganja%2C%20Azerbaijan">Ganja</a> on 10 March 1735, ceding the city and all other conquered territories in the Caucasus back to <a href="Iran">Iran</a>.

The erupation of instability following Nader Shah's death gave rise to the various <a href="Khanates%20of%20the%20Caucasus">Caucasian khanates</a>. The semi-autonomous Persian-ruled <a href="Baku%20Khanate">Baku Khanate</a> was once of these. It was ruled by Mirza Muhammed Khan but soon became a dependency of the much stronger <a href="Quba%20Khanate">Quba Khanate</a>. During the time, the population of Baku was small (approximately 5,000), and the economy was ruined as a result of constant warfare.

From the late 18th century, Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south, namely Iran and the Ottoman Empire. In the spring of 1796, by <a href="Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia">Catherine II</a>’s order, General <a href="Valerian%20Zubov">Valerian Zubov</a>’s troops started <a href="Persian%20Expedition%20of%201796">a large campaign</a> against <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Qajar</a> Persia. Zubov had sent 13,000 men to capture Baku, and it was overrun subsequently without any resistance. On 13 June 1796, a Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay, and a garrison of Russian troops was placed inside the city. Later, however, <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Pavel I</a> ordered the cessation of the campaign and the withdrawal of Russian forces following his predecessor, <a href="Catherine%20the%20Great">Catherine the Great</a> her death. In March 1797, the tsarist troops left Baku and the city became part of <a href="Qajar%20Iran">Qajar Iran</a> again.

In 1813, following the <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281804%E2%80%9313%29">Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813</a>, Qajar Iran was forced to sign the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Gulistan">Treaty of Gulistan</a> with Russia, which provided for the irrevocable cession of Baku and most of Iran's territories in the <a href="North%20Caucasus">North Caucasus</a> and <a href="South%20Caucasus">South Caucasus</a> to Russia. During the next and final bout of hostilities between the two, the <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281826%E2%80%9328%29">Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828</a>, Baku was briefly recaptured by the Iranians. However, militarily superior, the Russians ended this war in a victory as well, and the resulting <a href="Treaty%20of%20Turkmenchay">Treaty of Turkmenchay</a> made its inclusion into the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> definite.
When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281804%E2%80%9313%29">war of 1804–13</a>, nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic <a href="Tat%20people%20%28Caucasus%29">Tat</a>.

The first <a href="oil%20well">oil well</a> was mechanically drilled in the <a href="Bibi-Heybat%20Mosque">Bibi-Heybat</a> suburb of Baku in 1846, though a number of hand-dug wells predate it. Large-scale oil exploration started in 1872, when Russian imperial authorities auctioned the parcels of oil-rich land around Baku to private investors. The pioneer of oil extracting from the bottom of the sea was Polish geologist Witold Zglenicki. Soon after that Swiss, British, French, Belgian, German, Swedish and American investors appeared in Baku. Among them were the firms of the <a href="Robert%20Nobel">Nobel brothers</a> together with the family <a href="Schuch">von Börtzell-Szuch</a> (Carl Knut Börtzell, who also owned the <a href="Livadia%20Palace">Livadia Palace</a>) and the <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschild family</a>. An industrial oil belt, better known as Black City, was established near Baku.

Professor <a href="A.%20V.%20Williams%20Jackson">A. V. Williams Jackson</a> of Columbia University wrote in his work "From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam" (1911):
By the beginning of the 20th century, half of the oil sold in international markets was being extracted in Baku. The <a href="oil%20boom">oil boom</a> contributed to the massive growth of Baku. Between 1856 and 1910 Baku's population grew at a faster rate than that of <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a> or <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>.

In 1917, after the <a href="October%20Revolution">October revolution</a> and amidst the turmoil of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and the <a href="Russian%20revolution">breakup of the Russian Empire</a>, Baku came under the control of the <a href="26%20Baku%20Commissars">Baku Commune</a>, which was led by veteran Bolshevik <a href="Stepan%20Shahumyan">Stepan Shahumyan</a>. Seeking to capitalize on the existing inter-ethnic conflicts, by spring 1918, Bolsheviks inspired and condoned civil warfare in and around Baku. During the infamous <a href="March%20Days">March Days</a>, Bolsheviks and <a href="Armenian%20Revolutionary%20Federation">Dashnaks</a> seeking to establish control over the Baku streets, were faced with armed Azerbaijani groups. The Azerbaijanis suffered a crushing defeat by the united forces of the Baku Soviet and were massacred by Dashnak teams in what was called <a href="March%20Days">March Days</a>. An estimated 3–12,000 Azerbaijanis were killed in their own capital. After the massacre, on 28 May 1918, the Azerbaijani faction of the <a href="Transcaucasian%20Democratic%20Federative%20Republic">Transcaucasian Sejm</a> proclaimed the independence of the <a href="Azerbaijan%20Democratic%20Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a> (ADR) in <a href="Ganja%2C%20Azerbaijan">Ganja</a>, thereby becoming the first Muslim-majority <a href="democratic%20republic">democratic</a> and <a href="secular">secular</a> <a href="republic">republic</a>. The newly independent Azerbaijani republic, being unable to defend the independence of the country on their own, asked the Ottoman Empire for military support in accordance with clause 4 of the treaty between the two countries. Shortly after, Azerbaijani forces, with support of the <a href="Ottoman%20Army%20of%20Islam">Ottoman Army of Islam</a> led by <a href="Nuri%20Killigil">Nuru Pasha</a>, started their advance into Baku, eventually capturing the city from the loose coalition of <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s, <a href="Socialist-Revolutionary%20Party">Esers</a>, <a href="Armenian%20Revolutionary%20Federation">Dashnaks</a>, <a href="Menshevik">Menshevik</a>s and British forces under the command of General <a href="Lionel%20Dunsterville">Lionel Dunsterville</a> on 15 September 1918.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Baku">Battle of Baku</a>, the Azerbaijani irregular troops, with the tacit support of the Turkish command, conducted four days of pillaging and killing of 10–30,000 of the <a href="Armenians%20in%20Baku">Armenian residents of Baku</a>. This pogrom was known as the <a href="September%20Days">September Days</a>. Shortly after this Baku was proclaimed the new capital of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

With Turkey having lost the war by October 1918 they conducted the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Mudros">Armistice of Mudros</a> with the British which meant Baku was to be evacuated. Headed by General <a href="William%20Montgomery%20Thomson">William Thomson</a>, British troops of 5,000 soldiers, including parts of Dunsterforce, arrived in Baku on 17 November. Thomson declared himself military governor of Baku and implemented <a href="Martial%20law">Martial law</a> on the capital until "the civil power would be strong enough to release the forces from the responsibility to maintain the public order". British forces left before the end of 1919 having felt they had done so.

The independence of the Azerbaijani republic was a significant but a short lived chapter. On 28 April 1920, the <a href="11th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">11th Red Army</a> invaded Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the <a href="Azerbaijan%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic</a>.

The city underwent many major changes. As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of the Soviet life. Since about 1921, the city was headed by the Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as "Bakgorispolkom". Together with the Baku Party Committee (known as the "Baksovet"), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930, Baku was the venue for one of the major <a href="Trade%20fair">Trade fair</a>s of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.

Baku's growing importance as a major energy hub remained in sight of the major powers. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and the <a href="Case%20Blue">Nazi German invasion of the southwestern Soviet Union</a>, Baku had become of vital strategic importance. In fact, capturing the <a href="Petroleum%20industry%20in%20Azerbaijan%23World%20War%20II">oil fields of Baku</a> was one of the ultimate goals of <a href="Operation%20Edelweiss">Operation Edelweiss</a>, carried out between May and November 1942. However the German Army's closest approach to Baku was no closer than some northwest of Baku in November 1942, falling far short of the city's capture before being driven back during the Soviet <a href="Operation%20Little%20Saturn">Operation Little Saturn</a> in mid-December 1942.

After the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a>, Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history. Thousands of buildings from the Soviet period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the <a href="Baku%20Bay">Baku Bay</a>. Improvements were made in the general cleaning, maintenance, and garbage collection, and these services are now at Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at full speed on an east-west axis along the shores of the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. Sustainability has become a key factor in future urban development.

Baku is situated on the western coast of <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. In the vicinity of the city there are a number of <a href="mud%20volcano">mud volcano</a>es (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, <a href="Lokbatan">Lokbatan</a> and others) and <a href="salt%20lake">salt lake</a>s (<a href="Lake%20Boyukshor">Boyukshor</a>, Khodasan and so on).

Baku has a <a href="temperate">temperate</a> <a href="semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>: "BSk") with warm and dry summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with this climate, Baku does not see extremely hot summers. This is largely because of its northerly <a href="latitude">latitude</a> and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea.
Baku and the <a href="Absheron%20Peninsula">Absheron Peninsula</a> on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan (<a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> here is around or less than a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these seasons are particularly wet.
During Soviet times, Baku with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated <a href="destination%20spa">spa</a> complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea. The city's past as a Soviet industrial center has left it as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

At the same time Baku is noted as a very windy city throughout the year, hence the city's nickname the "<a href="City%20of%20Winds">City of Winds</a>", and gale-force winds, the cold northern wind "<a href="khazri">khazri</a>" and the warm southern wind "<a href="gilavar">gilavar</a>" are typical here in all seasons. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.
The speed of the "khazri" sometimes reaches 144 kph (89 mph), which can cause damage to crops, trees and roof tiles.

The daily mean temperature in July and August averages , and there is very little rainfall during that season. During summer the "khazri" sweeps through, bringing desired coolness. Winter is cool and occasionally wet, with the daily mean temperature in January and February averaging . During winter the "khazri" sweeps through, driven by polar <a href="air%20mass">air mass</a>es; temperatures on the coast frequently drop below freezing and make it feel bitterly cold. Winter <a href="Winter%20storm">snow storms</a> are occasional; <a href="snow">snow</a> usually melts within a few days after each snowfall.

Today, Baku is divided into 12 "rayonlar (sub-rayons)" (administrative districts) and 5 settlements of city type. The mayor, presently <a href="Hajibala%20Abutalybov">Hajibala Abutalybov</a>, embodies the executive power of the city.

Until 1988 Baku had very large Russian, Armenian, and Jewish populations which contributed to <a href="cultural%20diversity">cultural diversity</a> and added in various ways (music, literature, architecture and progressive outlook) to Baku's history. With the onset of the <a href="Karabakh%20War">Karabakh War</a> and the <a href="Pogrom%20of%20Armenians%20in%20Baku">pogrom against Armenians</a> starting in January 1990, the city's large Armenian population was expelled.
Under Communism, the Soviets took over the majority of Jewish property in Baku and Kuba. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, <a href="President%20of%20Azerbaijan">Azerbaijani President</a> <a href="Heydar%20Aliyev">Heydar Aliyev</a> returned several synagogues and a Jewish college, nationalized by the Soviets, to the Jewish community. He encouraged the restoration of these buildings and is well liked by the Jews of Azerbaijan. Renovation has begun on seven of the original 11 synagogues, including the Gilah synagogue, built in 1896, and the large Kruei Synagogue.

Today the vast majority of the population of Baku are ethnic <a href="Azerbaijani%20people">Azerbaijanis</a> (more than 90%). When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281804%E2%80%9313%29">war of 1804–13</a>, nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic <a href="Tat%20people%20%28Caucasus%29">Tat</a>. The intensive growth of the population started in the middle of the 19th century when Baku was a small town with a population of about 7,000 people. The population increased again from about 13,000 in the 1860s to 112,000 in 1897 and 215,000 in 1913, making Baku the largest city in the Caucasus region.

Baku has been a cosmopolitan city at certain times during its history, meaning ethnic Azerbaijanis did not constitute the majority of population. In 2003 Baku additionally had 153,400 <a href="internally%20displaced%20person">internally displaced person</a>s and 93,400 refugees.

The urban landscape of Baku is shaped by many communities. The religion with the largest community of followers is Islam. The majority of the Muslims are <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia Muslims</a>, and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second highest Shia population percentage in the world after <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. The city's notable mosques include <a href="Juma%20Mosque%20%28Baku%29">Juma Mosque</a>, <a href="Bibi-Heybat%20Mosque">Bibi-Heybat Mosque</a>, <a href="Muhammad%20Mosque%20%28Baku%29">Muhammad Mosque</a> and <a href="Taza%20Pir%20Mosque">Taza Pir Mosque</a>.

There are some other faiths practiced among the different ethnic groups within the country. By article 48 of its <a href="Constitution%20of%20Azerbaijan">Constitution</a>, Azerbaijan is a <a href="secular%20state">secular state</a> and ensures religious freedom. Religious minorities include <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Christians</a>, <a href="Levantines%20%28Latin%20Christians%29">Catholic Levantines</a>, <a href="Georgian%20Orthodox%20Church">Georgian Orthodox Christians</a>, <a href="Lutherans">Lutherans</a>, <a href="Azerbaijani%20Jews">Ashkenazi</a> Jews and <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> Muslims.

<a href="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>, although extinct in the city as well as in the rest of the country by the present time, had a long <a href="Zoroastrianism%20in%20Azerbaijan">history in Azerbaijan</a> and the <a href="Nowruz">Zoroastrian New Year</a> (Nowruz) continues to be the main holiday in the city as well as in the rest of Azerbaijan.

Baku's largest industry is petroleum, and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to Azerbaijan's <a href="balance%20of%20payments">balance of payments</a>. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku. By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells.
Commercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the <a href="Petroleum%20industry%20in%20Azerbaijan">Baku oil fields</a> were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century <a href="skilled%20worker">skilled worker</a>s and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of <a href="Petroleum%20industry">oil industry</a> equipment before World War II. The World War II <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a> was fought to determine who would have control of the Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.

Currently the oil economy of Baku is undergoing a resurgence, with the development of the massive <a href="Azeri%E2%80%93Chirag%E2%80%93Guneshli">Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli</a> field (Shallow water Gunashli by <a href="State%20Oil%20Company%20of%20Azerbaijan%20Republic">SOCAR</a>, deeper areas by a consortium led by <a href="BP">BP</a>), development of the <a href="Shah%20Deniz%20gas%20field">Shah Deniz gas field</a>, the expansion of the <a href="Sangachal%20Terminal">Sangachal Terminal</a> and the construction of the <a href="Baku%E2%80%93Tbilisi%E2%80%93Ceyhan%20pipeline">BTC Pipeline</a>.

Baku has wildly varying architecture, ranging from the <a href="Old%20City%20%28Baku%29">Old City</a> core to modern buildings and the spacious layout of the Baku port. Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built during the early 20th century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in <a href="eclecticism">eclectic</a> style. Baku thus has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the 'Paris of the East'.

Hamam tradition in Baku is one of interesting one. There are a number of ancient hamams in Baku belonging to 12th, 14th and 18th centuries. Hamams also plays a very important role in the architectural appearance of Baku.

Gum hamam was discovered during archaeological excavations. It belongs to the XII-XIV. It was under sand, that`s why it is called Gum hamam (sand bath).

In old times Bairamali hamam was called “Bey hamam”. The hamam belongs to the XII-XIV centuries. In 1881 the hamam was reconstructed.

Agha Mikayil Hamam was constructed in the XVIII century by Haji Agha Mikayil in Kichik Gala Street of Old city (icherisheher). It is still operating keeping its ancient atmosphere. The hamam is open to women on Mondays and Fridays, men the rest of the week.

The Old City of Baku, also known as the Walled City of Baku, refers to the ancient Baku settlement. Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived.

Balalaika

The balalaika (, ) is a Russian <a href="string%20instrument">stringed</a> <a href="musical%20instrument">musical instrument</a> with a characteristic triangular wooden, hollow body and three strings. Two strings are usually tuned to the same note and the third string is a <a href="perfect%20fourth">perfect fourth</a> higher. The higher-pitched balalaikas are used to play melodies and chords. The instrument generally has a short <a href="sustain">sustain</a>, necessitating rapid strumming or plucking when it is used used to play melodies. Balalaikas are often used for Russian folk music and dancing.

The balalaika "family of instruments" includes instruments of various sizes, from the highest-pitched to the lowest: the piccolo balalaika, prima balalaika, secunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass balalaika, and contrabass balalaika. There are balalaika orchestras which consist solely of different balalaikas; these ensembles typically play Classical music that has been arranged for balalaikas. The prima balalaika is the most common; the piccolo is rare. There have also been "descant" and "tenor" balalaikas, but these are considered obsolete. All have three-sided bodies; spruce, evergreen, or fir tops; and backs made of three to nine wooden sections (usually maple). They are typically strung with three strings, and the necks are fretted.

The prima balalaika, secunda and alto are played either with the fingers or a <a href="plectrum">plectrum</a> (pick), depending on the music being played, and the bass and contrabass (equipped with extension legs that rest on the floor) are played with leather plectra. The rare piccolo instrument is usually played with a pick.

The earliest mention of the term "balalaika" dates back to a 1688 Russian document. The term "balabaika" was used in Ukrainian language document from 18th century. According to one theory, the term was loaned to Russian, where – in literary language – it first appeared in "Elysei", a 1771 poem by V. Maykov.

The most common solo instrument is the prima, which is tuned E–E–A (thus the two lower <a href="strings%20%28music%29">strings</a> are <a href="Musical%20tuning">tuned</a> to the same pitch). Sometimes the balalaika is tuned "guitar style" by folk musicians to G–B–D (mimicking the three highest strings of the <a href="Russian%20guitar">Russian guitar</a>), whereby it is easier to play for Russian guitar players, although classically trained balalaika purists avoid this tuning. It can also be tuned to E–A–D, like its cousin, the <a href="domra">domra</a>, to make it easier for those trained on the domra to play the instrument, and still have a balalaika sound. The folk (pre-Andreev) tuning D–F–A was very popular, as this makes it easier to play certain <a href="riff">riff</a>s.

The balalaika has been made the following sizes:

Factory-made six-string prima balalaikas with three sets of double courses are also common. These have three double courses similar to the stringing of the <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a> and often use a "guitar" tuning.

Four string alto balalaikas are also encountered and are used in the orchestra of the <a href="Piatnistky%20Folk%20Choir">Piatnistky Folk Choir</a>.

The piccolo, prima, d secunda balalaikas were originally strung with gut with the thinnest melody string made of stainless steel. Today, nylon strings are commonly used in place of gut.

An important part of balalaika technique is the use of the left thumb to fret notes on the lower string, particularly on the prima, where it is used to form <a href="chord%20%28music%29">chords</a>. Traditionally, the side of the <a href="index%20finger">index finger</a> of the right hand is used to sound notes on the prima, while a <a href="plectrum">plectrum</a> is used on the larger sizes.

Because of the large size of the contrabass's strings, it is not uncommon to see players using plectra made from a leather shoe or boot <a href="heel%20%28shoe%29">heel</a>. The bass balalaika and contrabass balalaika rest on the ground, on a wooden or metal pin that is drilled into one of its corners.

The exact origins of the balalaika are unknown.

However, it is commonly agreed that it descended from the <a href="domra">domra</a>, an instrument from the <a href="Caucasus%20region">Caucasus region</a> of Russia. There is also similarity to the Kazakh <a href="dombra">dombra</a>, which has 2 strings, and the Mongolian <a href="topshur">topshur</a>.

Early representations of the balalaika show it with anywhere from two to six strings, which resembles certain Central Asian instruments. Similarly, <a href="fret">fret</a>s on earlier balalaikas were made of animal gut and tied to the neck so that they could be moved around by the player at will (as is the case with the modern <a href="baglama">saz</a>, which allows for the playing distinctive to Turkish and Central Asian music).

The first known document mentioning the instrument dates back to 1688. A guard's logbook from the <a href="Moscow%20Kremlin">Moscow Kremlin</a> records that two <a href="commoners">commoners</a> were stopped from playing the Balalika whilst drunk. Further documents from 1700 and 1714 also mention the instrument. In the early 18th century the term appeared in Ukrainian documents, where it sounded like "Balabaika". Balalaika appeared in "Elysei", a 1771 poem by V. Maikov. In the 19th century, the balalaika evolved into a triangular instrument with a neck that was substantially shorter than that of its Asian counterparts. It was popular as a village instrument for centuries, particularly with the "<a href="skomorokh">skomorokh</a>s", sort of free-lance musical <a href="jester">jester</a>s whose tunes ridiculed the <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>, the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>, and Russian society in general.

In the 1880s, <a href="Vasily%20Vasilievich%20Andreyev">Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev</a>, who was then a professional violinist in the music salons of St Petersburg, developed what became the standardized balalaika, with the assistance of violin maker V. Ivanov. The instrument began to be used in his concert performances. A few years later, St. Petersburg craftsman Paserbsky further refined the instruments by adding a fully chromatic set of frets and also a number of balalaikas in orchestral sizes with the tunings now found in modern instruments. Andreyev patented the design and arranged numerous traditional Russian folk melodies for the orchestra. He also composed a body of concert pieces for the instrument.

The end result of Andreyev's labours was the establishment of an orchestral folk tradition in Tsarist Russia, which later grew into a movement within the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The balalaika orchestra in its full form consists of balalaikas, <a href="domra">domra</a>s, <a href="gusli">gusli</a>, <a href="bayan%20%28music%29">bayan</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Shepherd%27s%20Horns">Vladimir Shepherd's Horns</a>, <a href="garmoshka">garmoshka</a>s and several types of percussion instruments.

With the establishment of the Soviet system and the entrenchment of a proletarian cultural direction, the culture of the working classes (which included that of village labourers) was actively supported by the Soviet establishment. The concept of the balalaika orchestra was adopted wholeheartedly by the Soviet government as something distinctively proletarian (that is, from the working classes) and was also deemed progressive. Significant amounts of energy and time were devoted to support and foster formal study of the balalaika, from which highly skilled ensemble groups such as the <a href="Osipov%20State%20Russian%20Folk%20Orchestra">Osipov State Russian Folk Orchestra</a> emerged. Balalaika virtuosi such as <a href="Boris%20Feoktistov">Boris Feoktistov</a> and <a href="Pavel%20Necheporenko">Pavel Necheporenko</a> became stars both inside and outside the Soviet Union. The movement was so powerful that even the renowned <a href="Alexandrov%20Ensemble">Red Army Choir</a>, which initially used a normal symphonic orchestra, changed its instrumentation, replacing violins, <a href="viola">viola</a>s, and <a href="violoncello">violoncello</a>s with orchestral balalaikas and <a href="domra">domra</a>s.

Often musicians perform solo on the balalaika. In particular, <a href="Alexey%20Arkhipovsky">Alexey Arkhipovsky</a> is well known for his solo performances. In particular, he was invited to play at the opening ceremony of the second semi final of the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202009">Eurovision Song Contest 2009</a> in Moscow because the organizers wanted to give a "more Russian appearance" to the contest.

Through the 20th century, interest in Russian folk instruments grew outside of Russia, likely as a result of western tours by Andreyev and other balalaika virtuosi early in the century. Significant balalaika associations are found in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York; Atlanta and Seattle.

Bank of China Tower (Hong Kong)

The Bank of China Tower (abbreviated BOC Tower) is one of the most recognisable skyscrapers in <a href="Central%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Central</a>, <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>. It houses the headquarters for the <a href="Bank%20of%20China%20%28Hong%20Kong%29%20Limited">Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited</a>. The building is located at 1 <a href="Garden%20Road%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Garden Road</a>, in <a href="Central%20and%20Western%20District">Central and Western District</a> on <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Island">Hong Kong Island</a>.

Designed by <a href="I.%20M.%20Pei">I. M. Pei</a> and <a href="L.C%20Pei">L.C Pei</a> of I.M Pei and Partners, the building is high with two masts reaching high.
It was the <a href="List%20of%20tallest%20buildings%20in%20Hong%20Kong">tallest building in Hong Kong</a> and Asia from 1989 to 1992, and it was the first <a href="supertall%20skyscraper">supertall skyscraper</a> outside the United States, the first to break the 305 m (1,000 ft) mark. It is now the fourth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, after <a href="International%20Commerce%20Centre">International Commerce Centre</a>, <a href="Two%20International%20Finance%20Centre">Two International Finance Centre</a> and <a href="Central%20Plaza">Central Plaza</a>.

The site on which the building is constructed was formerly the location of <a href="Murray%20House">Murray House</a>. After its brick-by-brick relocation to <a href="Stanley%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Stanley</a>, the site was sold by the Government for "only HK$1 billion" in August 1982 amidst growing concern over the future of Hong Kong in the run-up to the <a href="Transfer%20of%20sovereignty%20of%20Hong%20Kong">transfer of sovereignty</a>.

Once developed, gross floor area was expected to be 100,000 m². The original project was intended for completion on the <a href="Numbers%20in%20Chinese%20culture">auspicious</a> date of 8 August 1988. However, owing to project delays, groundbreaking took place in March 1985, almost two years late. It was topped out in 1989, and occupied on 15 June 1990.

The building was initially built by the Hong Kong Branch of the Bank of China; its Garden Road entrance continues to display the name "Bank of China", rather than BOCHK. The top four and the bottom 19 stories are used by the Bank, while the other floors are leased out. Ownership has since been transferred to BOCHK, although the Bank of China has leased back several floors for use by its own operations in Hong Kong.

The Government had apparently given preferential treatment to Chinese companies, and was again criticised for the apparent preferential treatment to the BOCHK.

The price paid was half the amount of the 6,250 m² Admiralty II plot, for which the <a href="MTR%20Corporation">MTR Corporation</a> paid HK$1.82 billion in cash. The BOC would make initial payment of $60 million, with the rest payable over 13 years at 6% interest. The announcement of the sale was also poorly handled, and a dive in business confidence ensued. The <a href="Hang%20Seng%20Index">Hang Seng Index</a> fell 80 points, and the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20dollar">HK$</a> lost 1.5% of its value the next day.

Designed by <a href="Pritzker%20Prize">Pritzker Prize</a>-winning architect <a href="I.%20M.%20Pei">I. M. Pei</a>, the building is high with two masts reaching high. The 72-story building is located near <a href="Central%20%28MTR%29">Central MTR station</a>. This was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1990 to 1992, the first building outside the United States to break the 305 m (1,000 ft) mark, and the first composite <a href="space%20frame">space frame</a> high-rise building. That also means it was the tallest outside the United States from its completion year, 1990. It is now the fourth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, after <a href="International%20Commerce%20Centre">International Commerce Centre</a>, <a href="Two%20International%20Finance%20Centre">Two International Finance Centre</a> and <a href="Central%20Plaza">Central Plaza</a>.

A small observation deck on the 43rd floor of the building is open to the public.

The <a href="structural%20expressionism">structural expressionism</a> adopted in the design of this building resembles growing bamboo shoots, symbolising livelihood and prosperity. The whole structure is supported by the four steel columns at the corners of the building, with the triangular frameworks transferring the weight of the structure onto these four columns. It is covered with glass curtain walls.

While its distinctive look makes it one of Hong Kong's most identifiable landmarks today, it was the source of some controversy at one time, as the bank is the only major building in Hong Kong to have bypassed the convention of consulting with <a href="feng%20shui">feng shui</a> masters on matters of design prior to construction.

The building has been criticised by some practitioners of feng shui for its sharp edges and its negative symbolism by the numerous 'X' shapes in its original design, though Pei modified the design to some degree before construction following this feedback. The building's profile from some angles resembles that of a <a href="Cleaver%20%28knife%29">meat cleaver</a> This earned it the nickname “一把刀”(Yaat Baa Dou) in Cantonese, literally meaning 'One Knife'.The Bank Of China Tower can be accessed by the MTR by going through Chater Garden from <a href="Central%20Station">Central Station</a> Exit J2.

Blind Lemon Jefferson

Lemon Henry "Blind Lemon" Jefferson (September 24, 1893 – December 19, 1929) was an American <a href="blues">blues</a> and <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a> singer, songwriter, and musician. He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the "Father of the <a href="Texas%20Blues">Texas Blues</a>".

Jefferson's performances were distinctive because of his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists. Later blues and <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> musicians, however, did attempt to imitate both his songs and his musical style.

Jefferson was born <a href="Blindness">blind</a> (or possibly partially blind), near <a href="Coutchman%2C%20Texas">Coutchman, Texas</a>. He was the youngest of seven (or possibly eight) children born to Alex and Clarissa Jefferson, who were <a href="Sharecropping">sharecroppers</a>. Disputes regarding the date of his birth derive from contradictory census records and draft registration records. By 1900, the family was farming southeast of <a href="Streetman%2C%20Texas">Streetman, Texas</a>, and his birth date is indicated as September 1893 in the <a href="1900%20census">1900 census</a>. The <a href="1910%20United%20States%20Census">1910 census</a>, taken in May, before his birthday, further confirms his year of birth as 1893 and indicated that the family was farming northwest of Wortham, near his birthplace.

In his 1917 <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">draft registration</a>, Jefferson gave his birth date as October 26, 1894, further stating that he then lived in <a href="Dallas%2C%20Texas">Dallas, Texas</a>, and had been blind since birth. In the <a href="1920%20United%20States%20Census">1920 census</a>, he is recorded as having returned to <a href="Freestone%20County%2C%20Texas">Freestone County</a> and was living with his half-brother, Kit Banks, on a farm between Wortham and Streetman.

Jefferson began playing the guitar in his early teens and soon after he began performing at picnics and parties. He became a <a href="busking">street musician</a>, playing in <a href="East%20Texas">East Texas</a> towns in front of barbershops and on street corners. According to his cousin Alec Jefferson, quoted in the notes for "Blind Lemon Jefferson, Classic Sides":

In the early 1910s, Jefferson began traveling frequently to Dallas, where he met and played with the blues musician <a href="Lead%20Belly">Lead Belly</a>. Jefferson was one of the earliest and most prominent figures in the blues movement developing in the <a href="Deep%20Ellum">Deep Ellum</a> section of Dallas. It is likely that he moved to Deep Ellum on a more permanent basis by 1917, where he met Aaron Thibeaux Walker, also known as <a href="T-Bone%20Walker">T-Bone Walker</a>. Jefferson taught Walker the basics of playing blues guitar in exchange for Walker's occasional services as a guide. By the early 1920s, Jefferson was earning enough money for his musical performances to support a wife and, possibly, a child. However, firm evidence of his marriage and children has not been found.

Prior to Jefferson, few artists had recorded solo voice and blues guitar, the first of which were the vocalist <a href="Sara%20Martin">Sara Martin</a> and the guitarist Sylvester Weaver, who recorded "Longing for Daddy Blues", probably on October 24, 1923. The first self-accompanied solo performer of a self-composed blues song was <a href="Lee%20Morse">Lee Morse</a>, whose "Mail Man Blues" was recorded on October 7, 1924. Jefferson's music is uninhibited and represented the classic sounds of everyday life, from a <a href="honky-tonk">honky-tonk</a> to a country picnic, to street corner blues, to work in the burgeoning oil fields (a reflection of his interest in mechanical objects and processes).

Jefferson did what few had ever done before him – he became a successful solo guitarist and male vocalist in the commercial recording world. Unlike many artists who were "discovered" and recorded in their normal venues, Jefferson was taken to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Illinois, in December 1925 or January 1926 to record his first tracks. Uncharacteristically, his first two recordings from this session were <a href="Gospel%20music">gospel</a> songs ("<a href="Lord%2C%20I%20Want%20to%20Be%20a%20Christian">I Want to Be Like Jesus in My Heart</a>" and "All I Want Is That Pure Religion"), released under the name Deacon L. J. Bates. A second recording session was held in March 1926. His first releases under his own name, "Booster Blues" and "Dry Southern Blues", were hits. Their popularity led to the release of the other two songs from that session, "Got the Blues" and "Long Lonesome Blues", which became a runaway success, with sales in six figures. He recorded about 100 tracks between 1926 and 1929; 43 <a href="gramophone%20record">records</a> were issued, all but one for <a href="Paramount%20Records">Paramount Records</a>. Paramount's studio techniques and quality were poor, and the recordings were released with poor sound quality. In May 1926, Paramount re-recorded Jefferson performing his hits "Got the Blues" and "Long Lonesome Blues" in the superior facilities at <a href="Autograph%20Records">Marsh Laboratories</a>, and subsequent releases used those versions. Both versions appear on compilation albums.

Largely because of the popularity of artists such as Jefferson and his contemporaries <a href="Blind%20Blake">Blind Blake</a> and <a href="Ma%20Rainey">Ma Rainey</a>, Paramount became the leading recording company for the blues in the 1920s. Jefferson's earnings reputedly enabled him to buy a car and employ chauffeurs (this information has been disputed); he was given a Ford car "worth over $700" by <a href="Mayo%20Williams">Mayo Williams</a>, Paramount's connection with the black community. This was a common compensation for recording rights in that market. Jefferson is known to have done an unusual amount of traveling for the time in the American South, which is reflected in the difficulty of placing his music in a single regional category.

Jefferson's "old-fashioned" sound and confident musicianship made it easy to market him. His skillful guitar playing and impressive vocal range opened the door for a new generation of male solo blues performers, such as <a href="Furry%20Lewis">Furry Lewis</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Patton">Charlie Patton</a>, and <a href="Barbecue%20Bob">Barbecue Bob</a>. He stuck to no musical conventions, varying his <a href="riff">riff</a>s and rhythm and singing complex and expressive lyrics in a manner exceptional at the time for a "simple country blues singer." According to the North Carolina musician Walter Davis, Jefferson played on the streets in <a href="Johnson%20City%2C%20Tennessee">Johnson City, Tennessee</a>, during the early 1920s, at which time Davis and the entertainer Clarence Greene learned the art of blues guitar.

Jefferson was reputedly unhappy with his royalties (although Williams said that Jefferson had a bank account containing as much as $1500). In 1927, when Williams moved to <a href="Okeh%20Records">Okeh Records</a>, he took Jefferson with him, and Okeh quickly recorded and released Jefferson's "Matchbox Blues", backed with "<a href="That%20Black%20Snake%20Moan">Black Snake Moan</a>". It was his only Okeh recording, probably because of contractual obligations with Paramount. Jefferson's two songs released on Okeh have considerably better sound quality than his Paramount records at the time. When he returned to Paramount a few months later, "Matchbox Blues" had already become such a hit that Paramount re-recorded and released two new versions, with the producer <a href="Arthur%20Laibly">Arthur Laibly</a>. In 1927, Jefferson recorded another of his classic songs, the haunting "<a href="See%20That%20My%20Grave%20Is%20Kept%20Clean">See That My Grave Is Kept Clean</a>" (again using the pseudonym Deacon L. J. Bates), and two other uncharacteristically spiritual songs, "He Arose from the Dead" and "Where Shall I Be". "See That My Grave Is Kept Clean" was so successful that it was re-recorded and re-released in 1928.

Jefferson died in Chicago at 10:00 a.m. on December 19, 1929, of what his death certificate said was "probably acute <a href="myocarditis">myocarditis</a>". For many years, rumors circulated that a jealous lover had poisoned his coffee, but a more likely explanation is that he died of a heart attack after becoming disoriented during a snowstorm. Some have said that he died of a heart attack after being attacked by a dog in the middle of the night. The book "Tolbert's Texas" claimed that he was killed while being robbed of a large royalty payment by a guide escorting him to Union Station to catch a train home to Texas. Paramount Records paid for the return of his body to Texas by train, accompanied by the pianist <a href="William%20Ezell">William Ezell</a>.

Jefferson was buried at Wortham Negro Cemetery (later Wortham Black Cemetery). Far from being <a href="See%20That%20My%20Grave%20Is%20Kept%20Clean">kept clean</a>, his grave was unmarked until 1967, when a Texas historical marker was erected in the general area of his plot, the precise location of which is unknown. By 1996, the cemetery and marker were in poor condition, and a new granite headstone was erected in 1997. In 2007, the cemetery's name was changed to Blind Lemon Memorial Cemetery, and his gravesite is kept clean by a cemetery committee in Wortham, Texas.

Jefferson had an intricate and fast style of guitar playing and a particularly high-pitched voice. He was a founder of the <a href="Texas%20blues">Texas blues</a> sound and an important influence on other blues singers and guitarists, including <a href="Lead%20Belly">Lead Belly</a> and <a href="Lightnin%27%20Hopkins">Lightnin' Hopkins</a>.

He was the author of many songs covered by later musicians, including the classic "<a href="See%20That%20My%20Grave%20Is%20Kept%20Clean">See That My Grave Is Kept Clean</a>". Another of his songs, "<a href="Matchbox%20%28song%29">Matchbox Blues</a>", was recorded more than 30 years later by the <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatles</a>, in a <a href="rockabilly">rockabilly</a> version credited to <a href="Carl%20Perkins">Carl Perkins</a>, who did not credit Jefferson on his 1955 recording.

The <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> selected Jefferson's 1927 recording of "<a href="Matchbox%20%28song%29">Matchbox Blues</a>" as one of the 500 songs that shaped rock and roll. Jefferson was among the inaugural class of blues musicians inducted into the <a href="Blues%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Blues Hall of Fame</a> in 1980.

Baku (spirit)

The Japanese term "baku" has two current meanings, referring to both the traditional dream-devouring creature and to the <a href="Malayan%20tapir">Malayan tapir</a>. In recent years, there have been changes in how the baku is depicted.

The traditional Japanese nightmare-devouring baku originates in <a href="Chinese%20folklore">Chinese folklore</a> and was familiar in Japan as early as the <a href="Muromachi%20period">Muromachi period</a> (14th-15th century). Hori Tadao has described the dream-eating abilities attributed to the traditional baku and relates them to other preventatives against nightmare such as <a href="amulet">amulet</a>s. <a href="Kaii-Y%C5%8Dkai%20Densh%C5%8D%20Database">Kaii-Yōkai Denshō Database</a>, citing a 1957 paper, and Mizuki also describe the dream-devouring capacities of the traditional baku.

An early 17th-century Japanese manuscript, the "Sankai Ibutsu" (), describes the baku as a shy, Chinese mythical <a href="chimera%20%28mythology%29">chimera</a> with an <a href="elephant">elephant</a>’s trunk, <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>' eyes, an <a href="ox">ox</a>'s tail, and a <a href="tiger">tiger</a>'s paws, which protected against pestilence and evil, although eating nightmares was not included among its abilities. However, in a 1791 Japanese wood-block illustration, a specifically dream-destroying baku is depicted with an elephant’s head, tusks, and trunk, with horns and tiger’s claws. The elephant’s head, trunk, and tusks are characteristic of baku portrayed in classical era (pre-<a href="Meiji%20period">Meiji</a>) Japanese wood-block prints (see illustration) and in shrine, temple, and <a href="netsuke">netsuke</a> carvings.

Writing in the <a href="Meiji%20period">Meiji period</a>, <a href="Lafcadio%20Hearn">Lafcadio Hearn</a> (1902) described a baku with very similar attributes that was also able to devour nightmares.
Legend has it, that a person who wakes up from a bad dream can call out to baku. A child having a nightmare in Japan will wake up and repeat three times, "Baku-san, come eat my dream." Legends say that the baku will come into the child’s room and devour the bad dream, allowing the child to go back to sleep peacefully. However, calling to the baku must be done sparingly, because if he remains hungry after eating one’s nightmare, he may also devour their hopes and desires as well, leaving them to live an empty life. The baku can also be summoned for protection from bad dreams prior to falling asleep at night. To this day, it remains common for Japanese children to keep a baku talisman at their bedside.

Blackbeard

Edward Teach or Edward Thatch (22 November 1718), better known as Blackbeard, was a notorious English <a href="Piracy">pirate</a> who operated around the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> and the eastern coast of Britain's <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">North American colonies</a>. Although little is known about his early life, he was probably born in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, England. Recent genealogical research indicates his family moved to Jamaica where Edward Thatch, Jr. is listed as being a mariner in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> aboard HMS "Windsor" in 1706. He may have been a sailor on <a href="privateer">privateer</a> ships during <a href="Queen%20Anne%27s%20War">Queen Anne's War</a> before settling on the <a href="The%20Bahamas">Bahamian</a> island of <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a>, a base for Captain <a href="Benjamin%20Hornigold">Benjamin Hornigold</a>, whose crew Teach joined sometime around 1716. Hornigold placed him in command of a <a href="sloop">sloop</a> he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by <a href="Stede%20Bonnet">Stede Bonnet</a>, but toward the end of 1717 Hornigold retired from piracy, taking two vessels with him.

Teach captured a French merchant vessel, renamed her "<a href="Queen%20Anne%27s%20Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a>", and equipped her with 40 guns. He became a renowned pirate, his <a href="Cognomen%23As%20a%20contemporary%20term">cognomen</a> derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he was reported to have tied lit fuses under his hat to frighten his enemies. He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charles Town, South Carolina</a>. After successfully ransoming its inhabitants, he ran "Queen Anne's Revenge" aground on a sandbar near <a href="Beaufort%2C%20North%20Carolina">Beaufort, North Carolina</a>. He parted company with Bonnet and settled in <a href="Bath%2C%20North%20Carolina">Bath Town</a>, where he accepted a royal pardon. But he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of <a href="Alexander%20Spotswood">Alexander Spotswood</a>, the <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">Governor of Virginia</a>. Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to try to capture the pirate, which they did on 22 November 1718. During a ferocious battle, Teach and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant <a href="Robert%20Maynard">Robert Maynard</a>.

A shrewd and calculating leader, Teach spurned the use of force, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response he desired from those he robbed. Contrary to the modern-day picture of the traditional tyrannical pirate, he commanded his vessels with the permission of their crews and there is no known account of his ever having harmed or murdered those he held captive. He was romanticised after his death and became the inspiration for pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres.

Little is known about Blackbeard's early life. It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40 years old and thus born in about 1680. In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch or Edward Teach; the latter is most often used today. However, several spellings of his surname exist—Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche and Theach. One early source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely. Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in the business of piracy, so as not to tarnish the family name, and this makes it unlikely that Teach's real name will ever be known.

The 17th-century rise of Britain's American colonies and the rapid 18th-century expansion of the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> had made Bristol an important international sea port, and Teach was most likely raised in what was the second-largest city in England. He could almost certainly read and write; he communicated with merchants and when killed had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the <a href="Province%20of%20Carolina">Province of Carolina</a>, Tobias Knight. The author Robert Lee speculated that Teach may therefore have been born into a respectable, wealthy family. He may have arrived in the Caribbean in the last years of the 17th century, on a merchant vessel (possibly a <a href="slave%20ship">slave ship</a>). The 18th-century author <a href="Captain%20Charles%20Johnson">Charles Johnson</a> claimed that Teach was for some time a sailor operating from <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> on privateer ships during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, and that "he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage". At what point during the war Teach joined the fighting is, in keeping with the record of most of his life before he became a pirate, unknown.

With its history of colonialism, trade and piracy, the West Indies was the setting for many 17th and 18th-century maritime incidents. The privateer-turned-pirate <a href="Henry%20Jennings">Henry Jennings</a> and his followers decided, early in the 18th century, to use the uninhabited island of <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a> as a base for their operations; it was within easy reach of the <a href="Florida%20Strait">Florida Strait</a> and its busy shipping lanes, which were filled with European vessels crossing the Atlantic. New Providence's harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships, and was too shallow for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s larger vessels to navigate. The author George Woodbury described New Providence as "no city of homes; it was a place of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population," continuing, "The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on; all others were transient." In New Providence, pirates found a welcome respite from the law.

Teach was one of those who came to enjoy the island's benefits. Probably shortly after the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a>, he moved there from Jamaica, and with most privateers once involved in the war, became involved in piracy. Possibly about 1716, he joined the crew of Captain Benjamin Hornigold, a renowned pirate who operated from New Providence's safe waters. In 1716 Hornigold placed Teach in charge of a <a href="sloop">sloop</a> he had taken as a prize. In early 1717, Hornigold and Teach, each captaining a sloop, set out for the mainland. They captured a boat carrying 120 barrels of flour out of <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, and shortly thereafter took 100 barrels of wine from a sloop out of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. A few days later they stopped a vessel sailing from <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> to Charles Town, South Carolina. Teach and his quartermaster, William Howard, may at this time have struggled to control their crews. By then they had probably developed a taste for <a href="Madeira%20wine">Madeira wine</a>, and on 29 September near <a href="Cape%20Charles%2C%20Virginia">Cape Charles</a> all they took from the "Betty" of Virginia was her cargo of Madeira, before they <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> her with the remaining cargo.

It was during this cruise with Hornigold that the earliest known report of Teach was made, in which he is recorded as a pirate in his own right, in command of a large crew. In a report made by a Captain Mathew Munthe on an anti-piracy patrol for North Carolina, "Thatch" was described as operating "a sloop 6 gunns and about 70 men". In September Teach and Hornigold encountered Stede Bonnet, a landowner and military officer from a wealthy family who had turned to piracy earlier that year. Bonnet's crew of about 70 were reportedly dissatisfied with his command, so with Bonnet's permission, Teach took control of his ship "Revenge". The pirates' flotilla now consisted of three ships; Teach on "Revenge", Teach's old sloop and Hornigold's "Ranger". By October, another vessel had been captured and added to the small fleet. The sloops "Robert" of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and "Good Intent" of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> were stopped on 22 October 1717, and their cargo holds emptied.

As a former British privateer, Hornigold attacked only his old enemies, but for his crew, the sight of British vessels filled with valuable cargo passing by unharmed became too much, and at some point toward the end of 1717 he was demoted. Whether Teach had any involvement in this decision is unknown, but Hornigold quickly retired from piracy. He took "Ranger" and one of the sloops, leaving Teach with "Revenge" and the remaining sloop. The two never met again, and with many other occupants of New Providence, Hornigold accepted the King's pardon from <a href="Woodes%20Rogers">Woodes Rogers</a> in June the following year.

On 28 November Teach's two ships attacked a French merchant vessel off the coast of <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20%28island%29">Saint Vincent</a>. They each fired a <a href="broadside">broadside</a> across its bulwarks, killing several of its crew, and forcing its captain to surrender. The ship was "La Concorde" of <a href="Saint-Malo">Saint-Malo</a>, a large French guineaman carrying a cargo of slaves. Teach and his crews sailed the vessel south along <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a> to <a href="Bequia">Bequia</a>, where they disembarked her crew and cargo, and converted the ship for their own use. The crew of "La Concorde" were given the smaller of Teach's two sloops, which they renamed "Mauvaise Rencontre" (Bad Meeting), and sailed for Martinique. Teach may have recruited some of their slaves, but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of "Mauvaise Rencontre".

Teach immediately renamed "La Concorde" as "Queen Anne's Revenge" and equipped her with 40 guns. By this time Teach had placed his <a href="Lieutenant%20Richards%20%28pirate%29">lieutenant Richards</a> in command of Bonnet's "Revenge". In late November, near Saint Vincent, he attacked the "Great Allen". After a lengthy engagement, he forced the large and well-armed merchant ship to surrender. He ordered her to move closer to the shore, disembarked her crew and emptied her cargo holds, and then burned and sank the vessel. The incident was chronicled in the "Boston News-Letter", which called Teach the commander of a "French ship of 32 Guns, a <a href="Brigantine">Briganteen</a> of 10 guns and a Sloop of 12 guns." When or where Teach collected the ten gun briganteen is unknown, but by that time he may have been in command of at least 150 men split among three vessels.

On 5 December 1717 Teach stopped the merchant sloop "Margaret" off the coast of Crab Island, near <a href="Anguilla">Anguilla</a>. Her captain, Henry Bostock, and crew, remained Teach's prisoners for about eight hours, and were forced to watch as their sloop was ransacked. Bostock, who had been held aboard "Queen Anne's Revenge", was returned unharmed to "Margaret" and was allowed to leave with his crew. He returned to his base of operations on <a href="Saint%20Christopher%20Island">Saint Christopher Island</a> and reported the matter to Governor Walter Hamilton, who requested that he sign an <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a> about the encounter. Bostock's deposition details Teach's command of two vessels: a sloop and a large French guineaman, Dutch-built, with 36 cannon and a crew of 300 men. The captain believed that the larger ship carried valuable gold dust, silver plate, and "a very fine cup" supposedly taken from the commander of "Great Allen". Teach's crew had apparently informed Bostock that they had destroyed several other vessels, and that they intended to sail to <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> and lie in wait for an expected Spanish armada, supposedly laden with money to pay the garrisons. Bostock also claimed that Teach had questioned him about the movements of local ships, but also that he had seemed unsurprised when Bostock told him of an expected royal pardon from London for all pirates.

Bostock's deposition describes Teach as a "tall spare man with a very black beard which he wore very long". It is the first recorded account of Teach's appearance and is the source of his cognomen, Blackbeard. Later descriptions mention that his thick black beard was braided into pigtails, sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons. Johnson (1724) described him as "such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful." Whether Johnson's description was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear, but it seems likely that Teach understood the value of appearances; better to strike fear into the heart of one's enemies, than rely on bluster alone. Teach was tall, with broad shoulders. He wore knee-length boots and dark clothing, topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly coloured silk or velvet. Johnson also described Teach in times of battle as wearing "a sling over his shoulders, with three brace of pistols, hanging in holsters like bandoliers; and stuck lighted matches under his hat", the latter apparently to emphasise the fearsome appearance he wished to present to his enemies. Despite his ferocious reputation though, there are no verified accounts of his ever having murdered or harmed those he held captive. Teach may have used other aliases; on 30 November, the "Monserrat Merchant" encountered two ships and a sloop, commanded by a Captain Kentish and Captain Edwards (the latter a known alias of Stede Bonnet).

Teach's movements between late 1717 and early 1718 are not known. He and Bonnet were probably responsible for an attack off <a href="Sint%20Eustatius">Sint Eustatius</a> in December 1717. Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would head toward the Spanish-controlled <a href="Saman%C3%A1%20Bay">Samaná Bay</a> in Hispaniola, but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity. Captain Hume of reported on 6 February that a "Pyrate Ship of 36 Guns and 250 men, and a Sloop of 10 Guns and 100 men were Said to be Cruizing amongst the Leeward Islands". Hume reinforced his crew with <a href="musket">musket</a>-armed soldiers and joined up with to track the two ships, to no avail, though they discerned that the two ships had sunk a French vessel off <a href="Saint%20Kitts">St Christopher Island</a>, and reported also that they had last been seen "gone down the North side of Hispaniola". Although no confirmation exists that these two ships were controlled by Teach and Bonnet, author Angus Konstam believes it very likely they were.
In March 1718, while taking on water at Turneffe Island east of <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, both ships spotted the Jamaican logwood cutting sloop "Adventure" making for the harbour. She was stopped and her captain, <a href="David%20Herriot">Harriot</a>, invited to join the pirates. Harriot and his crew accepted the invitation, and Teach sent over a crew to sail "Adventure" making <a href="Israel%20Hands">Israel Hands</a> the captain. They sailed for the <a href="Bay%20of%20Honduras">Bay of Honduras</a>, where they added another ship and four sloops to their flotilla. On 9 April Teach's enlarged fleet of ships looted and burnt "Protestant Caesar". His fleet then sailed to <a href="Grand%20Cayman">Grand Cayman</a> where they captured a "small turtler". Teach probably sailed toward Havana, where he may have captured a small Spanish vessel that had left the Cuban port. They then sailed to the wrecks of the <a href="1715%20Treasure%20Fleet">1715 Spanish fleet</a>, off the eastern coast of <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. There Teach disembarked the crew of the captured Spanish sloop, before proceeding north to the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, attacking three vessels along the way.

By May 1718, Teach had awarded himself the rank of <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">Commodore</a> and was at the height of his power. Late that month his flotilla blockaded the port of Charles Town in the <a href="Province%20of%20South%20Carolina">Province of South Carolina</a>. All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped, and as the town had no <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a>, its <a href="pilot%20boat">pilot boat</a> was the first to be captured. Over the next five or six days about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past <a href="Charleston%20Bar">Charles Town Bar</a>, where Teach's fleet was anchored. One such ship, headed for London with a group of prominent Charles Town citizens which included Samuel Wragg (a member of the Council of the Province of Carolina), was the "Crowley". Her passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day. Teach informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina, and that if none were forthcoming, all prisoners would be executed, their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt.

Wragg agreed to Teach's demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given two days to collect the drugs. Teach moved his fleet, and the captured ships, to within about five or six <a href="League%20%28unit%29">leagues</a> from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.

Teach kept to his side of the bargain and released the captured ships and his prisoners—albeit relieved of their valuables, including the fine clothing some had worn.

Whilst at Charles Town, Teach learned that Woodes Rogers had left England with several <a href="Man-of-war">men-of-war</a>, with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates. Teach's flotilla sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into <a href="Topsail%20Inlet">Topsail Inlet</a> (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), off the coast of North Carolina. There they intended to <a href="Careening">careen</a> their ships to scrape their hulls, but "Queen Anne's Revenge" ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her <a href="main-mast">main-mast</a> and severely damaging many of her timbers. Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her. A sloop commanded by <a href="Israel%20Hands">Israel Hands</a> of "Adventure" also ran aground, and both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair, leaving only "Revenge" and the captured Spanish sloop.

Teach had at some stage learnt of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it. The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5 September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5 January. Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach at risk of being hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions. Teach thought that Governor <a href="Charles%20Eden%20%28politician%29">Charles Eden</a> was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited to see what would happen to another captain. Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon. He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the "Revenge" and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Thomas Island</a> to receive a commission. Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him. He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27 September 1718 at the mouth of the <a href="Cape%20Fear%20River">Cape Fear River</a>. All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town.

The author Robert Lee surmised that Teach and Hands intentionally ran the ships aground to reduce the fleet's crew complement, increasing their share of the spoils. During the trial of Bonnet's crew, "Revenge"s <a href="boatswain">boatswain</a> Ignatius Pell testified that "the ship was run ashore and lost, which Thatch [Teach] caused to be done." Lee considers it plausible that Teach let Bonnet in on his plan to accept a pardon from Governor Eden. He suggested that Bonnet do the same, and as war between the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Quadruple%20Alliance">Quadruple Alliance of 1718</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a> was threatening, to consider taking a privateer's commission from England. Lee suggests that Teach also offered Bonnet the return of his ship "Revenge". Konstam (2007) proposes a similar idea, explaining that Teach began to see "Queen Anne's Revenge" as something of a liability; while a pirate fleet was anchored, news of this was sent to neighbouring towns and colonies, and any vessels nearby would delay sailing. It was prudent therefore for Teach not to linger for too long, although wrecking the ship was a somewhat extreme measure.

Before sailing northward on his remaining sloop to <a href="Ocracoke%20Inlet">Ocracoke Inlet</a>, Teach marooned about 25 men on a small sandy island about a league from the mainland. He may have done this to stifle any protest they made, if they guessed their captain's plans. Bonnet rescued them two days later. Teach continued on to Bath, where in June 1718—only days after Bonnet had departed with his pardon—he and his much-reduced crew received their pardon from Governor Eden.

He settled in Bath, on the eastern side of Bath Creek at Plum Point, near Eden's home. During July and August he travelled between his base in the town and his sloop off Ocracoke. Johnson's account states that he <a href="Mary%20Ormond">married</a> the daughter of a local plantation owner, although there is no supporting evidence for this. Eden gave Teach permission to sail to St Thomas to seek a commission as a privateer (a useful way of removing bored and troublesome pirates from the small settlement), and Teach was given official title to his remaining sloop, which he renamed "Adventure". By the end of August he had returned to piracy, and in the same month the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a warrant for his arrest, but by then Teach was probably operating in <a href="Delaware%20Bay">Delaware Bay</a>, some distance away. He took two French ships leaving the Caribbean, moved one crew across to the other, and sailed the remaining ship back to Ocracoke. In September he told Eden that he had found the French ship at sea, deserted. A <a href="Vice%20admiralty%20court">Vice Admiralty Court</a> was quickly convened, presided over by Tobias Knight and the Collector of Customs. The ship was judged as a derelict found at sea, and of its cargo twenty <a href="hogshead">hogshead</a>s of sugar were awarded to Knight and sixty to Eden; Teach and his crew were given what remained in the vessel's hold.

Ocracoke Inlet was Teach's favourite anchorage. It was a perfect vantage point from which to view ships travelling between the various settlements of northeast Carolina, and it was from there that Teach first spotted the approaching ship of <a href="Charles%20Vane">Charles Vane</a>, another English pirate. Several months earlier Vane had rejected the pardon brought by Woodes Rogers and escaped the men-of-war the English captain brought with him to <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>. He had also been pursued by Teach's old commander, Benjamin Hornigold, who was by then a pirate hunter. Teach and Vane spent several nights on the southern tip of Ocracoke Island, accompanied by such notorious figures as Israel Hands, Robert Deal and <a href="Calico%20Jack">Calico Jack</a>.

As it spread throughout the neighbouring colonies, the news of Teach and Vane's impromptu party worried the Governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates. They were unsuccessful, but Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina. Some of Teach's former crew had already moved into several Virginian seaport towns, prompting Spotswood to issue a proclamation on 10 July, requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities, to give up their arms and to not travel in groups larger than three. As head of a <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a>, Spotswood viewed the <a href="proprietary%20colony">proprietary colony</a> of North Carolina with contempt; he had little faith in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates, who he suspected would be back to their old ways, disrupting Virginian commerce, as soon as their money ran out.

Spotswood learnt that William Howard, the former quartermaster of "Queen Anne's Revenge", was in the area, and believing that he might know of Teach's whereabouts had the pirate and his two slaves arrested. Spotswood had no legal authority to have pirates tried, and as a result, Howard's attorney, John Holloway, brought charges against Captain Brand of , where Howard was imprisoned. He also sued on Howard's behalf for damages of £500, claiming wrongful arrest.

Spotswood's council claimed that Teach's presence was a crisis and that under a statute of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>, the governor was entitled to try Howard without a jury. The charges referred to several acts of piracy supposedly committed after the pardon's cut-off date, in "a sloop belonging to ye subjects of the King of Spain", but ignored the fact that they took place outside Spotswood's jurisdiction and in a vessel then legally owned. Another charge cited two attacks, one of which was the capture of a slave ship off Charles Town Bar, from which one of Howard's slaves was presumed to have come. Howard was sent to await trial before a Court of Vice-Admiralty, on the charge of piracy, but Brand and his colleague, Captain Gordon (of ) refused to serve with Holloway present. Incensed, Holloway had no option but to stand down, and was replaced by the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Virginia">Attorney General of Virginia</a>, John Clayton, whom Spotswood described as "an honester man [than Holloway]". Howard was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged, but was saved by a commission from London, which directed Spotswood to pardon all acts of piracy committed by surrendering pirates before 23 July 1718.

Meanwhile, Spotswood had obtained from Howard valuable information on Teach's whereabouts, and he planned to send his forces across the border into North Carolina to capture him. He gained the support of two men keen to discredit North Carolina's Governor—Edward Moseley and Colonel Maurice Moore. He also wrote to the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Lords of Trade</a>, suggesting that the Crown might benefit financially from Teach's capture. Spotswood personally financed the operation, possibly believing that Teach had fabulous treasures hidden away. He ordered Captains Gordon and Brand of HMS "Pearl" and HMS "Lyme" to travel overland to Bath. Lieutenant Robert Maynard of HMS "Pearl" was given command of two commandeered sloops, to approach the town from the sea. An extra incentive for Teach's capture was the offer of a reward from the Assembly of Virginia, over and above any that might be received from the Crown.

Maynard took command of the two armed sloops on 17 November. He was given 57 men—33 from HMS "Pearl" and 24 from HMS "Lyme". Maynard and the detachment from HMS "Pearl" took the larger of the two vessels and named her "Jane"; the rest took "Ranger", commanded by one of Maynard's officers, a Mister Hyde. Some from the two ships' civilian crews remained aboard. They sailed from <a href="Kecoughtan%2C%20Virginia">Kecoughtan</a>, along the <a href="James%20River%20%28Virginia%29">James River</a>, on 17 November. The two sloops moved slowly, giving Brand's force time to reach Bath. Brand set out for North Carolina six days later, arriving within three miles of Bath on 23 November. Included in Brand's force were several North Carolinians, including Colonel Moore and Captain Jeremiah Vail, sent to put down any local objection to the presence of foreign soldiers. Moore went into the town to see if Teach was there, reporting back that he was not, but that the pirate was expected at "every minute." Brand then went to Governor Eden's home and informed him of his purpose. The next day, Brand sent two canoes down <a href="Pamlico%20River">Pamlico River</a> to Ocracoke Inlet, to see if Teach could be seen. They returned two days later and reported on what eventually transpired.

Maynard found the pirates anchored on the inner side of <a href="Ocracoke%2C%20North%20Carolina">Ocracoke Island</a>, on the evening of 21 November. He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack. He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet—preventing any warning of his presence—and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that Teach could not escape to sea. On the other side of the island, Teach was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout. With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about 24 of "Adventure"s sailors, he also had a much-reduced crew. Johnson (1724) reported that the pirate had "no more than twenty-five men on board" and that he "gave out to all the vessels that he spoke with that he had forty". "Thirteen white and six Negroes", was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty.

At daybreak, preceded by a small boat taking <a href="Depth%20sounding">soundings</a>, Maynard's two sloops entered the channel. The small craft was quickly spotted by "Adventure" and fired at as soon as it was within range of her guns. While the boat made a quick retreat to the "Jane", Teach cut the "Adventure"s anchor cable. His crew hoisted the sails and the "Adventure" manoeuvred to point her starboard guns toward Maynard's sloops, which were slowly closing the gap. Hyde moved "Ranger" to the port side of "Jane" and the <a href="Union%20flag">Union flag</a> was unfurled on each ship. "Adventure" then turned toward the beach of Ocracoke Island, heading for a narrow channel. What happened next is uncertain. Johnson claimed that there was an exchange of small-arms fire following which "Adventure" ran aground on a <a href="Shoal">sandbar</a>, while Maynard anchored and then lightened his ship to pass over the obstacle. Another version claimed that "Jane" and "Ranger" ran aground, although Maynard made no mention of this in his log.
What is certain though is that "Adventure" turned her guns on the two ships and fired. The broadside was devastating; in an instant, Maynard had lost as much as a third of his forces. About 20 on "Jane" were either wounded or killed and 9 on "Ranger". Hyde was dead and his second and third officers either dead or seriously injured. His sloop was so badly damaged that it played no further role in the attack. Again, contemporary accounts of what happened next are confused, but small-arms fire from "Jane" may have cut "Adventure"s <a href="jib%20sheet">jib sheet</a>, causing her to lose control and run onto the sandbar. In the aftermath of Teach's overwhelming attack, "Jane" and "Ranger" may also have been grounded; the battle thenceforth would have become a race to see who could float their ship first.
The lieutenant had kept many of his men below deck and in anticipation of being boarded told them to prepare for close fighting. Teach watched as the gap between the vessels closed, and ordered his men to be ready. The two vessels contacted one another as the "Adventure"s grappling hooks hit their target and several grenades, made from powder and shot-filled bottles and ignited by fuses, broke across the sloop's deck. As the smoke cleared, Teach led his men aboard, buoyant at the sight of Maynard's apparently empty ship, his men firing at the small group formed by the lieutenant and his men at the <a href="stern">stern</a>.

The rest of Maynard's men then burst from the hold, shouting and firing. The plan to surprise Teach and his crew worked; the pirates were apparently taken aback at the assault. Teach rallied his men and the two groups fought across the deck, which was already slick with blood from those killed or injured by Teach's broadside. Maynard and Teach fired their <a href="flintlock">flintlock</a>s at each other, then threw them away. Teach drew his cutlass and managed to break Maynard's sword. Against superior training and a slight advantage in numbers, the pirates were pushed back toward the bow, allowing the "Jane"s crew to surround Maynard and Teach, who was by then completely isolated. As Maynard drew back to fire once again, Teach moved in to attack him, but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynard's men. Badly wounded, he was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynard's crew. The remaining pirates quickly surrendered. Those left on the "Adventure" were captured by the "Ranger"s crew, including one who planned to set fire to the powder room and blow up the ship. Varying accounts exist of the battle's list of casualties; Maynard reported that 8 of his men and 12 pirates were killed. Brand reported that 10 pirates and 11 of Maynard's men were killed. Spotswood claimed ten pirates and ten of the King's men dead.
Maynard later examined Teach's body, noting that it had been shot no fewer than five times and cut about twenty. He also found several items of correspondence, including a letter to the pirate from Tobias Knight. Teach's corpse was thrown into the inlet while his head was suspended from the <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a> of Maynard's sloop so that the reward could be collected.

Lieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days, making repairs and burying the dead. Teach's loot—sugar, cocoa, <a href="Indigo%20dye">indigo</a> and cotton—found "in pirate sloops and ashore in a tent where the sloops lay", was sold at auction along with sugar and cotton found in Tobias Knight's barn, for £2,238. Governor Spotswood used a portion of this to pay for the entire operation. The prize money for capturing Teach was to have been about £400, but it was split between the crews of HMS "Lyme" and HMS "Pearl". As Captain Brand and his troops had not been the ones fighting for their lives, Maynard thought this extremely unfair. He lost much of any support he may have had though when it was discovered that he and his crew had helped themselves to about £90 of Teach's booty. The two companies did not receive their prize money for another four years, and despite his bravery Maynard was not promoted; instead, he faded into obscurity.

The remainder of Teach's crew and former associates were found by Brand, in Bath, and were transported to <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg, Virginia</a>, where they were jailed on charges of piracy. Several were black, prompting Spotswood to ask his council what could be done about "the Circumstances of these Negroes to exempt them from undergoing the same Tryal as other pirates." Regardless, the men were tried with their comrades in Williamsburg's Capitol building, under admiralty law, on 12 March 1719. No records of the day's proceedings remain, but 14 of the 16 accused were found guilty. Of the remaining two, one proved that he had partaken of the fight out of necessity, having been on Teach's ship only as a guest at a drinking party the night before, and not as a pirate. The other, Israel Hands, was not present at the fight. He claimed that during a drinking session Teach had shot him in the knee, and that he was still covered by the royal pardon. The remaining pirates were <a href="Hanging%23Short%20drop">hanged</a>, then left to rot in <a href="gibbet">gibbet</a>s along Williamsburg's Capitol Landing Road (known for some time after as "Gallows Road").

Governor Eden was certainly embarrassed by Spotswood's invasion of North Carolina, while Spotswood disavowed himself of any part of the seizure. He defended his actions, writing to <a href="John%20Carteret%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Granville">Lord Carteret</a>, a shareholder of the Province of Carolina, that he might benefit from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests. He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden "could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design", and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king. Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice. By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion. Lee (1974) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods. Eden doubtless shared the same view. As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach, on 4 April 1719, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning. Israel Hands had, weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the "Adventure" in August 1718, shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize. Four pirates had testified that with Teach, they had visited Knight's home to give him presents. This testimony and the letter found on Teach's body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence. Despite being very sick and close to death, he questioned the reliability of Spotswood's witnesses. He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress, and that under North Carolinian law, the other witness, an African, was unable to testify. The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally, and Teach had visited him only on business, in his official capacity. The board found Knight innocent of all charges. He died later that year.

Eden was annoyed that the accusations against Knight arose during a trial in which he played no part. The goods which Brand seized were officially North Carolinian property and Eden considered him a thief. The argument raged back and forth between the colonies until Eden's death on 17 March 1722. His will named one of Spotswood's opponents, John Holloway, a beneficiary. In the same year, Spotswood, who for years had fought his enemies in the <a href="House%20of%20Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a> and the Council, was replaced by <a href="Hugh%20Drysdale">Hugh Drysdale</a>, once <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a> was convinced to act.

Official views on pirates were sometimes quite different from those held by contemporary authors, who often described their subjects as despicable rogues of the sea. Privateers who became pirates were generally considered by the English government to be reserve naval forces, and were sometimes given active encouragement; as far back as 1581 <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a> was knighted by <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth</a>, when he returned to England from a round-the-world expedition with plunder worth an estimated £1,500,000. Royal pardons were regularly issued, usually when England was on the verge of war, and the public's opinion of pirates was often favourable, some considering them akin to patrons. Economist <a href="Peter%20Leeson">Peter Leeson</a> believes that pirates were generally shrewd businessmen, far removed from the modern, romanticised view of them as murderous tyrants. After Woodes Rogers' 1718 landing at New Providence and his ending of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Pirates">pirate republic</a>, however, piracy in the West Indies fell into terminal decline. With no easily accessible outlet to fence their stolen goods, pirates were reduced to a subsistence livelihood, and following almost a century of naval warfare between the British, French and Spanish—during which sailors could find easy employment—lone privateers found themselves outnumbered by the powerful ships employed by the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> to defend its merchant fleets. The popularity of the slave trade helped bring to an end the frontier condition of the West Indies and in these circumstances, piracy was no longer able to flourish as it once did.

Since the end of this so-called <a href="golden%20age%20of%20piracy">golden age of piracy</a>, Teach and his exploits have become the stuff of lore, inspiring books, films and even amusement park rides. Much of what is known about him can be sourced to Charles Johnson's "<a href="A%20General%20Historie%20of%20the%20Robberies%20and%20Murders%20of%20the%20Most%20Notorious%20Pyrates">A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates</a>", published in Britain in 1724. A recognised authority on the pirates of his time, Johnson's descriptions of such figures as <a href="Anne%20Bonny">Anne Bonny</a> and <a href="Mary%20Read">Mary Read</a> were for years required reading for those interested in the subject. Readers were titillated by his stories and a second edition was quickly published, though author Angus Konstam suspects that Johnson's entry on Blackbeard was "coloured a little to make a more sensational story." "A General Historie", though, is generally considered to be a reliable source. Johnson may have been an assumed alias. As Johnson's accounts have been corroborated in personal and official dispatches, Lee (1974) considers that whoever he was, he had some access to official correspondence. Konstam speculates further, suggesting that Johnson may have been the English playwright <a href="Charles%20Johnson%20%28writer%29">Charles Johnson</a>, the British publisher <a href="Charles%20Rivington">Charles Rivington</a>, or the writer <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>. In his 1951 work "The Great Days of Piracy", author George Woodbury wrote that Johnson is "obviously a pseudonym", continuing "one cannot help suspecting that he may have been a pirate himself."
Despite his infamy, Teach was not the most successful of pirates. <a href="Henry%20Every">Henry Every</a> retired a rich man, and <a href="Bartholomew%20Roberts">Bartholomew Roberts</a> took an estimated five times the amount Teach stole. Treasure hunters have long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumoured hoard of gold and silver, but nothing found in the numerous sites explored along the east coast of the US has ever been connected to him. Some tales suggest that pirates often killed a prisoner on the spot where they buried their loot, and Teach is no exception in these stories, but that no finds have come to light is not exceptional; buried pirate treasure is often considered a modern myth for which almost no supporting evidence exists. The available records include nothing to suggest that the burial of treasure was a common practice, except in the imaginations of the writers of fictional accounts such as "<a href="Treasure%20Island">Treasure Island</a>". Such hoards would necessitate a wealthy owner, and their supposed existence ignores the command structure of a pirate vessel, in which the crew often served by free suffrage. The only pirate ever known to bury treasure was <a href="William%20Kidd">William Kidd</a>; the only treasure so far recovered from Teach's exploits is that taken from the wreckage of what is presumed to be the "Queen Anne's Revenge", which was found in 1996. As of 2009 more than 250,000 artifacts have been recovered. A selection is on public display at the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Maritime%20Museum">North Carolina Maritime Museum</a>.

Various <a href="Credulity">superstitious</a> tales exist of Teach's ghost. Unexplained lights at sea are often referred to as "Teach's light", and some recitals claim that the notorious pirate now roams the afterlife searching for his head, for fear that his friends, and the Devil, will not recognise him. A North Carolinian tale holds that Teach's skull was used as the basis for a silver drinking chalice; a local judge even claimed to have drunk from it one night in the 1930s.

The name of Blackbeard has been attached to many local attractions, such as Charleston's Blackbeard's Cove.

His name and persona have also featured heavily in literature. He is the main subject of Matilda Douglas's fictional 1835 work "Blackbeard: A page from the colonial history of Philadelphia".

Film renditions of his life include "<a href="Blackbeard%20the%20Pirate">Blackbeard the Pirate</a>" (1952), "<a href="Blackbeard%27s%20Ghost">Blackbeard's Ghost</a>" (1968), "<a href="Blackbeard%20%282005%20film%29">Blackbeard: Terror at Sea</a>" (2005) and the 2006 <a href="Hallmark%20Channel">Hallmark Channel</a> miniseries "<a href="Blackbeard%20%282006%20film%29">Blackbeard</a>". Parallels have also been drawn between Johnson's Blackbeard and the character of Captain <a href="Jack%20Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a> in the 2003 adventure film, "".

Blackbeard is also portrayed as a central character in two recent TV series. In the short lived <a href="Crossbones%20%28TV%20series%29">Crossbones</a> (2014) he is played by <a href="John%20Malkovich">John Malkovich</a>. The British actor <a href="Ray%20Stevenson%20%28actor%29">Ray Stevenson</a> plays him in season three and four of <a href="Black%20Sails%20%28TV%20series%29">Black Sails</a> (2016-2017).

Bugzilla was originally devised by Terry Weissman in 1998 for the nascent <a href="Mozilla.org">Mozilla.org</a> project, as an <a href="open%20source">open source</a> application to replace the in-house system then in use at Netscape Communications for tracking defects in the <a href="Netscape%20Communicator">Netscape Communicator</a> suite. Bugzilla was originally written in <a href="Tcl">Tcl</a>, but Weissman decided to port it to <a href="Perl">Perl</a> before its release as part of Netscape's early open source code drops, in the hope that more people would be able to contribute to it, given that Perl seemed to be a more popular language at the time.

Bugzilla 2.0 was the result of that port to Perl, and the first version was released to the public via anonymous <a href="Concurrent%20Versions%20System">CVS</a>. In April 2000, Weissman handed over control of the Bugzilla project to <a href="Tara%20Hernandez">Tara Hernandez</a>. Under her leadership, some of the regular contributors were coerced into taking more responsibility, and Bugzilla development became more community-driven. In July 2001, facing distraction from her other responsibilities in Netscape, Hernandez handed control to Dave Miller, who was still in charge .

Bugzilla 3.0 was released on May 10, 2007 and brought refreshed <a href="User%20interface">UI</a>, <a href="XML-RPC">XML-RPC</a> interface, custom fields and resolutions, <a href="mod_perl">mod_perl</a> support, shared saved searches, and improved <a href="UTF-8">UTF-8</a> support, along with other changes.

Bugzilla 4.0 was released on February 15, 2011. And Bugzilla 5.0 was relaxed at about July 2015. And the last version as far as 2017, Bugzilla 5.0.3 was released at mid-2016.

While the potential exists in the code to turn Bugzilla into a <a href="issue%20tracking%20system">technical support ticket system</a>, task management tool, or project management tool, Bugzilla's developers have chosen to focus on the task of designing a system to track software defects. Mandated design requirements include:


In practice, most Bugzilla projects allowing the public to file bugs—such as the Bugzilla bug database for Bugzilla itself—assign all bugs to a gatekeeper, whose job it is to assign responsibility and priority level.

By design, Bugzilla is programmed to return the string "zarro boogs found" instead of "0 bugs found" when a search for bugs returns no results. "Zarro Boogs" is a meta-statement about the nature of software <a href="software%20bug">debugging</a>. <a href="Bug%20tracking%20system">Bug tracking system</a>s like Bugzilla readily describe how many "known" bugs are outstanding. The response "zarro boogs", is intended as a buggy statement itself (a misspelling of "zero bugs"), implying that even when no bugs have been identified, software is still likely to contain bugs that have not yet been identified.

Ballad

A ballad is a form of verse, often a <a href="narrative">narrative</a> set to <a href="music">music</a>. Ballads derive from the medieval <a href="Music%20of%20France">French</a> "chanson balladée" or "<a href="Ballade%20%28forme%20fixe%29">ballade</a>", which were originally "danced songs<nowiki>"</nowiki>. Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later <a href="medieval">medieval</a> period until the 19th century. They were widely used across <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, and later in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>. Ballads are often 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. Another common form is ABAB or ABCB repeated, in alternating 8 and 6 syllable lines.

Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet <a href="Broadside%20%28music%29">broadsides</a>. The form was often used by <a href="poet">poet</a>s and <a href="composer">composer</a>s from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century, the term took on the meaning of a slow form of popular <a href="love%20song">love song</a> and is now often used for any love song, particularly the <a href="sentimental%20ballad">sentimental ballad</a> of <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> or <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>.

The ballad derives its name from medieval <a href="French%20language">French</a> dance songs or "ballares" (<a href="Latin">L</a>: "ballare", to dance), from which 'ballet' is also derived, as did the alternative rival form that became the French <a href="Ballade%20%28forme%20fixe%29">ballade</a>. As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n and <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as <a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>. Musically they were influenced by the <a href="Minnesinger">Minnesinger</a>. The earliest example of a recognizable ballad in form in <a href="England">England</a> is "<a href="Judas%20%28ballad%29">Judas</a>" in a 13th-century <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>.
This means that the two words, ballad and ballet, are both derived from the French language.

Ballads were originally written to accompany dances, and so were composed in couplets with refrains in alternate lines. These refrains would have been sung by the dancers in time with the dance. Most northern and west European ballads are written in <a href="ballad%20stanza">ballad stanza</a>s or <a href="quatrains">quatrains</a> (four-line <a href="stanzas">stanzas</a>) of alternating lines of <a href="Iamb%20%28foot%29">iambic</a> (an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable) <a href="tetrameter">tetrameter</a> (eight syllables) and iambic <a href="trimeter">trimeter</a> (six syllables), known as <a href="Common%20metre%23Variants">ballad meter</a>. Usually, only the second and fourth line of a quatrain are rhymed (in the scheme a, b, c, b), which has been taken to suggest that, originally, ballads consisted of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. This can be seen in this stanza from "<a href="Lord%20Thomas%20and%20Fair%20Annet">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>":

The horse | fair Ann | et rode | upon |
He amb | led like | the wind |,
With sil | ver he | was shod | before,
With burn | ing gold | behind |.

There is considerable variation on this pattern in almost every respect, including length, number of lines and rhyming scheme, making the strict definition of a ballad extremely difficult. In southern and eastern Europe, and in countries that derive their tradition from them, ballad structure differs significantly, like Spanish "romanceros", which are <a href="octosyllabic">octosyllabic</a> and use <a href="Literary%20consonance">consonance</a> rather than rhyme.

Ballads usually are heavily influenced by the regions in which they originate and use the common dialect of the people. <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>'s ballads in particular, both in theme and language, are strongly characterised by their distinctive tradition, even exhibiting some pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as travel to the <a href="Fairy">Fairy</a> Kingdom in the <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> ballad "Tam Lin". The ballads do not have any known author or correct version; instead, having been passed down mainly by oral tradition since the Middle Ages, there are many variations of each. The ballads remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the 18th century led collectors such as <a href="Thomas%20Percy%20%28bishop%20of%20Dromore%29">Bishop Thomas Percy</a> (1729–1811) to publish volumes of popular ballads.

In all traditions most ballads are narrative in nature, with a self-contained story, often concise, and rely on imagery, rather than description, which can be tragic, historical, romantic or comic. Themes concerning rural laborers and their sexuality are common, and there are many ballads based on the Robin Hood legend. Another common feature of ballads is repetition, sometimes of fourth lines in succeeding stanzas, as a <a href="refrain">refrain</a>, sometimes of third and fourth lines of a stanza and sometimes of entire stanzas.

Scholars of ballads have been divided into "communalists", such as <a href="Johann%20Gottfried%20Herder">Johann Gottfried Herder</a> (1744–1803) and the <a href="Brothers%20Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a>, who argue that ballads are originally communal compositions, and "individualists" such as <a href="Cecil%20Sharp">Cecil Sharp</a>, who assert that there was one single original author. Communalists tend to see more recent, particularly printed, broadside ballads of known authorship as a debased form of the genre, while individualists see variants as corruptions of an original text. More recently scholars have pointed to the interchange of oral and written forms of the ballad.

The transmission of ballads comprises a key stage in their re-composition. In romantic terms this process is often dramatized as a narrative of degeneration away from the pure 'folk memory' or 'immemorial tradition.' In the introduction to "<a href="The%20Minstrelsy%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Border">The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</a>" (1802) the romantic poet and historical novelist <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a> argued a need to 'remove obvious corruptions' in order to attempt to restore a supposed original. For Scott, the process of multiple recitations 'incurs the risk of impertinent interpolations from the conceit of one rehearser, unintelligible blunders from the stupidity of another, and omissions equally to be regretted, from the want of memory of a third.' Similarly, John Robert Moore noted 'a natural tendency to oblivescence'. According to Scott, transcribed ballads often have a 'flatness and insipidity' compared to their oral counterparts.

 European Ballads have been generally classified into three major groups: traditional, broadside and literary. In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'Native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music. For the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term 'ballad' to mean a slow love song.

The traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering <a href="minstrels">minstrels</a> of late medieval Europe. From the end of the 15th century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music. A reference in <a href="William%20Langland">William Langland</a>'s "<a href="Piers%20Plowman">Piers Plowman</a>" indicates that ballads about <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a> were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is <a href="Wynkyn%20de%20Worde">Wynkyn de Worde's</a> collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.

Early collections of English ballads were made by <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a> (1633–1703) and in the <a href="Roxburghe%20Ballads">Roxburghe Ballads</a> collected by <a href="Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Earl%20Mortimer">Robert Harley</a>, 1st (1784), which paralleled the work in Scotland by <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a> and <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a>. Inspired by his reading as a teenager of "<a href="Reliques%20of%20Ancient%20English%20Poetry">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</a>" by <a href="Thomas%20Percy%20%28bishop%20of%20Dromore%29">Thomas Percy</a>, Scott began collecting ballads while he attended Edinburgh University in the 1790s. He published his research from 1802 to 1803 in a three-volume work, "<a href="The%20Minstrelsy%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Border">The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</a>". Burns collaborated with <a href="James%20Johnson%20%28engraver%29">James Johnson</a> on the multi-volume "<a href="Scots%20Musical%20Museum">Scots Musical Museum</a>", a miscellany of folk songs and poetry with original work by Burns. Around the same time, he worked with <a href="George%20Thomson%20%28musician%29">George Thompson</a> on "<a href="A%20Select%20Collection%20of%20Original%20Scottish%20Airs%20for%20the%20Voice">A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice</a>". 

Both Northern English and Southern Scots shared in the identified tradition of <a href="Border%20ballads">Border ballads</a>, particularly evinced by the cross-border narrative in versions of "<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20Chevy%20Chase">The Ballad of Chevy Chase</a>" sometimes associated with the Lancashire-born sixteenth-century minstrel <a href="Richard%20Sheale">Richard Sheale</a>.

It has been suggested that the increasing interest in traditional popular ballads during the eighteenth century was prompted by social issues such as the enclosure movement as many of the ballads deal with themes concerning rural laborers. James Davey has suggested that the common themes of sailing and naval battles may also have prompted the use (at least in England) of popular ballads as naval recruitment tools.

Key work on the traditional ballad was undertaken in the late 19th century in Denmark by <a href="Svend%20Grundtvig">Svend Grundtvig</a> and for England and Scotland by the Harvard professor <a href="Francis%20James%20Child">Francis James Child</a>. They attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions. Since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as "<a href="The%20English%20and%20Scottish%20Popular%20Ballads">The English and Scottish Popular Ballads</a>". There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous. The traditional form and content of the ballad were modified to form the basis for twenty-three bawdy pornographic ballads that appeared in the underground Victorian magazine "<a href="The%20Pearl%20%28magazine%29">The Pearl</a>", which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880. Unlike the traditional ballad, these obscene ballads aggressively mocked sentimental nostalgia and local lore.

Broadside ballads (also known as 'broadsheet', 'stall', 'vulgar' or 'come all ye' ballads) were a product of the development of cheap print in the 16th century. They were generally printed on one side of a medium to large sheet of poor quality paper. In their heyday of the first half of the 17th century, they were printed in black-letter or gothic type and included multiple, eye-catching illustrations, a popular tune title, as well as an alluring poem. By the 18th century, they were printed in white letter or roman type and often without much decoration (as well as tune title). These later sheets could include many individual songs, which would be cut apart and sold individually as "slip songs." Alternatively, they might be folded to make small cheap books or "chapbooks" which often drew on ballad stories. They were produced in huge numbers, with over 400,000 being sold in England annually by the 1660s. Tessa Watt estimates the number of copies sold may have been in the millions. Many were sold by travelling <a href="chapmen">chapmen</a> in city streets or at fairs. The subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad, although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides. Among the topics were love, marriage, religion, drinking-songs, legends, and early journalism, which included disasters, political events and signs, wonders and prodigies.

Literary or lyrical ballads grew out of an increasing interest in the ballad form among social elites and intellectuals, particularly in the <a href="Romantic%20movement">Romantic movement</a> from the later 18th century. Respected literary figures <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a> and <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a> in Scotland collected and wrote their own ballads. Similarly in England <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> produced a collection of "<a href="Lyrical%20Ballads">Lyrical Ballads</a>" in 1798 that included Coleridge's "<a href="The%20Rime%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>". Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats were attracted to the simple and natural style of these folk ballads and tried to imitate it. At the same time in Germany <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a> cooperated with <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Schiller</a> on a series of ballads, some of which were later set to music by <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>. Later important examples of the poetic form included Rudyard Kipling's "<a href="Barrack-Room%20Ballads">Barrack-Room Ballads</a>" (1892-6) and <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>'s "<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20Reading%20Gaol">The Ballad of Reading Gaol</a>" (1897). Victorian poet <a href="Christina%20Rossetti">Christina Rossetti</a> used ballad forms to explore spiritual and moral issues and to discuss the stereotypical treatment and representation of men and women's roles in society.

In the 18th century ballad operas developed as a form of <a href="England">English</a> <a href="stage%20play">stage entertainment</a>, partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene. It consisted of racy and often <a href="Satire">satirical</a> spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Rather than the more aristocratic themes and music of the Italian opera, the ballad operas were set to the music of popular folk songs and dealt with lower-class characters. Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. The first, most important and successful was "<a href="The%20Beggar%27s%20Opera">The Beggar's Opera</a>" of 1728, with a libretto by <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a> and music arranged by <a href="John%20Christopher%20Pepusch">John Christopher Pepusch</a>, both of whom probably influenced by <a href="Paris">Paris</a> ian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of <a href="Thomas%20d%27Urfey">Thomas d'Urfey</a> (1653–1723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work. Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title "Polly". <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a>, <a href="Colley%20Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>, Arne, Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity. Ballad opera was attempted in America and Prussia. Later it moved into a more pastoral form, like <a href="Isaac%20Bickerstaffe">Isaac Bickerstaffe's</a> "Love in a Village" (1763) and <a href="William%20Shield">Shield's</a> "Rosina" (1781), using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the 18th century its influence can be seen in light operas like that of <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan's</a> early works like "<a href="The%20Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a>" as well as in the modern musical. In the 20th century, one of the most influential plays, <a href="Kurt%20Weill">Kurt Weill</a> and <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht's</a> (1928) "<a href="The%20Threepenny%20Opera">The Threepenny Opera</a>" was a reworking of "The Beggar's Opera", setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite, but only using one tune from the original. The term ballad opera has also been used to describe musicals using folk music, such as "The Martins and the Coys" in 1944, and <a href="Peter%20Bellamy">Peter Bellamy's</a> "The Transports" in 1977. The satiric elements of ballad opera can be seen in some modern musicals such as "<a href="Chicago%20%28musical%29">Chicago</a>" and "<a href="Cabaret%20%28musical%29">Cabaret</a>".

Native American ballads are ballads that are native to North America (not to be confused with ballads performed by <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a>). Some 300 ballads sung in North America have been identified as having origins in British traditional or broadside ballads. Examples include '<a href="The%20Streets%20of%20Laredo">The Streets of Laredo</a>', which was found in Britain and Ireland as 'The Unfortunate Rake'; however, a further 400 have been identified as originating in North America, including among the best known, '<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20Davy%20Crockett">The Ballad of Davy Crockett</a>' and '<a href="Jesse%20James%20%28folk%20song%29">Jesse James</a>'. They became an increasing area of interest for scholars in the 19th century and most were recorded or catalogued by <a href="George%20Malcolm%20Laws">George Malcolm Laws</a>, although some have since been found to have British origins and additional songs have since been collected. They are usually considered closest in form to British broadside ballads and in terms of style are largely indistinguishable, however, they demonstrate a particular concern with occupations, journalistic style and often lack the ribaldry of British broadside ballads.

The blues ballad has been seen as a fusion of Anglo-American and Afro-American styles of music from the 19th century. Blues ballads tend to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, but frequently lacking a strong narrative and emphasising character instead. They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar which followed <a href="the%20blues">the blues</a> musical format. The most famous blues ballads include those about <a href="John%20Henry%20%28folklore%29">John Henry</a> and <a href="Casey%20Jones">Casey Jones</a>.

The ballad was taken to Australia by early settlers from Britain and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural <a href="outback">outback</a>. The rhyming songs, <a href="poems">poems</a> and tales written in the form of ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in <a href="The%20Bush">The Bush</a>, and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards. The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including <a href="John%20Meredith%20%28folklorist%29">John Meredith</a> whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Australia">National Library of Australia</a>. The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, <a href="sheep%20shearing">sheep shearing</a>, wanderings, war stories, the <a href="1891%20Australian%20shearers%27%20strike">1891 Australian shearers' strike</a>, class conflicts between the landless working class and the <a href="Squatting%20%28pastoral%29">squatters</a> (landowners), and outlaws such as <a href="Ned%20Kelly">Ned Kelly</a>, as well as love interests and more modern fare such as <a href="Truck%20driver">trucking</a>. The most famous bush ballad is "<a href="Waltzing%20Matilda">Waltzing Matilda</a>", which has been called "the unofficial national anthem of Australia".

Sentimental ballads, sometimes called "tear-jerkers" or "drawing-room ballads" owing to their popularity with the middle classes, had their origins in the early "<a href="Tin%20Pan%20Alley">Tin Pan Alley</a>" music industry of the later 19th century. They were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an <a href="opera">opera</a> (descendants perhaps of <a href="broadside%20%28music%29">broadside ballads</a>, but with <a href="sheet%20music">printed music</a>, and usually newly composed). Such songs include "Little Rosewood Casket" (1870), "<a href="After%20the%20Ball%20%28song%29">After the Ball</a>" (1892) and "<a href="Danny%20Boy">Danny Boy</a>". The association with sentimentality led to the term "ballad" being used for slow <a href="love%20song">love song</a>s from the 1950s onwards. Modern variations include "<a href="jazz%20music">jazz</a> ballads", "<a href="pop%20music">pop</a> ballads" and "power ballads".

Blue Öyster Cult

Blue Öyster Cult (often abbreviated BÖC) is an American <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> band formed on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, New York, in 1967, whose most successful work includes the <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> and <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> songs "<a href="%28Don%27t%20Fear%29%20The%20Reaper">(Don't Fear) The Reaper</a>", "<a href="Godzilla%20%28song%29">Godzilla</a>" and "<a href="Burnin%27%20for%20You">Burnin' for You</a>". Blue Öyster Cult has sold over 24 million records worldwide, including 7 million records in the United States alone. The band's <a href="music%20video">music video</a>s, especially "Burnin' for You", received heavy rotation on <a href="MTV">MTV</a> when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>.

Blue Öyster Cult's longest lasting and most commercially successful lineup included <a href="Buck%20Dharma">Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser</a> (lead guitar, vocals), <a href="Eric%20Bloom">Eric Bloom</a> (lead vocals, "<a href="Rhythm%20guitar">stun guitar</a>"), <a href="Allen%20Lanier">Allen Lanier</a> (keyboards, rhythm guitar, backing vocals), <a href="Joe%20Bouchard">Joe Bouchard</a> (bass, backing vocals) and <a href="Albert%20Bouchard">Albert Bouchard</a> (drums, percussion, backing vocals). The band's current lineup includes Roeser and Bloom, as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), <a href="Richie%20Castellano">Richie Castellano</a> (keyboard, rhythm guitar, backing vocals), and <a href="Kasim%20Sulton">Kasim Sulton</a> (bass, backing vocals).

The band originated as a group called Soft White Underbelly (a name the band would occasionally use in the 1970s and 1980s to play small club gigs around the United States and UK) in 1967 in the vicinity of <a href="Stony%20Brook%20University">Stony Brook University</a> on <a href="Long%20Island%2C%20New%20York">Long Island, New York</a>, at the prompting of critic and manager <a href="Sandy%20Pearlman">Sandy Pearlman</a> consisting of guitarist Buck Dharma, drummer Albert Bouchard, keyboardist Allen Lanier, singer Les Braunstein and bassist Andrew Winters. Pearlman wanted the group to be the American answer to <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>. Pearlman was important to the band – he was able to get them <a href="concert">gigs</a> and recording contracts with <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra</a> and <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia</a>, and he provided them with his <a href="poetry">poetry</a> for use as lyrics for many of their songs, including "Astronomy". Writer <a href="Richard%20Meltzer">Richard Meltzer</a> also provided the band with lyrics from their early days up through their most recent studio album. Pearlman also gave stage names to each of the band members (Jesse Python for Eric Bloom, Andy Panda for Andy Winters, Prince Omega for Albert Bouchard, La Verne for Allen Lanier) but only Buck Dharma kept his. The band recorded an album's worth of material for <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> in 1968. When Braunstein departed in early 1969, Elektra shelved the album.

<a href="Eric%20Bloom">Eric Bloom</a> (formerly the band's acoustic engineer) replaced Braunstein, and the band continued to perform as Soft White Underbelly. However, a bad review of a 1969 Fillmore East show caused Pearlman to change the name of the band – first to Oaxaca, then to the Stalk-Forrest Group. The band recorded yet another album's worth of material for Elektra, but only one single ("What Is Quicksand?" b/w "Arthur Comics") was released (and only in a promo edition of 300 copies) on <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> (this album was eventually released, with additional outtakes, by Rhino Handmade Records as "" in 2001). After a few more temporary band names, including the Santos Sisters, the band settled on Blue Öyster Cult in 1971 (see <a href="%23Band%20name%20and%20logo">below</a> for its origin).

New York City producer/composer and jingle writer <a href="David%20Lucas%20%28composer%29">David Lucas</a> saw the band perform and took them into his Warehouse Recording Studio and produced four demos, with which Pearlman was able to get the renamed band another audition with <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. <a href="Clive%20Davis">Clive Davis</a> liked what he heard, and signed the band to the label. The first album was subsequently produced and recorded by Lucas on eight track at Lucas' studio. Winters would leave the band and be replaced by Bouchard's brother, <a href="Joe%20Bouchard">Joe Bouchard</a>.

Lyricists for Blue Öyster Cult include band members Donald Roeser, Albert Bouchard, producer Sandy Pearlman, and writers <a href="Richard%20Meltzer">Richard Meltzer</a>, <a href="Patti%20Smith">Patti Smith</a>, <a href="Michael%20Moorcock">Michael Moorcock</a>, <a href="Eric%20Van%20Lustbader">Eric Van Lustbader</a>, <a href="Jim%20Carroll">Jim Carroll</a>, Broadway Blotto and <a href="John%20Shirley">John Shirley</a>.

Their debut album "<a href="Blue%20%C3%96yster%20Cult%20%28album%29">Blue Öyster Cult</a>" was released in January 1972, with a black and white cover designed by artist Bill Gawlik. The album featured the songs "<a href="Cities%20on%20Flame%20with%20Rock%20and%20Roll">Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll</a>", "Stairway to the Stars" and "Then Came the Last Days of May". The album sold well, and Blue Öyster Cult toured with artists such as <a href="The%20Byrds">The Byrds</a>, <a href="Mahavishnu%20Orchestra">Mahavishnu Orchestra</a> and <a href="Alice%20Cooper">Alice Cooper</a>.

Their next album "<a href="Tyranny%20and%20Mutation">Tyranny and Mutation</a>", released in 1973, was written while the band was on tour for their first LP. It contained songs such as "The Red and the Black" (an ode to the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> and a rewrite of "I'm On the Lamb But I Ain't No Sheep" from the debut album), "Hot Rails to Hell" and "Baby Ice Dog", the first of the band's many collaborations with <a href="Patti%20Smith">Patti Smith</a>.

The band's third album, "<a href="Secret%20Treaties">Secret Treaties</a>" (1974) received positive reviews, featuring songs such as "Career of Evil" (co-written by Patti Smith), "Dominance and Submission" and "<a href="Astronomy%20%28song%29">Astronomy</a>". As a result of constant touring, the band was now capable of headlining arenas.

The band's first live album "<a href="On%20Your%20Feet%20or%20on%20Your%20Knees">On Your Feet or on Your Knees</a>" (1975) achieved greater success and went gold, and was followed up by their first platinum album, "<a href="Agents%20of%20Fortune">Agents of Fortune</a>" (1976), which was again produced by David Lucas. It contained the hit single "<a href="%28Don%27t%20Fear%29%20The%20Reaper">(Don't Fear) The Reaper</a>", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts and has become a classic of the heavy rock genre. Other major songs on the album were "(This Ain't) The Summer of Love", "E.T.I. (Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)" and "The Revenge of Vera Gemini". For the tour, the band added lasers to their light show, for which they became known. They were among the first acts to use lasers in performance.

Their next album, "<a href="Spectres%20%28album%29">Spectres</a>" (1977), had the FM radio hit "<a href="Godzilla%20%28song%29">Godzilla</a>", but its sales were not as strong as those for the previous album.

The band then released another live album, "<a href="Some%20Enchanted%20Evening%20%28Blue%20%C3%96yster%20Cult%20album%29">Some Enchanted Evening</a>" (1978). Though it was intended as another double-live album in the vein of "On Your Feet or on Your Knees", Columbia insisted that it be edited down to single-album length. It became Blue Öyster Cult's most popular album, eventually selling over 2 million copies.

It was followed by the studio album "<a href="Mirrors%20%28Blue%20%C3%96yster%20Cult%20album%29">Mirrors</a>" (1979). For "Mirrors", instead of working with previous producers Sandy Pearlman (who instead went on to manage <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>) and Murray Krugman, Blue Öyster Cult chose <a href="Tom%20Werman">Tom Werman</a>, who had worked with acts such as <a href="Cheap%20Trick">Cheap Trick</a> and <a href="Ted%20Nugent">Ted Nugent</a>. However, the resulting album sales were disappointing.

Pearlman's association with Black Sabbath led to Sabbath's "<a href="Heaven%20and%20Hell%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Heaven and Hell</a>" producer <a href="Martin%20Birch">Martin Birch</a> being hired for the next Blue Öyster Cult record. The result was positive, with "<a href="Cult%C3%B6saurus%20Erectus">Cultösaurus Erectus</a>" (1980) receiving good reviews. The album went to number 12 in the United Kingdom, but did not do as well in the United States. The song "Black Blade", which was written by Bloom with lyrics by sci-fi and fantasy author <a href="Michael%20Moorcock">Michael Moorcock</a>, is a kind of retelling of Moorcock's epic <a href="Elric%20of%20Melnibon%C3%A9">Elric of Melniboné</a> saga. The band also did a co-headlining tour with Black Sabbath in support of the album, calling the tour "<a href="Black%20and%20Blue%20%28video%29">Black and Blue</a>".

Birch produced the band's next album as well, "<a href="Fire%20of%20Unknown%20Origin">Fire of Unknown Origin</a>" (1981). The biggest hit on this album was the Top 40 hit "<a href="Burnin%27%20for%20You">Burnin' for You</a>", a song Dharma had written with a <a href="Richard%20Meltzer">Richard Meltzer</a> lyric. He had intended to use it on his solo album, "<a href="Flat%20Out%20%28Buck%20Dharma%20album%29">Flat Out</a>" (1982), but he was convinced to use it on the Blue Öyster Cult album instead. The album went platinum, and contained other fan favorites such as "Joan Crawford" (inspired by the book and film "<a href="Mommie%20Dearest">Mommie Dearest</a>") and "<a href="Veteran%20of%20the%20Psychic%20Wars">Veteran of the Psychic Wars</a>", another song co-written by Moorcock. Several of the songs had been written for the animated film "<a href="Heavy%20Metal%20%28film%29">Heavy Metal</a>", but only "Veteran of the Psychic Wars" (which, ironically, was not written for "Heavy Metal") was actually used in the movie. After this album, Albert Bouchard had a falling out with the others and left the band, and Rick Downey (formerly the band's lighting designer) replaced him on drums.

After leaving the band, Albert Bouchard spent five years working on a solo album based on Sandy Pearlman's poem "Imaginos". Blue Öyster Cult released a live album "<a href="Extraterrestrial%20Live">Extraterrestrial Live</a>", then went to the studio for the next album, with <a href="Bruce%20Fairbairn">Bruce Fairbairn</a> as producer, the release "<a href="The%20Rev%C3%B6lution%20by%20Night">The Revölution by Night</a>" (1983). Its highest-charting single was "Shooting Shark", co-written by Patti Smith, which reached number 83 on the charts. "Shooting Shark" also featured <a href="Randy%20Jackson">Randy Jackson</a> on bass. After "Revölution", Rick Downey left, leaving Blue Öyster Cult without a drummer.

The band re-united with Albert Bouchard for a California tour in February 1985, infamously known as the "Albert Returns" Tour. This arrangement was only temporary, and caused more tensions between the band and Bouchard, as he had thought he would be staying on permanently, which was not the case. The band had only intended to use him as a last-minute fill-in until another drummer could come on board, which resulted in Bouchard's leaving after the tour. Allen Lanier also quit the band shortly thereafter, leaving the band without a keyboardist.

Blue Öyster Cult hired drummer Jimmy Wilcox and keyboardist Tommy Zvoncheck to finish the album "<a href="Club%20Ninja">Club Ninja</a>", which was poorly received, with only "Dancing In the Ruins"—one of several songs on the record written entirely by outside songwriters—enjoying minimal success on radio and <a href="MTV">MTV</a>. The highlight of the album was "Perfect Water" written by Dharma and <a href="Jim%20Carroll">Jim Carroll</a> (noted author of "<a href="The%20Basketball%20Diaries">The Basketball Diaries</a>").

The band toured in Germany, after which bassist Joe Bouchard left, leaving only two members of the classic lineup, Eric Bloom and Donald Roeser — some referred to the band as "Two Öyster Cult" during this period. Jon Rogers was hired to replace Joe, and this version of the band finished out the 1986 tour. After the tour wound up that year, the band took a temporary break from recording and touring.
When Blue Öyster Cult received an offer to tour in Greece in the early summer of 1987, the band reformed. The new line-up contained founding members Eric Bloom, Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser and Allen Lanier, with Jon Rogers returning on bass, and Ron Riddle on drums. <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> was not interested in releasing the "<a href="Imaginos">Imaginos</a>" project as an Albert Bouchard solo album, so Pearlman arranged for it to be released in 1988 by Columbia as a Blue Öyster Cult album, with some new vocal and instrumental overdubs from Bloom and Roeser. The album did not sell well (despite a positive review in Rolling Stone magazine), and though Blue Öyster Cult did tour to promote "Imaginos", promotion by the label was virtually non-existent. When Columbia Records' parent company CBS Records was purchased by <a href="Sony">Sony</a> and became <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">Sony Music Entertainment</a>, Blue Öyster Cult were dropped from the label.

The band spent the next 11 years touring without releasing an album, though they did contribute two new songs to the "<a href="Bad%20Channels">Bad Channels</a>" movie soundtrack, released in 1992. Riddle quit in 1991 and was followed by a series of other drummers including
<a href="Chuck%20Burgi">Chuck Burgi</a> (1991–1992, 1992–1995, 1996–1997), <a href="John%20Miceli">John Miceli</a> (1992, 1995), John O'Reilly (1995–1996) and <a href="Bobby%20Rondinelli">Bobby Rondinelli</a> (1997–2004). Jules Radino joined in 2004, and is the band's current drummer. Rogers left in 1995, and was replaced by Danny Miranda. Miranda left in 2004 and ended up as the bassist for <a href="Queen%20%2B%20Paul%20Rodgers">Queen + Paul Rodgers</a> – and Richie Castellano replaced him.
In the late 1990s, Blue Öyster Cult secured a recording contract with CMC Records (later purchased by <a href="Sanctuary%20Records">Sanctuary Records</a>), and continued to tour frequently. Two studio albums were released, "<a href="Heaven%20Forbid">Heaven Forbid</a>" (1998) and "<a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Hidden%20Mirror">Curse of the Hidden Mirror</a>" (2001). Both albums featured songs co-written by cyberpunk/horror novelist <a href="John%20Shirley">John Shirley</a>. Another live record, "<a href="A%20Long%20Day%27s%20Night">A Long Day's Night</a>" and DVD (same title), followed in 2002, both drawn from one concert in Chicago.

In 2001, Sony/Columbia's reissue arm, <a href="Legacy%20Records">Legacy Records</a> issued expanded versions of the first four Blue Öyster Cult studio albums, including some previously unreleased demos and outtakes from album sessions, live recordings (from the "Live 72" EP), and post-St. Cecilia tunes from the Stalk-Forrest Group era.

In February 2007, the Sony Legacy remaster series continued, releasing expanded versions of studio album "<a href="Spectres%20%28album%29">Spectres</a>" and live album "<a href="Some%20Enchanted%20Evening%20%28Blue%20%C3%96yster%20Cult%20album%29">Some Enchanted Evening</a>".

In August 2012 it was announced that Sony Legacy would be releasing a 17-disc boxed set entitled "The Complete Columbia Albums Collection" on October 30, 2012. The set includes the first round of the remastered series plus the long-awaited remastered versions of; "On Your Feet or on Your Knees" (1975), "<a href="Mirrors%20%28Blue%20%C3%96yster%20Cult%20album%29">Mirrors</a>", "<a href="Cult%C3%B6saurus%20Erectus">Cultösaurus Erectus</a>", "<a href="Fire%20Of%20Unknown%20Origin">Fire Of Unknown Origin</a>", "<a href="Extraterrestrial%20Live">Extraterrestrial Live</a>", "<a href="The%20Rev%C3%B6lution%20by%20Night">The Revölution by Night</a>", "<a href="Club%20Ninja">Club Ninja</a>" and "<a href="Imaginos">Imaginos</a>". Also exclusive to this set are two discs of rare and unreleased B-sides, demos and radio broadcasts.

Allen Lanier retired from live performances in 2007 after not appearing with the band since late 2006. Castellano has switched to rhythm guitar and keyboards (Castellano also filled in on lead guitar and vocals for an ailing Buck Dharma in two shows in 2005), and the position of bassist was taken up by <a href="Rudy%20Sarzo">Rudy Sarzo</a> (previously a member of <a href="Quiet%20Riot">Quiet Riot</a>, <a href="Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a>,<a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> and <a href="Dio%20%28band%29">Dio</a>), with the band employing Danny Miranda and Jon Rogers as guest bassists to fill in when Sarzo was unavailable. Sarzo then joined the band as an official member of the band, although Rogers had occasionally filled in when Sarzo had been busy.

In December 2008, BÖC management announced that Roeser had fallen down a staircase in his <a href="Florida">Florida</a> home and injured his shoulder. As a result, several tour dates in December 2008 and January 2009 were canceled or postponed. The band returned to touring by the fall of 2009.

In June 2012, the band announced that bassist <a href="Rudy%20Sarzo">Rudy Sarzo</a> was leaving the band and was being replaced by former <a href="Utopia%20%28American%20band%29">Utopia</a> bassist <a href="Kasim%20Sulton">Kasim Sulton</a>.

In 2012, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Blue Öyster Cult, the current incarnation of the band reunited for the first time in 25 years with other original members Joe and Albert Bouchard and Allan Lanier as guests for a special event in New York.

Founding keyboardist/guitarist Allen Lanier died of <a href="chronic%20obstructive%20pulmonary%20disease">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> on August 14, 2013.

In 2016, Albert Bouchard played again as guest with the current line-up of the band, playing at shows in New York, Los Angeles and London, where BÖC played the album "Agents of Fortune" in its entirety. The shows featured songs from "Agents of Fortune" that had either not been played live before ("True Confessions", "The Revenge of Vera Gemini", "Sinful Love", "Tenderloin", "Debbie Denise"), songs that had not been played since the album's debut tour ("Morning Final"), and songs that were either no longer or never were played frequently ("This Ain't the Summer of Love", "Tattoo Vampire"), as well as the fan favorite "Five Guitars", which had not been played since Albert initially left the band in 1981. Albert played in the following songs at the show: "The Revenge of Vera Gemini" (vocals, guitar), "Sinful Love" (vocals, guitar), "Tattoo Vampire" (guitar), "Morning Final" (guitar), "Tenderloin" (cymbals), "Debbie Denise" (vocals, acoustic guitar), "Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll" (vocals, drums), and "Five Guitars" (guitar).

In a January 2017 interview, Roeser stated: "BÖC has tentative plans to do some recording this year. The band we have is so good it would be a shame not to record." It would be the band's first new music since 2001.

In a May 2017 appearance on Castellano's "Band Geek" podcast, Bloom confirmed that there were tentative plans to release a new album in 2018 and that the band was currently considering offers from multiple record labels. He also stated that former bassist Danny Miranda would be playing with the band for the remainder of the year due to Sulton's prior touring commitments with <a href="Todd%20Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>.

The name "Blue Öyster Cult" came from a 1960s poem written by manager <a href="Sandy%20Pearlman">Sandy Pearlman</a>. It was part of his "Imaginos" poetry, later used more extensively on their album "<a href="Imaginos">Imaginos</a>" (1988). Pearlman had also come up with the band's earlier name, "Soft White Underbelly", from a phrase used by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> in describing <a href="Italy">Italy</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. In Pearlman's poetry, the "Blue Oyster Cult" was a group of aliens who had assembled to secretly guide Earth's history. "Initially, the band was not happy with the name, but settled for it, and went to work preparing to record their first release..."

In a 1976 interview published in the U.K. music magazine "<a href="ZigZag%20%28magazine%29">ZigZag</a>", Pearlman told the story explaining the origin of the band's name was an anagram of "Cully Stout Beer".

The addition of the <a href="Metal%20umlaut">umlaut</a> was suggested by <a href="Allen%20Lanier">Allen Lanier</a>, but rock critic <a href="Richard%20Meltzer">Richard Meltzer</a> claims to have suggested it just after Pearlman came up with the name, reportedly "because of the Wagnerian aspect of Metal". Other bands later copied the practice of using umlauts or diacritic marks in their own band names, such as <a href="Mot%C3%B6rhead">Motörhead</a>, <a href="M%C3%B6tley%20Cr%C3%BCe">Mötley Crüe</a>, <a href="Queensr%C3%BFche">Queensrÿche</a> and <a href="Spinal%20Tap%20%28band%29">Spın̈al Tap</a>.

The hook-and-cross logo was designed by Bill Gawlik in January 1972, and appears on all of the band's albums. In Greek mythology, "... the hook-and-cross symbol is that of <a href="Cronus">Kronos (Cronus)</a>, the king of the Titans and father of Zeus ... and is the alchemical symbol for <a href="lead">lead</a> (a <a href="Heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metal</a>), one of the heaviest of metals." Sandy Pearlman considered this, combined with the heavy and distorted guitar sound of the band and decided the description "<a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>" would be aptly applied to Blue Öyster Cult's musical sound. The hook-and-cross symbol also resembled the astrological symbol for <a href="Planets%20in%20astrology">Saturn</a>, the Roman god of agriculture, and the <a href="sickle">sickle</a>, which is associated with both Kronos (Cronus) and Saturn (both the <a href="Saturn">planet</a> and the Roman god). The logo's "... metaphysical, alchemical and mythological connotations, combined with its similarity to some religious symbols gave it a flair of decadence and mystery ..."

The band was billed, for the only time, as "The" Blue Öyster Cult on the cover and label of their second album, "<a href="Tyranny%20and%20Mutation">Tyranny and Mutation</a>".

Blue Öyster Cult have been influential to the realm of hard rock and heavy metal, leading them to being referred to as “the thinking man’s heavy metal band” due to their often cryptic lyrics, literate songwriting, and links to famous authors. They have influenced many acts including <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>, <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>, <a href="Fates%20Warning">Fates Warning</a>, <a href="Iced%20Earth">Iced Earth</a>, <a href="Alice%20in%20Chains">Alice in Chains</a>, <a href="Twisted%20Sister">Twisted Sister</a>, <a href="Ratt">Ratt</a>, <a href="Steel%20Panther">Steel Panthers</a>, <a href="Body%20Count">Body Count</a>, <a href="Possessed%20%28band%29">Possessed</a>, <a href="Candlemass">Candlemass</a>, <a href="Saint%20Vitus%20%28band%29">Saint Vitus</a>, <a href="Trouble%20%28band%29">Trouble</a>, <a href="Opeth">Opeth</a>, <a href="White%20Zombie%20%28band%29">White Zombie</a>, <a href="Kvelertak">Kvelertak</a>, <a href="HIM%20%28Finnish%20band%29">HIM</a>, <a href="Turbonegro">Turbonegro</a>, <a href="Radio%20Birdman">Radio Birdman</a>, <a href="The%20Cult">The Cult</a>, <a href="Minutemen%20%28band%29">The Minutemen</a>, <a href="Firehose%20%28band%29">Firehose</a>, <a href="Hoodoo%20Gurus">Hoodoo Gurus</a>, <a href="Widespread%20Panic">Widespread Panic</a>, <a href="Queens%20of%20the%20Stone%20Age">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href="Umphrey%27s%20McGee">Umphrey’s McGee</a>, <a href="Stabbing%20Westward">Stabbing Westward</a>, <a href="Royal%20Trux">Royal Trux,</a> and <a href="Moe%20%28band%29">Moe</a>.

The in-authored <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> page for <a href="stoner%20metal">stoner metal</a> states: "Stoner metal bands updated the long, mind-bending jams and ultra-heavy riffs of bands like <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, <a href="Blue%20Cheer">Blue Cheer</a>, Blue Oyster Cult and <a href="Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a> by filtering their psychedelia-tinged metal and acid rock through the buzzing sound of early Sub Pop-style grunge."

Heavy metal journalist <a href="Martin%20Popoff">Martin Popoff</a> has stated that Blue Öyster Cult is one of his favorite bands. He has written a book titled "Blue Öyster Cult: Secrets Revealed" about the discography. It is a compiled track-by-track analysis of the entire output of the group that uses period and recent interviews with band members and those close to the band. It is complete up to "Curse of the Hidden Mirror".

Their hit single "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" was featured in the famous "Saturday Night Live" sketch, "<a href="More%20cowbell">More cowbell</a>". The original recording was produced at The Record Plant in New York by <a href="David%20Lucas%20%28producer%29">David Lucas</a>, who sang background vocals with Roeser and played the now famous cowbell part. Manager Sandy Pearlman mixed the record.

"(Don't Fear) The Reaper" was also used in writer/director <a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>'s horror film classic, "<a href="Halloween%20%281978%20film%29">Halloween</a>" (1978), the opening sequence of the miniseries adaptation of "<a href="The%20Stand%20%28miniseries%29">The Stand</a>" (1994) by <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>, and covered by <a href="The%20Mutton%20Birds">The Mutton Birds</a> for <a href="Peter%20Jackson">Peter Jackson</a>'s comedy film "<a href="The%20Frighteners">The Frighteners</a>" (1996). "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" was also used throughout the comedy film "<a href="The%20Stoned%20Age">The Stoned Age</a>" (1994) and plays a role in its storyline.

The band's influence has extended beyond the musical sphere. The lyrics of "Astronomy" have been named by author Shawn St. Jean as inspirational to the later chapters of his fantasy novel "Clotho's Loom", wherein Sandy Pearlman's "Four Winds Bar" provides the setting for a portion of the action.

In 2015, titles and lines from the band's songs provided structure and narrative for the third Robert Galbraith (pseudonym for <a href="J.%20K.%20Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>) novel – "<a href="Career%20of%20Evil">Career of Evil</a>" (a Cormoran Strike novel).



While Eric Bloom has always been the band's official lead singer, other members of the band have contributed lead vocals throughout its history:
"Then Came the Last Days of May", "Before the Kiss, a Redcap", "Teen Archer", "<a href="%28Don%27t%20Fear%29%20The%20Reaper">(Don't Fear) The Reaper</a>", "Godzilla" (duet with Eric Bloom), "Golden Age of Leather", "I Love the Night", "In Thee", "Mirrors", "The Vigil", "Lonely Teardrops", "Deadline", "Burnin' for You", "Don't Turn Your Back", "Shooting Shark", "Veins", "Dragon Lady", "Dancin' in the Ruins", "Perfect Water", "Spy in the House of the Night", "Madness to the Method", "Astronomy (Imaginos version)", "Les Invisibles", "Magna of Illusion", "Harvest Moon", "X-Ray Eyes", "Damaged", "Real World", "Live for Me", "Still Burnin'", "Dance on Stilts", "Pocket", "Here Comes That Feeling", "Stone of Love", "Night Flyer" (out-take from "Spectres"), "Summa Cum Laude"

Battery Park City

Battery Park City is a mainly residential <a href="planned%20community">planned community</a> on the west side of the southern tip of the island of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. More than one-third of the development is parkland. The land upon which it is built was created by <a href="land%20reclamation">land reclamation</a> on the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> using over of soil and rock excavated during the construction of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973-2001%29">World Trade Center</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Water%20Tunnel">New York City Water Tunnel</a>, and certain other construction projects, as well as from sand dredged from <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">New York Harbor</a> off <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>. The neighborhood, which is the site of <a href="Brookfield%20Place%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Brookfield Place</a> (formerly the World Financial Center), along with numerous buildings designed for housing, commercial, and retail, is named for adjacent <a href="The%20Battery%20%28Manhattan%29">Battery Park</a>.

Battery Park City is bounded on the east by <a href="West%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">West Street</a>, which separates the area from the <a href="Financial%20District%2C%20Manhattan">Financial District</a> of <a href="lower%20Manhattan">lower Manhattan</a>. To the west, north, and south, the area is surrounded by the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>.

The development consists of roughly five major sections. Traveling north to south, the first neighborhood has high-rise residential buildings, the <a href="Stuyvesant%20High%20School">Stuyvesant High School</a>, a <a href="Regal%20Entertainment%20Group">Regal Entertainment Group</a> movie theater, and the <a href="%23Library">Battery Park City branch</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Library">New York Public Library</a>. It is also the site of the 463-suite Conrad New York luxury hotel, which contains restaurants and bars such as the Loopy Doopy Rooftop Bar, ATRIO Wine Bar Restaurant, Mexican-themed El Vez, and three <a href="Danny%20Meyer">Danny Meyer</a>-branded restaurants (North End Grill, Blue Smoke, <a href="Shake%20Shack">Shake Shack</a>); the hotel has a ballroom and a conference center. Other restaurants located in that hotel, as well as a <a href="DSW%2C%20Inc.">DSW</a> store and a <a href="New%20York%20Sports%20Club">New York Sports Club</a> branch, were closed in 2009 after the takeover of the property by <a href="Goldman%20Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a>. Former undeveloped lots in the area have been developed into high-rise buildings; for example, <a href="Goldman%20Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> built a new headquarters at <a href="200%20West%20Street">200 West Street</a>.

Nearby is <a href="%23Brookfield%20Place">Brookfield Place</a>, a complex of several commercial buildings formerly known as the World Financial Center.

Current residential neighborhoods of Battery Park City are divided into northern and southern sections, separated by Brookfield Place. The northern section consists entirely of large, 20–45-story buildings, all various shades of orange brick. The southern section, extending down from the Winter Garden, which is located in Brookfield Place, contains residential apartment buildings such as Gateway Plaza and the Rector Place apartment buildings. In this section lies the majority of Battery Park City's residential areas, in three sections: Gateway Plaza, a high-rise building complex; the "Rector Place Residential Neighborhood"; and the" Battery Place Residential Neighborhood". These subsections contain most of the area's residential buildings, along with <a href="park">park</a> space, <a href="supermarket">supermarket</a>s, <a href="restaurant">restaurant</a>s, and <a href="movie%20theater">movie theater</a>s. Construction of residential buildings began north of the World Financial Center in the late 1990s, and completion of the final lots took place in early 2011. Additionally, a park restoration was completed in 2013.

Throughout the 19th century and early 20th century, the area adjoining today's Battery Park City was known as <a href="%23Cultural%20heritage">Little Syria</a> with Lebanese, Greeks, Armenians, and other ethnic groups. In 1929, the land was the proposed site of a $50,000,000 residential development that would have served workers in the Wall Street area. The <a href="Battery%20Tower%20%28Manhattan%29">Battery Tower</a> project was left unfinished after workers digging the foundation ran into forty feet of old <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a>, sunken docks, and ships. Construction was halted and never restarted.

By the late 1950s, the once-prosperous port area of downtown Manhattan was occupied by a number of dilapidated shipping piers, casualties of the rise of <a href="container%20shipping">container shipping</a> which drove sea traffic to <a href="Port%20Newark-Elizabeth%20Marine%20Terminal">Port Elizabeth, New Jersey</a>. The initial proposal to reclaim this area through <a href="Land%20reclamation">landfill</a> was offered in the early 1960s by private firms and supported by the mayor. That plan became complicated when Governor <a href="Nelson%20Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> announced his desire to redevelop a part of the area as a separate project. The various groups reached a compromise, and in 1966 the governor unveiled the proposal for what would become Battery Park City. The creation of architect <a href="Wallace%20K.%20Harrison">Wallace K. Harrison</a>, the proposal called for a 'comprehensive community' consisting of housing, social infrastructure and light industry. The landscaping of the park space and later the Winter Garden was designed by <a href="M.%20Paul%20Friedberg">M. Paul Friedberg</a>.

In 1968, the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> created the <a href="Battery%20Park%20City%20Authority">Battery Park City Authority</a> (BPCA) to oversee development. The <a href="Empire%20State%20Development%20Corporation">New York State Urban Development Corporation</a> and ten other public agencies were also involved in the development project. For the next several years, the BPCA made slow progress. In April 1969, it unveiled a master plan for the area, which was approved in October. In early 1972, the BPCA issued $200 million in bonds to fund construction efforts, with <a href="Harry%20Helmsley">Harry B. Helmsley</a> designated as the developer. That same year, low-income housing units were removed from the master plan due to opposition.

Landfill material from <a href="Building%20of%20the%20World%20Trade%20Center">construction</a> of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973-2001%29">World Trade Center</a> was used to add fill for the southern portion. Cellular <a href="cofferdam">cofferdam</a>s were constructed to retain the material. After removal of the piers, wooden piles and overburden of silt, the northern portion (north of, and including the marina) was filled with sand dredged from areas adjacent to <a href="Ambrose%20Channel">Ambrose Channel</a> in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as stone from the construction of <a href="New%20York%20City%20Water%20Tunnel%20No.%203">Water Tunnel #3</a>. By 1976, the landfill was completed. Seating stands for viewing the American Bicentennial "Operation Sail" flotilla parade were set up on the completed landfill in July 1976. Construction efforts ground to a halt in 1977, as a result of the city's fiscal crisis. That year, the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Jimmy%20Carter">presidential administration of Jimmy Carter</a> approved mortgage insurance for 1,600 of the development's proposed units. In 1979, the title to the landfill was transferred from the city to the Battery Park City Authority, which financially restructured itself and created a new, more viable master plan, designed by <a href="Alex%20Cooper">Alex Cooper</a> and Stanton Eckstut. By that time, only two of the proposed development's buildings had been built, and the $200 million bond issue was supposed to have been paid off the next year.

The design of BPC to some degree reflects the values of vibrant city neighborhoods championed by <a href="Jane%20Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a>. The <a href="Urban%20Land%20Institute">Urban Land Institute</a> (ULI) awarded the Battery Park City Master Plan its 2010 Heritage Award, for having "facilitated the private development of 9.3 million square feet of commercial space, 7.2 million square feet of residential space, and nearly 36 acres of open space in lower Manhattan, becoming a model for successful large-scale planning efforts and marking a positive shift away from the urban renewal mindset of the time."

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the site hosted Creative Time's landmark Art on the Beach sculpture exhibitions. On September 23, 1979, the landfill was the site of an <a href="List%20of%20anti-nuclear%20protests%20in%20the%20United%20States">anti-nuclear rally</a> attended by 200,000 people.

Construction began on the first residential building in June 1980. In April 1981, the New York State Urban Development Corporation (now the <a href="Empire%20State%20Development%20Corporation">Empire State Development Corporation</a>) issued a <a href="request%20for%20proposal">request for proposal</a>, ultimately selecting six real-estate companies to develop over 1,800 residential units. The same year, the <a href="Brookfield%20Place%20%28New%20York%20City%29">World Financial Center</a> started construction; <a href="Olympia%20and%20York">Olympia and York</a> of <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> was named as the developer for the World Financial Center, who then hired <a href="Cesar%20Pelli">Cesar Pelli</a> as the lead architect. By 1985, construction was completed and the World Financial Center (later renamed Brookfield Place New York) saw its first tenants. The newly completed development was lauded by "The New York Times" as "a triumph of urban design," with the World Financial Center being deemed "a symbol of change."

During early construction, two acres of land in the southern section of the Battery Park landfill was used by artist <a href="Agnes%20Denes">Agnes Denes</a> to plant wheat in an exhibition titled "Wheatfield - A Confrontation". The project was a visual contradiction: a golden field of wheat set among the steel skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan. It was created during a six-month period in the spring, summer, and fall of 1982 when Denes, with the support of the <a href="Public%20Art%20Fund">Public Art Fund</a>, planted the field of wheat on rubble-strewn land near <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> and the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20site">World Trade Center site</a>. Denes stated that her "decision to plant a wheatfield in Manhattan, instead of designing just another public sculpture, grew out of a long-standing concern and need to call attention to our misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values."

Throughout the 1980s, the BPCA oversaw a great deal of construction, including the entire <a href="Rector%20Place">Rector Place</a> neighborhood and the river esplanade. It was during that period that <a href="Amanda%20Burden">Amanda Burden</a>, later City Planning Department Director in the Bloomberg administration, worked on Battery Park City. During the 1980s, a total of 13 buildings were constructed. The <a href="Vietnam%20Veterans%20Plaza">Vietnam Veterans Plaza</a> was established by <a href="Edward%20I.%20Koch">Edward I. Koch</a> in 1985. In the early 1990s, Battery Park City became the new home of the <a href="Stuyvesant%20High%20School">Stuyvesant High School</a>. During the 1990s, an additional six buildings were added to the neighborhood. By the turn of the 21st century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street.

Initially, in the 1980s, 23 buildings were built in the area. By the 1990s, 9 more buildings were built, followed by the construction of 11 buildings in the 2000s and 3 buildings in the 2010s. The Battery Park City Authority, wishing to attract more middle-class residents, started providing subsidies in 1998 to households whose annual incomes were $108,000 or less. By the end of the decade, nearly the entire landfill had been developed.

The <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> in 2001 had a major impact on Battery Park City. The residents of lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced for an extended period of time. Parts of the community were an official crime-scene and therefore residents were unable to return to live or even collect property. Many of the displaced residents were not allowed to return to the area for months and none were given government guidance of where to live temporarily on the already crowded island of Manhattan. With most hotel rooms booked, residents, including young children and the elderly were forced to fend for themselves.

When they were finally allowed to return to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted. Upon residents' return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until December, 2001. More than half of the area's residents moved away permanently from the community after the adjacent World Trade Center towers collapsed and spread toxic dust, debris, and smoke. Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. Temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.

After September 11, 2001, residents of Battery Park City and <a href="Tribeca">Tribeca</a> formed <a href="the%20TriBattery%20Pops%20Tom%20Goodkind%20Conductor">the TriBattery Pops Tom Goodkind Conductor</a> in response to the events of the attacks. The “Pops” have been <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy</a>-nominated and are the first lower Manhattan all-volunteer community band in a century.

Since then, real estate development in the area has continued robustly. Commercial development includes the <a href="200%20West%20Street">200 West Street</a>, the <a href="Goldman%20Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> global headquarters, which began construction in 2005 and opened for occupancy in October 2009. 200 West Street is seeking gold-level certification under the <a href="United%20States%20Green%20Building%20Council">United States Green Building Council</a>’s <a href="Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) program by incorporating various water and energy conservation features. Several residential projects are underway, including LEED buildings which cater to the environmentally conscious.

Battery Park City is owned and managed by the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority (BPCA), a Class A <a href="public-benefit%20corporation">public-benefit corporation</a> created by New York State in 1968 to redevelop outmoded and deteriorated piers, a project that has involved <a href="land%20reclamation">reclaiming the land</a>, replanning the area and facilitating new construction of a mixed commercial and residential community. It has operated under the authority of the <a href="Empire%20State%20Development%20Corporation">Urban Development Corporation</a>. Its mission is "to plan, create, co-ordinate and maintain a balanced community of <a href="commerce">commercial</a>, <a href="residential">residential</a>, <a href="retail">retail</a>, and <a href="park">park</a> space within its designated 92-acre site on the <a href="Lower%20West%20Side%2C%20Manhattan">lower west side</a> of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>" in New York City. The authority's board is composed of seven uncompensated members who are appointed by the <a href="governor">governor</a> and who serve six-year terms. The BPCA is invested with substantial powers: it can acquire, hold and dispose of <a href="real%20property">real property</a>, enter into <a href="rental%20agreement">lease agreements</a>, borrow money and issue <a href="bond%20%28finance%29">debt</a>, and manage the project. Like other public benefit corporations, the BPCA is exempt from <a href="property%20tax">property tax</a>es and has the ability to issue <a href="municipal%20bond">tax exempt bonds</a>.

Under the 1989 agreement between the BPCA and the City of New York, $600 million was transferred by the BPCA to the city. Charles J. Urstadt, the first Chairman and CEO of the BPCA, noted in an August 19, 2007 op-ed piece in the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" that the aggregate figure of funds transferred to the City of New York is above $1.4 billion, with the BPCA continuing to contribute $200 million a year.

Excess revenue from the area was to be contributed to other housing efforts, typically low-income projects in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a> and <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. Much of this funding has historically been diverted to general city expenses, under section 3.d of the 1989 agreement. However, in July 2006, Mayor <a href="Michael%20Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a>, Governor <a href="George%20Pataki">George Pataki</a>, and Comptroller <a href="William%20C.%20Thompson%2C%20Jr.">William C. Thompson, Jr.</a> announced the final approval for the New York City Housing Trust Fund derived from $130 million in Battery Park City revenues. The fund aimed to preserve or create 4,300 units of low- and moderate-income housing by 2009. It also provided seed financing for the New York Acquisition Fund, a $230 million initiative that aims to serve as a catalyst for the construction and preservation of more than 30,000 units of affordable housing citywide by 2016. The Acquisition Fund has since established itself as a model for similar funds in cities and states across the country.

As of the 2000 census, there were 7,951 people residing in Battery Park City. The population density was 41,032 people per square mile (15,855/km²). The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 75% <a href="White%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">White</a>, 17.93% <a href="Asian%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Asian</a>, 0.04% <a href="Pacific%20Islander%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Pacific Islander</a>, 2.97% <a href="African%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">African American</a>, 0.06% <a href="Native%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Native American</a>, 1.58% from <a href="Race%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">other races</a>, and 2.42% from two or more races. 5.32% of the population were <a href="Hispanic%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Hispanic</a> of any race. 27.7% of the population was foreign born, 51.8% came from Asia, 30.8% from Europe, 8.2% from Latin America and 9.2% from other (mostly Canada).

, about 10,000 people live in Battery Park City, most of whom are <a href="upper%20middle%20class">upper middle class</a> and <a href="upper%20class">upper class</a> (54.0% of households have incomes over $100,000). When fully built out, the neighborhood is projected to have 14,000 residents. The population history is as follows:


A largely <a href="Arab-American">Arab-American</a> neighborhood existed adjacent to what is today southeastern Battery Park City from the late 1880s to the 1940s. "<a href="Little%20Syria%2C%20Manhattan">Little Syria</a>" encompassed <a href="Washington%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Washington Street</a> from Battery Park to Rector Street. It declined as a neighborhood as the inhabitants became successful and moved to other areas, especially <a href="Atlantic%20Avenue%20%28Brooklyn%29">Atlantic Avenue</a> in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, and disappeared almost entirely when a great deal of lower Washington Street was demolished to make way for entrance ramps to the <a href="Brooklyn-Battery%20Tunnel">Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel</a>, which opened in 1950. The overwhelming majority of the residents were <a href="Arab%20Christians">Arabic-speaking Christians</a>, <a href="Melkite">Melkite</a> and <a href="Maronite">Maronite</a> immigrants from present-day <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> who settled in the area in the late 19th century, escaping <a href="Dhimmi">religious persecution</a> and poverty in their homelands – which were then under control of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> – and answering the call of American <a href="Missionary">missionaries</a> to escape their difficulties by traveling to New York City.

However, many other ethnic groups had lived in this diverse neighborhood, including Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Slovaks, Poles, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Czechs, and Irish.

A long-standing reminder of the ethnic past was the former <a href="St.%20Nicholas%20Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church</a>, which was destroyed in the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. An additional historic church, <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Syrian%20Catholic%20Church">St. George's Syrian Catholic Church</a>, still stands at 103 Washington Street.

Bacterial vaginosis

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a <a href="disease">disease</a> of the <a href="vagina">vagina</a> caused by excessive growth of <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>. Common symptoms include increased <a href="vaginal%20discharge">vaginal discharge</a> that often smells like fish. The discharge is usually white or gray in color. <a href="Dysuria">Burning with urination</a> may occur. Itching is uncommon. Occasionally, there may be no symptoms. Having BV approximately doubles the risk of infection by a number of other <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20infections">sexually transmitted infections</a>, including <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>. It also increases the risk of <a href="preterm">early delivery</a> among pregnant women.
BV is caused by an imbalance of the naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina. There is a change in the most common type of bacteria and a hundred to thousandfold increase in total numbers of bacteria present. Typically, bacteria other than "Lactobacilli" become more common. Risk factors include <a href="douching">douching</a>, new or <a href="multiple%20sex%20partners">multiple sex partners</a>, <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s, and using an <a href="intrauterine%20device">intrauterine device</a>, among others. However, it is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms, and may be verified by testing the vaginal discharge and finding a higher than normal vaginal <a href="pH">pH</a>, and large numbers of bacteria. BV is often confused with a <a href="vaginal%20yeast%20infection">vaginal yeast infection</a> or <a href="infection%20with%20Trichomonas">infection with Trichomonas</a>.
Usually treatment is with an antibiotic, such as <a href="clindamycin">clindamycin</a> or <a href="metronidazole">metronidazole</a>. These medications may also be used in the second or third trimesters of <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. However, the condition often recurs following treatment. <a href="Probiotic">Probiotic</a>s may help prevent re-occurrence. It is unclear if the use of probiotics or antibiotics affects pregnancy outcomes.
BV is the most common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. The percentage of women affected at any given time varies between 5% and 70%. BV is most common in parts of Africa and least common in Asia and Europe. In the United States about 30% of women between the ages of 14 and 49 are affected. Rates vary considerably between <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a>s within a country. While BV like symptoms have been described for much of recorded history, the first clearly documented case occurred in 1894.

Common symptoms include increased <a href="vaginal%20discharge">vaginal discharge</a> that usually smells like fish. The discharge is often white or gray in color. There may be <a href="Dysuria">burning with urination</a>. Occasionally, there may be no symptoms.

The discharge coats the walls of the vagina, and is usually without significant irritation, pain, or <a href="erythema">erythema</a> (redness), although mild <a href="Pruritus">itching</a> can sometimes occur. By contrast, the normal vaginal discharge will vary in consistency and amount throughout the <a href="menstrual%20cycle">menstrual cycle</a> and is at its clearest at <a href="ovulation">ovulation</a>—about two weeks before the <a href="menstruation">period</a> starts. Some practitioners claim that BV can be asymptomatic in almost half of affected women, though others argue that this is often a misdiagnosis.

Healthy vaginal microbiota consists of species which neither cause symptoms or infections, nor negatively affect pregnancy. It is dominated mainly by Lactobacillus species. BV is defined by the disequilibrium in the <a href="List%20of%20microbiota%20species%20of%20the%20lower%20reproductive%20tract%20of%20women">vaginal microbiota</a>, with decline in the number of <a href="lactobacilli">lactobacilli</a>. While the infection involves a number of bacteria, it is believed that most infections start with <a href="Gardnerella%20vaginalis">Gardnerella vaginalis</a> creating a <a href="biofilm">biofilm</a>, which allows other <a href="opportunistic%20infection">opportunistic bacteria</a> to thrive.

One of the main risks for developing BV is <a href="douching">douching</a>, which alters the vaginal flora and predisposes women to developing BV. Douching is strongly discouraged by the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a> and various medical authorities, for this and other reasons.

BV is a risk factor for <a href="pelvic%20inflammatory%20disease">pelvic inflammatory disease</a>, HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and reproductive and obstetric disorders or negative outcomes. It is possible for sexually inactive persons to develop bacterial vaginosis.

Bacterial vaginosis may sometimes affect women after <a href="menopause">menopause</a>. Also, subclinical iron deficiency may correlate with bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy. A longitudinal study published in February 2006, in the "American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology", showed a link between psychosocial stress and bacterial vaginosis persisted even when other risk factors were taken into account. Exposure to the spermicide <a href="nonoxynol-9">nonoxynol-9</a> does not affect the risk of developing bacterial vaginosis.

Having a <a href="Women%20who%20have%20sex%20with%20women">female partner</a> increases the risk of BV by 60%. The bacteria associated with BV have been isolated from <a href="Male%20reproductive%20system">male genitalia</a>. BV microbiota has been found in the <a href="penis">penis</a>, <a href="coronal%20sulcus">coronal sulcus</a>, and <a href="male%20urethra">male urethra</a>, in the male partners of infected females. Partners who have not been <a href="Circumcision">circumcised</a> may act as a ‘<a href="Natural%20reservoir">reservoir</a>’ increasing the likelihood of acquiring an infection after sexual intercourse. Another mode of transmission of the BV-associated microbiota is to a female sexual partner via skin-to-skin transfer. BV may be transmitted via the perineal enteric bacteria from the microbiota of the female and male genitalia.

To make a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, a swab from inside the vagina should be obtained. These swabs should be tested for:

Two positive results in addition to the discharge itself are enough to diagnose BV. If there is no discharge, then all three criteria are needed.
Differential diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis includes the following:

The Center For Disease Control (CDC) defines STIs as "a variety of clinical syndromes and infections caused by pathogens that can be acquired and transmitted through sexual activity." But the CDC does not specifically identify BV as sexually transmitted infection.

In clinical practice BV can be diagnosed using the Amsel criteria:


At least three of the four criteria should be present for a confirmed diagnosis.
A modification of the Amsel criteria accepts the presence of two instead of three factors and is considered equally diagnostic.

An alternative is to use a Gram-stained vaginal smear, with the Hay/Ison criteria or the Nugent criteria. The Hay/Ison criteria are defined as follows:
Gardnerella vaginalis is the main culprit in BV. Gardnerella vaginalis is a short rod (coccobacillus). Hence, the presence of clue cells and gram variable coccobacilli are indicative or diagnostic of bacterial vaginosis.

The Nugent Score is now rarely used by physicians due to the time it takes to read the slides and requires the use of a trained microscopist. A score of 0-10 is generated from combining three other scores. The scores are as follows:
At least 10–20 high power (1000× oil immersion) fields are counted and an average determined.

<a href="DNA%20hybridization">DNA hybridization</a> testing with Affirm VPIII was compared to the Gram stain using the Nugent criteria. The Affirm VPIII test may be used for the rapid diagnosis of BV in symptomatic women but uses expensive proprietary equipment to read results, and does not detect other pathogens that cause BV, including Prevotella spp, Bacteroides spp, & Mobiluncus spp.

Some steps suggested to lower the risk include: not <a href="douching">douching</a>, avoiding sex, or limiting the number of sex partners.

One review concluded that probiotics may help prevent re-occurrence. Another review found that while there is tentative evidence it is not strong enough to recommend their use for this purpose.

Early evidence suggested that antibiotic treatment of male partners could re-establish the normal microbiota of the male urogenital tract and prevent the recurrence of infection. However, a 2016 Cochrane review found high-quality evidence that treating the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis had no effect on symptoms, clinical outcomes, or recurrence in the affected women. It also found that such treatment may lead treated sexual partners to report increased adverse events.

Treatment is typically with the <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s <a href="metronidazole">metronidazole</a> or <a href="clindamycin">clindamycin</a>. They can be either given by mouth or applied inside the vagina. About 10% to 15% of people, however, do not improve with the first course of antibiotics and recurrence rates of up to 80% have been documented. Recurrence rates are increased with sexual activity with the same pre-/posttreatment partner and inconsistent condom use although estrogen-containing contraceptives decrease recurrence. When clindamycin is given to pregnant women symptomatic with BV before 22 weeks of gestation the risk of pre-term birth before 37 weeks of gestation is lower.

Other antibiotics that may work include <a href="macrolide">macrolide</a>s, <a href="lincosamide">lincosamide</a>s, <a href="nitroimidazole">nitroimidazole</a>s, and <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>s.

Bacterial vaginosis is not considered a <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20infection">sexually transmitted infection</a>, and treatment of a male sexual partner of a woman with bacterial vaginosis is not recommended.

A 2009 Cochrane review found tentative but insufficient evidence for probiotics as a treatment for BV. A 2014 review reached the same conclusion. A 2013 review found some evidence supporting the use of probiotics during pregnancy.

Although previously considered a mere nuisance infection, untreated bacterial vaginosis may cause complications, such as increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections including HIV and <a href="pregnancy%20complication">pregnancy complication</a>s.

It has been shown that HIV-infected women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) are more likely to transmit HIV to their sexual partners than those without BV. Diagnostic criteria for BV have also been associated with a female genital tract factor that induces expression of HIV.

There is evidence of an association between BV and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS. BV is associated with up to a six-fold increase in HIV shedding. There is also a correlation between the absence of vaginal lactobacilli and infection by <a href="Neisseria%20gonorrhea">Neisseria gonorrhea</a> and <a href="Chlamydia%20trachomatis">Chlamydia trachomatis</a>. BV is a risk factor for viral shedding and <a href="herpes%20simplex%20virus">herpes simplex virus</a> type 2 infection. BV may increase the risk of infection with or reactivation of <a href="human%20papillomavirus">human papillomavirus</a> (HPV).

In addition, bacterial vaginosis an <a href="intercurrent%20disease%20in%20pregnancy">intercurrent disease in pregnancy</a> may increase the risk of pregnancy complications, most notably <a href="premature%20birth">premature birth</a> or <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>.
Pregnant women with BV have a higher risk of <a href="chorioamnionitis">chorioamnionitis</a>, <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>, preterm birth, <a href="premature%20rupture%20of%20membranes">premature rupture of membranes</a>, and postpartum <a href="endometritis">endometritis</a>. BV is associated with gynecological and obstetric complications. Data suggest an association between BV, tubal factor <a href="infertility">infertility</a>, and <a href="pelvic%20inflammatory%20disease">pelvic inflammatory disease</a>. Women with BV who are treated with <a href="in%20vitro%20fertilization">in vitro fertilization</a> have a lower implantation rate and higher rates of early pregnancy loss.

BV is the most common infection of the vagina in women of reproductive age. The percentage of women affected at any given time varies between 5% and 70%. BV is most common in parts of Africa, and least common in Asia and Europe. In the United States, about 30% of those between the ages of 14 and 49 are affected. Rates vary considerably between ethnic groups within a country.

Bud Selig

Allan Huber "Bud" Selig (; born July 30, 1934) is an American baseball executive who currently serves as the Commissioner Emeritus of Baseball. Previously, he served as the ninth <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">Commissioner of Baseball</a>. He initially served as the acting commissioner beginning in 1992 before being named the official commissioner in 1998. Selig oversaw baseball through the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">1994 strike</a>, the introduction of the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20wild%20card">wild card</a>, <a href="interleague%20play">interleague play</a>, and the merging of the <a href="National%20League">National</a> and <a href="American%20League">American League</a>s under the Office of the Commissioner. He was instrumental in organizing the <a href="World%20Baseball%20Classic">World Baseball Classic</a> in 2006. Selig also introduced revenue sharing. He is credited for the financial turnaround of baseball during his tenure with a 400 percent increase in the revenue of MLB and annual record breaking attendance. Selig enjoys a high level of support from baseball owners. <a href="Jerome%20Holtzman">Jerome Holtzman</a>, MLB's official historian from 1999 until his death in 2008, believed Selig to be the best commissioner in baseball history.

During Selig's term of service, <a href="Banned%20substances%20in%20baseball">the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs</a> became a public issue. The <a href="Mitchell%20Report%20%28baseball%29">Mitchell Report</a>, commissioned by Selig, concluded that the MLB commissioners, club officials, the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">Players Association</a>, and the players all share "to some extent in the responsibility for the steroid era." Following the release of the Mitchell Report, Congressman <a href="Cliff%20Stearns">Cliff Stearns</a> called publicly for Selig to step down as commissioner, citing his "glacial response" to the "growing stain on baseball." Selig has pledged on numerous occasions to rid baseball of performance-enhancing drugs, and has overseen and instituted many rule changes and penalties to that end.

Selig was previously the team owner and team president of the <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a>. As a Milwaukee native, he is credited for keeping baseball in Milwaukee. In 1970, he purchased the <a href="Seattle%20Pilots">Seattle Pilots</a> in bankruptcy court and renamed them the Milwaukee Brewers after the <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers%20%28minor%20league%20baseball%20team%29">minor league team of the same name</a> he had watched in his youth, which existed until the arrival of the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Braves</a> in Milwaukee in 1953. The Brewers went to the <a href="1982%20World%20Series">1982 World Series</a> and won seven organization of the year awards during his tenure. Selig remains a resident of Milwaukee.

On January 17, 2008, Selig's contract was extended through 2012, after which he planned to retire, but he then decided to stay as commissioner until the end of the 2014 season, a move approved by the owners on January 12, 2012, which would take his leadership past his 80th birthday. Selig made $14.5 million in the 12-month period ending October 31, 2005. Selig announced on September 26, 2013, that he would retire in January 2015. On January 22, 2015, <a href="MLB">MLB</a> announced that Selig would formally step down from the office when his current term expired on January 24, 2015.

He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2017.

Selig was born in <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, and grew up in a Jewish family. His father, Ben Selig, had come to the United States from <a href="Romania">Romania</a> with his family when he was four years old. Selig graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">B.A.</a> in <a href="American%20history">American history</a> and <a href="political%20science">political science</a> in 1956. He served two years in the <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> before working with his father who owned a car leasing business in Milwaukee. Selig continues to be involved in the automotive industry, serving as president of the Selig Executive Lease Company.

Selig's interest in baseball came from his mother. An immigrant from <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, Marie Selig attended college, a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early 20th century, and became a school teacher. When Selig was only three, Marie began taking him and his older brother, Jerry, to <a href="Borchert%20Field">Borchert Field</a>, where the minor league <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers%20%28minor%20league%20baseball%20team%29">Milwaukee Brewers</a> played. When the <a href="Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29">Boston Braves</a> relocated to Milwaukee in 1953, Selig switched allegiances, and eventually became the team's largest public stockholder. Selig was devastated when he learned that the Braves were going to leave Milwaukee in favor of <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. In 1965, when the Braves left Milwaukee, he divested his stock in the team. As a youngster, Selig's favorite player was <a href="Hersh%20Martin">Hershel Martin</a>.

As a minority owner of the <a href="Milwaukee%20Braves%20%281953%E2%80%9365%29">Milwaukee Braves</a>, Selig founded the organization Teams, Inc., in an attempt to prevent the majority owners (based out of Chicago) from moving the club to a larger television market. This was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations (in the modern era) left a city without a team. Prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams. When his quest to keep the team in Milwaukee finally failed after the <a href="1965%20in%20baseball">1965 season</a>, he changed the group's name to Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc., after the <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers%20%28minor%20league%20baseball%20team%29">minor league baseball team</a> he grew up watching, and devoted himself to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.

Selig arranged for major league games to be played at <a href="Milwaukee%20County%20Stadium">Milwaukee County Stadium</a>. The first, a pre-season match-up between the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> and <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>, drew more than 51,000 spectators. Selig followed this up by hosting nine White Sox regular-season games in 1968 and eleven in 1969. One of the games played in Milwaukee that year was against the expansion <a href="Seattle%20Pilots">Seattle Pilots</a>, the team that would become the Brewers. Those Milwaukee "home" games were phenomenally successful, with the handful of games accounting for about "one-third" of total White Sox home attendance.

To satisfy that fan base, Selig decided to purchase the White Sox (with the intention of moving them to Milwaukee) in 1969. He entered into an agreement to buy the club, but the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> vetoed the sale, preferring to keep an American League team in Chicago, which at the time was still America's second largest city. Selig turned his attention to other franchises.

In 1970, he purchased the bankrupt Seattle Pilots franchise, moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the "Brewers".

During Selig's tenure as club president, the Brewers participated in postseason play in 1981, when the team finished first in the American League East during the second half of the season, and in 1982, when the team made it to the <a href="1982%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, under the leadership of future <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Famers</a> <a href="Robin%20Yount">Robin Yount</a> and <a href="Paul%20Molitor">Paul Molitor</a>. Under Selig's watch, the Brewers also won seven Organization of the Year awards. Selig was part of the owners' <a href="Baseball%20collusion%231985%E2%80%931987">collusion</a> in 1985–1987, resulting in the owners paying US$280 million in damages to the players.

Upon his assumption of the commissioner's role, Selig transferred his ownership interest in the Brewers to his daughter <a href="Wendy%20Selig-Prieb">Wendy Selig-Prieb</a> in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest, though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations. Although the team has been sold to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> investor <a href="Mark%20Attanasio">Mark Attanasio</a>, questions remain regarding Selig's past involvement. Selig's defenders point to the poor management of the team after Selig-Prieb took control as proof that Selig was not working behind the scenes.

Selig was elected to the <a href="Wisconsin%20Athletic%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame</a> in 2001.

On August 24, 2010, a statue of Selig, the "<a href="Selig%20Monument">Selig Monument</a>", commissioned by Brewers owner Mark Attanasio and designed by artist Brian Maughan, was unveiled outside Miller Park in Milwaukee.

Selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of Commissioner <a href="Fay%20Vincent">Fay Vincent</a>, and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal. Selig has never stated that the owners <a href="Baseball%20collusion">colluded</a>, while Vincent has:
Following an 18-9 <a href="no-confidence%20vote">no-confidence vote</a>, Vincent resigned. Selig had by this time become chairman of the Executive Council of Major League Baseball, and as such became <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> acting commissioner.

His first major act was to institute the <a href="MLB%20Wild%20Card">Wild Card</a> and divisional playoff play, which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans. Those against the Wild Card see it as diminishing the importance of the <a href="pennant%20race">pennant race</a> and the regular season, with the true race often being for second rather than first place, while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a first-place finish in their division, thus maintaining fan interest later in the season.

Selig suspended <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> owner <a href="Marge%20Schott">Marge Schott</a> for a year in 1993 for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions. The same year, <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> owner <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a> was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by Selig's predecessor <a href="Fay%20Vincent">Fay Vincent</a>. <a href="Pete%20Rose">Pete Rose</a> has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration. Rose, along with his close friend and former teammate <a href="Mike%20Schmidt">Mike Schmidt</a> (who is a strong supporter of Rose's reinstatement into baseball), met with Selig in 2002, where Rose privately admitted to Selig (two years before going public with his admission) about <a href="Dowd%20Report">betting on baseball</a>. Bud Selig was a close friend of the late <a href="A.%20Bartlett%20Giamatti">Bart Giamatti</a>, who was the commissioner when Rose was first banned from the sport in 1989.

As acting commissioner, Selig represented MLB during the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">1994 players strike</a> and cancelled the <a href="1994%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since <a href="1904%20World%20Series">1904</a>.

After a six-year search for a new commissioner, the owners voted to give Selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the <a href="1998%20in%20baseball">1998 season</a>.

During his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in 2002, and has seen the implementation of <a href="interleague%20play">interleague play</a>.

Whereas in the past, the <a href="National%20League">National</a> and <a href="American%20League">American</a> leagues had separate administrative organizations (which, for example, allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a>), under Selig, Major League Baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the Commissioner's Office in 2000. The last official presidents of the NL and AL were <a href="Leonard%20S.%20Coleman%20Jr.">Leonard S. Coleman Jr.</a> and Dr. <a href="Gene%20Budig">Gene Budig</a> respectively.

On September 11, 2001, Selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">terror attacks on New York and Washington</a>. The games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims, but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players.

After the conclusion of the <a href="2001%20World%20Series">2001 World Series</a>, Selig held a vote on contracting two teams, reportedly the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> and <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a>. This action led to Selig (along with former Expos owner <a href="Jeffrey%20Loria">Jeffrey Loria</a>) being sued for racketeering and conspiring with Loria to deliberately defraud the Expos minority owners. If found liable, the league could have been ordered to pay as much as $500 million in total damages. The judge also ruled that the Expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over. The case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

A week after Selig’s announcement, Hennepin County Judge Harry Seymour Crump issued a temporary restraining order that forced the Twins to honor their lease and play the 2002 season at the <a href="Metrodome">Metrodome</a>. In August 2002, the effort to contract the Twins officially fizzled as players and owners reached a consensus on a new labor agreement which extended the team's <a href="Metrodome">Metrodome</a> lease.

The <a href="2002%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">2002 All-Star Game</a>, played in Selig's hometown of <a href="Miller%20Park%20%28Milwaukee%29">Milwaukee</a>, was tied 7-7 after 9 innings, and remained tied after the bottom of the 11th inning. Due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings, both managers had used their entire roster. Concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound, Selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie, to the dissatisfaction of the Milwaukee fans. Selig later said that this call was "embarrassing" and that he was "tremendously saddened" by the outcome of the game.

Since 2002, Selig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the All-Star Game by awarding the winning league home-field advantage in the World Series. The <a href="2003%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">2003 All-Star Game</a> had the same U.S. viewership as 2002 (9.5 <a href="Share%20%28ratings%29">rating</a>; 17 <a href="Ratings%20share">share</a>) and the ratings declined in 2004 (8.8 rating; 15 share) and 2005 (8.1 rating; 14 share). The American television audience increased in 2006 (9.3 rating; 16 share).

On July 1, 2005, Selig suspended <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a> pitcher <a href="Kenny%20Rogers%20%28baseball%29">Kenny Rogers</a> for 20 games and fined him US$50,000. Rogers got in trouble when on June 29, 2005, he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman, resulting in one camera falling to the ground. When the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera, Rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way. One of the reporters then resumed filming and Rogers knocked him down again. While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the <a href="2005%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">2005 All-Star Game</a> in <a href="Detroit%20Michigan">Detroit</a>, where fans loudly booed him. On July 22, 2005, Selig heard Rogers' appeal of his suspension. Selig decided to uphold the 20 games, however, an independent arbitrator ruled that Selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to 13 games, but upheld the fine.

In 2005, Selig faced <a href="U.S.%20Congress">Congress</a> on the issue of <a href="Anabolic%20steroids">steroids</a>. After the Congressional hearings in early 2005, and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue, Selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performance-enhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system. This proposal also included the banning of <a href="amphetamines">amphetamines</a>, a first for the major North American sports leagues. The <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">MLB Players Association</a> and MLB reached an agreement in November on the new policy.

Selig's testimony on the subject has been contradictory. In 2005, Selig told reporters, "I never even heard about them [steroids] until 1998 or 1999. I ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and I never heard any comment from them. It wasn't until 1998 or ’99 that I heard the discussion." But a year later, testifying to Congress in 2006, Selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early: "In 1994, before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball, we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the MLBPA. As early as 1998, I began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing substances from the game." During the <a href="1988%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1988 ALCS</a>, <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland</a>'s <a href="Jose%20Canseco">Jose Canseco</a> had been repeatedly taunted by <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston</a> fans with a chant of "ster-oids, ster-oids, ster-oids." Speaking at the 2013 All-Star Game, Selig complained, "People say, ‘Well, you were slow to react.’ We were not slow to react. In fact, I heard that this morning, and it aggravated me all over again."

By early 2006, Selig was forced to deal with the issue of steroid use. On March 30, 2006, as a response to the controversy of the use of performance-enhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by <a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a>, Selig asked former <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="George%20J.%20Mitchell">George J. Mitchell</a> to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseball's recent past. <a href="Joe%20Sheehan">Joe Sheehan</a> from "<a href="Baseball%20Prospectus">Baseball Prospectus</a>" wrote that the commission has been focusing "blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel", and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management.

Much controversy surrounded Selig and his involvement in Bonds' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig and the possibility that he and <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Henry Aaron</a> would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a>, sitting in Padres owner <a href="John%20Moores%20%28baseball%29">John Moores</a>' private suite. When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds' accomplishment, instead choosing to keep his hands in his pockets and have a look of disdain on his face. Bud Selig also did not attend the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>' game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run against the <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a>; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.

On December 13, 2007, former senator Mitchell released his <a href="Mitchell%20Report%20%28baseball%29">report on the use of performance-enhancing substances by MLB players</a>. The report names many current and former players who allegedly used performance-enhancing drugs during their career.

Selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry. "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" columnist <a href="Jay%20Mariotti">Jay Mariotti</a> called Selig the "Steroids Commissioner." Selig has been called to <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> several times to testify on performance-enhancing drug use. Congressman <a href="Cliff%20Stearns">Cliff Stearns</a> said in December 2007 that Selig should resign because of use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure.

Selig's decision to extend the traditional post-season schedule into November in an attempt to increase Nielsen ratings was met with widespread disdain, both inside and outside the baseball community. <a href="Mike%20Scioscia">Mike Scioscia</a>, manager of the American League West Division Champion Los Angeles Angels, dismissed the decision as "Ridiculous. I don’t know. Can I say it any clearer than that? We should have never had a day off last Wednesday. We should never have three days off after the season. You shouldn’t even have two days off after the season."

Related to the contraction controversy in 2001, <a href="Rob%20Dibble">Rob Dibble</a> posted an open letter to Bud Selig, criticizing his actions for benefiting only the Milwaukee Brewers. Dibble cites that the contraction of the Twins would benefit the Brewers, as they would potentially claim the Twins' share of the upper Midwest market.

Selig has made some decisions involving the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> that were unpopular with their supporters. He ordered the roof at <a href="Minute%20Maid%20Park">Minute Maid Park</a> to be opened for games three and four of the <a href="2005%20World%20Series">2005 World Series</a>, pre-empting the authority held by the Astros. The roof was closed for all prior playoff games and similar weather conditions. For <a href="Hurricane%20Ike">Hurricane Ike</a> in 2008, Selig mandated that the Astros play two home games against the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> in his hometown of Milwaukee despite proximity to the visiting Cubs; the home ballparks for the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a> and <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> were both available to host the games. The Astros subsequently were victims of a no-hitter by <a href="Carlos%20Zambrano">Carlos Zambrano</a> and recorded a single hit in the following game. In the midst of the playoff race, this decision and its impact deeply affected the playoff race and seedings with eight teams holding winning records at the moment. The Milwaukee Brewers benefited from these events by qualifying in the playoffs as a Wild Card team, only to lose in the <a href="2008%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">NLDS</a> to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, the eventual World Series winner. In 2011, Selig also demanded that the Astros move to the <a href="American%20League%20West">American League West</a> as a condition of the sale of the franchise to businessman Jim Crane; the team switched leagues in 2013 in return for $70 million discount in the purchase price.

United States bankruptcy judge Kevin Gross rendered a stern warning to Selig in regards to the <a href="2011%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20ownership%20dispute">2011 Los Angeles Dodgers ownership dispute</a>. Treating other teams differently in regards to their media contracts drew accusations that Selig did not act in good faith with respect to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. Selig rejected the television deal that <a href="Frank%20McCourt%20%28executive%29">Frank McCourt</a> negotiated that intended to bring the franchise out of bankruptcy, claiming McCourt violated the Baseball Agreement. In comparison, no action was taken against <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> owner <a href="Fred%20Wilpon">Fred Wilpon</a> despite being in a similar position. Gross stated, "Should the Commissioner falter in proving alleged wrongdoing, the Court may allow LAD (Los Angeles Dodgers) to take further, limited discovery." Some critics have used Selig's handling of the Dodgers to point out a double standard in treatment of MLB owners. More specifically in regards to the Mets, critics point out that with Selig's personal relationship with Wilpon has motivated him to stall any possible removal of Wilpon as that club's principal owner.

Selig also notably failed to resolve a 6-year conflict between the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a> and the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> regarding the Athletics' proposed move to <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose</a>. Selig established a blue-ribbon panel in 2009 to resolve the dispute; however, despite years to find a resolution, the blue-ribbon panel completely failed to make any progress toward resolving the issue, leading San Jose to sue MLB. The lawsuit, which is currently ongoing, questions the league's anti-trust exemption and its ability to enforce particular clubs' geographic territories.

On December 1, 2006, Selig announced that he would be retiring as commissioner of baseball upon the expiration of his contract in 2009. Selig earned $14.5 million from MLB over the timespan October 31, 2005 to October 31, 2006. However, in January 2008, Selig agreed to a three-year contract extension, announcing he planned to retire after the 2012 season.
