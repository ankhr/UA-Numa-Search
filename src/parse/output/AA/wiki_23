And did those feet in ancient time

"And did those feet in ancient time" is a short poem by <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a> from the preface to his epic "<a href="Milton%20a%20Poem">Milton a Poem</a>", one of a collection of writings known as the <a href="Blake%27s%20prophetic%20books">Prophetic Books</a>. The date of 1804 on the title page is probably when the plates were begun, but the poem was printed c. 1808. Today it is best known as the <a href="anthem">anthem</a> "Jerusalem", with music written by Sir <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Hubert Parry</a> in 1916. It is not to be confused with another poem, much longer and larger in scope, but also by Blake, called "<a href="Jerusalem%20The%20Emanation%20of%20the%20Giant%20Albion">Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion</a>".

The poem was inspired by the <a href="apocryphal">apocryphal</a> story that a young Jesus, accompanied by <a href="Joseph%20of%20Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, a tin merchant, travelled to what is now England and visited <a href="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> during his <a href="unknown%20years%20of%20Jesus">unknown years</a>. The poem's theme is linked to the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Revelation">pageRank.Book of Revelation</a> (3:12 and 21:2) describing a <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming</a>, wherein Jesus establishes a <a href="New%20Jerusalem">New Jerusalem</a>. The Christian church in general, and the <a href="Church%20of%20England">English Church</a> in particular, has long used Jerusalem as a metaphor for <a href="Heaven%20%28Christianity%29">Heaven</a>, a place of universal love and peace.

In the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake implies that a visit by Jesus would briefly create heaven in England, in contrast to the "dark Satanic Mills" of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Blake's poem asks four questions rather than asserting the historical truth of Christ's visit. Thus the poem merely implies that there may, or may not, have been a divine visit, when there was briefly heaven in England.

The original text is found in the preface Blake wrote for inclusion with "Milton, a Poem", following the lines beginning "The Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer & Ovid: of Plato & Cicero, which all Men ought to contemn: ..."
Blake's poem
Beneath the poem Blake inscribed a quotation from the Bible:

The phrase "dark Satanic Mills", which entered the English language from this poem, is often interpreted as referring to the early <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> and its destruction of nature and human relationships.

This view has been linked to the fate of the Albion Flour Mills, which was the first major factory in London. Designed by <a href="John%20Rennie%20the%20Elder">John Rennie</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Wyatt">Samuel Wyatt</a>, the factory was built on land purchased by Wyatt in <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>. This rotary steam-powered flour mill by <a href="Matthew%20Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a> and <a href="James%20Watt">James Watt</a> used grinding gears by Rennie to produce 6000 <a href="bushel">bushel</a>s of flour per week.

The factory could have driven independent traditional millers out of business, but it was destroyed in 1791 by fire, perhaps deliberately. London's independent millers celebrated with placards reading, "Success to the mills of <a href="Albion">Albion</a> but no Albion Mills." Opponents referred to the factory as <a href="satan">satan</a>ic, and accused its owners of adulterating flour and using cheap imports at the expense of British producers. A contemporary illustration of the fire shows a <a href="devil">devil</a> squatting on the building. The mills were a short distance from Blake's home.

Blake's phrase resonates with a wider theme in his works, what he envisioned as a physically and spiritually <a href="Political%20repression">repressive</a> ideology based on a quantified reality. Blake saw the <a href="cotton%20mill">cotton mill</a>s and <a href="collieries">collieries</a> of the period as a mechanism for the enslavement of millions, but the concepts underpinning the works had a wider application:

<a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> and other megaliths are featured in "Milton", suggesting they may relate to the oppressive power of priestcraft in general; as <a href="Peter%20Porter%20%28poet%29">Peter Porter</a> observed, many scholars argue that the "[mills] are churches and not the factories of the Industrial Revolution everyone else takes them for".

An alternative theory is that Blake is referring to a mystical concept within his own mythology related to the ancient history of England. Satan's "mills" are referred to repeatedly in the main poem, and are first described in words which suggest neither industrialism nor ancient megaliths, but rather something more abstract: "the starry Mills of Satan/ Are built beneath the earth and waters of the Mundane Shell...To Mortals thy Mills seem everything, and the Harrow of <a href="El%20Shaddai">Shaddai</a> / A scheme of human conduct invisible and incomprehensible".

The line from the poem "Bring me my Chariot of fire!" draws on the story of , where the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> prophet <a href="Elijah%20%28prophet%29">Elijah</a> is taken directly to heaven: "And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." The phrase has become a byword for divine energy, and inspired the title of the 1981 film "<a href="Chariots%20of%20Fire">Chariots of Fire</a>". The plural phrase "chariots of fire" refers to 2 Kings 6:16–18.

Blake lived in London for most of his life, but wrote much of "Milton" while living in the village of <a href="Felpham">Felpham</a> in Sussex. Amanda Gilroy argues that the poem is informed by Blake's "evident pleasure" in the Felpham countryside.

The phrase "green and pleasant land" has become a <a href="collocation">collocation</a> for identifiably English landscape or society. It appears as a headline, title or sub-title in numerous articles and books. Sometimes it refers, whether with appreciation, nostalgia or critical analysis, to idyllic or enigmatic aspects of the English countryside. In other contexts it can suggest the perceived habits and aspirations of rural middle-class life. Sometimes it is used ironically, e.g. in the <a href="Dire%20Straits">Dire Straits</a> song "<a href="Iron%20Hand%20%28song%29">Iron Hand</a>".

Several of Blake's poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: "As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)". He retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, but was often forced to resort to cloaking social idealism and political statements in Protestant mystical <a href="allegory">allegory</a>. Even though the poem was written during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Blake was an outspoken supporter of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, and <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> claimed to be continuing this revolution. The poem expressed his desire for radical change without overt sedition. (In 1803 Blake was charged at <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a> with high treason for having "uttered seditious and treasonable expressions", but was acquitted.) The poem is followed in the preface by a quotation from "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Numbers">Numbers</a>" ch. 11, v. 29: "Would to God that all the Lords people were prophets." <a href="Christopher%20Rowland%20%28theologian%29">Christopher Rowland</a> has argued that this includes

everyone in the task of speaking out about what they saw. Prophecy for Blake, however, was not a prediction of the end of the world, but telling the truth as best a person can about what he or she sees, fortified by insight and an "honest persuasion" that with personal struggle, things could be improved. A human being observes, is indignant and speaks out: it's a basic political maxim which is necessary for any age. Blake wanted to stir people from their intellectual slumbers, and the daily grind of their toil, to see that they were captivated in the grip of a culture which kept them thinking in ways which served the interests of the powerful.

The words of the poem "stress the importance of people taking responsibility for change and building a better society 'in Englands green and pleasant land.'"

The poem, which was little known during the century which followed its writing, was included in the patriotic anthology of verse "The Spirit of Man," edited by the <a href="Poet%20Laureate%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Robert%20Bridges">Robert Bridges</a>, and published in 1916, at a time when morale had begun to decline because of the high number of casualties in World War I and the perception that there was no end in sight.

Under these circumstances, Bridges, finding the poem an appropriate hymn text to "brace the spirit of the nation [to] accept with cheerfulness all the sacrifices necessary," asked Sir <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Hubert Parry</a> to put it to music for a <a href="Fight%20for%20Right%20Movement">Fight for Right campaign</a> meeting in London's <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a>. Bridges asked Parry to supply "suitable, simple music to Blake's stanzas – music that an audience could take up and join in", and added that, if Parry could not do it himself, he might delegate the task to <a href="George%20Butterworth">George Butterworth</a>.

The poem's idealistic <a href="Theme%20%28literature%29">theme</a> or <a href="subtext">subtext</a> accounts for its popularity across much of the political spectrum. It was used as a campaign slogan by the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 general election</a>; <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> said they would build "a new Jerusalem". It has been sung at conferences of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>, at the <a href="Glee%20Club%20%28British%20politics%29">Glee Club</a> of the British <a href="Liberal%20Assembly">Liberal Assembly</a>, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> and by the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a>.

In adapting Blake's poem as a <a href="unison">unison</a> song, Parry deployed a two-<a href="stanza">stanza</a> format, each taking up eight lines of Blake's original poem. He added a four-bar musical introduction to each verse and a <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a>, echoing melodic <a href="motif%20%28music%29">motif</a>s of the song. The word "those" was substituted for "these" before "dark satanic mills".

The piece was to be conducted by Parry's former student <a href="Walford%20Davies">Walford Davies</a>, but Parry was initially reluctant to set the words, as he had doubts about the ultra-patriotism of Fight for Right, but not wanting to disappoint either Robert Bridges or Davies he agreed, writing it on 10 March 1916, and handing the manuscript to Davies with the comment, "Here's a tune for you, old chap. Do what you like with it." Davies later recalled,

Davies arranged for the vocal score to be published by <a href="Curwen%20Press">Curwen</a> in time for the concert at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> on 28 March and began rehearsing it. It was a success and was taken up generally.

But Parry began to have misgivings again about Fight for Right and eventually wrote to Sir <a href="Francis%20Younghusband">Francis Younghusband</a> withdrawing his support entirely in May 1917. There was even concern that the composer might withdraw the song, but the situation was saved by <a href="Millicent%20Garrett%20Fawcett">Millicent Fawcett</a> of the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Women%27s%20Suffrage%20Societies">National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies</a> (NUWSS). The song had been taken up by the Suffragettes in 1917 and Fawcett asked Parry if it might be used at a Suffrage Demonstration Concert on 13 March 1918. Parry was delighted and orchestrated the piece for the concert (it had originally been for voices and organ). After the concert, Fawcett asked the composer if it might become the Women Voters' Hymn. Parry wrote back,

Accordingly, he assigned the copyright to the NUWSS. When that organisation was wound up in 1928, Parry's executors reassigned the copyright to the <a href="Women%27s%20Institutes">Women's Institutes</a>, where it remained until it entered the public domain in 1968.

The song was first called "And Did Those Feet in Ancient Time" and the early published scores have this title. The change to "Jerusalem" seems to have been made about the time of the 1918 Suffrage Demonstration Concert, perhaps when the orchestral score was published (Parry's manuscript of the orchestral score has the old title crossed out and "Jerusalem" inserted in a different hand). However, Parry always referred to it by its first title. He had originally intended the first verse to be sung by a solo female voice (this is marked in the score), but this is rare in contemporary performances. Sir <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a> re-scored the work for very large orchestra in 1922 for use at the <a href="Leeds%20Festival%20%28classical%20music%29">Leeds Festival</a>. Elgar's orchestration has overshadowed Parry's own, primarily because it is the version usually used now for the <a href="Last%20Night%20of%20the%20Proms">Last Night of the Proms</a> (though Sir <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a>, who introduced it to that event in the 1950s, always used Parry's version).

During his folk-singing period, in 1965 <a href="Don%20Partridge">Don Partridge</a> recorded a solo version of the hymn with acoustic guitar accompaniment.

Although Parry composed the music as a unison song, many churches have adopted "Jerusalem"; English cathedrals, churches and chapels frequently use it as an office or recessional hymn on <a href="St%20George%27s%20Day">St George's Day</a>.

However, some clergy in the Church of England, according to the <a href="BBC%20TV">BBC TV</a> programme "Jerusalem: An Anthem for England", have said that the song is not technically a <a href="hymn">hymn</a> as it is not a prayer to God (which they claim hymns always are, though many counter-examples appear in any hymnal). Consequently, it is not sung in some churches in England. Despite this, it was sung as a hymn during the <a href="wedding%20of%20Prince%20William%20and%20Catherine%20Middleton">wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

Many schools use the song, especially <a href="Public%20school%20%28UK%29">public school</a>s in Great Britain (it was used as the title music for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s 1979 series 'Public School' at <a href="Radley%20College">Radley College</a>), and several private schools in Australia, New Zealand, New England and Canada. "Jerusalem" was chosen as the opening hymn for the <a href="London%20Olympics%202012">London Olympics 2012</a>, although "<a href="God%20Save%20the%20Queen">God Save the Queen</a>" was the anthem sung during the raising of the flag in salute to the Queen. Some attempts have also been made to increase its use elsewhere with other words, examples include the State Funeral of President Ronald Reagan in Washington National Cathedral on 11 June 2004 and the State Memorial Service for Australian Prime Minister <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> AC QC on 5 November 2014.

Upon hearing the orchestral version for the first time, <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> said that he preferred "Jerusalem" over the British national anthem "<a href="God%20Save%20the%20King">God Save the King</a>". "Jerusalem" is considered to be England's most popular patriotic song; "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said it was "fast becoming an alternative national anthem," and there have even been calls to give it official status. England has no official anthem and uses the British national anthem "<a href="God%20Save%20the%20Queen">God Save the Queen</a>", also unofficial, for some national occasions, such as before English international football matches. However, some sports, including <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>, use "Jerusalem" as the English anthem. "Jerusalem" is the official hymn of the <a href="England%20and%20Wales%20Cricket%20Board">England and Wales Cricket Board</a>, although "God Save the Queen" was the anthem sung before England's games in <a href="2010%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20">2010 ICC World Twenty20</a> and <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Ashes%20series">2010–11 Ashes series</a>. Questions in <a href="British%20Parliament">Parliament</a> have not clarified the situation, as answers from the relevant minister say that since there is no official national anthem, each sport must make its own decision.

As Parliament has not clarified the situation, Team England, the English Commonwealth team, held a public poll in 2010 to decide which anthem should be played at medal ceremonies to celebrate an English win at the Commonwealth Games. "Jerusalem" was selected by 52% of voters over "<a href="Land%20of%20Hope%20and%20Glory">Land of Hope and Glory</a>" (used since 1930) and "God Save the Queen". The lyrics' explicit focus on England, without mention of other parts of the United Kingdom, renders the song unfitting as a national anthem for the entire UK.

In 2005 <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> produced "Jerusalem: An Anthem For England" highlighting the usages of the song/poem and a case was made for its adoption as the <a href="national%20anthem%20of%20England">national anthem of England</a>. Varied contributions come from <a href="Howard%20Goodall">Howard Goodall</a>, <a href="Billy%20Bragg">Billy Bragg</a>, <a href="Gary%20Bushell">Gary Bushell</a>, <a href="Lord%20Hattersley">Lord Hattersley</a>, <a href="Ann%20Widdecombe">Ann Widdecombe</a> and <a href="David%20Mellor">David Mellor</a>, <a href="Militarism">war proponents</a>, <a href="pacifism">war opponents</a>, <a href="suffragettes">suffragettes</a>, <a href="trade%20unionists">trade unionists</a>, <a href="Independent%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public schoolboys</a>, the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a>, the <a href="The%20Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>, <a href="Football%20Supporters%27%20Federation">football supporters</a>, the <a href="British%20National%20Party">British National Party</a>, the <a href="Women%27s%20Institute%23.22Jerusalem.22">Women's Institute</a>, <a href="London%20Gay%20Men%27s%20Chorus">a gay choir</a>, <a href="London%20Community%20Gospel%20Choir">a gospel choir</a>, <a href="Fat%20Les">Fat Les</a> and <a href="Naturists%23United%20Kingdom">naturists</a>.

In <a href="1973">1973</a>, for their "<a href="Brain%20Salad%20Surgery">Brain Salad Surgery</a>" album, British progressive rock band <a href="Emerson%2C%20Lake%20%26amp%3B%20Palmer">Emerson, Lake & Palmer</a> recorded a version of the song titled "Jerusalem". The track features the debut of the prototype <a href="Moog%20Apollo">Moog Apollo</a>, the first-ever <a href="polyphonic%20synthesizer">polyphonic music synthesizer</a>. The subject matter of this song indicates a nod to ELP's unabashed Englishness and simultaneously lent an air of timeless tradition and ceremony to the music. Though a single was released of the song, it failed to chart, and it was banned from radio play in England. The BBC would not accept it as a serious piece of music, the band claims. Drummer <a href="Carl%20Palmer">Carl Palmer</a> later expressed disappointment over this decision.
A live rendition was recorded during their subsequent "Someone Get Me a Ladder" tour, and was included on "<a href="Welcome%20Back%2C%20My%20Friends%2C%20to%20the%20Show%20That%20Never%20Ends%20%7E%20Ladies%20and%20Gentlemen">Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ~ Ladies and Gentlemen... Emerson, Lake & Palmer!</a>"

The popularity of Parry's setting has resulted in many hundreds of recordings being made, too numerous to list, of both traditional choral performances and new interpretations by popular music artists. Consequently, only its most notable performances are listed below.


"Bring me my Chariot of fire" inspired the title of the film "<a href="Chariots%20of%20Fire">Chariots of Fire</a>". A church congregation sings "Jerusalem" at the close of the film and a performance appears on the "<a href="Chariots%20of%20Fire%20%28album%29">Chariots of Fire soundtrack</a>" performed by the <a href="Ambrosian%20Singers">Ambrosian Singers</a> overlaid partly by a composition by <a href="Vangelis">Vangelis</a>. One unexpected touch is that "Jerusalem" is sung in four-part harmony, as if it were truly a hymn. This is not authentic: Parry's composition was a unison song (that is, all voices sing the tune – perhaps one of the things that make it so "singable" by massed crowds) and he never provided any harmonisation other than the accompaniment for organ (or orchestra). Neither does it appear in any standard hymn book in a guise other than Parry's own, so it may have been harmonised specially for the film. The film's working title was "Running" until <a href="Colin%20Welland">Colin Welland</a> saw a television programme, "<a href="Songs%20of%20Praise">Songs of Praise</a>", featuring the hymn and decided to change the title.

The hymn has featured in many other films and television programmes including "<a href="Four%20Weddings%20and%20a%20Funeral">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>", "<a href="How%20to%20Get%20Ahead%20in%20Advertising">How to Get Ahead in Advertising</a>", "<a href="The%20Loneliness%20of%20the%20Long%20Distance%20Runner%20%28film%29">The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</a>", "<a href="Calendar%20Girls">Calendar Girls</a>", "", "<a href="Goodnight%20Mister%20Tom%20%281998%20film%29">Goodnight Mr. Tom</a>", "<a href="Women%20in%20Love">Women in Love</a>", "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Fell%20to%20Earth">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>", "<a href="Shameless%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Shameless</a>", <a href="Building%20Jerusalem">Building Jerusalem</a> and "<a href="Monty%20Python%27s%20Flying%20Circus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a>". An extract was heard in the 2013 "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" episode "<a href="The%20Crimson%20Horror">The Crimson Horror</a>" although that story was set in 1893, i.e., before Parry's arrangement. A punk version is heard in <a href="Derek%20Jarman">Derek Jarman</a>'s 1977 film "<a href="Jubilee%20%28film%29">Jubilee</a>". In an episode of "<a href="Peep%20Show%20%28TV%20series%29">Peep Show</a>", Jez (<a href="Robert%20Webb">Robert Webb</a>) records a track titled "This Is Outrageous" which uses the first and a version of the second line in a verse.

In the theatre it appears in "<a href="Jerusalem%20%28play%29">Jerusalem</a>", "<a href="Calendar%20Girls">Calendar Girls</a>" and in "<a href="Time%20and%20the%20Conways">Time and the Conways</a>". Eddie Izzard discusses the hymn in his 2000 "<a href="Circle%20%28Eddie%20Izzard%29">Circle</a>" stand-up tour. Punk band <a href="Bad%20Religion">Bad Religion</a> have borrowed the opening line of Blake's poem in their "God Song", from the 1990 album "<a href="Against%20the%20Grain%20%28Bad%20Religion%20album%29">Against the Grain</a>".

Blake's lyrics have also been set to music by other composers without reference to Parry's melody. <a href="Tim%20Blake">Tim Blake</a> (synthesiser player of <a href="Gong%20%28band%29">Gong</a>) produced a solo album in 1978 called "<a href="Blake%27s%20New%20Jerusalem">Blake's New Jerusalem</a>", including a 20-minute track with lyrics from Blake's poem. <a href="Mark%20E.%20Smith">Mark E. Smith</a> of <a href="The%20Fall%20%28band%29">The Fall</a> interpolated the verses with a deadpan rant against his native land, set to a bludgeoningly repetitive dirge, in the track "Dog is life/Jerusalem" from the 1988 ballet score "<a href="I%20Am%20Kurious%20Oranj">I Am Kurious Oranj</a>". The words, with some variations, are used in the track "Jerusalem" on <a href="Bruce%20Dickinson">Bruce Dickinson</a>'s album "<a href="The%20Chemical%20Wedding%20%28Bruce%20Dickinson%20album%29">The Chemical Wedding</a>", which also includes lines from book two of "Milton". <a href="Finn%20Coren">Finn Coren</a> also created a different musical setting for the poem on his album "". <a href="The%20Verve">The Verve</a> also referenced the song in their 2008 song "<a href="Love%20Is%20Noise">Love Is Noise</a>" from the album <a href="Forth%20%28album%29">Forth.</a> Lead singer and writer <a href="Richard%20Ashcroft">Richard Ashcroft</a> said that Blake had influenced the lyric "'Will those feet in modern times"' from the song. This is not the first Verve song influenced by Blake, as their previous single "<a href="History%20%28The%20Verve%20song%29">History</a>" also featured the lyrics "I wandered lonely streets/Behind where the old Thames does flow/And in every face I meet", referencing Blake's "<a href="London%20%28William%20Blake%20poem%29">London</a>".

Inspired by the <a href="Ingmar%20Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a> film "<a href="Smiles%20of%20a%20Summer%20Night">Smiles of a Summer Night</a>", it involves the romantic lives of several couples. Its title is a literal English translation of the German name for <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>'s <a href="Eine%20kleine%20Nachtmusik">Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major</a>, "Eine kleine Nachtmusik". The musical includes the popular song "<a href="Send%20in%20the%20Clowns">Send in the Clowns</a>".

Since its original 1973 <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> production, the musical has enjoyed professional productions in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>, by opera companies, in a 2009 Broadway revival, and elsewhere, and it is a popular choice for regional groups. It was <a href="A%20Little%20Night%20Music%20%28film%29">adapted for film in 1977</a>, with <a href="Harold%20Prince">Harold Prince</a> directing and <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, <a href="Len%20Cariou">Len Cariou</a>, <a href="Lesley-Anne%20Down">Lesley-Anne Down</a> and <a href="Diana%20Rigg">Diana Rigg</a> starring.

The setting is Sweden, around the year 1900. One by one, the Quintet – five singers who comment like a <a href="Greek%20chorus">Greek chorus</a> throughout the show – enter, tuning up. Gradually, their vocalizing becomes an overture blending fragments of "Remember", "Soon" and "The Glamorous Life", leading into the first "Night Waltz". The other characters enter <a href="waltz">waltz</a>ing, each uncomfortable with their particular partner. After they drift back off, the aging and severe Madame Armfeldt and her solemn granddaughter, Fredrika, enter. Madame Armfeldt tells the child that the summer night "smiles" three times: first on the young, second on fools, and third on the old. Fredrika vows to watch the smiles occur. Middle-aged Fredrik Egerman is a successful lawyer. He has recently married an 18-year-old <a href="trophy%20wife">trophy wife</a>, Anne, a vain girl who is in love with Fredrik, but too immature to grasp the concept of marriage. The two have been married for eleven months, but Anne still protects her <a href="virginity">virginity</a>. Fredrik laments his inability to <a href="sexual%20intercourse">make love</a> to his wife ("Now"). Meanwhile, his son Henrik, a year older than his stepmother, is feeling extremely frustrated. He is a <a href="seminary">seminary</a> student and everyone is always teasing him, never taking him seriously or letting him talk ("Later"). Anne is intrigued by him, but fails to understand his real meaning. Anne promises her husband that shortly she will consent to have sex ("Soon"). Anne's <a href="maidservant">maidservant</a> Petra, an experienced and forthright girl, slightly older than the teen herself, offers her worldly but crass advice.

Desiree Armfeldt is a prominent and glamorous actress who is now reduced to touring in small towns. Madame Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, has taken over the care of Desiree's daughter Fredrika. Fredrika misses her mother, but Desiree continually delays going to see her, preferring, somewhat ironically, "The Glamorous Life". She is performing near Fredrik's home, and he brings Anne to see the play. While there, Desiree notices Fredrik; the two had been lovers years earlier. Anne, suspicious and annoyed because of Desiree's amorous glances, demands that Fredrik take her home immediately. Meanwhile, Petra has been trying to seduce Henrik.

That night, as Fredrik remembers his past with Desiree, he sneaks out to see her; the two share a happy but strained reunion, as they "Remember". They reflect on their new lives, and Fredrik tries to explain how much he loves Anne ("You Must Meet My Wife"). Desiree responds sarcastically, boasting of her own adultery, as she has been seeing the married <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. Upon learning that Fredrik has gone for eleven months without sex, she agrees to accommodate him as a favor for an old friend.

Madame Armfeldt offers advice to young Fredrika. The elderly woman reflects poignantly on her own checkered past, and wonders what happened to her refined "Liaisons". Back in Desiree's apartment, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm proclaims his unannounced arrival in his typical booming voice. Fredrik and Desiree fool the gullible Count into believing that their disheveled appearance was entirely innocent, but he is still suspicious. He instantly dislikes Fredrik and returns to his wife, Countess Charlotte. Charlotte is quite aware of her husband's infidelity, but Carl-Magnus is too absorbed in his suspicions of Desiree to talk to her ("In Praise of Women"). When she persuades him to blurt out the whole story, a twist is revealed—Charlotte's little sister is a schoolfriend of Anne's.

Charlotte visits Anne, who is talking with Petra. Charlotte describes Fredrik's meeting with Desiree; Anne reacts with shock and horror. The older woman explains to Anne that such is the lot of a wife, and that marriage brings pain ("Every Day A Little Death"). Meanwhile, Desiree asks Madame Armfeldt to host a party for Fredrik, Anne and Henrik. Though reluctant, Madame Armfeldt agrees. She sends out a personal invitation; its receipt sends the women into a frenzy, imagining "A Weekend in the Country". Anne does not want to accept the invitation, but Charlotte convinces her to do so to heighten the contrast between the older woman and the young teenager. Meanwhile, the Count has plans of his own—as a birthday present to his wife, the pair will attend the party uninvited. Carl-Magnus plans to challenge Fredrik to a <a href="duel">duel</a>, while Charlotte hopes to seduce the lawyer to make her husband jealous and end his philandering. The day of the party dawns.

Armfeldt's country estate is bathed in the golden glow of perpetual summer sunset at this high latitude ("Night Waltz One and Two"). Everyone arrives, each carrying their own amorous purposes and desires—even Petra, who catches the eye of Armfeldt's fetching <a href="manservant">manservant</a>, Frid. The women begin to act against each other. Fredrik is astonished to learn the name of Desiree's daughter. Henrik meets Fredrika, and confesses his deep love for Anne to her. Meanwhile, in the garden, Fredrik and Carl-Magnus reflect on how difficult it is to be annoyed with Desiree, agreeing "It Would Have Been Wonderful" had she not been quite so wonderful. Dinner is served, and the characters' "Perpetual Anticipation" enlivens that meal.

At dinner, Charlotte attempts to flirt with Fredrik, while Anne and Desiree trade insults. Soon, everyone is shouting and scolding everyone else, except for Henrik, who finally stands up for himself. He shrieks at them for being completely <a href="amorality">amoral</a>, and flees the scene. Stunned, everyone reflects on the situation and wanders away. Fredrika tells Anne of Henrik's secret love, and the two dash off searching for him. Meanwhile, Desiree meets Fredrik and asks if he still wants to be "rescued" from his life. Fredrik answers honestly that he loves Desiree, but only as a dream. Hurt and bitter, Desiree can only reflect on the nature of her life ("Send in the Clowns"). Anne finds Henrik, who is attempting to commit suicide. The clumsy boy cannot complete the task, and Anne tells him that she has feelings for him, too. The pair begins to kiss, which leads to Anne's first sexual encounter. Meanwhile, not far away, Frid sleeps in Petra's lap. The maid thinks of the joy and freedom that she longs for before becoming trapped in marriage ("The Miller's Son"). Henrik and Anne, happy together, run away to start their new life. However, Carl-Magnus is enraged by this and attempts to shoot the lovers, but Desiree and Charlotte prevent him, while lamenting both the pains of marriage and the strange behavior of married people ("The World Won't End/Every Day a Little Death (reprise)"). With Carl-Magnus calmed, Charlotte confesses her plan to Fredrik, and the two commiserate on a bench. Carl-Magnus, preparing to romance Desiree, sees this and challenges Fredrik to <a href="Russian%20Roulette">Russian Roulette</a>, at which a nervous Fredrik misfires and simply grazes his own ear. Victorious, Carl-Magnus begins to romance Charlotte, granting her wish at last.

After the Count and Countess leave, Fredrika and Madame Armfeldt discuss the chaos of the recent turns-of-events. The elderly woman then asks Fredrika a surprising question: "What is it all for?" Fredrika thinks about this, and decides that it "must be worth it". Madame Armfeldt is surprised, ruefully noting that she rejected love for material wealth at Fredrika's age. She praises her granddaughter and remembers true love's fleeting nature.

Fredrik finally confesses his love for Desiree, acknowledges that Fredrika is his daughter, and the two promise to start a new life together ("Finale"). Armfeldt sits alone with Fredrika. Fredrika tells her grandmother that she has watched carefully, but still has not seen the night smile. Armfeldt laughs and points out that the night has indeed smiled twice: first on Henrik and Anne, the young, and second on Desiree and Fredrik, the fools. As the two wait for the "third smile... on the old", it happens: Madame Armfeldt closes her eyes, and dies peacefully with Fredrika beside her.

<a href="Opera%20Australia">Opera Australia</a> presented the piece in Melbourne in May 2009, starring <a href="Sigrid%20Thornton">Sigrid Thornton</a> as Desiree Armfeldt and Nacye Hayes as Madame Armfeldt. The production returned in 2010 at the Sydney Opera House with <a href="Anthony%20Warlow">Anthony Warlow</a> taking on the role of Fredrik Egerman.

Designer <a href="Isaac%20Mizrahi">Isaac Mizrahi</a> directed and designed the production, with a cast that starred <a href="Amy%20Irving">Amy Irving</a>, <a href="Si%C3%A2n%20Phillips">Siân Phillips</a> and <a href="Ron%20Raines">Ron Raines</a>.

The piece has also become a popular choice for amateur musical theatre and light opera companies. In 2017, the musical was performed by students at The <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a>.

A film version of "<a href="A%20Little%20Night%20Music%20%281977%20film%29">A Little Night Music</a>" was released in 1977, starring <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, <a href="Lesley-Anne%20Down">Lesley-Anne Down</a> and <a href="Diana%20Rigg">Diana Rigg</a>, with <a href="Len%20Cariou">Len Cariou</a>, <a href="Hermione%20Gingold">Hermione Gingold</a> and <a href="Laurence%20Guittard">Laurence Guittard</a> reprising their Broadway roles. The setting for the film was moved from Sweden to Austria. <a href="Stephen%20Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a> wrote lyrics for the "Night Waltz" theme ("Love Takes Time") and wrote an entirely new version of "The Glamorous Life", which has been incorporated into several subsequent productions of the stage musical. However, other songs, including "In Praise of Women", "The Miller's Son" and "Liaisons", were cut and remain heard only as background orchestrations. The film marked Broadway director <a href="Hal%20Prince">Hal Prince</a>'s second time as a motion picture director. Critical reaction to the film was mostly negative, with much being made of Taylor's wildly fluctuating weight from scene to scene. Some critics talked more positively of the film, with "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" calling it "an elegant looking, period romantic charade". There was praise for Diana Rigg's performance, and orchestrator <a href="Jonathan%20Tunick">Jonathan Tunick</a> received an <a href="Academy%20Award">Oscar</a> for his work on the score. A soundtrack recording was released on LP, and a DVD release was issued in June 2007.

The score for "A Little Night Music" has elements not often found in musical theater, presenting challenges for performers, with complex meters, pitch changes, polyphony, and high notes for both males and females. The difficulty is heightened when songs merge, as in "Now"/"Later"/"Soon", because all three have to be performed in the same key, limiting the ability to pick a comfortable key for each singer. Critic <a href="Rex%20Reed">Rex Reed</a> noted that "The score of 'Night Music' ...contains patter songs, contrapuntal duets and trios, a quartet, and even a dramatic double quintet to puzzle through. All this has been gorgeously orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick; there is no rhythm section, only strings and woodwinds to carry the melodies and harmonies aloft."

Sondheim's engagement with threes extends to his lyrics. He organizes trios with the singers separated, while his duets are sung together, about a third person.

The work is performed as an <a href="operetta">operetta</a> in many professional opera companies. For example, it was added to the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Opera">New York City Opera</a> Company repertoire in 1990.

Virtually all of the music in the show is written in <a href="waltz%20time">waltz time</a> (3/4). Some parts adopt <a href="Compound%20meter%20%28music%29">compound meter</a>, with a <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a> such as 12/8. Passages in "Overture", "Glamorous Life", "Liaisons", and "The Miller's Son" are in <a href="duple%20meter">duple meter</a>.

At several points, Sondheim has multiple performers each sing a different song simultaneously. This use of <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> maintains coherence even as it extends the notion of a <a href="round%20%28music%29">round</a>, familiar in songs such as the traditional "<a href="Fr%C3%A8re%20Jacques">Frère Jacques</a>", into something more complex. Sondheim said: "As for the three songs... going together well, I might as well confess. In those days I was just getting into contrapuntal and choral writing...and I wanted to develop my technique by writing a trio. What I didn't want to do is the <a href="quodlibet">quodlibet</a> method...wouldn't it be nice to have three songs you don't think are going to go together, and they do go together... The trick was the little <a href="vamp%20%28music%29">vamp</a> on "Soon" which has five-and six-note chords." Steve Swayne comments that the "contrapuntal episodes in the extended ensembles... stand as testament to his interest in Counterpoint."

The show's best-known and Sondheim's biggest hit song was almost an afterthought, written several days before the start of out-of-town tryouts. Sondheim initially conceived Desiree as a role for a more-or-less non-singing actress. When he discovered that the original Desiree, <a href="Glynis%20Johns">Glynis Johns</a>, was able to sing (she had a "small, silvery voice") but could not "sustain a phrase", he devised the song "<a href="Send%20in%20the%20Clowns">Send in the Clowns</a>" for her in a way that would work around her vocal weakness, e.g., by ending lines with consonants that made for a short cut-off. "It is written in short phrases in order to be acted rather than sung...tailor-made for Glynis Johns, who lacks the vocal power to sustain long phrases."

In analyzing the text of the song, <a href="Max%20Cryer">Max Cryer</a> wrote that it "is not intended to be sung by the young in love, but by a mature performer who has seen it all before. The song remains an anthem to regret for unwise decisions in the past and recognition that there's no need to send in the clowns-they're already here."

Graham Wolfe has argued, "What Desirée is referring to in the famous song is a conventional device to cover over a moment when something has gone wrong on stage. Midway through the second Act she has deviated from her usual script by suggesting to Fredrik the possibility of being together seriously and permanently, and, having been rejected, she falters "as" a show-person, finds herself bereft of the capacity to improvise and wittily cover. If Desirée could perform at this moment – revert to the innuendos, one-liners and blithe self-referential humour that constitutes her normal character – all would be well. She cannot, and what follows is an exemplary manifestation of Sondheim’s musico-dramatic complexity, his inclination to write music that performs drama. That is, what needs to be covered over (by the clowns sung about in the song) is the very intensity, ragged emotion and utter vulnerability that comes forward through the music and singing itself, a display protracted to six minutes, wrought with exposed silences, a shocked Fredrik sitting so uncomfortably before Desirée while something much too real emerges in a realm where he – and his audience – felt assured of performance."

The elegant, <a href="harmony">harmonically</a>-advanced music in this musical pays indirect homage to the compositions of <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>, especially his "<a href="Valses%20nobles%20et%20sentimentales%20%28Ravel%29">Valses nobles et sentimentales</a>" (whose opening chord is borrowed for the opening chord of the song "Liaisons"); part of this effect stems from the style of orchestration that <a href="Jonathan%20Tunick">Jonathan Tunick</a> used.

In addition to the original Broadway and London cast recordings, and the motion picture soundtrack (no longer available), there are recordings of the 1990 studio cast, the 1995 <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a> revival (starring <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a>), and the 2001 Barcelona cast recording sung in <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a>. In 1997 an all-jazz version of the score was recorded by <a href="Terry%20Trotter">Terry Trotter</a>.

The 2009 Broadway revival with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Angela Lansbury recorded a cast album on January 4, 2010, which was released on April 6.

In his review of the original 1973 Broadway production, <a href="Clive%20Barnes">Clive Barnes</a> in the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" called the musical "heady, civilized, sophisticated and enchanting." He noted that "the real triumph belongs to Stephen Sondheim...the music is a celebration of 3/4 time, an orgy of plaintively memorable waltzes, all talking of past loves and lost worlds...There is a peasant touch here." He commented that the lyrics are "breathtaking".

In its review of the 1989 London revival, the reviewer for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that the "production also strikes me as infinitely superior to Harold Prince's 1975 version at the Adelphi. Mr Judge's great innovation is to transform the Liebeslieder Singers from the evening-dressed, after-dinner line-up into 18th century ghosts weaving in and out of the action...But Mr Judge's other great realisation is that, in Sondheim, the lyrics are not an adornment to a song but their very essence: understand them and the show will flow. Thus Dorothy Tutin as Desiree, the touring thesp eventually reunited with her quondam lover, is not the melting romantic of previous productions but a working mother with the sharpness of a hat-pin."

The "<a href="The%20Independent">Independent</a>" review of the 1995 National Theatre revival praised the production, writing "For three hours of gloriously barbed bliss and bewitchment, Sean Mathias's production establishes the show as a minor miracle of astringent worldly wisdom and one that is haunted by less earthy intimations." The review went on to state that "The heart of the production, in both senses, is Judi Dench's superb Desiree Armfeldt...Her husky-voiced rendering of "Send in the Clowns" is the most moving I've ever heard."

In reviewing the 2008 Menier Chocolate Factory production, the "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">Telegraph</a>" reviewer wrote that "Sondheim's lyrics are often superbly witty, his music here, mostly in haunting waltz-time, far more accessible than is sometimes the case. The score positively throbs with love, regret and desire." But of the specific production, the reviewer went on to note: "But Nunn's production, on one of those hermetic sets largely consisting of doors and tarnished mirrors that have become such a cliché in recent years, never penetrates the work's subtly erotic heart. And as is often the case with this director's work, the pace is so slow and the mood so reverent, that initial enchantment gives way to bored fidgeting."

In his "New York Times" review of the 2009 Broadway production, <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> noted that "the expression that hovers over Trevor Nunn's revival...feels dangerously close to a smirk...It is a smirk shrouded in shadows. An elegiac darkness infuses this production." The production is "sparing on furniture and heavy on shadows", with "a scaled-down orchestra at lugubriously slowed-down tempos..." He goes on to write that "this somber, less-is-more approach could be effective were the ensemble plugged into the same rueful sensibility. But there is only one moment in this production when all its elements cohere perfectly. That moment, halfway through the first act, belongs to Ms. Lansbury, who has hitherto been perfectly entertaining, playing Madame Armfeldt with the overripe aristocratic condescension of a Lady Bracknell. Then comes her one solo, "Liaisons", in which her character thinks back on the art of love as a profession in a gilded age, when sex 'was but a pleasurable means to a measurable end.' Her face, with its glamour-gorgon makeup, softens, as Madame Armfeldt seems to melt into memory itself, and the wan stage light briefly appears to borrow radiance from her. It's a lovely example of the past reaching out to the present..."

Steven Suskin, reviewing the new Broadway cast for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", wrote "What a difference a diva makes. Bernadette Peters steps into the six-month-old revival of 'A Little Night Music' with a transfixing performance, playing it as if she realizes her character's onstage billing -- "the one and only Desiree Armfeldt"—is cliched hyperbole. By figuratively rolling her eyes at the hype, Peters gives us a rich, warm and comedically human Desiree, which reaches full impact when she pierces the facade with a nakedly honest, tears-on-cheek 'Send in the Clowns.'"

Dual wield

Dual wielding is using two <a href="weapon">weapon</a>s, one in each hand, during <a href="combat">combat</a>. It is not a common combat practice. Although historical records of dual wielding in <a href="war">war</a> are limited, there are numerous <a href="Martial%20arts%23Variation%20and%20scope">weapon-based martial arts</a> that involve the use of a pair of weapons. The use of a <a href="companion%20weapon">companion weapon</a> is sometimes employed in <a href="European%20martial%20arts">European martial arts</a> and fencing, such as a parrying dagger. <a href="Miyamoto%20Musashi">Miyamoto Musashi</a>, a <a href="Japan">Japanese</a> swordsman and "<a href="ronin">ronin</a>", was said to have conceived of the idea of a particular style of swordsmanship involving the use of two swords.

In terms of <a href="firearm">firearm</a>s and <a href="handgun">handgun</a>s, this style has been popularized by <a href="television">television</a>, but is generally denounced by firearm enthusiasts due to its impracticality. Though using two hand guns at a time confers an advantage by allowing more ready ammunition, it is rarely done due to other aspects of weapons handling. Dual wielding is present in many films and video games, which have the freedom of ignoring the impracticality of the style. The term itself is often invoked in the context of games.

Dual wielding has not been used or mentioned much in military history, though it appears in <a href="Martial%20arts%23Variation%20and%20scope">weapon based martial arts</a> and <a href="fencing">fencing</a> practices. This style of combat requires special training, since an untrained user is unable to swing both weapons at the same time. To perform an attack by the defensive weapon after the first, the user needs to perform a separate and distinct action. 

The use of weapon combinations in each hand has been mentioned for close combat in western Europe during the <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a>, <a href="Medieval">Medieval</a>, and <a href="Renaissance%20era">Renaissance era</a>. The use of a <a href="parrying%20dagger">parrying dagger</a> such as a main gauche along with a <a href="rapier">rapier</a> is common in historical European martial arts. 
Traditional schools of <a href="Japanese%20martial%20arts">Japanese martial arts</a> include dual wield techniques, particularly a style conceived by <a href="Miyamoto%20Musashi">Miyamoto Musashi</a> involving the <a href="katana">katana</a> and <a href="wakizashi">wakizashi</a>, two-sword <a href="kenjutsu">kenjutsu</a> techniques he called "<a href="Niten%20Ichi-ry%C5%AB">Niten Ichi-ryū</a>". <a href="Eskrima">Eskrima</a>, the traditional martial arts of the Philippines teaches "Doble Baston" techniques involving the basic use of a pair of <a href="rattan%20sticks">rattan sticks</a> and also Espada y daga or Sword/Stick and Dagger. <a href="Okinawan%20martial%20arts">Okinawan martial arts</a> have a method that uses a pair of <a href="Sai%20%28weapon%29">"sai"</a>. <a href="Chinese%20martial%20arts">Chinese martial arts</a> involve the use of a pair of <a href="Butterfly%20swords">Butterfly swords</a> and <a href="Hook%20sword">Hook sword</a>s. <a href="Gatka">Gatka</a>, a weapon-based martial art from the <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab region</a>, is known to use two sticks at a time. The Thailand weapon-based martial art <a href="Krabi%20Krabong">Krabi Krabong</a> involves the use of a separate <a href="Krabi%20%28sword%29">"Krabi"</a> in each hand. <a href="Kalaripayattu">Kalaripayattu</a> teaches advanced students to use either two sticks (of various sizes) or two daggers or two swords, simultaneously. 

It should be noted that all the above-mentioned examples, involve either one long and one short weapon, or two short weapons. An example of a dual wield of two sabres is the Ukrainian cossack dance <a href="hopak">hopak</a>.

In modern terms, the use of a gun in each hand is most associated with the <a href="American%20Old%20West">American Old West</a>, mainly due to media portrayals. Some people of the era preferred to carry two guns, but not to use them at the same time, as shown in movies, but rather to use the second one, instead of having to take the time to reload the first. The second handgun was rarely used in the manner portrayed especially in movies and video games. <a href="Wild%20Bill%20Hickok">Wild Bill Hickok</a>, a folk hero of that time, was said to not use a second gun in his off hand. Dual wielding two handguns was popularized by the passion of gun enthusiasts and television.

In "<a href="MythBusters">MythBusters</a>", there is an episode in which they compared many firing stances, including having a gun in each hand and found that, compared to the two-handed single gun stance as a benchmark, only the one handed shoulder level stance with a single gun was comparable in terms of accuracy and speed. The ability to look down the sights of the gun was given as the main reason for this. In an episode the following year, they compared holding two guns and firing simultaneously—rather than alternating left and right shots— with holding one gun in the two-handed stance, and found that the results were in favor of using two guns and firing simultaneously.

Ariel Sharon

Ariel Sharon (; , ', also known by his <a href="diminutive">diminutive</a> Arik, , born Ariel Scheinermann, ‎; February 26, 1928 – January 11, 2014) was an Israeli general and politician who served as the 11th <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Israel">Prime Minister of Israel</a> from March 2001 until April 2006. Sharon was incapacitated by a stroke in January 2006.

Sharon was a commander in the <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israeli Army</a> from its creation in 1948. As a soldier and then an officer, he participated prominently in the <a href="1948%20Palestine%20war">1948 War of Independence</a>, becoming a platoon commander in the <a href="Alexandroni%20Brigade">Alexandroni Brigade</a> and taking part in many battles, including <a href="Battles%20of%20Latrun%23Operation%20Bin%20Nun%20Alef%20%2824%E2%80%9325%20May%29">Operation Bin Nun Alef</a>. He was an instrumental figure in the creation of <a href="Unit%20101">Unit 101</a> and the <a href="reprisal%20operations">reprisal operations</a>, as well as in the 1956 <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a>, the <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a> of 1967, the <a href="War%20of%20Attrition">War of Attrition</a>, and the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom-Kippur War</a> of 1973. As Minister of Defense, he directed the <a href="1982%20Lebanon%20War">1982 Lebanon War</a>.

Sharon was considered the greatest field commander in Israel's history, and one of the country's greatest military strategists and tacticians. 
Upon retirement from the military, Sharon entered politics, joining the <a href="Likud">Likud</a>, and served in a number of ministerial posts in Likud-led governments in 1977–92 and 1996–99. He became the leader of the Likud in 2000, and served as Israel's prime minister from 2001 to 2006.

From the 1970s through to the 1990s, Sharon championed construction of <a href="Israeli%20settlement">Israeli settlement</a>s in the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a> and <a href="Gaza%20Strip">Gaza Strip</a>. However, as Prime Minister, in 2004–05 Sharon orchestrated <a href="Israel%27s%20unilateral%20disengagement%20plan">Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip</a>. Facing stiff opposition to this policy within the Likud, in November 2005 he left Likud to form a new party, <a href="Kadima">Kadima</a>. He had been expected to win the next election and was widely interpreted as planning on "clearing Israel out of most of the West Bank", in a series of unilateral withdrawals. After suffering a stroke on January 4, 2006, Sharon remained in a <a href="permanent%20vegetative%20state">permanent vegetative state</a> until his death in January 2014.

Sharon was born on February 26, 1928 in <a href="Kfar%20Malal">Kfar Malal</a>, an agricultural <a href="moshav">moshav</a>, then in <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Mandatory Palestine</a>, to Shmuel Scheinerman (1896–1956) of <a href="Brest%2C%20Belarus">Brest-Litovsk</a> and Vera (née Schneirov) Scheinerman (1900–1988) of <a href="Mogilev">Mogilev</a>. His mother, Vera, was from a family of <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n <a href="subbotniks">Subbotnik Jewish</a> origin. His parents met while at university in Tiflis (now <a href="Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a>, Republic of Georgia), where Sharon's father was studying <a href="agronomy">agronomy</a> and his mother was studying medicine. They <a href="aliyah">immigrated</a> to Mandatory Palestine in 1922 in the wake of the Russian Communist government's growing persecution of Jews in the region.

The family arrived with the <a href="Third%20Aliyah">Third Aliyah</a> and settled in Kfar Malal, a socialist, <a href="secularism">secular</a> community. (Ariel Sharon himself would remain proudly secular throughout his life.) Although his parents were <a href="Mapai">Mapai</a> supporters, they did not always accept communal consensus: "The Scheinermans' eventual ostracism ... followed the 1933 <a href="Haim%20Arlosoroff">Arlozorov</a> murder when Dvora and Shmuel refused to endorse the Labor movement's anti-Revisionist calumny and participate in <a href="bolshevism">Bolshevik</a>-style public revilement rallies, then the order of the day. Retribution was quick to come. They were expelled from the local health-fund clinic and village synagogue. The cooperative's truck wouldn't make deliveries to their farm nor collect produce."

Sharon grew up to be bilingual in both Hebrew and Russian languages.

Four years after their arrival at Kfar Malal, the Sheinermans had a daughter, Yehudit (Dita). Ariel was born two years later. At age 10, he joined the youth movement <a href="HaNoar%20HaOved%20VeHaLomed">HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed</a>. As a teenager, he began to take part in the armed night-patrols of his <a href="moshav">moshav</a>. In 1942 at the age of 14, Sharon joined the <a href="Gadna%20%28Israel%29">Gadna</a>, a paramilitary youth <a href="battalion">battalion</a>, and later the <a href="Haganah">Haganah</a>, the underground paramilitary force and the Jewish military precursor to the <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF).

Sharon's unit of the <a href="Haganah">Haganah</a> became engaged in serious and continuous combat from the autumn of 1947, with the onset of the <a href="Battle%20for%20Jerusalem%20%281948%29">Battle for Jerusalem</a>. Without the manpower to hold the roads, his unit took to making offensive hit-and-run raids on Arab forces in the vicinity of Kfar Malal. In units of thirty men, they would hit constantly at Arab villages, bridges and bases, as well as ambush the traffic between Arab villages and bases.

Sharon wrote in his autobiography: "We had become skilled at finding our way in the darkest nights and gradually we built up the strength and endurance these kind of operations required. Under the stress of constant combat we drew closer to one another and began to operate not just as a military unit but almost as a family. ... [W]e were in combat almost every day. Ambushes and battles followed each other until they all seemed to run together."

For his role in a night-raid on Iraqi forces at Bir Adas, Sharon was made a <a href="platoon">platoon</a> commander in the <a href="Alexandroni%20Brigade">Alexandroni Brigade</a>. Following the <a href="Israeli%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Israeli Declaration of Independence</a> and the onset of the <a href="1948%20Arab%20Israeli%20War">War of Independence</a>, his platoon fended off the Iraqi advance at Kalkiya. Sharon was regarded as a hardened and aggressive soldier, swiftly moving up the ranks during the war. He was shot in the groin, stomach and foot by the Jordanian <a href="Arab%20Legion">Arab Legion</a> in the <a href="Battles%20of%20Latrun">First Battle of Latrun</a>, an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the besieged Jewish community of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Sharon wrote of the casualties in the "horrible battle," and his brigade suffered 139 deaths.

Jordanian field marshal <a href="Habis%20Al-Majali">Habis Al-Majali</a> claimed that Sharon was among 6 Israeli soldiers captured by the Jordanian 4th battalion during the battle, and that Habis took them to a camp in <a href="Mafraq">Mafraq</a> and the 6 were later traded back. Sharon denied the claims, but Habes was adamant. "Sharon is like a grizzly bear," he grumbled. "I captured him, I healed his wounds." In 1994 and during the peace treaty signing ceremony with Jordan, Sharon wanted to get in touch with his former captor, but the latter determinedly refused to discuss the incident publicly.

After recovering from the wounds received at Latrun, he resumed command of his patrol unit. On December 28, 1948, his platoon attempted to break through an Egyptian stronghold in Iraq-El-Manshia. At about this time, Israeli founding father <a href="David%20Ben-Gurion">David Ben-Gurion</a> gave him the <a href="Hebraization%20of%20surnames">Hebraized</a> name "Sharon". In September 1949, Sharon was promoted to <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> commander (of the <a href="Golani%20Brigade">Golani Brigade</a>'s reconnaissance unit) and in 1950 to <a href="Espionage">intelligence officer</a> for Central Command. He then took leave to begin studies in history and Middle Eastern culture at the <a href="Hebrew%20University%20of%20Jerusalem">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>. Sharon's subsequent military career would be characterized by insubordination, aggression and disobedience, but also brilliance as a commander.

A year and a half later, on the direct orders of the Prime Minister, Sharon returned to active service in the rank of major, as the founder and commander of the new <a href="Unit%20101">Unit 101</a>, a special forces unit tasked with <a href="reprisal%20operations">reprisal operations</a> in response to <a href="Palestinian%20fedayeen">Palestinian fedayeen</a> attacks. The first Israeli commando unit, Unit 101 specialized in offensive guerrilla warfare in enemy countries. The unit consisted of 50 men, mostly former paratroopers and Unit 30 personnel. They were armed with non-standard weapons and tasked with carrying out special reprisals across the state's borders— mainly establishing small unit maneuvers, activation and insertion tactics. Training included engaging enemy forces across Israel's borders. Israeli historian <a href="Benny%20Morris">Benny Morris</a> describes Unit 101:

Unit 101 undertook a series of raids against <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, which then held the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a>. The raids also helped bolster Israeli morale and convince Arab states that the fledgling nation was capable of long-range military action. Known for raids against Arab civilians and military targets, the unit is held responsible for the widely condemned <a href="Qibya%20massacre">Qibya massacre</a> in the fall of 1953. After a group of Palestinians used Qibya as a staging point for a fedayeen attack in <a href="Yehud-Monosson">Yehud</a> that killed a Jewish woman and her two children in Israel, Unit 101 retaliated on the village. By various accounts of the ensuing attack, 65 to 70 Palestinian civilians, half of them women and children, were killed when Sharon's troops dynamited 45 houses and a school.

Facing international condemnation for the attack, Ben-Gurion denied that the Israeli military was involved. In his memoir, Sharon wrote that the unit had checked all the houses before detonating the explosives and that he thought the houses were empty. Although he admitted the results were tragic, Sharon defended the attack, however: "Now people could feel that the terrorist gangs would think twice before striking, now that they knew for sure they would be hit back. Kibbya also put the Jordanian and Egyptian governments on notice that if Israel was vulnerable, so were they."
A few months after its founding, Unit 101 was merged with the 890 Paratroopers Battalion to create the <a href="Paratroopers%20Brigade%20%28IDF%29">Paratroopers Brigade</a>, of which Sharon would also later become commander. Like Unit 101, it continued raids into Arab territory, culminating with the attack on the <a href="Qalqilyah">Qalqilyah</a> police station in the autumn of 1956.

Leading up to the Suez War, the missions Sharon took part in included:

During a payback operation in the Deir al-Balah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Sharon was again wounded by gunfire, this time in the leg. Incidents such as those involving <a href="Meir%20Har-Zion">Meir Har-Zion</a>, along with many others, contributed to the tension between Prime Minister <a href="Moshe%20Sharett">Moshe Sharett</a>, who often opposed Sharon's raids, and <a href="Moshe%20Dayan">Moshe Dayan</a>, who had become increasingly ambivalent in his feelings towards Sharon. Later in the year, Sharon was investigated and tried by the Military Police for disciplining one of his subordinates. However, the charges were dismissed before the onset of the Suez War.

Sharon commanded Unit 202 (the Paratroopers Brigade) during the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">1956 Suez War</a> (the British "<a href="Operation%20Musketeer%20%281956%29">Operation Musketeer</a>"), leading the troop to take the ground east of the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai</a>'s <a href="Mitla%20Pass">Mitla Pass</a> and eventually the pass itself against the advice of superiors, suffering heavy Israeli casualties in the process. Having successfully carried out the first part of his mission (joining a battalion parachuted near Mitla with the rest of the brigade moving on ground), Sharon's unit was deployed near the pass. Neither <a href="surveillance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> nor <a href="Reconnaissance">scouts</a> reported enemy forces inside the Mitla Pass. Sharon, whose forces were initially heading east, away from the pass, reported to his superiors that he was increasingly concerned with the possibility of an enemy thrust through the pass, which could attack his brigade from the flank or the rear.

Sharon asked for permission to attack the pass several times, but his requests were denied, though he was allowed to check its status so that if the pass was empty, he could receive permission to take it later. Sharon sent a small scout force, which was met with heavy fire and became bogged down due to vehicle malfunction in the middle of the pass. Sharon ordered the rest of his troops to attack in order to aid their comrades. Sharon was criticized by his superiors and was damaged by allegations several years later made by several former subordinates, who claimed that Sharon tried to provoke the <a href="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> and sent out the scouts in bad faith, ensuring that a battle would ensue.

Sharon had assaulted Themed in a dawn attack, and had stormed the town with his armor through the Themed Gap. Sharon routed the Sudanese police company, and captured the settlement. On his way to the <a href="An-Nakhl%20Fortress">Nakla</a>, Sharon's men came under attack from Egyptian MIG-15s. On the 30th, Sharon linked up with Eytan near Nakla. Dayan had no more plans for further advances beyond the passes, but Sharon nonetheless decided to attack the Egyptian positions at Jebel Heitan. Sharon sent his lightly armed paratroopers against dug-in Egyptians supported by aircraft, tanks and heavy artillery. Sharon's actions were in response to reports of the arrival of the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the 4th Egyptian Armored Division in the area, which Sharon believed would annihilate his forces if he did not seize the high ground. Sharon sent two infantry companies, a mortar battery and some AMX-13 tanks under the command of <a href="Mordechai%20Gur">Mordechai Gur</a> into the Heitan Defile on the afternoon of October 31, 1956. The Egyptian forces occupied strong defensive positions and brought down heavy anti-tank, mortar and machine gun fire on the IDF force. Gur's men were forced to retreat into the "Saucer", where they were surrounded and came under heavy fire. Hearing of this, Sharon sent in another task force while Gur's men used the cover of night to scale the walls of the Heitan Defile. During the ensuing action, the Egyptians were defeated and forced to retreat. A total of 260 Egyptian and 38 Israeli soldiers were killed during the battle at Mitla. Due to these deaths, Sharon's actions at Mitla were surrounded in controversy, with many within the IDF viewing the deaths as the result of unnecessary and unauthorized aggression.

The Mitla incident hindered Sharon's military career for several years. In the meantime, he occupied the position of an <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="brigade">brigade</a> commander and received a <a href="law%20degree">law degree</a> from <a href="Tel%20Aviv%20University">Tel Aviv University</a>. However, when <a href="Yitzhak%20Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a> became <a href="Ramatkal">Chief of Staff</a> in 1964, Sharon again began to rise rapidly in the ranks, occupying the positions of Infantry School Commander and Head of Army Training Branch, eventually achieving the rank of <a href="Aluf">Aluf</a> (<a href="Major%20General">Major General</a>).

In the <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a>, Sharon, in command of an <a href="armored%20division">armored division</a> on the <a href="Sinai">Sinai</a> <a href="Front%20%28military%29">front</a>, drew up his own complex offensive strategy that combined infantry troops, tanks and paratroopers from planes and helicopters to destroy the Egyptian forces Sharon's <a href="319th%20Division">38th Division</a> faced when it broke through to the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area. Sharon's victories and offensive strategy in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Abu-Ageila%20%281967%29">Battle of Abu-Ageila</a> led to international commendation by military strategists; he was judged to have inaugurated a new paradigm in operational command. Researchers at the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Training%20and%20Doctrine%20Command">United States Army Training and Doctrine Command</a> studied Sharon's operational planning, concluding that it involved a number of unique innovations. It was a simultaneous attack by a multiplicity of small forces, each with a specific aim, attacking a particular unit in a synergistic Egyptian defense network. As a result, instead of supporting and covering each other as they were designed to do, each Egyptian unit was left fighting for its own life.

According to Sapir Handelman, after Sharon's <a href="Battle%20of%20Abu-Ageila%20%281967%29">assault of the Sinai in the Six-Day War</a> and his <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War%23Israeli%20breakthrough">encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army in the Yom Kippur War</a>, the Israeli public nicknamed him "The King of Israel".

Sharon played a key role in the <a href="War%20of%20Attrition">War of Attrition</a>. In 1969, he was appointed the Head of IDF's <a href="Southern%20Command%20%28Israel%29">Southern Command</a>. As leader of the southern command, on July 29 Israeli frogmen <a href="Operation%20Bulmus%206">stormed and destroyed Green Island</a>, a fortress at the northern end of the Gulf of Suez whose radar and antiaircraft installations controlled that sector's airspace. On September 9 Sharon's forces carried out <a href="Operation%20Raviv">Operation Raviv</a>, a large-scale raid along the western shore of the Gulf of Suez. Landing craft ferried across Russian-made tanks and armored personnel carriers that Israel had captured in 1967, and the small column harried the Egyptians for ten hours.

Following his appointment to the southern command, Sharon had no further promotions, and considered retiring. Sharon discussed the issue with Rabbi <a href="Menachem%20M.%20Schneerson">Menachem M. Schneerson</a>, who strongly advised him to remain at his post. Sharon remained in the military for another three years, before retiring in August 1973. Soon after, he helped found the <a href="Likud">Likud</a> ("Unity") political party.

At the start of the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a> on October 6, 1973, Sharon was called back to active duty along with his assigned reserve armored division. On his farm, before he left for the front line, the Reserve Commander, Zeev Amit, said to him, "How are we going to get out of this?" Sharon replied, "You don't know? We will cross the Suez Canal and the war will end over there." Sharon arrived at the front, to participate in his fourth war, in a civilian car. His forces did not engage the <a href="Egyptian%20Army">Egyptian Army</a> immediately, despite his requests. Under cover of darkness, Sharon's forces moved to a point on the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> that had been prepared before the war. In a move that again thwarted the commands of his superiors, Sharon's division crossed the Suez, effectively winning the war for Israel. He then headed north towards Ismailia, intent on cutting the Egyptian second army's supply lines, but his division was halted south of the <a href="Fresh%20Water%20Canal">Fresh Water Canal</a>.
<a href="Abraham%20Adan">Abraham Adan</a>'s division passed over the bridgehead into Africa, advancing to within 101 kilometers of <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. His division managed to encircle <a href="Suez">Suez</a>, cutting off and <a href="Encirclement">encircling</a> the Third Army. Tensions between the two generals followed Sharon's decision, but a <a href="military%20tribunal">military tribunal</a> later found his action was militarily effective.

Sharon's complex ground maneuver is regarded as a decisive move in the Yom Kippur War, undermining the Egyptian Second Army and encircling the Egyptian Third Army. This move was regarded by many Israelis as the turning point of the war in the Sinai front. Thus, Sharon is widely viewed as the hero of the Yom Kippur War, responsible for Israel's ground victory in the Sinai in 1973. A photo of Sharon wearing a head bandage on the Suez Canal became a famous symbol of Israeli military prowess.

Sharon's political positions were controversial, and he was relieved of duty in February 1974.

Following Israel's victory in the six day war, the war of attrition at the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> began. The Egyptians began firing in provocation against the Israeli forces posted on the eastern part of the canal. <a href="Haim%20Bar%20Lev">Haim Bar Lev</a>, Israel's chief of staff, suggested that Israel construct a border line to protect its southern border. A wall of sand and earth raised along almost the entire length of the Suez Canal would both allow observation of Egyptian forces and conceal the movements of Israeli troops on the eastern side. This line, named after the chief of staff Haim Bar Lev, became known as the <a href="Bar%20Lev%20Line">Bar Lev Line</a>. It included at least thirty strong points stretching over almost 200 kilometers.

Bar Lev suggested that such a line would defend against any major Egyptian assault across the canal, and was expected to function as a "graveyard for Egyptian troops". <a href="Moshe%20Dayan">Moshe Dayan</a> described it as "one of the best anti-tank ditches in the world." Sharon, and <a href="Israel%20Tal">Israel Tal</a> on the other hand, vigorously opposed the line. Sharon said that it would pin down large military formations that would be sitting ducks for deadly artillery attacks, and cited the opinion of Rabbi <a href="Menachem%20M.%20Schneerson">Menachem M. Schneerson</a>, who explained him "the great military disaster such a line could bring." Notwithstanding, it was completed in spring 1970.

During the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a>, Egyptian forces successfully breached the Bar Lev Line in less than two hours at a cost of more than a thousand dead and some 5,000 wounded. Sharon would later recall that what <a href="Menachem%20M.%20Schneerson">Schneerson</a> had told him was a tragedy, "but unfortunately, that happened."

In the 1940s and 1950s, Sharon seemed to be personally devoted to the ideals of <a href="Mapai">Mapai</a>, the predecessor of the modern <a href="Labor%20Party%20%28Israel%29">Labor Party</a>. However, after retiring from military service, he joined the Liberal Party and was instrumental in establishing <a href="Likud">Likud</a> in July 1973 by a merger of <a href="Herut">Herut</a>, the <a href="Liberalism%20in%20Israel">Liberal Party</a> and independent elements. Sharon became chairman of the campaign staff for <a href="Israeli%20legislative%20election%2C%201973">that year's elections</a>, which were scheduled for November. Two and a half weeks after the start of the election campaign, the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a> erupted and Sharon was called back to reserve service. On the heels of being hailed as a war hero for crossing the Suez in the 1973 war, Sharon won a seat to the Knesset in the elections that year, but resigned a year later.

From June 1975 to March 1976, Sharon was a special aide to Prime Minister <a href="Yitzhak%20Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a>. He planned his return to politics for the <a href="Israeli%20legislative%20election%2C%201977">1977 elections</a>; first, he tried to return to the Likud and replace <a href="Menachem%20Begin">Menachem Begin</a> at the head of the party. He suggested to <a href="Simha%20Erlich">Simha Erlich</a>, who headed the Liberal Party bloc in the Likud, that he was more fitting than Begin to win an election victory; he was rejected, however. He then tried to join the Labor Party and the <a href="centrism">centrist</a> <a href="Democratic%20Movement%20for%20Change">Democratic Movement for Change</a>, but was rejected by those parties too. Only then did he form his own list, <a href="Shlomtzion%20%28political%20party%29">Shlomtzion</a>, which won two Knesset seats in the subsequent elections. Immediately after the elections, he merged Shlomtzion with the Likud and became <a href="Agriculture%20Minister%20of%20Israel">Minister of Agriculture</a>.

When Sharon joined Begin's government, he had relatively little political experience. During this period, Sharon supported the <a href="Gush%20Emunim">Gush Emunim</a> settlements movement and was viewed as the patron of the settlers' movement. He used his position to encourage the establishment of a network of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories to prevent the possibility of <a href="Palestinian%20Arab">Palestinian Arab</a>s' return to these territories. Sharon doubled the number of Jewish settlements on the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a> and <a href="Gaza%20Strip">Gaza Strip</a> during his tenure.

After the 1981 elections, Begin rewarded Sharon for his important contribution to Likud's narrow win, by appointing him <a href="Defense%20Minister%20of%20Israel">Minister of Defense</a>.

Under Sharon, Israel continued to build upon the unprecedented coordination between the <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israel Defense Forces</a> and the <a href="South%20African%20Defence%20Force">South African Defence Force</a>, with Israeli and South African generals giving each other unfettered access to each other's battlefields and military tactics, and Israel sharing with South Africa highly classified information about its missions, such as <a href="Operation%20Opera">Operation Opera</a>, which had previously only been reserved for the United States. In 1981, after visiting South African forces fighting in Namibia for 10 days, Sharon argued that South Africa needed more weapons to fight Soviet infiltration in the region. Sharon promised that the relationship between Israel and South Africa would continue to deepen as they work to "ensure the National Defense of both our countries". The collaboration in carrying out joint-nuclear tests, in planning counter-insurgency strategies in Namibia and in designing security fences helped to make Israel, South Africa's closest ally in this period.

As Defense Minister, Sharon launched an invasion of Lebanon called Operation Peace for Galilee, later known as the <a href="1982%20Lebanon%20War">1982 Lebanon War</a>, following the shooting of Israel's ambassador in London, <a href="Shlomo%20Argov">Shlomo Argov</a>. Although this attempted assassination was in fact perpetrated by the <a href="Abu%20Nidal%20Organization">Abu Nidal Organization</a>, possibly with Syrian or Iraqi involvement, the Israeli government justified the invasion by citing 270 terrorist attacks by the <a href="Palestinian%20Liberation%20Organization">Palestinian Liberation Organization</a> (PLO) in Israel, the occupied territories, and the Jordanian and Lebanese border (in addition to 20 attacks on Israeli interests abroad). Sharon intended the operation to eradicate the PLO from its state within a state inside Lebanon, but the war is primarily remembered for the <a href="Sabra%20and%20Shatila%20massacre">Sabra and Shatila massacre</a>. In a three-day massacre between September 16 and 18, between 460 and 3,500 civilians, mostly <a href="Palestinian%20people">Palestinians</a> and <a href="Shia%20Islam%20in%20Lebanon">Lebanese Shiites</a>, in the Sabra neighborhood and the adjacent <a href="Shatila%20refugee%20camp">Shatila refugee camp</a> were killed by the <a href="Kataeb%20Party">Phalanges</a>— Lebanese Maronite Christian militias. Chatila had previously been one of the PLO's three main training camps for foreign terrorists and the main training camp for European terrorists; the Israelis maintained that 2,000 to 3,000 terrorists remained in the camps, but were unwilling to risk the lives of more of their soldiers after the Lebanese army repeatedly refused to "clear them out." The killings followed years of sectarian civil war in Lebanon that left 95,000 dead. The Lebanese army's chief prosecutor investigated the killings and counted 460 dead, Israeli intelligence estimated 700-800 dead, and the Palestinian Red Crescent claimed 2,000 dead. 1,200 death certificates were issued to anyone who produced three witnesses claiming a family member disappeared during the time of the massacre. Nearly all of the victims were men.

The Phalange militia went into the camps to clear out PLO fighters while Israeli forces surrounded the camps, blocking camp exits and providing logistical support. The killings led some to label Sharon "the Butcher of Beirut".

An <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> report on September 15, 1982 stated, "Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, in a statement, tied the killing of the Phalangist leader <a href="Bachir%20Gemayel">Bachir Gemayel</a> to the PLO, saying 'it symbolises the terrorist murderousness of the PLO terrorist organisations and their supporters'." Habib Chartouni, a Lebanese Christian from the <a href="Syrian%20Socialist%20National%20Party">Syrian Socialist National Party</a> confessed to the murder of Gemayel, and no Palestinians were involved.

Robert Maroun Hatem, Hobeika's bodyguard, stated in his book "From Israel to Damascus" that Phalangist commander <a href="Elie%20Hobeika">Elie Hobeika</a> ordered the massacre of civilians in defiance of Israeli instructions to behave like a "dignified" army. Hatem claimed "Sharon had given strict orders to Hobeika...to guard against any desperate move" and that Hobeika perpetrated the massacre "to tarnish Israel's reputation worldwide" for the benefit of Syria. Hobeika subsequently joined the Syrian occupation government and lived as a prosperous businessman under Syrian protection; further massacres in Sabra and Shatilla occurred with Syrian support in 1985.

The massacre followed intense Israeli bombings of <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> that had seen heavy civilian casualties, testing Israel's relationship with the United States in the process. America sent troops to help negotiate the PLO's exit from Lebanon, withdrawing them after negotiating a ceasefire that ostensibly protected Palestinian civilians.

After 400,000 <a href="Peace%20Now">Peace Now</a> protesters rallied in <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> to demand an official government inquiry into the massacres, the official Israeli government investigation into the massacre at Sabra and Shatila, the <a href="Kahan%20Commission">Kahan Commission</a> (1982), was conducted. The inquiry found that the <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israeli Defense Forces</a> were indirectly responsible for the massacre since IDF troops held the area. The commission determined that the killings carried out by a Phalangist unit acting on its own, but its entry was known to Israel and approved by Sharon. Prime Minister Begin was also found responsible for not exercising greater involvement and awareness in the matter of introducing the Phalangists into the camps.

The commission also concluded that Sharon bore personal responsibility "for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge [and] not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed". It said Sharon's negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control, amounted to a dereliction of duty of the minister. In early 1983, the commission recommended the removal of Sharon from his post as defense minister and stated:

We have found ... that the Minister of Defense [Ariel Sharon] bears personal responsibility. In our opinion, it is fitting that the Minister of Defense draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office— and if necessary, that the Prime Minister consider whether he should exercise his authority ... to ... remove [him] from office."

Sharon initially refused to resign as defense minister, and Begin refused to fire him. After a grenade was thrown into a dispersing crowd at an Israeli <a href="Peace%20Now">Peace Now</a> march, killing <a href="Emil%20Grunzweig">Emil Grunzweig</a> and injuring 10 others, a compromise was reached: Sharon agreed to forfeit the post of defense minister but stayed in the cabinet as a <a href="minister%20without%20portfolio">minister without portfolio</a>.

Sharon's resignation as defense minister is listed as one of the important events of the <a href="Tenth%20Knesset">Tenth Knesset</a>.

In its February 21, 1983 issue, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" published an article implying that Sharon was directly responsible for the massacres. Sharon sued "Time" for <a href="Slander%20and%20libel">libel</a> in American and Israeli courts. Although the jury concluded that the "Time" article included false allegations, they found that the magazine had not acted with <a href="actual%20malice">actual malice</a> and so was not guilty of libel.

On June 18, 2001, relatives of the victims of the Sabra massacre began proceedings in Belgium to have Sharon indicted on alleged <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s charges. Elie Hobeika, the leader of the Phalange militia who carried out the massacres, was assassinated in January 2002, several months before he was scheduled to testify trial. Prior to his assassination, he had "specifically stated that he did not plan to identify Sharon as being responsible for Sabra and Shatila."

After his dismissal from the Defense Ministry post, Sharon remained in successive governments as a minister without portfolio (1983–1984), <a href="Industry%2C%20Trade%20and%20Labour%20Minister%20of%20Israel">Minister for Trade and Industry</a> (1984–1990), and <a href="Housing%20and%20Construction%20Minister%20of%20Israel">Minister of Housing Construction</a> (1990–1992). In the Knesset, he was member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense committee (1990–1992) and Chairman of the committee overseeing <a href="aliyah">Jewish immigration</a> from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. During this period he was a rival to then prime minister <a href="Yitzhak%20Shamir">Yitzhak Shamir</a>, but failed in various bids to replace him as chairman of Likud. Their rivalry reached a head in February 1990, when Sharon grabbed the microphone from Shamir, who was addressing the Likud central committee, and famously exclaimed: "Who's for wiping out terrorism?" The incident was widely viewed as an apparent <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a> attempt against Shamir's leadership of the party.

In <a href="Benjamin%20Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>'s 1996–1999 government, Sharon was <a href="National%20Infrastructure%20Minister%20of%20Israel">Minister of National Infrastructure</a> (1996–98), and <a href="Foreign%20Affairs%20Minister%20of%20Israel">Foreign Minister</a> (1998–99). Upon the election of the <a href="Ehud%20Barak">Barak</a> Labor government, Sharon became leader of the Likud party.

Ariel Sharon criticised the <a href="NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia">NATO bombing of Yugoslavia</a> in 1999 as an act of "brutal interventionism". Sharon said both Serbia and Kosovo have been victims of violence. He said prior to the current Yugoslav campaign against Kosovo Albanians, Serbians were the targets of attacks in the Kosovo province. "Israel has a clear policy. We are against aggressive actions. We are against hurting innocent people. I hope that the sides will return to the negotiating table as soon as possible." During the crisis, Elyakim Haetzni said the Serbs should be the first to receive Israeli aid. "There are our traditional friends," he told Israel Radio." It was suggested that Sharon may have supported the Yugoslav position because of the Serbian population's history of saving Jews during the holocaust. On Sharon's death, Serbian minister <a href="Aleksandar%20Vulin">Aleksandar Vulin</a> stated: The Serbian people will remember Sharon for opposing the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against the former Yugoslavia and advocating respect for sovereignty of other nations and a policy of not interfering with their internal affairs.

On September 28, 2000, Sharon and an escort of over 1,000 Israeli police officers visited the <a href="Temple%20Mount">Temple Mount</a> complex, site of the <a href="Dome%20of%20the%20Rock">Dome of the Rock</a> and <a href="al-Aqsa%20Mosque">al-Aqsa Mosque</a>, the holiest place in the world to Jews and the third holiest site in Islam. Sharon declared that the complex would remain under perpetual Israeli control. Palestinian commentators accused Sharon of purposely inflaming emotions with the event to provoke a violent response and obstruct success of delicate ongoing peace talks. On the following day, a large number of Palestinian demonstrators and an Israeli police contingent confronted each other at the site. According to the <a href="U.S.%20State%20Department">U.S. State Department</a>, "Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200." According to the government of Israel, 14 policemen were injured.

Sharon's visit, a few months before his election as Prime Minister, came after archeologists claimed that extensive building operations at the site were destroying priceless antiquities. Sharon's supporters claim that <a href="Yasser%20Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> and the <a href="Palestinian%20National%20Authority">Palestinian National Authority</a> planned the <a href="Second%20Intifada">Second Intifada</a> months prior to Sharon's visit. They state that Palestinian security chief Jabril Rajoub provided assurances that if Sharon did not enter the mosques, no problems would arise. They also often quote statements by Palestinian Authority officials, particularly Imad Falouji, the P.A. Communications Minister, who admitted months after Sharon's visit that the violence had been planned in July, far in advance of Sharon's visit, stating the intifada "was carefully planned since the return of (Palestinian President) Yasser Arafat from <a href="Camp%20David%202000%20Summit">Camp David</a> negotiations rejecting the U.S. conditions". According to the <a href="Mitchell%20Report%20%28Arab-Israeli%20conflict%29">Mitchell Report</a>,
the government of Israel asserted that the immediate catalyst for the violence was the breakdown of the Camp David negotiations on 25 July 2000 and the "widespread appreciation in the international community of Palestinian responsibility for the impasse." In this view, Palestinian violence was planned by the PA leadership, and was aimed at "provoking and incurring Palestinian casualties as a means of regaining the diplomatic initiative."
The Mitchell Report found that
the Sharon visit did not cause the Al-Aqsa Intifada. But it was poorly timed and the provocative effect should have been foreseen; indeed, it was foreseen by those who urged that the visit be prohibited. More significant were the events that followed: The decision of the Israeli police on 29 September to use lethal means against the Palestinian demonstrators.
In addition, the report stated,
Accordingly, we have no basis on which to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the PA [Palestinian Authority] to initiate a campaign of violence at the first opportunity; or to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the GOI [Government of Israel] to respond with lethal force."

The Or Commission, an Israeli panel of inquiry appointed to investigate the October 2000 events,
criticised the Israeli police for being unprepared for the riots and possibly using excessive force to disperse the mobs, resulting in the deaths of 12 Arab Israeli, one Jewish and one Palestinian citizens.

After the collapse of Barak's government, Sharon was <a href="Israeli%20prime%20ministerial%20election%2C%202001">elected Prime Minister on 6 February 2001</a>, defeating Barak 68 percent to 32 percent. Sharon's senior adviser was <a href="Raanan%20Gissin">Raanan Gissin</a>. In his first act as prime minister, Sharon invited the Labor Party to join in a coalition with Likud. After Israel was struck by a wave of <a href="List%20of%20Palestinian%20suicide%20attacks%232000s">suicide bombings</a> in 2002, Sharon decided to launch <a href="Operation%20Defensive%20Shield">Operation Defensive Shield</a> and began the construction of a <a href="Israeli%20West%20Bank%20barrier">barrier</a> around the West Bank. A survey conducted by Tel Aviv University's Jaffe Center in May 2004 found that 80% of Jewish Israelis believed that the Israel Defense Forces had succeeded in militarily countering the Al-Aqsa Intifada.

The election of the more pro-Russian Sharon, as well as the more pro-Israel <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, led to an improvement in <a href="Israel%E2%80%93Russia%20relations">Israel–Russia relations</a> relations.

In September 2003, Sharon became the first prime minister of Israel to visit <a href="India">India</a>, saying that Israel regarded India as one of the most important countries in the world. Some analysts speculated on the development of a three-way military axis of <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>, <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> and <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.

On July 20, 2004, Sharon called on French Jews to emigrate from France to Israel immediately, in light of an increase in <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> in France (94 antisemitic assaults were reported in the first six months of 2004, compared to 47 in 2003). France has the third-largest Jewish population in the world (about 600,000 people). Sharon observed that an "unfettered anti-Semitism" reigned in France. The French government responded by describing his comments as "unacceptable", as did the French representative Jewish organization <a href="Conseil%20Repr%C3%A9sentatif%20des%20Institutions%20juives%20de%20France">CRIF</a>, which denied Sharon's claim of intense anti-Semitism in French society. An Israeli spokesperson later claimed that Sharon had been misunderstood. France then postponed a visit by Sharon. Upon his visit, both Sharon and French President <a href="Jacques%20Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> were described as showing a willingness to put the issue behind them.

In September 2001, Sharon stated for the first time that Palestinians should have the right to establish their own land west of the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>. In May 2003, Sharon endorsed the <a href="Road%20Map%20for%20Peace">Road Map for Peace</a> put forth by the United States, <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, and Russia, which opened a dialogue with <a href="Mahmud%20Abbas">Mahmud Abbas</a>, and announced his commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state in the future.

He embarked on a course of unilateral withdrawal from the <a href="Gaza%20Strip">Gaza Strip</a>, while maintaining control of its coastline and airspace. Sharon's plan was welcomed by both the <a href="Palestinian%20Authority">Palestinian Authority</a> and Israel's left wing as a step towards a final peace settlement. However, it was greeted with opposition from within his own Likud party and from other right wing Israelis, on national security, military, and religious grounds.

On December 1, 2004, Sharon dismissed five ministers from the Shinui party for voting against the government's 2005 budget. In January 2005, Sharon formed a <a href="national%20unity%20government">national unity government</a> that included representatives of Likud, Labor, and <a href="Meimad">Meimad</a> and <a href="Degel%20HaTorah">Degel HaTorah</a> as "out-of-government" supporters without any seats in the government (<a href="United%20Torah%20Judaism">United Torah Judaism</a> parties usually reject having ministerial offices as a policy). Between August 16 and 30, 2005, Sharon controversially expelled 9,480 Jewish settlers from 21 settlements in Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank. Once it became clear that the evictions were definitely going ahead, a group of conservative Rabbis, led by <a href="Yosef%20Dayan">Yosef Dayan</a>, placed an ancient curse on Sharon known as the <a href="Pulsa%20diNura">Pulsa diNura</a>, calling on the <a href="Destroying%20angel%20%28Bible%29">Angel of Death</a> to intervene and kill him. After Israeli soldiers bulldozed every settlement structure except for several former synagogues, Israeli soldiers formally left Gaza on September 11, 2005 and closed the border fence at <a href="Kissufim">Kissufim</a>. While his decision to withdraw from Gaza sparked bitter protests from members of the Likud party and the settler movement, opinion polls showed that it was a popular move among most of the Israeli electorate, with more than 80 percent of Israelis backing the plans. On September 27, 2005, Sharon narrowly defeated a leadership challenge by a 52–48 percent vote. The move was initiated within the central committee of the governing Likud party by Sharon's main rival, <a href="Benjamin%20Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, who had left the cabinet to protest Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza. The measure was an attempt by Netanyahu to call an early primary in November 2005 to choose the party's leader.

On November 21, 2005, Sharon resigned as head of Likud, and dissolved parliament to form a new centrist party called <a href="Kadima">Kadima</a> ("Forward"). November polls indicated that Sharon was likely to be returned to the prime ministership. On December 20, 2005, Sharon's longtime rival Netanyahu was elected his successor as leader of Likud. Following Sharon's incapacitation, Ehud Olmert replaced Sharon as Kadima's leader, for the nearing general elections. Likud, along with the <a href="Labor%20Party%20%28Israel%29">Labor Party</a>, were "Kadima"'s chief rivals in the <a href="Israel%20legislative%20election%2C%202006">March 2006 elections</a>.

Sharon's stroke occurred a few months before he had been expected to win a new election and was widely interpreted as planning on "clearing Israel out of most of the West Bank", in a series of unilateral withdrawals.

In the elections, which saw Israel's lowest-ever voter turnout of 64 percent (the number usually averages on the high 70%), Kadima, headed by Olmert, received the most Knesset seats, followed by Labor. The new governing coalition installed in May 2006 included Kadima, with Olmert as Prime Minister, Labor (including <a href="Amir%20Peretz">Amir Peretz</a> as Defense Minister), the Gil (Pensioner's) Party, the Shas religious party, and <a href="Israel%20Beytenu">Israel Beytenu</a>.

During the latter part of his career, Sharon was investigated for alleged involvement in a number of financial scandals, in particular, the <a href="Greek%20Island%20Affair">Greek Island Affair</a> and irregularities of fundraising during the 1999 election campaign. In the Greek Island Affair, Sharon was accused of promising (during his term as Foreign Minister) to help Israeli businessman <a href="David%20Appel%20%28businessman%29">David Appel</a> in his development project on a Greek island in exchange for large consultancy payments to Sharon's son Gilad. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. In the 1999 election fundraising scandal, Sharon was not charged with any wrongdoing, but his son <a href="Omri%20Sharon">Omri</a>, a Knesset member at the time, was charged and sentenced in 2006 to nine months in prison.

To avoid a potential conflict of interest in relation to these investigations, Sharon was not involved in the confirmation of the appointment of a new attorney general, <a href="Menahem%20Mazuz">Menahem Mazuz</a>, in 2005.

On December 10, 2005, Israeli police raided <a href="Martin%20Schlaff">Martin Schlaff</a>'s apartment in Jerusalem. Another suspect in the case was Robert Nowikovsky, an Austrian involved in Russian state-owned company <a href="Gazprom">Gazprom</a>'s business activities in Europe.

According to "Haaretz", "The $3 million that parachuted into Gilad and Omri Sharon's bank account toward the end of 2002 was transferred there in the context of a consultancy contract for development of kolkhozes (collective farms) in Russia. Gilad Sharon was brought into the campaign to make the wilderness bloom in Russia by Getex, a large Russian-based exporter of seeds (peas, millet, wheat) from Eastern Europe. Getex also has ties with Israeli firms involved in exporting wheat from Ukraine, for example. The company owns farms in Eastern Europe and is considered large and prominent in its field. It has its Vienna offices in the same building as Jurimex, which was behind the $1-million guarantee to the <a href="Yisrael%20Beiteinu">Yisrael Beiteinu</a> party."

On December 17, police announced that they had found evidence of a $3 million bribe paid to Sharon's sons. Shortly after the announcement, Sharon suffered a stroke.

Sharon suffered from <a href="obesity">obesity</a> from the 1980s and also had suspected chronic <a href="high%20blood%20pressure">high blood pressure</a> and <a href="high%20cholesterol">high cholesterol</a> – at tall, he was reputed to weigh . Stories of Sharon's appetite and obesity were legendary in Israel. He would often joke about his love of food and expansive girth. His staff car would reportedly be stocked with snacks, vodka, and caviar. In October 2004 when asked why he did not wear a <a href="bulletproof%20vest">bulletproof vest</a> despite frequent death threats, Sharon smiled and replied, "There is none that fits my size". He was a daily consumer of cigars and luxury foods. Numerous attempts by doctors, friends, and staff to impose a balanced diet on Sharon were unsuccessful.

Sharon was hospitalized on December 18, 2005, after suffering a minor <a href="ischemic%20stroke">ischemic stroke</a>. During his hospital stay, doctors discovered a heart defect requiring surgery and ordered bed rest pending a <a href="cardiac%20catheterization">cardiac catheterization</a> scheduled for January 5, 2006. Instead, Sharon immediately returned to work and suffered a <a href="hemorrhagic%20stroke">hemorrhagic stroke</a> on January 4, the day before surgery. After two surgeries lasting 7 and 14 hours, doctors stopped the bleeding in Sharon's brain, but were unable to prevent him from entering into a coma. Subsequent media reports indicated that Sharon had been diagnosed with <a href="cerebral%20amyloid%20angiopathy">cerebral amyloid angiopathy</a> (CAA) during his December hospitalisation. <a href="Hadassah%20Medical%20Center">Hadassah Hospital</a> Director Shlomo Mor-Yosef declined to respond to comments that the combination of CAA and blood thinners after Sharon's December stroke might have caused his more serious subsequent stroke.

<a href="Ehud%20Olmert">Ehud Olmert</a> became <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Israel%23Acting%20Prime%20Minister">Acting Prime Minister</a> the night of Sharon's second stroke, while Sharon was only officially in office. <a href="Israeli%20legislative%20election%2C%202006">Knesset elections</a> followed in March, with Olmert and Sharon's <a href="Kadima">Kadima</a> party winning a plurality. The next month, the Israeli Cabinet declared Sharon permanently incapacitated and Olmert officially became Interim Prime Minister in office on April 14, 2006 until his new established government made him Prime Minister in his own right on 4 May.

Sharon underwent a series of subsequent surgeries related to his state. In May 2006, he was transferred to a long-term care facility in <a href="Sheba%20Medical%20Center">Sheba Medical Center</a>. In July of that year, he was briefly taken to the hospital's intensive care unit to be treated for bacteria in his blood, before returning to the long-term care facility on November 6, 2006. Sharon would remain at Sheba Medical Center until his death. Medical experts indicated that his <a href="cognition">cognitive</a> abilities had likely been destroyed by the stroke. His condition worsened from late 2013, and Sharon suffered from <a href="renal%20failure">renal failure</a> on January 1, 2014.

After spending eight years in a coma, Sharon died at 14:00 <a href="Israel%20Standard%20Time">local time</a> (12:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>) on January 11, 2014. <a href="Death%20and%20funeral%20of%20Ariel%20Sharon">Sharon's state funeral</a> was held on January 13 in accordance with <a href="Jewish%20bereavement%23Funeral%20service">Jewish burial customs</a>, which require that interment takes place as soon after death as possible. His body <a href="lie%20in%20state">lay in state</a> in the Knesset Plaza from January 12 until the official ceremony, followed by a funeral held at the family's ranch in the <a href="Negev%20Desert">Negev Desert</a>. Sharon was buried beside his wife, Lily.

Sharon was married twice, to two sisters, Margalit and Lily Zimmerman, who were from <a href="Romania">Romania</a>. Sharon met Margalit in 1947 when she was 16, while she was tending a vegetable field, and married her in 1953, shortly after becoming a <a href="Drill%20instructor">military instructor</a>. Margalit was a supervisory psychiatric nurse. They had one son, Gur. Margalit died in a car accident in May 1962 and Gur died in October 1967, aged 11, after a friend accidentally shot him while the two children were playing with a rifle at the Sharon family home. After Margalit's death, Sharon married her younger sister, Lily. They had two sons, <a href="Omri%20Sharon">Omri</a> and Gilad, and six grandchildren. Lily Sharon died of lung cancer in 2000.

Sharon's sister, Yehudit (Dita) married Dr. Shmuel Mandel. In the 1950s, the couple permanently left Israel and emigrated to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. This caused a permanent rift in the family. Shmuel and Vera Scheinerman were greatly hurt by their daughter's choice to leave Israel. As a result, Vera Scheinerman willed only a small part of her estate to Dita, an act which enraged her. At one point, Dita decided to return to Israel, but after Vera was informed by the Israel Lands Administration that it would not be legally possible to split the family property between Ariel and Dita, and informed her that she would not be able to build a home there, Dita, believing she was being lied to, permanently cut her family in Israel off, and refused to attend the funerals of her mother and sister-in-law. She reestablished contact after Sharon's stroke. Sharon's sister has rarely been mentioned in biographies of him: he himself rarely acknowledged her and only mentioned her twice in his autobiography.

A $250 million park named for Ariel Sharon is under construction outside <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>. When complete, the Ariel Sharon Park will be three times the size of New York's <a href="Central%20Park%2C%20New%20York">Central Park</a> and introduce many new ecological technologies. A 50,000-seat amphitheatre is also planned as a national concert venue.

In the Negev desert, the IDF is currently building its city of training bases, <a href="Camp%20Ariel%20Sharon">Camp Ariel Sharon</a>. In total, a NIS 50 billion project, the city of bases is named after Ariel Sharon, the largest active construction project in Israel, it is to become the largest IDF base in Israel.

Romantic orientation

Romantic orientation, also called affectional orientation, indicates the <a href="sex">sex</a> or <a href="gender">gender</a> with which a person is most likely to have a <a href="romance%20%28love%29">romantic relationship</a> or <a href="Falling%20in%20love">fall in love</a>. It is used both alternatively and side-by-side with the term "<a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a>", and is based on the perspective that <a href="sexual%20attraction">sexual attraction</a> is but a single component of a larger dynamic. For example, although a <a href="pansexuality">pansexual</a> person may feel sexually attracted to people regardless of gender, they may be predisposed to romantic intimacy with females. For <a href="Asexuality">asexual</a> people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation.

People may or may not engage in purely emotional <a href="Romance%20%28love%29">romantic</a> relationships. The main identities relating to this are:

The implications of the distinction between romantic and sexual orientations has not been fully recognized, nor has it been studied extensively. It is common for sources to describe sexual orientation as including components of both sexual and romantic (or romantic equivalent) attractions. Similarly, "romantic love" has been noted as "love with strong components of sexuality and infatuation," although some sources contradict this notion, stating that sexual and romantic attraction are not necessarily linked. With regard to asexuality, while asexuals usually do not experience sexual attraction (see <a href="gray%20asexuality">gray asexuality</a>), they may still experience romantic attraction.

<doc id="2947" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2947" title="Anoa">
Anoa

Anoa, also known as midget buffalo and sapiutan, are a subgenus of "<a href="Bubalus">Bubalus</a>" comprising two species native to <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>: the mountain anoa ("Bubalus quarlesi") and the lowland anoa ("Bubalus depressicornis"). Both live in undisturbed rainforest, and are essentially miniature <a href="Domestic%20buffalo">water buffalo</a>. They are similar in appearance to a <a href="deer">deer</a>, weighing .

Both are found on the island of <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> and the nearby island of <a href="Buton">Buton</a> in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. They apparently live singly or in pairs, rather than in herds like most cattle, except when the cows are about to give birth. One young is born per year.

Both species of anoa have been classified as <a href="endangered">endangered</a> since the 1960s, and the population continues to decrease. Fewer than 5000 animals of each species likely remain. Reasons for their decline include hunting for <a href="hide%20%28skin%29">hide</a>, <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horn</a>s, and <a href="meat">meat</a> by the local peoples and loss of habitat due to the advancement of settlement. Currently, hunting is the more serious factor in most areas.

The lowland anoa ("Bubalus depressicornis") is a small <a href="bovid">bovid</a>, standing barely over at the shoulder. They are also known as "anoa de Ilanura" or "anoa des plaines". It is most closely allied to the larger Asiatic buffaloes, showing the same reversal of the direction of the hair on their backs. The <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horn</a>s are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness, although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes. White spots are sometimes present below the eyes, and there may be white markings on the legs and back; the absence or presence of these white markings may be indicative of distinct <a href="race%20%28biology%29">race</a>s. The horns of the cows are very small. The nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct buffaloes, the remains of which are found in the <a href="Siwalik%20Hills">Siwalik Hills</a> of northern India. In habits, the animal appears to resemble the <a href="Indian%20buffalo">Indian buffalo</a>. It is usually solitary, living in <a href="lowland">lowland</a> <a href="tropical%20rainforest">forests</a> and <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s, browsing on plants and <a href="understory">understory</a>.

Mountain anoa ("Bubalus quarlesi") are also known as "anoa de montana", "anoa de Quarle, anoa des montagnes, anoa pegunungan," and Quarle's anoa. Standing at at the shoulder, it is even smaller than the lowland anoa and the smallest of all <a href="Bovini">wild cattle</a>. They also have longer, <a href="wool">wool</a>ier hair that moults every February to April, showing faint spots on the head, neck, and limbs.

Agner Krarup Erlang

Agner Krarup Erlang (1 January 1878 – 3 February 1929) was a <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>, <a href="statistician">statistician</a> and <a href="engineer">engineer</a>, who invented the fields of <a href="teletraffic%20engineering">traffic engineering</a> and <a href="queueing%20theory">queueing theory</a>.

By the time of his relatively early death at the age of 51, Erlang had created the field of <a href="PSTN">telephone networks</a> analysis. His early work in scrutinizing the use of local, exchange and trunk telephone line usage in a small community to understand the theoretical requirements of an efficient network led to the creation of the <a href="Erlang%20formula">Erlang formula</a>, which became a foundational element of modern <a href="telecommunication">telecommunication</a> network studies.

Erlang was born at Lønborg, near <a href="Tarm">Tarm</a>, in <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a>. He was the son of a schoolmaster, and a descendant of <a href="Thomas%20Fincke">Thomas Fincke</a> on his mother's side. At age 14, he passed the Preliminary Examination of the <a href="University%20of%20Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a> with distinction, after receiving dispensation to take it because he was younger than the usual minimum age. For the next two years he taught alongside his father.

A distant relative provided free board and lodging, and Erlang prepared for and took the University of <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> entrance examination in 1896, and passed with distinction. He won a scholarship to the University and majored in <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, and also studied <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="physics">physics</a> and <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>. He graduated in 1901 with an MA and over the next 7 years taught at several schools. He maintained his interest in mathematics, and received an award for a paper that he submitted to the University of Copenhagen.

He was a member of the Danish Mathematicians' Association (TBMI) and through this met amateur mathematician <a href="Johan%20Jensen%20%28mathematician%29">Johan Jensen</a>, the Chief Engineer of the <a href="Copenhagen%20Telephone%20Company">Copenhagen Telephone Company</a> (KTAS in Danish), an <a href="Corporate%20spin-off">offshoot</a> of the <a href="International%20Bell%20Telephone%20Company">International Bell Telephone Company</a>. Erlang worked for the CTC (KTAS) from 1908 for almost 20 years, until his death in Copenhagen after an abdominal operation.

He was an associate of the British <a href="Institution%20of%20Electrical%20Engineers">Institution of Electrical Engineers</a>.

While working for the CTC, Erlang was presented with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service. His thinking went further by finding how many <a href="Switchboard%20operator">telephone operators</a> were needed to handle a given volume of calls. Most <a href="telephone%20exchange">telephone exchange</a>s then used human operators and <a href="telephone%20switchboard">cord boards</a> to switch <a href="telephone%20call">telephone call</a>s by means of jack plugs.

Out of necessity, Erlang was a hands-on researcher. He would conduct measurements and was prepared to climb into street <a href="manhole">manhole</a>s to do so. He was also an expert in the history and calculation of the numerical tables of mathematical functions, particularly <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>s. He devised new calculation methods for certain forms of tables.

He developed his theory of telephone traffic over several years. His significant publications include:

These and other notable papers were translated into English, French and German. His papers were prepared in a very brief style and can be difficult to understand without a background in the field. One researcher from <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Laboratories">Bell Telephone Laboratories</a> is said to have learned Danish to study them.

The <a href="BT%20Group%20plc">British Post Office</a> accepted his formula as the basis for calculating circuit facilities.

In 1946, the <a href="CCITT">CCITT</a> named the international unit of telephone traffic "the <a href="Erlang%20%28unit%29">Erlang</a>". A statistical distribution and programming language listed below have also been named in his honour.

<doc id="2950" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2950" title="Anyone Can Whistle">
Anyone Can Whistle

Anyone Can Whistle is a <a href="Musical%20theater">musical</a> with a book by <a href="Arthur%20Laurents">Arthur Laurents</a> and music and lyrics by <a href="Stephen%20Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a>. The story concerns a corrupt mayoress, an idealistic nurse, a man who may be a doctor, and various officials, patients and townspeople, all fighting to save a bankrupt town. This musical was <a href="Angela%20Lansbury">Angela Lansbury</a>'s first stage musical role.

The show was first announced in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" on October 5, 1961: "For the winter of 1962, [Arthur Laurents] is nurturing another musical project, "The Natives Are Restless". The narrative and staging will be Mr. Laurent's handiwork; music and lyrics that of Stephen Sondheim. A meager description was furnished by Mr. Laurents, who refused to elaborate. Although the title might indicate otherwise, it is indigenous in content and contemporary in scope. No producer yet." No news of the show appeared until July 14, 1963, in an article in "The New York Times" about <a href="Kermit%20Bloomgarden">Kermit Bloomgarden</a>, where it discussed the four shows he was producing for the coming season; two were maybes, two were definite. One of the latter was a Sondheim-Laurents musical (now named "Side Show"). In a letter to Bloomgarden, Laurents wrote, "I beg you not to mention the money problems or any difficulties to Steve anymore. It depresses him terribly and makes it terribly difficult for him to work... It is damn hard to concentrate ... when all the atmosphere is filled with gloom and forebodings about will the show get the money to go on? ... Spare him the gory details." This behavior is considered unusual for Laurents, which runs contrary to his current reputation. Sondheim discovered that Laurents hated doing backers' auditions and he took over that responsibility, playing and singing more than 30. They found 115 investors to back the $350,000 production, including <a href="Richard%20Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a> and Sondheim's father.

Eager to work with both Laurents and Sondheim, Angela Lansbury accepted the lead role as Mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, despite her strong misgivings about the script and her ability to handle the score. Also signed were <a href="Lee%20Remick">Lee Remick</a> as Nurse Fay Apple and <a href="Harry%20Guardino">Harry Guardino</a> as Hapgood. Laurents had wanted <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> for the role of Fay, but she turned it down to star in "<a href="Funny%20Girl%20%28musical%29">Funny Girl</a>". Following rehearsals in New York City, the company started pre-Broadway tryouts in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> from March 2 to 21, 1964. Laurents, ignoring criticism about the show's message being trite and its absurdist style difficult to comprehend, poured his energies into restaging rather than dealing with the crux of the problem.

The show suffered further setbacks when supporting actor Henry Lascoe, who played Comptroller Schubb, suffered a heart attack during the show's out-of-town tryout, and was replaced by Gabriel Dell. According to Sondheim, "Lansbury was so insecure onstage, and unhappy with her performance, that we considered replacing her. Ironically, it soon became apparent that it had been Lascoe, an old pro...who had made her feel like an amateur. The minute his much less confident understudy took over, she felt free to blossom, which she spectacularly did." Sondheim called the reviews "humiliating" and the audiences "hostile." 

After multiple revisions, the show opened on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> on April 4, 1964, at the <a href="Majestic%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29">Majestic Theatre</a>, where it closed after 9 performances and 12 previews, unable to overcome the generally negative reviews it had received. Scenic design was by <a href="William%20and%20Jean%20Eckart">William and Jean Eckart</a>, costume design by <a href="Theoni%20V.%20Aldredge">Theoni V. Aldredge</a>, and lighting design by <a href="Jules%20Fisher">Jules Fisher</a>. <a href="Choreographer">Choreographer</a> <a href="Herbert%20Ross">Herbert Ross</a> received the show's sole <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> nomination.

The show became a cult favorite, and a truncated original cast recording released by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> sold well among Sondheim fans and musical theatre buffs. "There Won't Be Trumpets," a song cut during previews, has become a favorite of <a href="cabaret">cabaret</a> performers.

On April 8, 1995, a staged concert was held at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> in New York City as a benefit for the <a href="Gay%20Men%27s%20Health%20Crisis">Gay Men's Health Crisis</a>. The concert was recorded by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, preserving for the first time musical passages and numbers not included on the original Broadway cast recording. For example, the cut song "There's Always A Woman" was included at this concert. Lansbury served as narrator, with <a href="Madeline%20Kahn">Madeline Kahn</a> as Cora, <a href="Bernadette%20Peters">Bernadette Peters</a> as Fay, and <a href="Scott%20Bakula">Scott Bakula</a> as Hapgood. Additional cast included <a href="Chip%20Zien">Chip Zien</a>, <a href="Ken%20Page%20%28Actor%29">Ken Page</a>, and Harvey Evans, the only original cast member to reprise his role.

In 2003, <a href="Sony">Sony</a> reissued the original Broadway cast recording on <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a>. Two revivals were staged that year, one in London, at the Bridewell Theatre, and one in Los Angeles, at the Matrix Theatre.

The <a href="Ravinia%20Festival">Ravinia Festival</a>, <a href="Highland%20Park%2C%20Illinois">Highland Park</a>, Illinois, presented a staged concert on August 26 and 27, 2005, with <a href="Audra%20McDonald">Audra McDonald</a> (Fay), <a href="Michael%20Cerveris">Michael Cerveris</a> (Hapgood) and <a href="Patti%20LuPone">Patti LuPone</a> (Cora).

On January 11, 2008, Talk Is Free Theatre presented the Canadian professional premiere (in concert) at the Gryphon Theatre in <a href="Barrie">Barrie</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, with a fundraiser performance on January 13 at the Diesel Playhouse in Toronto, Ontario. It starred Adam Brazier as Hapgood, Kate Hennig as Cora, <a href="Blythe%20Wilson">Blythe Wilson</a> as Fay, and <a href="Richard%20Ouzounian">Richard Ouzounian</a> as Narrator, who also served as director. Choreography was by Sam Strasfeld. Additional cast included Juan Chioran as Comptroller Shub, Jonathan Monro as Treasurer Cooley, and Mark Harapiak as Chief Magruder. Musical direction was provided by Wayne Gwillim.

<a href="New%20York%20City%20Center">New York City Center</a> <a href="Encores%21">Encores!</a> presented a staged concert from April 8 through April 11, 2010, with <a href="Sutton%20Foster">Sutton Foster</a> as Nurse Fay Apple, <a href="Donna%20Murphy">Donna Murphy</a> as Mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, and <a href="Raul%20Esparza">Raul Esparza</a> as Hapgood, with direction and choreography by <a href="Casey%20Nicholaw">Casey Nicholaw</a>. The production was the second most attended in "Encores!" history, and Stephen Sondheim was present at the post-matinee talkback on April 10.

A London production of "Anyone can Whistle" opened at the Jermyn Street Studio Theatre, London, in association with Primavera Productions, running from March 10, 2010, to April 17, 2010. The director is <a href="Tom%20Littler">Tom Littler</a>, with Musical Director Tom Attwood, and a cast that includes <a href="Issy%20van%20Randwyck">Issy van Randwyck</a> (Mayoress), <a href="Rosalie%20Craig">Rosalie Craig</a> (Nurse Fay Apple) and David Ricardo-Pearce (Hapgood).

A new production directed by <a href="Phil%20Willmott">Phil Willmott</a> opened at the <a href="Union_Theatre%2C_London">Union Theatre</a> in London, running from February 8 through March 11, 2017.

The story is set in an imaginary American town that has gone bankrupt. (Its former major industry was the production of an unidentified product that never wore out. Everyone has one now, and no one needs a replacement.) The only place in town doing good business is the local sanitarium, known as “The Cookie Jar,” whose inmates look much healthier than the disgruntled townspeople. ("I'm Like the Bluebird") All the money is in the hands of Cora Hoover Hooper, the stylish, ruthless mayoress and her cronies - Comptroller Schub, Treasurer Cooley, and Police Chief Magruder. Cora appears carried in a litter by her backup singers, and admits that she can accept anything except unpopularity (“Me and My Town”). The scheming Comptroller Schub tells her that he has a plan to save her administration, and the town, promising “It's highly unethical.” He tells her to meet him at the rock on the edge of town. At the rock, a local mother, Mrs. Schroeder, tries to tell her child, Baby Joan, to come down from the rock, when Baby Joan licks it - and a spring of water begins flowing from it. The town instantly proclaims a miracle, and Cora and her council eagerly anticipate tourist dollars as they boast of the water's curative powers. ("Miracle Song") It is soon revealed to Cora that the miracle is a fake, controlled by a pump inside the rock. The only person in town who doubts the miracle is Fay Apple, an eternally skeptical young nurse from the Cookie Jar who refuses to believe in miracles. She appears at the rock with all forty-nine of the inmates, or “Cookies” in tow, intending to let them take some of the water. Schub realizes that if they drink the water and do not change, people will discover the fake. As he tries to stop Fay, the inmates mingle with the townspeople, until no one can guess who is who. Fay disappears, and hiding from the police, admits that she hopes for one miracle - for a hero who can come and deliver the town from the madness (“There Won't Be Trumpets”). Cora arrives on the scene with the Cookie Jar's manager, Dr. Detmold, but he says that Fay has taken the records to identify the inmates. He tells Cora that he is expecting a new assistant who might help them. At that moment a mysterious stranger, J. Bowden Hapgood, arrives asking for directions to the Cookie Jar. He is instantly taken for the new assistant. Asked to identify the missing Cookies, Hapgood begins questioning random people and sorting them into two groups, group A, and group one, but refuses to divulge which group is which. The town council becomes suspicious of this and try to force the truth out, but Hapgood questions them until they begin to doubt their own sanity. Cora is too caught up with his logic to care. (“Simple”) As the extended musical sequence ends, the lights black out except for a spotlight on Hapgood, who announces to the audience, “You are all mad!” Seconds later, the stage lights are restored. The stage set has vanished, and the cast is revealed in theater seats, holding programs, applauding the audience, as the act ends.

As act two opens, the two groups are now in bitter rivalry over who is the normal group (“A-1 March”) Another stranger, a French woman in a feathered coat appears. It is really Fay Apple in disguise. She introduces herself as the Lady from Lourdes, a professional Miracle Inspector, come to investigate the miracle. As Schub runs off to warn Cora, Fay seeks out Hapgood in his hotel, and the two seduce each other in the style of a French romantic film. (“Come Play Wiz Me”) Fay tries to get Hapgood's help in exposing the miracle. Hapgood, however, sees through her disguise and wants to question her first. Fay refuses to take her wig off, and confesses to him that this disguise, left over from a college play, is the only way she can break out of her rigid and cynical persona. She begins to hope, however, that Hapgood may be the one who can help her learn to be free. (“Anyone Can Whistle”) Meanwhile, the two groups continue to march, and Cora, trying to give a speech, realizes that Hapgood has stolen her limelight. (“A Parade in Town”) She and Schub plan an emergency meeting at her house. Back at the hotel, Hapgood comes up with an idea, telling Fay to destroy the inmates' records. That way Fay can be free of them and they can stop pretending. When Fay is reluctant, Hapgood produces a record of his own - he is her fiftieth Cookie. He is a practicing idealist who, after years of attempted heroism, is tired of crusading and has come to the Cookie Jar to retire. Inspired by his record, Fay begins to tear the records up. As she does, the Cookies appear and begin to dance (“Everybody Says Don't”).

Act three begins with Cora at her house with her council. Schub has put the miracle on hiatus, but announces that they can easily turn the town against Hapgood by blaming him for it. The group celebrates their alliance. (“I've Got You to Lean On”) A mob quickly forms outside the hotel, and Hapgood and Fay, still disguised, take refuge under the rock. Discovering the fraud, Cora and the council confront them. At that moment, Cora receives a telegram from the governor warning that if the quota of forty-nine cookies is not filled, she will be impeached. Schub tells her that since Hapgood never said who is normal or not, they can arrest anyone at random until the quota is filled. Fay tries to get Hapgood to expose the miracle, but he warns her no one will believe it is a fake, because it works as a miracle should. Fay wants his help stopping the Mayoress, but he refuses, since he is through with crusading. Although she knows she still isn't out of her shell, Fay angrily swears to go it alone. (“See What it Gets You”) As Cora and the police force begin rounding up Cookies, Fay tries to get the key away from the guards in an extended ballet sequence. (“The Cookie Chase”) As it ends, Fay is captured, and Dr. Detmold suddenly recognizes her. Fay tells the townspeople about the fake miracle, but the town refuses to believe her. Detmold tells Cora that even without the records, Fay can identify the inmates from memory. Cora warns that she will arrest forty-nine people, normal or not, and Fay, helplessly, identifies all the Cookies, except Hapgood. She tells him the world needs people like him, and Hapgood can't turn himself in. He asks Fay to come with him, but she still can't bring herself to break free. Parting ways, they reflect on what they briefly shared. (“With So Little to be Sure Of”) Word comes of a new miracle, two towns over, of a statue with a warm heart. Soon the town is all but deserted, and Cora is again upstaged. Again, Schub has the answer - since the Cookie Jar is still successful, they can turn the entire town into one big Cookie Jar! Cora realizes she and Schub are meant for each other, and they dance off together. As Fay resumes work, Detmold's real new assistant arrives, and Fay is horrified to realize that she is even more practical, rigid and disbelieving than Fay herself, and the new nurse marches the Cookies off to the next town to disprove the new miracle. Horrified at seeing what she might become, Fay returns to the rock calling for Hapgood. When he doesn't answer, she tries to whistle - and succeeds in blowing a shrill, ugly whistle. Hapgood appears again, saying 'That's good enough for me.' As they embrace, the water begins flowing from the rock - a true miracle this time. (Finale)

"(From the Broadway production")


Notes 

<a href="Howard%20Taubman">Howard Taubman</a> in his "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" review wrote that Laurents's "book lacks the fantasy that would make the idea work, and his staging has not improved matters. Mr. Sondheim has written several pleasing songs but not enough of them to give the musical wings. The performers yell rather than talk and run rather than walk. The dancing is the cream."

Steven Suskin wrote in his 2000 book about Broadway composers: The "fascinating extended musical scenes, with extended choral work, ... immediately marked Sondheim as the most distinctive theatre composer of his time. The first act sanity sequence ... and the third act chase ... are unlike anything that came before."

Alcopop

An alcopop (or cooler, spirit cooler in <a href="South%20African%20English">South African English</a>, or malternative in American slang) is a term describing certain flavored <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcoholic beverage</a>s with relatively low alcohol content (e.g., 3–7% <a href="alcohol%20by%20volume">alcohol by volume</a>), including:

The term alcopop (a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of the words "alcohol" and "<a href="soft%20drink">pop</a>") is used commonly in the United Kingdom to describe these drinks and in some countries by <a href="neoprohibition">neoprohibitionists</a>. Other terms include FAB (flavored alcoholic beverage), FMB (flavored malt beverage), PPS (pre-packaged spirit or premium packaged spirits), and RTD (<a href="ready-to-drink">ready-to-drink</a> – <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>).

There is a variety of beverages produced and marketed around the world as well as within each market which are described as coolers or alcopops. They tend to be <a href="sweetness">sweet</a> and served in small <a href="bottle">bottle</a>s (typically 355 ml (the normal size of a soda pop can) in the USA, 275 ml in South Africa and Germany, 330 ml in Canada and Europe), and between 4% and 7% <a href="alcohol%20by%20volume">ABV</a>. In Europe, Canada, and South Africa coolers tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g. <a href="Smirnoff%20Ice">Smirnoff Ice</a>) or rum (e.g. <a href="Bacardi%20Breezer">Bacardi Breezer</a>). In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as <a href="hops">un-hopped</a> <a href="beer">beer</a>s, depending on the state in which they are sold. Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent addition of alcohol (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring. Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can therefore be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks. There are, however, stronger ones that "are" simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g. Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can be sold only where hard liquor is available.

In the United States there is a proportionally limited tax on alcopops relative to those sold in Europe, although some states are considering legislation to bring their tax levels closer to the European model, which is credited with limiting consumption by youth.

According to the US <a href="Alcohol%20and%20Tobacco%20Tax%20and%20Trade%20Bureau">Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau</a> (TTB):

Flavored malt beverages are brewery products that differ from traditional malt beverages such as beer, ale, lager, porter, stout, or malt liquor in several respects. Flavored malt beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or malt beverage character. Their flavor is derived primarily from added flavors rather than from malt and other materials used in fermentation. At the same time, flavored malt beverages are marketed in traditional beer-type bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and malt beverage wholesalers, and their alcohol content is similar to other malt beverages in the 4-6% alcohol by volume range.

Although flavored malt beverages are produced at breweries, their method of production differs significantly from the production of other malt beverages and beer. In producing flavored malt beverages, brewers brew a fermented base of beer from malt and other brewing materials. Brewers then treat this base using a variety of processes in order to remove malt beverage character from the base. For example, they remove the color, bitterness, and taste generally associated with beer, ale, porter, stout, and other malt beverages. This leaves a base product to which brewers add various flavors, which typically contain distilled spirits, to achieve the desired taste profile and alcohol level.

While the alcohol content of flavored malt beverages is similar to that of most traditional malt beverages, the alcohol in many of them is derived primarily from the distilled spirits component of the added flavors rather than from fermentation.

In some <a href="Continental%20Europe">Continental Europe</a>an countries, such as <a href="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, bottled <a href="beer%20cocktail">beer cocktail</a>s and <a href="Shandy">shandies</a> are available, which are being marketed the same way like alcopops. However, these beverages are based on traditional hopped beers and therefore not considered to be alcopops.

Wine coolers gained popularity in the US market in the 1980s when <a href="Bartles%20and%20Jaymes">Bartles and Jaymes</a> began advertising their brand of wine coolers, which were followed by other brands, including when <a href="Bacardi">Bacardi</a> introduced the <a href="Bacardi%20Breezer">Breezer</a>. A growth in popularity occurred around 1993 with <a href="Two%20Dogs">Two Dogs</a>, DNA Alcoholic Spring Water, <a href="Hooper%27s%20Hooch">Hooper's Hooch</a> and <a href="Zima%20%28drink%29">Zima</a>, which was marketed under the title of "malternative beverage". <a href="Wine%20coolers">Wine coolers</a> were on the decline due to the increase in the US federal wine tax, and using a malt-beverage base became the new industry standard. Later, <a href="Mike%27s%20Hard%20Lemonade">Mike's Hard Lemonade</a> was released in the United States, with humorous commercials depicting what they called "violence against lemons". <a href="Smirnoff">Smirnoff</a> also came out with another <a href="citrus">citrus</a>-<a href="flavor">flavor</a>ed <a href="malt%20beverage">malt beverage</a> in the United States in the late 1990s called <a href="Smirnoff%20Ice">Smirnoff Ice</a>, which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places. (In the UK, Smirnoff Ice is marketed by <a href="Diageo">Diageo</a> as a PPS.)

Some have expressed concern that such drinks might appeal to children as they tend to be sweet and brightly colored. Many <a href="Alcohol%20advertising">cooler advertising campaigns</a> have been criticized as trying to make 'alcopops' appeal to young drinkers. In the United Kingdom, that led to a media outcry during the mid-1990s as the <a href="tabloid%20journalism">tabloid</a> press associated alcopops with under-age drinking which damaged sales and would lead to <a href="off-licence">off-licence</a>s withdrawing them from their stores.

In response to a complaint from the <a href="Center%20for%20Science%20in%20the%20Public%20Interest">Center for Science in the Public Interest</a> (CSPI), the <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) conducted an extensive investigation in 2001. The agency "found no evidence of intent to target minors with the FMB products, packaging, or advertising. Furthermore, after reviewing the consumer survey evidence submitted by CSPI in support of the proposition that FMBs were predominantly popular with minors, the FTC concluded that flaws in the survey's methodology limited the ability to draw conclusions from the survey data."

The Federal Trade Commission again in 2003 investigated FMB ads, <a href="product%20placement">product placement</a>, and internal company marketing documents after a directive from the conferees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. "The Commission's investigation found no evidence of targeting underage consumers in the marketing of FMBs. Adults 21 to 29 appear to be the intended target of FMB marketing" and found that "the majority of FMB drinkers are over the age of 27."

In December 2003, <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> raised the tax on flavored malt beverages to equal that of spirits, the second highest in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. <a href="Germany">Germany</a> has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 <a href="euro">euro</a> per bottle effective August 1, 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to <a href="wine%20coolers">wine coolers</a>, which are being marketed the same way. Some bottles now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by people under the legal drinking age (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the United States). On May 11, 2008, the <a href="Australia">Australia</a>n Government increased the excise tax on alcopops by 70%, to bring it inline with the tax on spirits. There is the concern this tax will encourage consumers to buy straight spirits and mix the drinks themselves, possibly resulting in drinks with a higher alcohol concentration than the premixed alternatives. This tax was revoked during March 2009 meaning the government had to pay back the 290 million collected on the tax.

The Federal Trade Commission report states, "Further, industry-conducted research on consumers over the age of 21 who use FMBs shows that these consumers generally view the FMBs as substitutes for beer, ... This research also concludes that consumers are not likely to consume more than two or three FMBs on any occasion because of the products'
sweetness.

Brands of coolers are numerous and their alcoholic base vary greatly. Some notable brands include: <a href="VK%20Vodkakick">VK Vodkakick</a>, <a href="Smirnoff%20Ice">Smirnoff Ice</a>, <a href="Mike%27s%20Hard%20Lemonade">Mike's Hard Lemonade</a>, <a href="Bacardi%20Breezer">Bacardi Breezer</a>, <a href="Skyy%20Blue">Skyy Blue</a>, <a href="Jack%20Daniel%27s">Jack Daniel's</a> Hard Cola and in the UK <a href="WKD%20Original%20Vodka">WKD Original Vodka</a>.

The Australian government increased the tax on these drinks under the <a href="2008%20Australian%20federal%20budget">2008 budget</a> to the same rate as spirits, volumetrically, in an effort to stop <a href="binge%20drinking">binge drinking</a>. The tax was criticized by the opposition as a tax grab, and voted down in the Senate on March 18, 2009. Before its rejection, the tax had already raised at least A$290 million after April 2008. In April 2009, some Labor party MPs planned to resubmit the tax to the Senate, and it was finally approved in August 2009, increasing the cost of the drinks from $39 to $66 a litre. A 2013 study concluded that the tax had no impact on binge drinking of the drinks by teenagers.

On 1 July 2004 the German government increased the tax on mixed drinks based on spirits (e.g. vodka, rum) by roughly one Euro per 275-ml-bottle in order to discourage teenagers drinking excessively, although those drinks were already prohibited for those under the age of 18. This had two implications: The most common alcopops, such as <a href="Smirnoff%20Ice">Smirnoff Ice</a> or <a href="Bacardi%20Breezer">Bacardi Breezer</a>, were nearly taken off the market, while other manufacturers changed the recipes of their drinks to replace spirit alcohols with wine or beer, but with the same <a href="Alcohol%20by%20volume">ABV</a>, enabling these mixed drinks (which are not "alcopops" under German law) to be sold legally to minors 16 and 17 years of age.

In South Africa, "spirit coolers" cannot be sold to persons under the age of 18. They are only sold at liquor stores.

In June 1997, <a href="Co-op%20Food">Co-op Food</a> became the first major retailer to place an outright ban on the sale of alcopops in its shops. This has since been rescinded. 

In the UK <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health">Secretary of State for Health</a>, <a href="Patricia%20Hewitt">Patricia Hewitt</a> called for a tax increase on such products, although this had not yet happened as of October 2013.

Alkali

In <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, an alkali (; from <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>: "al-qaly" القلي, القالي, “ashes of the saltwort”) is a <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a>, <a href="ionic%20compound">ionic</a> <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a> of an <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali metal</a> or <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a> <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>. An alkali also can be defined as a base that dissolves in <a href="water">water</a>. A solution of a soluble base has a <a href="pH">pH</a> greater than 7.0. The <a href="adjective">adjective</a> alkaline is commonly, and alkalescent less often, used in <a href="English%20language">English</a> as a <a href="synonym">synonym</a> for basic, especially for bases soluble in water. This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the <a href="acid-base%20reaction%20theories%23Arrhenius%20theory">Arrhenius</a> definition of a base, and they are still among the most common bases.

The word "alkali" is derived from Arabic "al qalīy" (or "alkali"), meaning "the calcined ashes" (see <a href="calcination">calcination</a>), referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burned plant ashes, called <a href="potash">potash</a> and composed mostly of potassium carbonate, was mildly basic. After heating this substance with <a href="calcium%20hydroxide">calcium hydroxide</a> ("slaked lime"), a far more strongly basic substance known as "caustic potash" (<a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>) was produced. Caustic potash was traditionally used in conjunction with animal fats to produce soft <a href="soap">soap</a>s, one of the caustic processes that rendered soaps from fats in the process of <a href="saponification">saponification</a>, one known since antiquity. Plant potash lent the name to the element <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, which was first derived from caustic potash, and also gave potassium its chemical symbol K (from the German name Kalium), which ultimately derived from alkali.

Alkalis are all Arrhenius bases, ones which form hydroxide ions (OH) when dissolved in water. Common properties of alkaline aqueous <a href="solution">solution</a>s include:

The terms "base" and "alkali" are often used interchangeably, particularly outside of the context of <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="chemical%20engineering">chemical engineering</a>.

There are various more specific definitions for the concept of an alkali. Alkalis are usually defined as a subset of the bases. One of two subsets is commonly chosen.

The second subset of bases is also called an "Arrhenius base".

Alkali salts are soluble hydroxides of <a href="alkali%20metals">alkali metals</a> and <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metals">alkaline earth metals</a>, of which common examples are:


Soils with pH values that are higher than 7.3 are usually defined as being alkaline. These soils can occur naturally, due to the presence of alkali salts. Although many plants do prefer slightly basic soil (including vegetables like <a href="cabbage">cabbage</a> and fodder like <a href="buffalograss">buffalograss</a>), most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil (with pHs between 6.0 and 6.8), and <a href="alkaline%20soil">alkaline soil</a>s can cause problems.

In <a href="Soda%20lake">alkali lake</a>s (also called "soda lakes"), evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring carbonate salts, giving rise to an alkalic and often saline lake.

Ain't I a Woman? (book)

Ain't I a Woman?: Black women and feminism is a 1981 book by <a href="bell%20hooks">bell hooks</a> titled after <a href="Sojourner%20Truth">Sojourner Truth</a>'s "<a href="Ain%27t%20I%20a%20Woman%3F">Ain't I a Woman?</a>" speech. hooks examines the effect of <a href="racism">racism</a> and <a href="sexism">sexism</a> on black women, the <a href="civil%20right">civil right</a>s movement, and <a href="feminist">feminist</a> movements from <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> to the 1970s. She argues that the convergence of sexism and racism during slavery contributed to black women having the lowest status and worst conditions of any group in American society. White female <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionists</a> and suffragists were often more comfortable with black male abolitionists such as <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, while southern <a href="Racial%20segregation">segregationalists</a> and stereotypes of black <a href="female%20promiscuity">female promiscuity</a> and immorality caused protests whenever black women spoke. hooks points out that these white female reformers were more concerned with white morality than the conditions these morals caused black Americans.

Further, she argues that the stereotypes that were set during slavery still affect black women today. She argued that slavery allowed white society to <a href="stereotype">stereotype</a> white women as the pure goddess <a href="virgin">virgin</a> and move black women to the seductive whore stereotype formerly placed on all women, thus justifying the devaluation of black femininity and rape of black women. The work which black women have been forced to perform, either in slavery or in a discriminatory workplace, that would be non-gender conforming for white women has been used against black women as a proof of their emasculating behaviour. bell hooks argues that <a href="black%20nationalism">black nationalism</a> was largely a patriarchal and <a href="misogynist">misogynist</a> movement, seeking to overcome racial divisions by strengthening sexist ones, and that it readily latched onto the idea of the emasculating black "<a href="matriarch">matriarch</a>" proposed by <a href="Daniel%20Patrick%20Moynihan">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</a>, whose theories bell hooks often criticizes.

Meanwhile, she says, the "feminist movement", a largely white middle and upper class affair, did not articulate the needs of poor and non-white women, thus reinforcing sexism, racism, and <a href="classism">classism</a>. She suggests this explains the low numbers of black women who participated in the feminist movement in the 1970s, pointing to <a href="Louis%20Harris">Louis Harris</a>' <a href="Virginia%20Slims">Virginia Slims</a> poll done in 1972 for <a href="Philip%20Morris%20USA">Philip Morris</a> that she says showed 62 percent of black women supported "efforts to change women's status" and 67 percent "sympathized with the women's rights movement", compared with 45 and 35 percent of white women (also Steinem, 1972). 

The book is commonly used in gender studies, Black studies, and philosophy courses.

AMOS (programming language)

AMOS BASIC is a dialect of the <a href="BASIC">BASIC</a> <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a> implemented on the <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> computer. AMOS BASIC was published by <a href="Europress%20Software">Europress Software</a> and originally written by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lionet">François Lionet</a> with <a href="Constantin%20Sotiropoulos">Constantin Sotiropoulos</a>.

AMOS is a descendant of <a href="STOS%20BASIC">STOS BASIC</a> for the <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a>. AMOS BASIC was first produced in 1990.

AMOS competed on the Amiga platform with Acid Software's <a href="Blitz%20BASIC">Blitz BASIC</a>. Both BASICs differed from other dialects on different platforms, in that they allowed the easy creation of fairly demanding multimedia software, with full structured code and many high-level functions to load images, animations, sounds and display them in various ways.

The original AMOS version was <a href="interpreter%20%28computing%29">interpreted</a> which, whilst working fine, suffered the same disadvantage of any language being run interpretively. By all accounts, AMOS was extremely fast among interpreted languages. The language was fast enough that an extension called AMOS 3D could produce playable 3D games even on plain 7 MHz Amigas. Later, an AMOS <a href="compiler">compiler</a> was developed that further increased speed.

AMOS could also include inline Assembly Language.

To simplify animation of sprites, AMOS included the AMOS Animation Language (AMAL), a compiled sprite scripting language which runs independently of the main AMOS BASIC program. It was also possible to control screen and "rainbow" effects using AMAL scripts. AMAL scripts in effect created CopperLists, small routines executed by the Amiga's Agnus chip.

After the original version of AMOS, Europress released a compiler (AMOS Compiler), and two other versions of the language: Easy AMOS, a simpler version for beginners, and AMOS Professional, a more advanced version with added features, such as a better <a href="Integrated%20development%20environment">IDE</a>, <a href="ARexx">ARexx</a> support, a new <a href="user%20interface">UI</a> API and new <a href="control%20flow">flow control constructs</a>. Neither of these new versions was significantly more popular than the original AMOS.

AMOS was mostly used to make multimedia software, <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s (platformers and graphical adventures) and educational software.

The language was mildly successful within the Amiga community. Its ease of use made it especially attractive to beginners.

Perhaps AMOS BASIC's biggest disadvantage, stemming from its Atari ST lineage, was its incompatibility with the Amiga's <a href="AmigaOS">operating system</a> functions and interfaces. Instead, AMOS BASIC controlled the computer directly, which caused programs written in it to have a non-standard user interface, and also caused compatibility problems with newer versions of the operating system.

Today the language has declined in popularity along with the Amiga computer for which it was written. Despite this, a small community of enthusiasts are still using it. The <a href="source%20code">source code</a> to AMOS has been around 2001 released under a <a href="BSD%20licenses">BSD style license</a> by <a href="Clickteam">Clickteam</a> - a company that includes the original programmer.

Arcadia 2001

Arcadia 2001 is a second-generation <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a> console released by <a href="Emerson%20Radio">Emerson Radio</a> in 1982 following the release of <a href="ColecoVision">ColecoVision</a>. It was discontinued only 18 months later, with a total of 35 games having been released. Emerson licensed the Arcadia 2001 to Bandai, which released it in Japan. Over 30 Arcadia 2001 clones exist.

The unrelated Arcadia Corporation, manufacturer of the Atari 2600 <a href="Starpath%20Supercharger">Supercharger</a> add-on, was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement. Arcadia Corporation then changed its name to <a href="Starpath">Starpath</a>.

The Arcadia is much smaller than its contemporary competitors and is powered by a standard 12-volt power supply so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. It also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.

The system came with two <a href="Intellivision">Intellivision</a>-style controllers with a 12 button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides. The direction pads have a removable joystick attachment. Most games came with <a href="BoPET">BoPET</a> overlays that could be applied to the controller's keypads. The console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.

There are at least three different types of cartridge case styles and artwork, with variations on each. Emerson-family cartridges come in two different lengths (short and long) of black plastic cases.


Emerson actually created many popular arcade titles including "<a href="Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a>", "<a href="Galaxian">Galaxian</a>" and "<a href="Defender%20%28video%20game%29">Defender</a>" for the Arcadia, but never had them manufactured as Atari started to sue its competitor companies for releasing games to which it had exclusive-rights agreements. Early marketing showed popular arcade games, but they were later released as clones. For instance, the Arcadia 2001 game "Space Raiders" is a clone of "Defender", and "Breakaway" is a clone of "<a href="Breakout%20clone">Breakout</a>".

In 1982 the Bandai Arcadia, a variant of the Emerson Arcadia 2001, was released in Japan by Bandai. There were four Japan-exclusive game releases developed by Bandai which were the only known Arcadia titles written by other companies than UA Ltd.


Some games for the Arcadia 2001 are ports of lesser-known arcade games such as "Route 16", "Jungler", and "Jump Bug", which were not available on other home systems.

This allows multiple constructions of the same honeycombs. If cells are colored based on unique positions within each Wythoff construction, these different symmetries can be shown.

In addition there are 5 special honeycombs which don't have pure reflectional symmetry and are constructed from reflectional forms with "elongation" and "gyration" operations.

The total unique honeycombs above are 18.

The prismatic stacks from infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:

In addition there is one special "elongated" form of the triangular prismatic honeycomb.

The total unique prismatic honeycombs above (excluding the cubic counted previously) are 10.

Combining these counts, 18 and 10 gives us the total 28 uniform honeycombs.

The regular cubic honeycomb, represented by Schläfli symbol {4,3,4}, offers seven unique derived uniform honeycombs via truncation operations. (One redundant form, the "runcinated cubic honeycomb", is included for completeness though identical to the cubic honeycomb.) The reflectional symmetry is the affine <a href="Coxeter%20group">Coxeter group</a> [4,3,4]. There are four index 2 subgroups that generate alternations: [1,4,3,4], [(4,3,4,2)], [4,3,4], and [4,3,4], with the first two generated repeated forms, and the last two are nonuniform.

The formula_2, [4,3] group offers 11 derived forms via truncation operations, four being unique uniform honeycombs. There are 3 index 2 subgroups that generate alternations: [1,4,3], [4,(3)], and [4,3]. The first generates repeated honeycomb, and the last two are nonuniform but included for completeness.

The honeycombs from this group are called "alternated cubic" because the first form can be seen as a "cubic honeycomb" with alternate vertices removed, reducing cubic cells to tetrahedra and creating octahedron cells in the gaps.

Nodes are indexed left to right as "0,1,0',3" with 0' being below and interchangeable with "0". The "alternate cubic" names given are based on this ordering.

There are 5 forms constructed from the formula_3, [3] <a href="Coxeter%20group">Coxeter group</a>, of which only the "quarter cubic honeycomb" is unique. There is one index 2 subgroup [3] which generates the snub form, which is not uniform, but included for completeness.

Three more uniform honeycombs are generated by breaking one or another of the above honeycombs where its faces form a continuous plane, then rotating alternate layers by 60 or 90 degrees ("gyration") and/or inserting a layer of prisms ("elongation").

The elongated and gyroelongated alternated cubic tilings have the same vertex figure, but are not alike. In the "elongated" form, each prism meets a tetrahedron at one triangular end and an octahedron at the other. In the "gyroelongated" form, prisms that meet tetrahedra at both ends alternate with prisms that meet octahedra at both ends.

The gyroelongated triangular prismatic tiling has the same vertex figure as one of the plain prismatic tilings; the two may be derived from the gyrated and plain triangular prismatic tilings, respectively, by inserting layers of cubes.

Eleven prismatic tilings are obtained by stacking the eleven <a href="tiling%20by%20regular%20polygons">uniform plane tilings</a>, shown below, in parallel layers. (One of these honeycombs is the cubic, shown above.) The <a href="vertex%20figure">vertex figure</a> of each is an irregular <a href="bipyramid">bipyramid</a> whose faces are <a href="isosceles%20triangle">isosceles triangle</a>s.

There are only 3 unique honeycombs from the square tiling, but all 6 tiling truncations are listed below for completeness, and tiling images are shown by colors corresponding to each form.

All nonprismatic <a href="Wythoff%20construction">Wythoff construction</a>s by Coxeter groups are given below, along with their <a href="alternation%20%28geometry%29">alternations</a>. Uniform solutions are indexed with <a href="Branko%20Gr%C3%BCnbaum">Branko Grünbaum</a>'s listing. Green backgrounds are shown on repeated honeycombs, with the relations are expressed in the extended symmetry diagrams.
All 28 of these tessellations are found in <a href="crystal">crystal</a> arrangements.

The <a href="tetrahedral-octahedral%20honeycomb">alternated cubic honeycomb</a> is of special importance since its vertices form a cubic <a href="close-packing">close-packing</a> of spheres. The space-filling <a href="truss">truss</a> of packed octahedra and tetrahedra was apparently first discovered by <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> and independently re-discovered by <a href="Buckminster%20Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a> (who called it the <a href="octet%20truss">octet truss</a> and patented it in the 1940s).
<a href="http%3A//tabletoptelephone.com/%7Ehopspage/Fuller.html"></a>
<a href="http%3A//members.cruzio.com/%7Edevarco/energy.htm"></a>
<a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20050113123708/http%3A//www.n55.dk/manuals/DISCUSSIONS/OTHER_TEXTS/CM_TEXT.html"></a>
<a href="http%3A//www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-2.html"></a>. Octet trusses are now among the most common types of truss used in construction.
If <a href="Cell%20%28mathematics%29">cells</a> are allowed to be <a href="uniform%20tiling">uniform tiling</a>s, more uniform honeycombs can be defined:

Families:

A <a href="scaliform%20polytope">scaliform</a> honeycomb is <a href="vertex-transitive">vertex-transitive</a>, like a "uniform honeycomb", with regular polygon faces while cells and higher elements are only required to be "orbiforms", equilateral, with their vertices lying on hyperspheres. For 3D honeycombs, this allows a subset of <a href="Johnson%20solid">Johnson solid</a>s along with the uniform polyhedra. Some scaliforms can be generated by an alternation process, leaving, for example, <a href="pyramid%20%28geometry%29">pyramid</a> and <a href="cupola%20%28geometry%29">cupola</a> gaps.

There are 9 <a href="Coxeter%20group">Coxeter group</a> families of compact uniform honeycombs in <a href="Hyperbolic%20space">hyperbolic 3-space</a>, generated as <a href="Wythoff%20construction">Wythoff construction</a>s, and represented by ring permutations of the <a href="Coxeter-Dynkin%20diagram">Coxeter-Dynkin diagram</a>s for each family.

From these 9 families, there are a total of 76 unique honeycombs generated:

The full list of hyperbolic uniform honeycombs has not been proven and an unknown number of <a href="non-Wythoffian">non-Wythoffian</a> forms exist. One known example is in the {3,5,3} family.

There are also 23 paracompact Coxeter groups of rank 4. These families can produce uniform honeycombs with unbounded facets or vertex figure, including ideal vertices at infinity:

Assassination

Assassination is the <a href="murder">murder</a> of a prominent person when executed by a third party or assassin, often a political leader or ruler, usually for political reasons or payment.

An assassination may be prompted by religious, political, or military <a href="Motive%20%28law%29">motives</a>; it is an act that may be done for <a href="contract%20killing">financial gain</a>, to <a href="revenge">avenge</a> a grievance, from a desire to acquire <a href="celebrity">fame</a> or <a href="infamy">notoriety</a>, or because of a military, security or insurgent group's command to carry out the <a href="homicide">homicide</a>.

The word "assassin" is often believed to derive from the word "<a href="Hashshashin">Hashshashin</a>" (Arabic: حشّاشين, ħashshāshīyīn, also Hashishin, Hashashiyyin, or <a href="Assassins">Assassins</a>), and shares its etymological roots with "<a href="hashish">hashish</a>" ( or ; from <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>: ""). It referred to a group of <a href="Nizari">Nizari</a> <a href="Shia">Shia</a> <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a> who worked against various <a href="Arabs">Arab</a> and <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> <a href="Targeting%20%28warfare%29">targets</a>.

Founded by the <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> <a href="Hassan-i%20Sabbah">Hassan-i Sabbah</a>, the Assassins were active in the fortress of <a href="Alamut">Alamut</a> in Iran from the 8th to the 14th centuries, and also controlled the castle of <a href="Masyaf">Masyaf</a> in Syria. The group killed members of the <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a>, <a href="Abbasid">Abbasid</a>, <a href="Seljuq%20dynasty">Seljuq</a>, and <a href="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="Crusades">Crusader</a> elite for political and religious reasons.

Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of <a href="hashish">hashish</a> during their killings or during their indoctrination, there is debate as to whether these claims have merit, with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name. 

The earliest known use of the verb "to assassinate" in printed English was by <a href="Matthew%20Sutcliffe">Matthew Sutcliffe</a> in "A Briefe Replie to a Certaine Odious and Slanderous Libel, Lately Published by a Seditious Jesuite", a pamphlet printed in 1600, five years before it was used in "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>" by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> (1605).

The word for "<a href="murder">murder</a>" in many <a href="Romance%20language">Romance language</a>s is derived from this same root word (see <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> "asesinado").

Assassination is one of the oldest tools of <a href="power%20politics">power politics</a>. It dates back at least as far as recorded history.

In the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, King <a href="Jehoash%20of%20Judah">Joash</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> was recorded as being assassinated by his own servants; <a href="Joab">Joab</a> assassinated <a href="Absalom">Absalom</a>, <a href="King%20David">King David</a>'s son; and King <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a> of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons.

<a href="Chanakya">Chanakya</a> (c. 350–283 BC) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise "<a href="Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a>". His student <a href="Chandragupta%20Maurya">Chandragupta Maurya</a>, the founder of the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Maurya Empire</a>, later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies, including two of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>'s generals, <a href="Nicanor%20%28satrap%29">Nicanor</a> and <a href="Philip%20%28son%20of%20Machatas%29">Philip.</a> Other famous victims are <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a> (336 BC), the father of Alexander the Great, and Roman consul <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> (44 BC). <a href="Emperors%20of%20Rome">Emperors of Rome</a> often met their end in this way, as did many of the Muslim <a href="Shia%20Imam">Shia Imam</a>s hundreds of years later. The practice was also well known in ancient China, as in <a href="Jing%20Ke">Jing Ke</a>'s failed assassination of <a href="Qin%20%28state%29">Qin</a> king <a href="Qin%20Shi%20Huang">Ying Zheng</a> in 227 BC. Whilst many assassination were performed by an individual or a small group, there were also specialized units who used a collective group of people to perform more than one assassination. The earliest were the <a href="sicarii">sicarii</a> in 6 A.D., who predated the Middle Eastern <a href="assassins">assassins</a> and Japanese <a href="ninja">ninja</a>s by centuries.

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, <a href="regicide">regicide</a> was rare in Western Europe, but it was a recurring theme in the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>. Blinding and strangling in the bathtub were the most commonly used procedures. With the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, <a href="tyrannicide">tyrannicide</a>—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe. High medieval sources mention the assassination of King <a href="Demetrius%20Zvonimir%20of%20Croatia">Demetrius Zvonimir</a> (1089), dying at the hands of his own people, who objected to a proposition by the Pope to go on a campaign to aid the <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a>s against the <a href="Seljuq%20dynasty">Seljuk</a> Turks. This account is, however, contentious among historians, it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes. The myth of the "Curse of King Zvonimir" is based on the legend of his assassination. In 1192, <a href="Conrad%20of%20Montferrat">Conrad of Montferrat</a>, the "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" <a href="King%20of%20Jerusalem">King of Jerusalem</a>, was killed by an <a href="Assassins">assassin</a>.

The reigns of King <a href="Przemys%C5%82%20II">Przemysł II</a> of Poland (1296), <a href="William%20the%20Silent">William the Silent</a> of the Netherlands (1584), and the French kings <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20France">Henry III</a> (1589) and <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV</a> (1610) were all ended by assassins.

In the modern world, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the <a href="propaganda%20of%20the%20deed">propaganda of the deed</a>. In <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Russia</a> alone, two emperors, <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul I</a> and his grandson <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II</a>, were assassinated within 80 years. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, only one <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a> has ever been assassinated—<a href="Assassination%20of%20Spencer%20Perceval">Spencer Perceval</a> on May 11, 1812.

In Japan, a group of assassins called the <a href="Four%20Hitokiri%20of%20the%20Bakumatsu">Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu</a> killed a number of people, including <a href="Ii%20Naosuke">Ii Naosuke</a> who was the head of administration for the Tokugawa shogunate, during the <a href="Boshin%20War">Boshin War</a>. Most of the assassinations in Japan were committed with bladed weaponry, a trait that was carried on into modern history as seen during the assassination of <a href="Inejiro%20Asanuma">Inejiro Asanuma</a> on live television using a sword.

In the United States, within 100 years, four presidents—<a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20assassination">Abraham Lincoln</a>, <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield%20assassination">James Garfield</a>, <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>, and <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination">John F. Kennedy</a>—died at the hands of assassins. There have been at least <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20presidential%20assassination%20attempts">20 known attempts</a> on U.S. presidents' lives. <a href="Huey%20Long">Huey Long</a>, a Senator, was assassinated in September 1935. <a href="Robert%20Kennedy">Robert Kennedy</a>, a Senator and a presidential candidate, was also assassinated in June 1968 in the US.

In Austria, the <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> and his wife <a href="Sophie%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Hohenberg">Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg</a>, in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 was carried out by <a href="Gavrilo%20Princip">Gavrilo Princip</a>, a Serbian national and a member of the <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>n nationalist <a href="Insurgency">insurgents</a> (<a href="Black%20Hand%20%28Serbia%29">The Black Hand</a>) is blamed for igniting <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> after a succession of minor conflicts, while belligerents on both sides in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> used operatives specifically trained for assassination. <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a> died after an attack by British-trained Czechoslovak soldiers on behalf of the Czechoslovak government in exile in <a href="Operation%20Anthropoid">Operation Anthropoid</a>, and knowledge from decoded transmissions allowed the U.S. to carry out <a href="Death%20of%20Isoroku%20Yamamoto">a targeted attack</a>, killing Japanese <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a> while he was travelling by plane. The Polish <a href="Armia%20Krajowa">Home Army</a> conducted a regular <a href="Operation%20Heads">campaign of assassinations</a> against top Nazi German officials in occupied Poland. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, meanwhile, was almost <a href="July%2020%20Plot">killed by his own officers</a>, and survived various attempts by other persons and organizations (such as <a href="Operation%20Foxley">Operation Foxley</a>, though this plan was never put into practice).

During the 1930s and 1940s <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> carried out numerous assassinations outside of the Soviet Union, such as the killings of <a href="Organization%20of%20Ukrainian%20Nationalists">Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists</a> leader <a href="Yevhen%20Konovalets">Yevhen Konovalets</a>, <a href="Ignace%20Poretsky">Ignace Poretsky</a>, <a href="Fourth%20International">Fourth International</a> secretary Rudolf Klement, <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (<a href="POUM">POUM</a>) leadership in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>.

India's "Father of the Nation," <a href="Mohandas%20K.%20Gandhi">Mohandas K. Gandhi</a>, was <a href="Assassination%20of%20Mohandas%20Karamchand%20Gandhi">shot to death</a> on January 30, 1948, by <a href="Nathuram%20Godse">Nathuram Godse</a>.

The American <a href="civil%20rights%20activist">civil rights activist</a>, <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> was assassinated on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel (now the <a href="National%20Civil%20Rights%20Museum">National Civil Rights Museum</a>) in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. Three years prior, another civil African-American civil rights activist, <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>, was assassinated at the <a href="Audubon%20Ballroom">Audubon Ballroom</a> on February 21, 1965. <a href="Fred%20Hampton">Fred Hampton</a> of the <a href="Black%20Panther%20Party">Black Panther Party</a> was assassinated on December 4, 1969.

<a href="Liaquat%20Ali%20Khan">Liaquat Ali Khan</a>, the first <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Pakistan">Prime Minister of Pakistan</a>, was assassinated by <a href="Saad%20Akbar">Saad Akbar</a>, a lone assassin, in 1951. Conspiracy theorists believe his conflict with certain members of the Pakistani military (Rawalpindi conspiracy) or suppression of Communists and antagonism towards the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, were potential reasons for his assassination.

In 1960, <a href="Inejiro%20Asanuma">Inejiro Asanuma</a>, Chairman of the <a href="Japan%20Socialist%20Party">Japanese Socialist Party</a>, was assassinated in a stabbing by an extreme rightist.

The U.S. Senate Select Committee chaired by Senator <a href="Frank%20Church">Frank Church</a> (the <a href="Church%20Committee">Church Committee</a>) reported in 1975 that it had found "concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro from 1960 to 1965."

Most major powers repudiated Cold War assassination tactics, though many allege that this was merely a smokescreen for political benefit and that covert and illegal training of assassins continues today, with Russia, <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, the U.S., <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, Paraguay, <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, and other nations accused of engaging in such operations. In 1986, U.S. President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> (who survived an assassination attempt himself) ordered the <a href="Operation%20El%20Dorado%20Canyon">Operation El Dorado Canyon</a> air raid on <a href="History%20of%20Libya%20under%20Muammar%20Gaddafi%23Great%20Socialist%20People%27s%20Libyan%20Arab%20Jamahiriya%20%281977%E2%80%932012%29">Libya</a> in which one of the primary targets was the home residence of Libyan ruler <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>. Gaddafi escaped unharmed; however, his adopted daughter <a href="Bombing%20of%20Libya%20%28April%201986%29%23Casualties">Hanna</a> was claimed to be one of the civilian casualties.

In the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Philippines%20%281965%E2%80%931986%29%23The%20Fourth%20Republic%20%281981%E2%80%931986%29">Philippines</a>, the assassination of <a href="Benigno%20Aquino%2C%20Jr.">Benigno Aquino, Jr.</a> triggered the eventual downfall of the 20-year autocratic rule of <a href="President%20of%20the%20Philippines">President</a> <a href="Ferdinand%20Marcos">Ferdinand Marcos</a>. Aquino, a former <a href="Senate%20of%20the%20Philippines">Senator</a> and a leading figure of the political opposition, was assassinated in 1983 at the <a href="Manila">Manila</a> <a href="International%20Airport">International Airport</a> (now the <a href="Ninoy%20Aquino%20International%20Airport">Ninoy Aquino International Airport</a>) upon returning home from <a href="exile">exile</a>. His death thrust his widow, <a href="Corazon%20Aquino">Corazon Aquino</a>, into the limelight and, ultimately, the presidency following the peaceful <a href="People%20Power%20Revolution">1986 EDSA Revolution</a>.

After the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a> of 1979, the new Islamic government of Iran began an international campaign of assassination that lasted into the 1990s. At least 162 killings in 19 countries have been linked to the senior leadership of the <a href="Islamic%20Republic%20of%20Iran">Islamic Republic of Iran</a>. This campaign came to an end after the <a href="Mykonos%20restaurant%20assassinations">Mykonos restaurant assassinations</a>, because a German court publicly implicated senior members of the government and issued arrest warrants for <a href="Ali%20Fallahian">Ali Fallahian</a>, the head of the Iranian Intelligence. Evidence indicates that Fallahian's personal involvement and individual responsibility for the murders were far more pervasive than his current indictment record represents.

<a href="Anwar%20Sadat">Anwar Sadat</a>, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt (formerly President of the United Arab Republic), was assassinated October 6, 1981, during the annual parade celebrating <a href="Operation%20Badr%20%281973%29">Operation Badr</a>, the opening maneuver of the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a>.

Swedish prime minister <a href="Olof%20Palme">Olof Palme</a> was murdered by a gun-wielding man close to midnight on 28 February 1986, after having visited a cinema with his wife. The couple were not accompanied by a body guard detail. The identity of the assassin and the reason for the murder are still unknown.

On August 17, 1988, President of <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> Gen. M. <a href="Zia%20ul%20Haq">Zia ul Haq</a> <a href="Death%20of%20Zia-ul-Haq">died alongside 31 others</a> including the Chief of Staff of the Pakistani Armed Forces, the US Ambassador to Pakistan and the chief of the US Military Mission to Pakistan when his <a href="C-130">C-130</a> transport plane mysteriously crashed. The crash is widely considered – in Pakistan – to be an act of political assassination.

In post-Saddam <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, the Shiite-dominated government used death squads to perform <a href="Extra-judicial%20killing">extrajudicial executions</a> of radical <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> Iraqis, with some alleging that the death squads were trained by the U.S. Concrete allegations have since surfaced that the Iranian government has actively armed and funded Shia death-squads in post-Saddam Iraq.
In India, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20India">Prime Ministers</a> <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> and her son <a href="Rajiv%20Gandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</a> (neither of whom were related to <a href="Mohandas%20Gandhi">Mohandas Gandhi</a>, who was assassinated in 1948), were assassinated in 1984 and 1991 respectively. The assassinations were linked to <a href="Separatism">separatist</a> movements in <a href="Punjab%2C%20India">Punjab</a> and northern <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, respectively.

In <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, Prime Minister <a href="Yitzhak%20Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a> was assassinated on November 4, 1995. <a href="Yigal%20Amir">Yigal Amir</a> confessed and was convicted of the crime.

Israeli tourist minister <a href="Rehavam%20Ze%27evi">Rehavam Ze'evi</a> was assassinated on October 17, 2001, by <a href="Hamdi%20Quran">Hamdi Quran</a> and three other members of the <a href="Popular%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Palestine%20%28PFLP%29">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a>. The PFLP stated that the assassination was in retaliation for the August 27, 2001, killing of <a href="Abu%20Ali%20Mustafa">Abu Ali Mustafa</a>, the Secretary General of the PFLP, by the <a href="Israeli%20Air%20Force">Israeli Air Force</a> under its policy of <a href="Israeli%20targeted%20killings">targeted killings</a>.

In <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, the assassination of former Prime Minister <a href="Rafik%20Hariri">Rafik Hariri</a> on February 14, 2005, prompted an investigation by the United Nations. The suggestion in the resulting "<a href="Mehlis%20report">Mehlis report</a>" that there was <a href="Syria">Syria</a>n involvement, prompted the <a href="Cedar%20Revolution">Cedar Revolution</a>, which drove Syrian troops out of Lebanon.

In <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, former prime minister and opposition leader <a href="Benazir%20Bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a> was <a href="Benazir%20Bhutto%20assassination">assassinated in 2007</a>, while running for re-election. Bhutto's assassination drew unanimous <a href="International%20reaction%20to%20the%20Benazir%20Bhutto%20assassination">condemnation from the international community</a>.

In <a href="Guinea%20Bissau">Guinea Bissau</a>, President <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Bernardo%20Vieira">João Bernardo Vieira</a> was assassinated in the early hours of March 2, 2009, in the capital, <a href="Bissau">Bissau</a>. Unlike typical assassinations his death was not swift; he first survived an explosion at the Presidential Villa, was then shot and wounded, and finally was butchered with machetes. His assassination was carried out by renegade soldiers who were apparently revenging the killing of General <a href="Tagme%20Na%20Waie">Tagme Na Waie</a>, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Guinea Bissau, who had been killed in a bomb explosion the day before.

Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused – <a href="Sun%20Tzu">Sun Tzu</a>, writing around 500 BC, argued in favor of using assassination in his book "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20War">The Art of War</a>". Nearly 2000 years later, in his book "<a href="The%20Prince">The Prince</a>", <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a> also argued assassination could be useful. An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a <a href="cult%20of%20personality">particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader</a>, whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war. 

For similar and additional reasons, assassination has also sometimes been used in the conduct of <a href="foreign%20policy">foreign policy</a>. The costs and benefits of such actions are difficult to compute, especially when they depend upon the policies of a successor, and one study has found that perceptual biases held by leaders often negatively affect decision making in this area, such that decisions made to go forward with assassinations often reflect the vague hope that any successor might be better.

In both military and foreign policy assassinations, there is the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader, or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will "<a href="Martyr%20%28politics%29">martyr</a>" a leader and lead to greater support of his or her cause (by showing the moral ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian <a href="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a> during the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>. A number of additional examples from <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> show how assassination was used as a tool:


Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:

Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.

The <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281917%E2%80%9322%29">Irish Republican Army</a> guerrillas of 1919–21 killed many <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Constabulary">RIC</a> Police Intelligence officers during the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>. <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28Irish%20leader%29">Michael Collins</a> set up a special unit – <a href="The%20Squad%20%28IRA%20unit%29">the Squad</a> – for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> on <a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%281920%29">Bloody Sunday</a> in 1920.

This tactic was used again by the <a href="Provisional%20IRA">Provisional IRA</a> during <a href="the%20Troubles">the Troubles</a> in Northern Ireland (1969–1998). Killing of <a href="Royal%20Ulster%20Constabulary">RUC</a> officers and assassination of RUC politicians was one of a number of methods used in the <a href="Provisional%20IRA%20campaign%201969%E2%80%931997">Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997</a>. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> by <a href="Brighton%20hotel%20bombing">bombing the Conservative Party Conference</a> in a <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> hotel. <a href="Ulster%20loyalism">Loyalist paramilitaries</a> retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating <a href="Irish%20nationalist">Irish nationalist</a> politicians.

<a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> terrorists <a href="ETA%20%28separatist%20group%29">ETA</a> in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably <a href="Luis%20Carrero%20Blanco">Luis Carrero Blanco</a>, 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.

The <a href="Red%20Brigades">Red Brigades</a> in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the <a href="Red%20Army%20Faction">Red Army Faction</a> in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem">Diem</a> regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.

A major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.

However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be <a href="delusion">delusion</a>al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.

It seems likely that the first assassinations would have been direct and simple: <a href="stabbing">stabbing</a>, <a href="strangle">strangling</a> or <a href="bludgeon%20%28weapon%29">bludgeoning</a>. The key technique was likely <a href="Infiltration%20tactics">infiltration</a>, with the actual assassination by stabbing, <a href="smothering">smothering</a> or <a href="strangulation">strangulation</a>. <a href="Poison">Poison</a>s also started to be used in many forms.

In ancient Rome, paid mobs were sometimes used to beat political enemies to death.

With the advent of effective <a href="ranged%20weaponry">ranged weaponry</a>, and later <a href="firearm">firearm</a>s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. <a href="Bodyguard">Bodyguard</a>s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival. The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the <a href="James%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Moray">Regent Moray of Scotland</a> in 1570, and <a href="William%20the%20Silent">William the Silent</a>, the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584. <a href="Gunpowder">Gunpowder</a> and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.

Explosives, especially the <a href="car%20bomb">car bomb</a>, become far more common in modern history, with <a href="grenade">grenade</a>s and remote-triggered <a href="land%20mine">land mine</a>s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a>'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the <a href="rocket-propelled%20grenade">rocket-propelled grenade</a> (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles, as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

A <a href="sniper">sniper</a> with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated <a href="sniper%20rifle">sniper rifle</a> is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.

Despite their comparative disadvantages, <a href="handgun">handgun</a>s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).

In the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. <a href="Georgi%20Markov">Georgi Markov</a>, a <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>n dissident was assassinated by <a href="ricin">ricin</a> poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed <a href="Bulgarian%20umbrella">umbrella</a>. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and <a href="KGB">KGB</a> have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the USSR, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder. The <a href="CIA">CIA</a> made several <a href="Assassination%20attempts%20on%20Fidel%20Castro">attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro</a>, many of the schemes involving poisoning his cigars. In the late 1950s, KGB assassin <a href="Bohdan%20Stashynsky">Bohdan Stashynsky</a> killed Ukrainian nationalist leaders <a href="Lev%20Rebet">Lev Rebet</a> and <a href="Stepan%20Bandera">Stepan Bandera</a> with a spray gun that fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> ampule, making their deaths look like heart attacks. A 2006 case in the UK concerned the <a href="Poisoning%20of%20Alexander%20Litvinenko">assassination of Alexander Litvinenko</a> who was given a lethal dose of radioactive <a href="polonium">polonium</a>-210, possibly passed to him in aerosol form sprayed directly onto his food. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent, had been granted asylum in the UK in 2000 after citing persecution in Russia. Shortly before his death he issued a statement accusing <a href="President%20of%20Russia">President of Russia</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> of involvement in his assassination. President Putin denies he had any part in Litvinenko's death.

Targeted killing is the intentional killing–by a government or its agents–of a civilian or "<a href="unlawful%20combatant">unlawful combatant</a>" who is not in the government's custody. The target is a person asserted to be taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the <a href="Third%20Geneva%20Convention">Third Geneva Convention</a>. Note that this is a different term and concept from that of "targeted violence" as used by specialists who study violence.

On the other hand, <a href="Georgetown%20University%20Law%20Center">Georgetown Law</a> Professor <a href="Gary%20D.%20Solis">Gary Solis</a>, in his 2010 book entitled "The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War", writes: "Assassinations and targeted killings are very different acts". The use of the term assassination is opposed, as it denotes murder, whereas the terrorists are targeted in self-defense, and thus it is viewed as a killing, but not a crime. Judge <a href="Abraham%20D.%20Sofaer">Abraham Sofaer</a>, former federal judge for the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York</a>, wrote on the subject:

When people call a targeted killing an "assassination," they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States ... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests ... But killings in self-defense are no more "assassinations" in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition.

Author and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan has argued that "there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing ... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination. Assassination ... constitutes an illegal killing." Similarly, <a href="Amos%20Guiora">Amos Guiora</a>, professor of law at the University of Utah, writes: "Targeted killing is ... not an assassination", <a href="Steven%20R.%20David">Steve David</a>, Professor of International Relations at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>, writes: "There are strong reasons to believe that the Israeli policy of targeted killing is not the same as assassination". <a href="Syracuse%20University%20College%20of%20Law">Syracuse Law</a> Professor William Banks and <a href="George%20Washington%20University%20Law%20School">GW Law</a> Professor Peter Raven-Hansen write: "Targeted killing of terrorists is ... not unlawful and would not constitute assassination", Rory Miller writes: "Targeted killing ... is not 'assassination'". Associate Professor Eric Patterson and Teresa Casale write: "Perhaps most important is the legal distinction between targeted killing and assassination".

On the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union also states on its website, "A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield."
Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article "By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'":
The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether.

Targeted killing has become a frequent tactic of the United States and Israel in their fight against terrorism. The tactic can raise complex questions and lead to contentious disputes as to the legal basis for its application, who qualifies as an appropriate "hit list" target, and what circumstances must exist before the tactic may be employed. Opinions range from people considering it a legal form of self-defense that reduces terrorism, to people calling it an extra-judicial killing that lacks due process, and which leads to further violence. Methods used have included firing a five-foot-long <a href="Hellfire%20missile">Hellfire missile</a> from a <a href="MQ-1%20Predator">Predator</a> or <a href="MQ-9%20Reaper">Reaper</a> <a href="Unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">drone</a> (an unmanned, remote-controlled plane), detonating a cell phone bomb, and long-range <a href="sniper">sniper</a> shooting. Countries such as the U.S. (in Pakistan and Yemen) and Israel (in the West Bank and Gaza) have used targeted killing to eliminate members of groups such as <a href="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> and <a href="Hamas">Hamas</a>. In early 2010, with President Obama's approval, <a href="Anwar%20al-Awlaki">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> became the first U.S. citizen to be publicly approved for targeted killing by the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA). Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in September 2011.

One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins was employing <a href="bodyguard">bodyguard</a>s. Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way—both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target, and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.

Notable examples of bodyguards include the Roman <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian Guard</a> or the Ottoman <a href="Janissary">Janissaries</a>—though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20India">Indian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>, assassinated by two <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> bodyguards in 1984.

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as <a href="poison">poison</a> (which risk was answered by having <a href="food%20taster">another person taste the leader's food</a> first).

Another notable measure is the use of a <a href="political%20decoy">body double</a>, a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.

With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, <a href="Armored%20car%20%28VIP%29">armored cars or limousines</a> were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to <a href="small%20arms">small arms</a> fire, smaller bombs and <a href="Land%20mine">mines</a>. <a href="Bulletproof%20vest">Bulletproof vest</a>s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected – so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted; potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of <a href="metal%20detector">metal</a> and <a href="Bomb%20disposal">bomb detectors</a>.

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and former <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>i Prime Minister <a href="Benazir%20Bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a>, or as part of <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coups d'état</a> where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a>.
The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear <a href="bulletproof%20glass">bulletproof glass</a>, such as the <a href="Popemobile">Popemobile</a> of <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>, built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer <a href="Salman%20Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>. A related form of protection is the use of <a href="political%20decoy">body doubles</a>, people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate. These persons are then <a href="makeup">made up</a>, and in some cases <a href="plastic%20surgery">altered</a> to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations. According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a> used body doubles.

<a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">United States Secret Service</a> protective agents receive training in the psychology of assassins.

Alcoholism

Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of <a href="alcohol%20%28drug%29">alcohol</a> that results in <a href="Mental%20health">mental</a> or <a href="physical%20health">physical health</a> problems. It was previously divided into two types: <a href="alcohol%20abuse">alcohol abuse</a> and <a href="alcohol%20dependence">alcohol dependence</a>. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, <a href="Alcohol%20withdrawal%20syndrome">withdrawal</a> occurs when stopping, and <a href="alcohol%20tolerance">alcohol tolerance</a> has occurred with use. Risky situations include <a href="driving%20under%20the%20influence">drinking and driving</a> or having <a href="unsafe%20sex">unsafe sex</a> among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a>, and <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>. This can result in <a href="mental%20illness">mental illness</a>, <a href="Wernicke%E2%80%93Korsakoff%20syndrome">Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome</a>, an <a href="arrythmia">irregular heart beat</a>, <a href="cirrhosis">liver failure</a>, and an increase in the risk of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, among other diseases. Drinking during <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> can cause damage to the baby resulting in <a href="fetal%20alcohol%20spectrum%20disorder">fetal alcohol spectrum disorder</a>s. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.
Both environmental factors and genetics are associated with alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High <a href="Stress%20%28biological%29">stress levels</a>, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.
Prevention of alcoholism may be attempted by regulating and limiting the sale of alcohol, <a href="alcohol%20tax">taxing alcohol</a> to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, <a href="alcohol%20detoxification">alcohol detoxification</a> should be carefully controlled. One common method involves the use of <a href="benzodiazepine">benzodiazepine</a> medications, such as <a href="diazepam">diazepam</a>. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other <a href="addiction">addiction</a>s or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as <a href="group%20therapy">group therapy</a> or <a href="support%20group">support group</a>s are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group <a href="Alcoholics%20Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>. The medications <a href="acamprosate">acamprosate</a>, <a href="disulfiram">disulfiram</a>, or <a href="naltrexone">naltrexone</a> may also be used to help prevent further drinking.
The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> estimates that as of 2010 there were 208 million people with alcoholism worldwide (4.1% of the population over 15 years of age). In the United States about 17 million (7%) of adults and 0.7 million (2.8%) of those age 12 to 17 years of age are affected. It is more common among males and young adults, becoming less common in middle and old age. It is the least common in Africa at 1.1% and has the highest rates in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> at 11%. Alcoholism directly resulted in 139,000 deaths in 2013 up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. A total of 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol. It often reduces a person's <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> by around ten years. In the United States it resulted in economic costs of $224 billion USD in 2006. Many terms, some <a href="Pejorative">insulting</a> and others <a href="slang">informal</a>, have been used to refer to people affected by alcoholism including: tippler, drunkard, <a href="dipsomaniac">dipsomaniac</a>, and souse. In 1979, the World Health Organization discouraged the use of "alcoholism" due to its inexact meaning, preferring "alcohol dependence syndrome".
The risk of alcohol dependence begins at low levels of drinking and increases directly with both the volume of alcohol consumed and a pattern of <a href="Binge%20drinking">drinking larger amounts on an occasion</a>, to the point of intoxication, which is sometimes called "binge drinking". Young adults are particularly at risk of engaging in binge drinking.

Alcoholism is characterised by an increased <a href="Alcohol%20tolerance">tolerance</a> to alcohol–which means that an individual can consume more alcohol–and <a href="physical%20dependence">physical dependence</a> on alcohol, which makes it hard for an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depressed mood</a> is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.

Warning signs of alcoholism include the consumption of increasing amounts of alcohol and frequent intoxication, preoccupation with drinking to the exclusion of other activities, promises to quit drinking and failure to keep them, the inability to remember what was said or done while drinking (colloquially known as "blackouts"), personality changes associated with drinking, denial or the making of excuses for drinking, the refusal to admit excessive drinking, dysfunction or other problems at work or school, the loss of interest in personal appearance or hygiene, marital and economic problems, and the complaint of poor health, with loss of appetite, respiratory infections, or increased anxiety.

Drinking enough to cause a <a href="blood%20alcohol%20concentration">blood alcohol concentration</a> (BAC) of 0.03–0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible <a href="euphoria">euphoria</a> (a "happy" feeling), increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a <a href="Alcohol%20flush%20reaction">flushed, red appearance in the face</a> and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes <a href="lethargy">lethargy</a>, <a href="sedation">sedation</a>, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC of 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes <a href="stupor">stupor</a>, unconsciousness, <a href="anterograde%20amnesia">anterograde amnesia</a>, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (<a href="pulmonary%20aspiration">pulmonary aspiration</a>) while unconscious and <a href="respiratory%20depression">respiratory depression</a> (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a <a href="coma">coma</a> (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal <a href="alcohol%20poisoning">alcohol poisoning</a>. With all alcoholic beverages, <a href="drinking%20and%20driving">drinking while driving</a>, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties for drunk driving.

Drinking more than one drink a day for women or two drinks for men increases the risk of heart disease, <a href="high%20blood%20pressure">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="atrial%20fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</a>, and <a href="stroke">stroke</a>. Risk is greater in younger people due to <a href="binge%20drinking">binge drinking</a> which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> of the liver, <a href="pancreatitis">pancreatitis</a>, <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, <a href="polyneuropathy">polyneuropathy</a>, <a href="Wernicke-Korsakoff%20syndrome">alcoholic dementia</a>, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, <a href="Duodenal%20ulcer">peptic ulcers</a> and <a href="sexual%20dysfunction">sexual dysfunction</a>, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing <a href="cardiovascular%20disease">cardiovascular disease</a>, <a href="malabsorption">malabsorption</a>, <a href="alcoholic%20liver%20disease">alcoholic liver disease</a>, and <a href="cancer">cancer</a>. Damage to the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a> and <a href="peripheral%20nervous%20system">peripheral nervous system</a> can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.

Women develop long-term complications of alcohol dependence more rapidly than do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and an <a href="alcohol%20and%20breast%20cancer">increased risk of breast cancer</a>. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to have a negative effect on reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as <a href="anovulation">anovulation</a>, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the <a href="menstrual%20cycle">menstrual cycle</a>, and early <a href="menopause">menopause</a>. Alcoholic <a href="ketoacidosis">ketoacidosis</a> can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of <a href="binge%20drinking">binge drinking</a>. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher <a href="blood%20alcohol%20concentration">blood alcohol concentration</a>s (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.

Long-term misuse of alcohol can cause a wide range of <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a> problems. Severe <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a> problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. Excessive alcohol use causes <a href="Brain%20damage">damage to brain function</a>, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. <a href="Social%20skills">Social skills</a> are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the <a href="prefrontal%20cortex">prefrontal cortex</a> area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by <a href="alcohol%20abuse">alcohol abuse</a> include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, <a href="Prosody%20%28linguistics%29">prosody</a> perception problems and <a href="theory%20of%20mind">theory of mind</a> deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety</a> and <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a> disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. <a href="Psychosis">Psychosis</a>, <a href="confusion">confusion</a>, and <a href="organic%20brain%20syndrome">organic brain syndrome</a> may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. <a href="Panic%20disorder">Panic disorder</a> can develop or worsen as a direct result of long-term alcohol misuse.

The co-occurrence of <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">major depressive disorder</a> and alcoholism is well documented. Among those with <a href="comorbid">comorbid</a> occurrences, a distinction is commonly made between depressive episodes that remit with alcohol abstinence ("substance-induced"), and depressive episodes that are primary and do not remit with abstinence ("independent" episodes). Additional use of other drugs may increase the risk of depression. Psychiatric disorders differ depending on gender. Women who have alcohol-use disorders often have a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis such as <a href="major%20depression">major depression</a>, <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a>, <a href="panic%20disorder">panic disorder</a>, <a href="bulimia">bulimia</a>, <a href="post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD), or <a href="borderline%20personality%20disorder">borderline personality disorder</a>. Men with alcohol-use disorders more often have a co-occurring diagnosis of <a href="narcissistic%20personality%20disorder">narcissistic</a> or <a href="antisocial%20personality%20disorder">antisocial personality disorder</a>, <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>, <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="impulse%20disorder">impulse disorder</a>s or <a href="attention%20deficit/hyperactivity%20disorder">attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD). Women with alcoholism are more likely to experience physical or <a href="sexual%20assault">sexual assault</a>, abuse and <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a> than women in the general population, which can lead to higher instances of psychiatric disorders and greater dependence on alcohol.

The social problems arising from alcoholism are serious, caused by the pathological changes in the brain and the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including <a href="child%20abuse">child abuse</a>, <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a>, <a href="rape">rape</a>, <a href="burglary">burglary</a> and <a href="assault">assault</a>. Alcoholism is associated with <a href="termination%20of%20employment">loss of employment</a>, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for <a href="drunk%20driving">drunk driving</a> or public disorder, or civil penalties for <a href="tort">tort</a>ious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to <a href="relational%20disorder">marital conflict</a> and <a href="divorce">divorce</a>, or contribute to <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a>. Alcoholism can also lead to <a href="child%20neglect">child neglect</a>, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.

As with similar substances with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as <a href="barbiturates">barbiturates</a> and <a href="benzodiazepines">benzodiazepines</a>, withdrawal from alcohol dependence can be fatal if it is not properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the <a href="GABAA%20receptor">GABA receptor</a>, promoting <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a> depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in <a href="drug%20tolerance">tolerance</a> and <a href="physical%20dependence">physical dependence</a>. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled <a href="synapse">synapse</a> firing. This can result in symptoms that include <a href="anxiety%20%28mood%29">anxiety</a>, life-threatening <a href="seizure">seizure</a>s, <a href="delirium%20tremens">delirium tremens</a>, hallucinations, shakes and possible <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a>, <a href="NMDA">NMDA</a> and <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a>.

Severe acute withdrawal symptoms such as <a href="delirium%20tremens">delirium tremens</a> and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase can be defined as lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the <a href="post-acute%20withdrawal%20syndrome">post-acute withdrawal syndrome</a>; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute withdrawal symptoms have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A <a href="Kindling%20%28sedative-hypnotic%20withdrawal%29">kindling effect</a> also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview while at the same time retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.

A complex mixture of genetic and environmental factors influences the risk of the development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the <a href="gene%20expression">expression of genes</a> which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism are also more likely to begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.

<a href="Psychological%20trauma">Severe childhood trauma</a> is also associated with a general increase in the risk of drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. <a href="Cerebral%20cortex">Cortical</a> degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of at least some of the alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.

Alcohol is the most available, widely consumed, and widely abused <a href="recreational%20drug">recreational drug</a>. <a href="Beer">Beer</a> alone is the world's most widely consumed <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcoholic beverage</a>; it is the third-most popular drink overall, after <a href="Drinking%20water">water</a> and <a href="tea">tea</a>. It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage.

Based on combined data from SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, the rate of past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% of those who did not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).

Genetic differences exist between different racial groups which affect the risk of developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The <a href="alcohol%20dehydrogenase">alcohol dehydrogenase</a> allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a> however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. <a href="psychological%20trauma">trauma</a> have been proposed to explain the higher rates of <a href="Alcohol%20and%20Native%20Americans">alcoholism among Native Americans</a> compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.

A <a href="genome-wide%20association%20study">genome-wide association study</a> of more than 100,000 human individuals identified variants of the gene "KLB", which encodes the <a href="transmembrane%20protein">transmembrane protein</a> β-<a href="Klotho%20%28biology%29">Klotho</a>, as highly associated with alcohol consumption. The protein β-Klotho is an essential element in <a href="cell%20surface%20receptor">cell surface receptor</a>s for <a href="hormone">hormone</a>s involved in modulation of appetites for <a href="Monosaccharide">simple sugar</a>s and alcohol.

Misuse, problem use, abuse, and heavy use of alcohol refer to improper use of alcohol which may cause physical, social, or moral harm to the drinker. Moderate use is defined by "The Dietary Guidelines for Americans" as no more than two alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women. Some drinkers may drink more than 600 ml of alcohol per day during a heavy drinking period. The <a href="National%20Institute%20on%20Alcohol%20Abuse%20and%20Alcoholism">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a> (NIAAA) defines <a href="binge%20drinking">binge drinking</a> as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a two-hour period. According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 <a href="standard%20drink">standard drink</a>s per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either "heavy drinkers" or "binge drinkers" defined according to the above criteria also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met the criteria. An inference drawn from this study is that evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases.

The term "alcoholism" is commonly used amongst laypeople, but it is poorly defined. The WHO calls "alcoholism" "a term of long-standing use and variable meaning", and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO expert committee. "<a href="The%20Big%20Book%20%28Alcoholics%20Anonymous%29">The Big pageRank.Book</a>" (from <a href="Alcoholics%20Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic, but does not define what is meant by the term "alcoholic" in this context. In 1960, <a href="Bill%20W.">Bill W.</a>, co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), said:

Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict’s response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered "normal" drinking and the last two are viewed as "typical" alcoholic drinking. Johnson's four phases consist of:

Other theorists such as Milam & Ketcham (1983) focus on the physical deterioration that alcohol consumption causes. They describe the process in three stages:

In psychology and psychiatry, the DSM is the most common global standard, while in medicine, the standard is ICD. The terms they recommend are similar but not identical.

The <a href="DSM-IV">DSM-IV</a> diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents one approach to the definition of alcoholism. In part, this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared to one another. According to the DSM-IV, an alcohol dependence diagnosis is: "maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one-year period: tolerance; withdrawal; taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended; desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use; great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from use; social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced; continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological <a href="sequela">sequela</a>e." Despite the imprecision inherent in the term, there have been attempts to define how the word "alcoholism" should be interpreted when encountered. In 1992, it was defined by the <a href="National%20Council%20on%20Alcoholism%20and%20Drug%20Dependence">National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence</a> (NCADD) and <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Addiction%20Medicine">ASAM</a> as "a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking." <a href="MeSH">MeSH</a> has had an entry for "alcoholism" since 1999, and references the 1992 definition.

AA describes alcoholism as an illness that involves a physical allergy (where "allergy" has a different meaning than that used in modern medicine.) and a mental obsession. The doctor and addiction specialist <a href="William%20Duncan%20Silkworth">Dr. William D. Silkworth M.D.</a> writes on behalf of AA that "Alcoholics suffer from a "(physical) craving beyond mental control". A 1960 study by <a href="E.%20Morton%20Jellinek">E. Morton Jellinek</a> is considered the foundation of the modern <a href="disease%20theory%20of%20alcoholism">disease theory of alcoholism</a>. Jellinek's definition restricted the use of the word "alcoholism" to those showing a particular <a href="natural%20history%20of%20disease">natural history</a>. The modern medical definition of "alcoholism" has been revised numerous times since then. The <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> uses the word alcoholism to refer to a particular chronic primary disease.

Attitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This is more of a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.

Several tools may be used to detect a loss of control of alcohol use. These tools are mostly <a href="self%20report%20study">self-report</a>s in questionnaire form. Another common theme is a score or tally that sums up the general severity of alcohol use.

The <a href="CAGE%20questionnaire">CAGE questionnaire</a>, named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.

Other tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence, such as the <a href="Alcohol%20Dependence%20Data%20Questionnaire">Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire</a>, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the <a href="CAGE%20questionnaire">CAGE questionnaire</a>. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The <a href="Michigan%20Alcohol%20Screening%20Test">Michigan Alcohol Screening Test</a> (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, <a href="driving%20under%20the%20influence">driving under the influence</a> being the most common. The <a href="Alcohol%20Use%20Disorders%20Identification%20Test">Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test</a> (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The <a href="Paddington%20Alcohol%20Test">Paddington Alcohol Test</a> (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending <a href="Accident%20and%20Emergency%20department">Accident and Emergency department</a>s. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.

Psychiatric geneticists John I. Nurnberger, Jr., and Laura Jean Bierut suggest that alcoholism does not have a single cause—including genetic—but that genes do play an important role "by affecting processes in the body and brain that <a href="Gene-environment%20interaction">interact with</a> one another and with an individual's life experiences to produce protection or susceptibility". They also report that fewer than a dozen alcoholism-related genes have been identified, but that more likely await discovery. At least one genetic test exists for an <a href="allele">allele</a> that is correlated to alcoholism and opiate addiction. Human dopamine receptor genes have a detectable variation referred to as the DRD2 TaqI polymorphism. Those who possess the A1 allele (variation) of this polymorphism have a small but significant tendency towards addiction to opiates and endorphin-releasing drugs like alcohol. Although this allele is slightly more common in alcoholics and opiate addicts, it is not by itself an adequate predictor of alcoholism, and some researchers argue that evidence for DRD2 is contradictory.

There are reliable tests for the actual use of alcohol, one common test being that of <a href="blood%20alcohol%20content">blood alcohol content</a> (BAC). These tests do not differentiate alcoholics from non-alcoholics; however, long-term heavy drinking does have a few recognizable effects on the body, including:


With regard to alcoholism, BAC is useful to judge <a href="alcohol%20tolerance">alcohol tolerance</a>, which in turn is a sign of alcoholism.

However, none of these blood tests for biological markers is as sensitive as screening questionnaires.

The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>, the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and other regional bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, <a href="evidence%20based">evidence based</a> educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.

Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based <a href="zero%20tolerance">zero tolerance</a> approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.

<a href="Alcohol%20detoxification">Alcohol detoxification</a> or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as <a href="benzodiazepines">benzodiazepines</a>, that have similar effects to prevent <a href="Alcohol%20withdrawal%20syndrome">alcohol withdrawal</a>. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.

Various forms of <a href="group%20therapy">group therapy</a> or <a href="psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a> can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety. <a href="Alcoholics%20Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a> was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest. Others include <a href="LifeRing%20Secular%20Recovery">LifeRing Secular Recovery</a>, <a href="SMART%20Recovery">SMART Recovery</a>, <a href="Women%20For%20Sobriety">Women For Sobriety</a>, and <a href="Secular%20Organizations%20for%20Sobriety">Secular Organizations for Sobriety</a>. Rationing and moderation programs such as <a href="Moderation%20Management">Moderation Management</a> and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the <a href="National%20Institute%20on%20Alcohol%20Abuse%20and%20Alcoholism">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a> (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency. A follow-up study, using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001–2002, examined the rates of return to problem drinking in 2004–2005. The study found abstinence from alcohol was the most stable form of remission for recovering alcoholics. A long-term (60 year) follow-up of two groups of alcoholic men concluded that "return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence."

In the United States there are four approved medications for alcoholism: <a href="disulfiram">disulfiram</a>, two forms of <a href="naltrexone">naltrexone</a>, and <a href="acamprosate">acamprosate</a>. Several other drugs are also used and many are under investigation.

The Sinclair method is a method of using naltrexone or another <a href="opioid%20antagonist">opioid antagonist</a>s to treat alcoholism by having the person take the medication about an hour before they drink alcohol, and only then. The medication blocks the <a href="positive%20reinforcement">positive reinforcement</a> effects of ethanol and hopefully allows the person to stop drinking or drink less.

Evidence does not support the use of <a href="selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitors">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a> (SSRIs), <a href="tricyclic%20antidepressants">tricyclic antidepressants</a> (TCAs), <a href="antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a>s, or <a href="gabapentin">gabapentin</a>.

Alcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic <a href="drug%20addiction">drug addiction</a>s and <a href="drug%20dependence">drug dependence</a>s. The most common dual dependence syndrome with alcohol dependence is <a href="benzodiazepine%20dependence">benzodiazepine dependence</a>, with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepine drugs such as <a href="valium">valium</a> or <a href="clonazopam">clonazopam</a>. These drugs are, like alcohol, <a href="depressant">depressant</a>s. Benzodiazepines may be used legally, if they are prescribed by doctors for anxiety problems or other mood disorders, or they may be purchased as <a href="illegal%20drugs">illegal drugs</a> "on the street" through illicit channels. Benzodiazepine use increases cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers. Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid <a href="benzodiazepine%20withdrawal%20syndrome">benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome</a> and other health consequences. Dependence on other sedative-hypnotics such as <a href="zolpidem">zolpidem</a> and <a href="zopiclone">zopiclone</a> as well as <a href="opiate">opiate</a>s and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics. Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics such as <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s, benzodiazepines and <a href="nonbenzodiazepine">nonbenzodiazepine</a>s. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> or <a href="seizure">seizure</a>s if not managed properly.

The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> estimates that as of 2010 there are 208 million people with alcoholism worldwide (4.1% of the population over 15 years of age). Substance use disorders are a major <a href="public%20health">public health</a> problem facing many countries. "The most common substance of abuse/dependence in patients presenting for treatment is alcohol." In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the number of 'dependent drinkers' was calculated as over 2.8 million in 2001. About 12% of American adults have had an alcohol dependence problem at some time in their life. In the United States and Western Europe, 10 to 20 percent of men and 5 to 10 percent of women at some point in their lives will meet criteria for alcoholism. <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a> had the highest death rate from alcohol in Europe in 2015 at 8.8 per 100,000 population.

Within the medical and scientific communities, there is a broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that "drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity)." Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though, in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased. Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences. Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood. 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse, while six percent are dependent on alcohol. Under the <a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">DSM</a>'s new definition of alcoholics, that means about 37 percent of college students may meet the criteria.

Alcoholism often reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years. The most common cause of death in alcoholics is from cardiovascular complications. There is a high rate of <a href="suicide">suicide</a> in chronic alcoholics, which increases the longer a person drinks. Approximately 3–15 percent of alcoholics commit suicide, and research has found that over 50 percent of all suicides are associated with alcohol or <a href="drug%20dependence">drug dependence</a>. This is believed to be due to alcohol causing physiological distortion of brain chemistry, as well as social isolation. Suicide is also very common in adolescent alcohol abusers, with 25 percent of suicides in adolescents being related to alcohol abuse. Among those with <a href="alcohol%20dependence">alcohol dependence</a> after one year, some met the criteria for low-risk drinking, even though only 25.5 percent of the group received any treatment, with the breakdown as follows: 25 percent were found to be still dependent, 27.3 percent were in partial remission (some symptoms persist), 11.8 percent asymptomatic drinkers (consumption increases chances of relapse) and 35.9 percent were fully recovered—made up of 17.7 percent low-risk drinkers plus 18.2 percent abstainers. In contrast, however, the results of a long-term (60-year) follow-up of two groups of alcoholic men indicated that "return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence." There was also "return-to-controlled drinking, as reported in short-term studies, is often a mirage."

Historically the name "<a href="dipsomania">dipsomania</a>" was coined by German physician <a href="C.%20W.%20Hufeland">C. W. Hufeland</a> in 1819 before it was superseded by "alcoholism". That term now has a more specific meaning. The term "alcoholism" was first used in 1849 by the Swedish physician Magnus Huss to describe the systematic adverse effects of alcohol.
Alcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed <a href="prohibition">prohibition</a> of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.

The various health problems associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for <a href="head%20injury">head injuries</a>, <a href="motor%20vehicle%20accident">motor vehicle accident</a>s (due to <a href="drunk%20driving">drunk driving</a>), <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a>, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to <a href="fetal%20alcohol%20syndrome">fetal alcohol syndrome</a>, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified the cost to the UK of "all" forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.

<a href="Stereotype">Stereotype</a>s of alcoholics are often found in <a href="fiction">fiction</a> and <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>. The "<a href="town%20drunk">town drunk</a>" is a <a href="stock%20character">stock character</a> in Western popular culture. Stereotypes of drunkenness may be based on <a href="racism">racism</a> or <a href="xenophobia">xenophobia</a>, as in the fictional depiction of the <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> as heavy drinkers. Studies by social psychologists Stivers and Greeley attempt to document the perceived prevalence of high alcohol consumption amongst the Irish in America. Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures, the United States, and Australia. In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product, there is heightened drinking compared to other Asian countries, but it is nowhere near as high as it is in other countries like the United States. It is also inversely seen, with countries that have very low gross domestic product showing high alcohol consumption. In a study done on Korean immigrants in Canada, they reported alcohol was even an integral part of their meal, and is the only time solo drinking should occur. They also believe alcohol is necessary at any social event as it helps conversations start.

Caucasians have a much lower abstinence rate (11.8%) and much higher tolerance to symptoms (3.4±2.45 drinks) of alcohol than Chinese (33.4% and 2.2±1.78 drinks respectively). Also, the more acculturation there is between cultures, the more influenced the culture is to adopt Caucasians drinking practices. <a href="Peyote">Peyote</a>, a psychoactive agent, has even shown promise in treating alcoholism. Alcohol had actually replaced peyote as <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a>’ psychoactive agent of choice in rituals when peyote was outlawed.

<a href="Topiramate">Topiramate</a>, a derivative of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, has been found effective in helping alcoholics quit or cut back on the amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.

<a href="Baclofen">Baclofen</a>, a <a href="GABAB%20receptor">GABAB receptor</a> agonist, is under study for the treatment of alcoholism. A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of baclofen for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism. There is tentative data supporting baclofen in alcohol dependence however further trials are needed as of 2013.

<a href="Ondansetron">Ondansetron</a>, a 5HT3 antagonist, appears to have promise as a treatment.

Abstraction

Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual <a href="wikt%3Aprocess">process</a> where general <a href="rule%20of%20inference">rules</a> and <a href="concept">concept</a>s are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "<a href="Abstract%20and%20concrete">concrete</a>") signifiers, <a href="first%20principle">first principle</a>s, or other methods. 

"An abstraction" is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a "group", "field", or "category".

Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the <a href="information">information</a> content of a <a href="concept">concept</a> or an observable <a href="phenomenon">phenomenon</a>, selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a <a href="ball">ball</a> selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, eliminating the other characteristics of that particular ball. In a <a href="type%E2%80%93token%20distinction">type–token distinction</a>, a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').

Abstraction in its secondary use is a <a href="%23Material%20process">material process</a>, discussed in the <a href="%23Themes">themes below</a>.

Thinking in abstractions is considered by <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a>s, <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a>s, and <a href="sociologist">sociologist</a>s to be one of the key traits in <a href="modern%20human%20behaviour">modern human behaviour</a>, which is believed to have developed between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. Its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of human <a href="language">language</a>, which (whether spoken or written) appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking.

"Abstraction" involves induction of ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something. It is the opposite of "specification", which is the analysis or breaking-down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete facts. Abstraction can be illustrated with <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>'s "<a href="Novum%20Organum">Novum Organum</a>" (1620), a book of modern scientific philosophy written in the late <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan era</a> of England to encourage modern thinkers to collect specific facts before making any generalizations.

Bacon used and promoted <a href="inductive%20reasoning">induction</a> as an abstraction tool, and it countered the ancient <a href="deductive">deductive</a>-thinking approach that had dominated the intellectual world since the times of Greek philosophers like <a href="Thales">Thales</a>, <a href="Anaximander">Anaximander</a>, and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. Thales (c. 624–546 BCE) believed that everything in the universe comes from one main substance, water. He deduced or specified from a general idea, "everything is water", to the specific forms of water such as ice, snow, fog, and rivers.

Modern scientists can also use the opposite approach of abstraction, or going from particular facts collected into one general idea, such as the motion of the planets (<a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newton</a> (1642–1727)). When determining that the sun is the center of our solar system (<a href="Copernicus">Copernicus</a> (1473–1543)), scientists had to utilize thousands of measurements to finally conclude that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit about the sun (<a href="Kepler">Kepler</a> (1571–1630)), or to assemble multiple specific facts into the law of falling bodies (<a href="Galileo">Galileo</a> (1564–1642)).

An abstraction can be seen as a <a href="data%20compression">compression</a> process, mapping multiple different pieces of <a href="wikt%3Aconstituent">constituent</a> data to a single piece of abstract data; based on similarities in the constituent data, for example, many different physical cats map to the abstraction "CAT". This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between "abstract" and "<a href="concrete%20%28philosophy%29">concrete</a>". In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects, and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is <a href="%23Physicality">itself an object</a>).
Chains of abstractions can be <a href="construe">construe</a>d, moving from neural impulses arising from sensory <a href="perception">perception</a> to basic abstractions such as color or <a href="shape">shape</a>, to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat, to <a href="semantic">semantic</a> abstractions such as the "idea" of a CAT, to classes of objects such as "mammals" and even categories such as "<a href="%23Physicality">object</a>" as opposed to "action".

Non-existent things in any particular place and time are often seen as abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times. 

Those abstract things are then said to be "multiply instantiated", in the sense of "picture 1", "picture 2", etc., shown <a href="%23Simplification%20and%20ordering">below</a>. It is not sufficient, however, to define "abstract" ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define "abstraction" as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts "cat" and "telephone" abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept "cat" or the concept "telephone". Although the concepts "cat" and "telephone" are "abstractions", they are not "abstract" in the sense of the objects in "graph 1" <a href="%23Simplification%20and%20ordering">below</a>. We might look at other graphs, in a progression from "cat" to "mammal" to "animal", and see that "animal" is more abstract than "mammal"; but on the other hand "mammal" is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to "<a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>" or "<a href="monotreme">monotreme</a>".

Perhaps confusingly, some <a href="philosophy">philosophies</a> refer to "<a href="trope%20%28philosophy%29">tropes</a>" (instances of properties) as "<a href="abstract%20particular">abstract particular</a>s"—e.g., the particular <a href="red">red</a>ness of a particular <a href="apple">apple</a> is an "abstract particular". This is similar to <a href="qualia">qualia</a> and <a href="sumbebekos">sumbebekos</a>.

Still retaining the primary meaning of 'abstrere' or 'to draw away from', the abstraction of money, for example, works by drawing away from the particular value of things allowing completely incommensurate objects to be compared (see the section on 'Physicality' below). <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s writing on the <a href="commodity">commodity</a> abstraction recognizes a parallel process.

The <a href="state%20%28polity%29">state (polity)</a> as both concept and material practice exemplifies the two sides of this process of abstraction. Conceptually, 'the current concept of the state is an abstraction from the much more concrete early-modern use as the standing or status of the prince, his visible estates'. At the same time, materially, the 'practice of statehood is now constitutively and materially more abstract than at the time when princes ruled as the embodiment of extended power'. 

The way that physical objects, like rocks and trees, have <a href="category%20of%20being">being</a> differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being, for example the way the <a href="concrete%20%28philosophy%29">concrete</a>, <a href="particular">particular</a>, <a href="individual">individual</a>s pictured in "<a href="%23Simplification%20and%20ordering">picture 1</a>" exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in "<a href="%23Simplification%20and%20ordering">graph 1</a>" exist. That difference accounts for the <a href="ontological">ontological</a> usefulness of the word "abstract". The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.

A physical object (a possible referent of a concept or word) is considered "concrete" (not abstract) if it is a "particular individual" that occupies a particular place and time. However, in the secondary sense of the term 'abstraction', this physical object can carry materially abstracting processes. For example, record-keeping aids throughout the <a href="Fertile%20Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a> included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in containers. According to , these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a <a href="bill%20of%20lading">bill of lading</a> or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers for the count, marks were placed on the outside of the containers. These physical marks, in other words, acted as material abstractions of a materially abstract process of accounting, using conceptual abstractions (numbers) to communicate its meaning.

Abstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in <a href="reality">reality</a> or exist only as sensory experiences, like the color <a href="red">red</a>. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like "God", "the number three", and "goodness" are real, abstract, or both.

An approach to resolving such difficulty is to use "<a href="predicate%20%28grammar%29">predicates</a>" as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g., "good"). Questions about the properties of things are then <a href="proposition">proposition</a>s about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the "graph 1" <a href="%23Simplification%20and%20ordering">below</a>, the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates.

Abstractions sometimes have ambiguous <a href="referent">referent</a>s; for example, "<a href="happiness">happiness</a>" (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or <a href="being">states of being</a> which make them happy. Likewise, "<a href="architecture">architecture</a>" refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of creation and <a href="innovation">innovation</a> which aim at elegant solutions to <a href="construction">construction</a> problems, to the use of space, and to the attempt to evoke an <a href="emotion">emotional response</a> in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.

Abstraction uses a <a href="strategy">strategy</a> of simplification, wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective <a href="communication">communication</a> about things in the abstract requires an <a href="intuition%20%28knowledge%29">intuitive</a> or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient. This is true for all verbal/abstract communication.

For example, many different things can be <a href="red">red</a>. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in "picture 1", to the right). The property of "<a href="red">red</a>ness" and the <a href="Relation%20of%20Ideas">relation</a> "<a href="sitting">sitting-on</a>" are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram "graph 1" identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their five labels), whereas the "picture 1" shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.

"Graph 1" details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example, the arrow between the "agent" and "CAT:Elsie" depicts an example of an "<a href="is-a">is-a</a>" relationship, as does the arrow between the "location" and the "MAT". The arrows between the <a href="gerund">gerund</a>/<a href="present%20participle">present participle</a> "SITTING" and the <a href="noun">noun</a>s "agent" and "location" express the <a href="diagram">diagram</a>'s basic relationship; ""agent is SITTING on location""; "Elsie" is an instance of "CAT".

Although the description "sitting-on" (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in <a href="Douglas%20Hofstadter">Douglas Hofstadter</a>'s illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in "<a href="G%C3%B6del%2C%20Escher%2C%20Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>" (1979):

An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no <a href="loss%20of%20generality">loss of generality</a>. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about something, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.

In <a href="philosophy">philosophical terminology</a>, "abstraction" is the <a href="thinking">thought process</a> wherein <a href="idea">idea</a>s are distanced from <a href="object%20%28philosophy%29">objects</a>.

Typically, "abstraction" is used in the arts as a <a href="synonym">synonym</a> for <a href="abstract%20art">abstract art</a> in general. Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory. Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.

<a href="Computer%20scientists">Computer scientists</a> use abstraction to make models that can be used and re-used without having to re-write all the program code for each new application on every different type of computer. They <a href="communication">communicate</a> their solutions with the computer by writing <a href="source%20code">source code</a> in some particular <a href="computer%20language">computer language</a> which can be translated into <a href="machine%20code">machine code</a> for different types of computers to execute. Abstraction allows program designers to separate categories and concepts related to computing problems from specific instances of implementation. This means that the program code can be written so that it does not depend on the specific details of supporting applications, <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> software or hardware, but on an abstract concept of the solution to the problem that can then be integrated with the system with minimal additional work.

Abstraction is frequently applied in <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a> so as to allow phenomena of language to be analyzed at the desired level of detail. A commonly considered abstraction is the "<a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>", which abstracts <a href="speech%20sound">speech sound</a>s in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning. Other analogous kinds of abstractions (sometimes called "<a href="emic%20unit">emic unit</a>s") considered by linguists include <a href="morpheme">morpheme</a>s, <a href="grapheme">grapheme</a>s, and <a href="lexeme">lexeme</a>s. Abstraction also arises in the relation between <a href="syntax">syntax</a>, <a href="semantics">semantics</a>, and <a href="pragmatics">pragmatics</a>. Pragmatics involves considerations that make reference to the user of the language; semantics considers expressions and what they denote (the <a href="designata">designata</a>) abstracted from the language user; and syntax considers only the expressions themselves, abstracted from the designata.

Abstraction in <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.

The advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:

The main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and require a degree of <a href="mathematical%20maturity">mathematical maturity</a> and experience before they can be assimilated.

In music, the term "abstraction" can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of <a href="tonality">tonality</a>. <a href="Atonal">Atonal</a> music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.

A recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts. This is because abstract concepts elicit greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts which elicit greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Other research into the <a href="human%20brain">human brain</a> suggests that the left and right hemispheres differ in their handling of abstraction. For example, one meta-analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage.

Abstraction in <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in <a href="concept">concept</a> formation of recognizing some set of common features in <a href="individual">individual</a>s, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a> and the <a href="problem%20of%20universals">problem of universals</a>. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under <a href="predicate%20abstraction">predicate abstraction</a>. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is <a href="thought%20space">thought space</a>.

<a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>'s definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive, different complementary psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies, such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is <a href="concretism%20%28psychology%29">concretism</a>. "Abstraction" is one of Jung's 57 definitions in Chapter XI of "<a href="Psychological%20Types">Psychological Types</a>".

There is an abstract "thinking", just as there is abstract "feeling", "sensation" and "intuition". Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous "sensation" and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic "intuition". (Jung, [1921] (1971): par. 678).
In social theory, abstraction is used as both an ideational and material process. <a href="Alfred%20Sohn-Rethel">Alfred Sohn-Rethel</a>, asked "Can there be abstraction other than by thought?" He used the example of commodity abstraction to show that abstraction occurs in practice as people create systems of abstract exchange that extend beyond the immediate physicality of the object and yet have real and immediate consequences. This work was extended through the 'Constitutive Abstraction' approach of writers associated with the Journal <a href="Arena%20%28Australian%20publishing%20co-operative%29">"Arena"</a>. Two books that have taken this theme of the abstraction of social relations as an organizing process in human history are (1996) and the second volume of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community, published in 2006: These books argue that the nation is an abstract community bringing together strangers who will never meet as such; thus constituting materially real and substantial, but abstracted and mediated relations. The books suggest that contemporary processes of globalization and mediatization have contributed to materially abstracting relations between people, with major consequences for how we live our lives.

It can be easily argued that abstraction is an elementary methodological tool in several disciplines of social science. These disciplines have definite and different man concepts that highlight those aspects of man and his behaviour by idealization that are relevant for the given human science. For example, homo sociologicus is the man as sociology abstracts and idealizes it, depicting man as a social being. Moreover, we could talk about homo cyber sapiens (the man who can extend his biologically determined intelligence thanks to new technologies), or homo creativus (who is simply creative).

Abstraction (combined with Weberian <a href="Idealization%20%28science%20philosophy%29">idealization</a>) plays a crucial role in <a href="economics">economics</a>. Breaking away from directly experienced reality was a common trend in 19th century sciences (especially <a href="physics">physics</a>), and this was the effort which was fundamentally determined the way economics tried and still tries to approach the economic aspects of social life. It is abstraction we meet in the case of both Newton’s physics and the neoclassical theory, since the goal was to grasp the unchangeable and timeless essence of phenomena. For example, <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newton</a> created the concept of the material point by following the abstraction method so that he abstracted from the dimension and shape of any perceptible object, preserving only inertial and translational motion. Material point is the ultimate and common feature of all bodies. <a href="Neoclassical%20economists">Neoclassical economists</a> created the indefinitely abstract notion of <a href="homo%20economicus">homo economicus</a> by following the same procedure. Economists abstract from all individual and personal qualities in order to get to those characteristics that embody the essence of economic activity. Eventually, it is the substance of the economic man that they try to grasp. Any characteristic beyond it only disturbs the functioning of this essential core.

Abelian group

In <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, an abelian group, also called a commutative group, is a <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a> in which the result of applying the group <a href="Operation%20%28mathematics%29">operation</a> to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written. That is, these are the groups that obey the axiom of <a href="commutativity">commutativity</a>. Abelian groups <a href="generalization">generalize</a> the <a href="arithmetic">arithmetic</a> of addition of <a href="integer">integer</a>s. They are named after <a href="Niels%20Henrik%20Abel">Niels Henrik Abel</a>.

The concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra, from which many other basic concepts, such as <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">modules</a> and <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>s are developed. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their <a href="nonabelian%20group">non-abelian</a> counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research.

An abelian group is a <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a>, "A", together with an <a href="Binary%20operation">operation</a> • that combines any two <a href="element%20%28mathematics%29">elements</a> "a" and "b" to form another element denoted . The symbol • is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, , must satisfy five requirements known as the "abelian group axioms":


A group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a "non-abelian group" or "non-commutative group".

There are two main notational conventions for abelian groups – additive and multiplicative.

Generally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">module</a>s and <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a>s. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered, some notable exceptions being <a href="near-ring">near-ring</a>s and <a href="partially%20ordered%20group">partially ordered group</a>s, where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian.

To verify that a <a href="finite%20group">finite group</a> is abelian, a table (matrix) – known as a <a href="Cayley%20table">Cayley table</a> – can be constructed in a similar fashion to a <a href="multiplication%20table">multiplication table</a>. If the group is under the operation ⋅, the entry of this table contains the product . The group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal.

This is true since if the group is abelian, then . This implies that the entry of the table equals the entry, thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.


In general, <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrices</a>, even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication – one example is the group of 2×2 <a href="rotation%20matrix">rotation matrices</a>.

Abelian groups were named after <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="Niels%20Henrik%20Abel">Niels Henrik Abel</a> by <a href="Camille%20Jordan">Camille Jordan</a> because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of a <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a> implies that the roots of the polynomial can be <a href="solvability%20by%20radicals">calculated by using radicals</a>. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background.

If "n" is a <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a> and "x" is an element of an abelian group "G" written additively, then "nx" can be defined as ("n" summands) and . In this way, "G" becomes a <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">module</a> over the <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a> Z of integers. In fact, the modules over Z can be identified with the abelian groups.

Theorems about abelian groups (i.e. <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">module</a>s over the <a href="principal%20ideal%20domain">principal ideal domain</a> Z) can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of <a href="finitely%20generated%20abelian%20group">finitely generated abelian group</a>s which is a specialization of the <a href="structure%20theorem%20for%20finitely%20generated%20modules%20over%20a%20principal%20ideal%20domain">structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain</a>. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form Z/"p"Z for "p" prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of Z.

If are two <a href="group%20homomorphism">group homomorphism</a>s between abelian groups, then their sum , defined by , is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if "H" is a non-abelian group.) The set of all group homomorphisms from "G" to "H" thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.

Somewhat akin to the <a href="dimension">dimension</a> of <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>s, every abelian group has a "<a href="rank%20of%20an%20abelian%20group">rank</a>". It is defined as the maximal <a href="cardinal%20number">cardinality</a> of a set of <a href="linearly%20independent">linearly independent</a> elements of the group. The integers and the <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals.

The <a href="center%20%28group%20theory%29">center</a> "Z"("G") of a group "G" is the set of elements that commute with every element of "G". A group "G" is abelian if and only if it is equal to its center "Z"("G"). The center of a group "G" is always a <a href="characteristic%20subgroup">characteristic</a> abelian subgroup of "G". If the quotient group "G"/"Z"("G") of a group by its center is cyclic then "G" is abelian.

Cyclic groups of <a href="modular%20arithmetic">integers modulo "n"</a>, Z/"n"Z, were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The <a href="automorphism%20group">automorphism group</a> of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of <a href="Georg%20Frobenius">Georg Frobenius</a> and <a href="Ludwig%20Stickelberger">Ludwig Stickelberger</a> and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a>.

Any group of prime order is isomorphic to a cyclic group and therefore abelian. Any group whose order is a square of a prime number is abelian. In fact, for every prime number "p" there are (up to isomorphism) exactly two groups of order "p", namely Z and Z×Z.

The fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups states that every finite abelian group "G" can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of <a href="prime%20number">prime</a>-power order; it is also known as the basis theorem for finite abelian groups. This is generalized by the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20finitely%20generated%20abelian%20groups">fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups</a>, with finite groups being the special case when "G" has zero <a href="rank%20of%20an%20abelian%20group">rank</a>; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.

The classification was proven by <a href="Leopold%20Kronecker">Leopold Kronecker</a> in 1870, though it wasn't stated in modern group-theoretic terms until later, and was preceded by a similar classification of quadratic forms by Gauss in 1801; see <a href="Fundamental%20theorem%20of%20finitely%20generated%20abelian%20groups%23History">history</a> for details.

The cyclic group Z of order "mn" is isomorphic to the direct sum of Z and Z if and only if "m" and "n" are <a href="coprime">coprime</a>. It follows that any finite abelian group "G" is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form

in either of the following canonical ways:

For example, Z can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are <a href="group%20isomorphism">isomorphic</a>.

For another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either Z (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or .

See also <a href="list%20of%20small%20groups">list of small groups</a> for finite abelian groups of order 30 or less.

One can apply the <a href="%23Classification">fundamental theorem</a> to count (and sometimes determine) the <a href="Group%20isomorphism%23Automorphisms">automorphisms</a> of a given finite abelian group "G". To do this, one uses the fact that if "G" splits as a direct sum of subgroups of <a href="coprime">coprime</a> order, then .

Given this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of "G" it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the <a href="Sylow%20theorems">Sylow</a> "p"-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of "p"). Fix a prime "p" and suppose the exponents "e" of the cyclic factors of the Sylow "p"-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:

for some . One needs to find the automorphisms of

One special case is when "n" = 1, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow "p"-subgroup "P". In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite <a href="cyclic%20group">cyclic group</a> can be used. Another special case is when "n" is arbitrary but . Here, one is considering "P" to be of the form

so elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension "n" over the finite field of "p" elements F. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so

where GL is the appropriate <a href="general%20linear%20group">general linear group</a>. This is easily shown to have order

In the most general case, where the "e" and "n" are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines

and

then one has in particular , , and

One can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see Hillar, C., & Rhea, D.).

The simplest infinite abelian group is the <a href="infinite%20cyclic%20group">infinite cyclic group</a> Z. Any <a href="finitely%20generated%20abelian%20group">finitely generated abelian group</a> "A" is isomorphic to the direct sum of "r" copies of Z and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many <a href="cyclic%20group">cyclic group</a>s of primary orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number "r", called the <a href="Rank%20of%20an%20abelian%20group">rank</a> of "A", and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.

By contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. <a href="Divisible%20group">Divisible group</a>s, i.e. abelian groups "A" in which the equation admits a solution for any natural number "n" and element "a" of "A", constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to Q and <a href="Pr%C3%BCfer%20group">Prüfer group</a>s Q/Z for various prime numbers "p", and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined. Moreover, if a divisible group "A" is a subgroup of an abelian group "G" then "A" admits a direct complement: a subgroup "C" of "G" such that . Thus divisible groups are <a href="injective%20module">injective module</a>s in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible (<a href="Baer%27s%20criterion">Baer's criterion</a>). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called reduced.

Two important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are "torsion groups" and "torsion-free groups", exemplified by the groups Q/Z (periodic) and Q (torsion-free).

An abelian group is called <a href="periodic%20group">periodic</a> or <a href="torsion%20%28algebra%29">torsion</a>, if every element has finite <a href="order%20%28group%20theory%29">order</a>. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second <a href="Pr%C3%BCfer%20theorems">Prüfer theorems</a> state that if "A" is a periodic group, and it either has a bounded exponent, i.e., for some natural number "n", or is countable and the <a href="height%20%28abelian%20group%29">"p"-heights</a> of the elements of "A" are finite for each "p", then "A" is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups. The cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to Z/"p"Z in such a decomposition is an invariant of "A". These theorems were later subsumed in the Kulikov criterion. In a different direction, <a href="Helmut%20Ulm">Helmut Ulm</a> found an extension of the second Prüfer theorem to countable abelian "p"-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their <a href="Ulm%20invariant">Ulm invariant</a>s.

An abelian group is called torsion-free if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of <a href="torsion-free%20abelian%20group">torsion-free abelian group</a>s have been studied extensively:


An abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called mixed. If "A" is an abelian group and "T"("A") is its <a href="torsion%20subgroup">torsion subgroup</a> then the factor group "A"/"T"("A") is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of "A", so "A" is "not" isomorphic to . Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups.

One of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group "A" is its <a href="rank%20of%20an%20abelian%20group">rank</a>: the cardinality of the maximal <a href="linearly%20independent">linearly independent</a> subset of "A". Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while <a href="torsion-free%20abelian%20groups%20of%20rank%201">torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1</a> are necessarily subgroups of Q and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank "r" is a subgroup of Q. On the other hand, the group of <a href="p-adic%20integer">"p"-adic integers</a> Z is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite Z-rank and the groups Z with different "n" are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.

The classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are <a href="pure%20subgroup">pure</a> and <a href="basic%20subgroup">basic</a> subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by <a href="Irving%20Kaplansky">Irving Kaplansky</a>, <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Fuchs">László Fuchs</a>, <a href="Phillip%20Griffith">Phillip Griffith</a>, and <a href="David%20Arnold%20%28mathematician%29">David Arnold</a>, as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in "<a href="Lecture%20Notes%20in%20Mathematics">Lecture Notes in Mathematics</a>" for more recent findings.

The additive group of a <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a> is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:


Many large abelian groups possess a natural <a href="topology">topology</a>, which turns them into <a href="topological%20group">topological group</a>s.

The collection of all abelian groups, together with the <a href="Group%20homomorphism">homomorphisms</a> between them, forms the <a href="category%20of%20abelian%20groups">category</a> Ab, the prototype of an <a href="abelian%20category">abelian category</a>.

Nearly all well-known <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a>s other than <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29">Boolean algebras</a> are <a href="Decidability%20%28logic%29">undecidable</a>. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:

Moreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a> commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the <a href="Whitehead%20problem">Whitehead problem</a>: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also <a href="free%20abelian%20group">free abelian group</a>s? In the 1970s, <a href="Saharon%20Shelah">Saharon Shelah</a> proved that the Whitehead problem is:

Among mathematical <a href="adjective">adjective</a>s derived from the <a href="proper%20name">proper name</a> of a <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>, the word "abelian" is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase a, rather than an uppercase A, indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.

<doc id="2975" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2975" title="Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty">
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty

The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty or ABMT) was an <a href="arms%20control">arms control</a> treaty between the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> on the limitation of the <a href="anti-ballistic%20missile">anti-ballistic missile</a> (ABM) systems used in defending areas against <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a>-delivered <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s. Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.

Signed in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1997 four former Soviet republics agreed with the United States to succeed the USSR's role in the treaty. In June 2002 the United States withdrew from the treaty, leading to its termination.

Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming <a href="ICBM">ICBM</a> warheads. During this period, the US considered the defense of the US as part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange. As part of this defense, <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called <a href="NORAD">North American Aerospace Defense Command</a>).

By the early 1950s, US research on the <a href="Project%20Nike">Nike Zeus</a> missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of an operational ABM system. Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as <a href="Sprint%20%28missile%29">Sprint</a> to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves. By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed <a href="National%20Missile%20Defense%23Sentinel%20Program">Sentinel</a>. In 1967, the US announced that Sentinel itself would be scaled down to the smaller and less expensive <a href="Safeguard%20Program">Safeguard</a>. Soviet doctrine called for development of its own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US. This was achieved with the operational deployment of the <a href="A-35%20anti-ballistic%20missile%20system">A-35 ABM system</a> and its successors, which remain operational to this day.

The development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (<a href="MIRV">MIRV</a>) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time. An ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer number of warheads. Upgrading it to counter the additional warheads would be economically unfeasible: The defenders required one rocket per incoming warhead, whereas the attackers could place 10 warheads on a single missile at a reasonable cost. To further protect against ABM systems, the Soviet MIRV missiles were equipped with decoys; <a href="R-36%20%28missile%29">R-36M</a> heavy missiles carried as many as 40. These decoys would appear as warheads to an ABM, effectively requiring engagement of five times as many targets and rendering defense even less effective.

The United States first proposed an anti-ballistic missile treaty at the 1967 <a href="Glassboro%20Summit%20Conference">Glassboro Summit Conference</a> during discussions between U.S. Secretary of Defense <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union <a href="Alexei%20Kosygin">Alexei Kosygin</a>. McNamara argued both that ballistic missile defense could provoke an arms race, and that it might provoke a first-strike against the nation fielding the defense. Kosygin rejected this reasoning. Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the <a href="SALT%20I">Strategic Arms Limitation Talks</a> began in November 1969 (SALT I). By 1972 an agreement had been reached to limit strategic defensive systems. Each country was allowed two sites at which it could base a defensive system, one for the capital and one for ICBM silos.

The treaty was signed during the <a href="Moscow%20Summit%20%281972%29">1972 Moscow Summit</a> on May 26 by the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> and the <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>; and ratified by the US Senate on August 3, 1972.

The 1974 Protocol reduced the number of sites to one per party, largely because neither country had developed a second site. The sites were <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> for the USSR and the North Dakota <a href="Stanley%20R.%20Mickelsen%20Safeguard%20Complex">Safeguard Complex</a> for the US, which was already under construction.

The Treaty limited only ABMs capable of defending against "strategic ballistic missiles", without attempting to define "strategic". It was understood that both ICBMs and <a href="SLBM">SLBM</a>s are obviously "strategic". Both countries did not intend to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs. The topic became disputable as soon as most potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs (SLBMs naturally tend to be much slower than ICBMs), nevertheless both sides continued counter-tactical ABM development.

On March 23, 1983 <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> announced the <a href="Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative">Strategic Defense Initiative</a>, a research program into ballistic missile defense which would be, "consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty". The project was a blow to <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>'s so-called "peace offensive". Andropov said that "It is time [Washington] stopped thinking up one option another in search of the best way of unleashing nuclear war in the hope of winning it. To do this is not just irresponsible. It is madness".

Regardless of the opposition, Reagan gave every indication that SDI would not be used as a bargaining chip and that the United States would do all in its power to build the system. The Soviets were threatened because the Americans might have been able to make a nuclear first strike possible. In "The Nuclear Predicament," Beckman claims that one of the central goals of Soviet diplomacy was to terminate SDI. A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a "ragged" Soviet retaliatory response. Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy. The Soviets could not afford to ignore Reagan's new endeavor, therefore their policy at the time was to enter negotiations with the Americans. By 1987, however, the USSR withdrew its opposition, concluding the SDI posed no threat and scientifically "would never work."

SDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped-for result. SDI research was cut back following the end of Reagan's presidency, and in 1995 it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that "missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability." This was reaffirmed in 1997.

Although the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991, in the view of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. Department of State</a>, the treaty continued in force. An additional memorandum of understanding was prepared in 1997, establishing Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine as successor states to the Soviet Union, for the purposes of the treaty.

On December 13, 2001, <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> gave <a href="Russia">Russia</a> notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that required six months' notice before terminating the pact—the first time in recent history that the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty. This led to the eventual creation of the American <a href="Missile%20Defense%20Agency">Missile Defense Agency</a>.

Supporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited <a href="National%20Missile%20Defense">National Missile Defense</a> to protect the United States from <a href="nuclear%20blackmail">nuclear blackmail</a> by a <a href="rogue%20state">rogue state</a>. The withdrawal had many critics as well as supporters. John Rhinelander, a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a "fatal blow" to the <a href="Treaty%20on%20the%20Non-Proliferation%20of%20Nuclear%20Weapons">Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> and would lead to a "world without effective legal constraints on <a href="nuclear%20proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a>." The construction of a missile defense system was also feared to enable the US to attack with a nuclear <a href="first%20strike">first strike</a>.

Russia and the United States signed the <a href="Strategic%20Offensive%20Reductions%20Treaty">Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty</a> in Moscow on May 24, 2002. This treaty mandates cuts in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but without actually mandating cuts to total stockpiled warheads, and without any mechanism for enforcement.

The union was a result of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Compromise%20of%201867">Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867</a> and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Croatia-Slavonia">Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia</a> under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the <a href="Croatian%E2%80%93Hungarian%20Settlement">Croatian–Hungarian Settlement</a> ("Nagodba") in 1868. It was ruled by the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">House of Habsburg</a>, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Monarchy</a>. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states.

Austria-Hungary was a <a href="multinational%20state">multinational state</a> and one of the world's <a href="great%20power">great power</a>s at the time. Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, at , and the third-most populous (after Russia and the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>). The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world, after the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, Germany, and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Austria-Hungary also became the world's third largest manufacturer and exporter of electric home appliances, electric industrial appliances and power generation apparatus for power plants, after the United States and the German Empire.

After 1878, <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20rule%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina was under Austro-Hungarian military and civilian rule</a> until it was fully annexed in 1908, provoking the <a href="Bosnian%20crisis">Bosnian crisis</a> among the other powers. <a href="Sand%C5%BEak">Sandžak/Raška</a>, "de jure" northern part of the Ottoman <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Novi%20Pazar">Sanjak of Novi Pazar</a> (in modern-day Montenegro and Serbia), was also under "de facto" joint occupation during that period but the Austro-Hungarian army withdrew as part of their annexation of Bosnia. The annexation of Bosnia also led to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> being recognized as an official state religion due to Bosnia's <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> population.

Austria-Hungary was one of the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. It was already effectively dissolved by the time the military authorities signed the <a href="armistice%20of%20Villa%20Giusti">armistice of Villa Giusti</a> on 3 November 1918. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%9346%29">Kingdom of Hungary</a> and the <a href="First%20Austrian%20Republic">First Austrian Republic</a> were treated as its <a href="succession%20of%20states">successors "de jure"</a>, whereas the independence of the <a href="West%20Slavs">West Slavs</a> and <a href="South%20Slavs">South Slavs</a> of the Empire as the <a href="First%20Czechoslovak%20Republic">First Czechoslovak Republic</a>, the <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Second Polish Republic</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>, respectively, and most of the territorial demands of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Kingdom of Romania</a> were also recognized by the victorious powers in 1920.

The realm's full, official name was The Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the <a href="Imperial%20Council%20%28Austria%29">Imperial Council</a> and the <a href="Lands%20of%20the%20Crown%20of%20Saint%20Stephen">Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen</a>.

<a href="German%20language">German</a>: "

The <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg-Lorraine">Habsburg</a> monarch ruled as <a href="Emperor%20of%20Austria">Emperor of Austria</a> over the western and northern half of the country that was the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a> ("Lands Represented in the Imperial Council", or <a href="Cisleithania">Cisleithania</a>) and as <a href="King%20of%20Hungary">King of Hungary</a> over the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a> ("<a href="Lands%20of%20the%20Crown%20of%20Saint%20Stephen">Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen</a>", or <a href="Transleithania">Transleithania</a>). Each enjoyed considerable sovereignty with only a few joint affairs (principally <a href="diplomacy">foreign relations</a> and defence).

Certain regions, such as <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Polish Galicia</a> within Cisleithania and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%20and%20Slavonia">Croatia</a> (officially the <a href="Triune%20Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%2C%20Slavonia%20and%20Dalmatia">Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia-Dalmatia</a>, even <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> was in Cisleithanian part of the "<a href="Dual%20Monarchy">Dual Monarchy</a>") within Transleithania, enjoyed autonomous status, each with its own unique governmental structures (see: <a href="Austrian%20Poland%23Galician%20autonomy">Polish Autonomy in Galicia</a> and <a href="Croatian%E2%80%93Hungarian%20Settlement">Croatian–Hungarian Settlement</a>).

The division between Austria and Hungary was so marked that there was no common citizenship: one was either an Austrian citizen or a Hungarian citizen, never both. This also meant that there were always separate Austrian and Hungarian passports, never a common one. However, neither Austrian nor Hungarian passports were used in the <a href="Triune%20Kingdom">Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia-Dalmatia</a>. Instead, the Kingdom issued its own passports which were written in Croatian and French and displayed the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia-Dalmatia on them. It is not known what kind of passports were used in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was under the control of both Austria and Hungary.

The Kingdom of Hungary had always maintained a separate parliament, the <a href="Diet%20of%20Hungary">Diet of Hungary</a>, even after the Austrian Empire was created in 1804.
The administration and government of the Kingdom of Hungary (until 1848-49 Hungarian revolution) remained largely untouched by the government structure of the overarching Austrian Empire. Hungary's central government structures remained well separated from the Austrian imperial government. The country was governed by the Council of Lieutenancy of Hungary (the Gubernium) – located in <a href="Bratislava">Pressburg</a> and later in <a href="Pest%2C%20Hungary">Pest</a> – and by the Hungarian Royal Court Chancellery in Vienna. The Hungarian government and Hungarian parliament were suspended after the Hungarian revolution of 1848, and were reinstated after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise in 1867.

Despite Austria and Hungary sharing a common currency, they were fiscally sovereign and independent entities. Since the beginnings of the personal union (from 1527), the government of the Kingdom of Hungary could preserve its separated and independent budget. After the revolution of 1848–1849, the Hungarian budget was amalgamated with the Austrian, and it was only after the Compromise of 1867 that Hungary obtained a separate budget. From 1527 (the creation of the monarchic <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a>) to 1851, the Kingdom of Hungary maintained its own customs controls, which separated her from the other parts of the Habsburg-ruled territories. After 1867, the Austrian and Hungarian customs union agreement had to be renegotiated and stipulated every ten years. The agreements were renewed and signed by Vienna and Budapest at the end of every decade because both countries hoped to derive mutual economic benefit from the customs union. The Austrian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary contracted their foreign commercial treaties independently of each other.

Austria-Hungary was a <a href="great%20power">great power</a> but it contained a large number of ethnic groups that sought their own nation. It was ruled by a coalition of two powerful minorities, the Germans and the Hungarians. Stresses regarding nationalism were building up, and the severe shock of a poorly handled war caused the system to collapse.

Vienna served as the Monarchy's primary capital. The Cisleithanian (Austrian) part contained about 57 percent of the total population and the larger share of its economic resources, compared to the Hungarian part.
Following a decision of <a href="Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria">Franz Joseph I</a> in 1868, the realm bore the official name Austro-Hungarian Monarchy/Realm (; ) in its international relations. It was often contracted to the Dual Monarchy in English, or simply referred to as Austria.

The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (called the "Ausgleich" in German and the "Kiegyezés" in Hungarian), which inaugurated the empire's dual structure in place of the former <a href="unitary%20state">unitary</a> <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a> (1804–67), originated at a time when Austria had declined in strength and in power—both in the <a href="Italian%20Peninsula">Italian Peninsula</a> (as a result of the <a href="Second%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">Second Italian War of Independence</a> of 1859) and among the states of the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> (it had been surpassed by <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> as the dominant German-speaking power following the <a href="Austro-Prussian%20War">Austro-Prussian War</a> of 1866).

Other factors in the constitutional changes were continued Hungarian dissatisfaction with rule from Vienna and increasing national consciousness on the part of other nationalities (or ethnicities) of the Austrian Empire. Hungarian dissatisfaction arose partly from Austria's suppression with <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> support of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">Hungarian liberal revolution</a> of 1848–49. However, dissatisfaction with Austrian rule had grown for many years within Hungary and had many other causes.

By the late 1850s, a large number of Hungarians who had supported the 1848–49 revolution were willing to accept the Habsburg monarchy. They argued that while Hungary had the right to full internal independence, under the <a href="Pragmatic%20Sanction%20of%201713">Pragmatic Sanction of 1713</a>, foreign affairs and defense were "common" to both Austria and Hungary.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%B6niggr%C3%A4tz">Austrian defeat at Königgrätz</a>, the government realized it needed to reconcile with Hungary to regain the status of a great power. The new foreign minister, <a href="Count%20Friedrich%20Ferdinand%20von%20Beust">Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust</a>, wanted to conclude the stalemated negotiations with the Hungarians. To secure the monarchy, Emperor <a href="Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria">Franz Joseph</a> began negotiations for a compromise with the <a href="Hungarian%20people">Hungarian</a> nobility, led by <a href="Ferenc%20De%C3%A1k">Ferenc Deák</a>, to ensure their support. In particular, Hungarian leaders demanded and received the Emperor's coronation as King of Hungary and the re-establishment of a separate parliament at <a href="Pest%2C%20Hungary">Pest</a> with powers to enact laws for the lands of the <a href="Holy%20Crown%20of%20Hungary">Holy Crown of Hungary</a>.

From 1867 onwards, the abbreviations heading the names of official institutions in Austria-Hungary reflected their responsibility: (' or <a href="Imperial%20and%20Royal">Imperial and Royal</a>) was the label for institutions common to both parts of the Monarchy, e.g. the ' (War Fleet) and, during the war, the ' (Army). There were three ' or joint ministries:

The last was responsible only for financing the Imperial and Royal household, the diplomatic service, the common army and the common war fleet. All other state functions were to be handled separately by each of the two states.

From 1867 onwards, common expenditures were allocated 70% to Austria and 30% to Hungary. This split had to be negotiated every 10 years. By 1907, the Hungarian share had risen to 36.4%. The negotiations in 1917 ended with the dissolution of the Dual Monarchy.

The common army changed its label from ' to ' only in 1889 at the request of the Hungarian government.


There were three parts to the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire:


Hungary and Austria maintained separate <a href="parliament">parliament</a>s each with its own <a href="prime%20minister">prime minister</a>. Linking/co-ordinating the two parliaments fell to a government under the monarch. In this sense Austria-Hungary remained under an authoritarian government, as the Emperor-King appointed both Austrian and Hungarian Prime ministers along with their respective cabinets. This made both Governments responsible to the Emperor-King, as neither half could have a government with a program contrary to the views of the Monarch. The Emperor-King could appoint non-parliamentary governments, for example, or maintain in power a government which does not have a majority in Parliament to block the formation of another which he does not approve. The Monarch had other prerogatives such as the right of Royal Assent before any kind of Bill would be presented to the National Assembly (the common name for the Hungarian Diet), the right to Veto all legislation passed by the National Assembly, and the power to prorogue or dissolve the Assembly and call to new elections (he had the same prerogatives considering the Croatian-Slavonian Diet or Croatian Parliament, the common name for the Croatian-Slavonian Diet). In the Austrian half, however, the Monarchs's power was even greater, as the Emperor had the power to both appoint and dismiss its Prime minister and cabinet members. The monarch's common government, in which its ministers were appointed by the Monarch and responsible to him, had the responsibility for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">army</a>, for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">navy</a>, for foreign policy, and for the <a href="customs%20union">customs union</a>. Due to the lack of common law between Austria and Hungary, to conclude identical texts, each parliament elected 60 of its members to form a delegation that discussed motions of the Imperial and Royal ministries separately and worked towards a compromise.

A common Ministerial Council ruled the common government: it comprised the three ministers for the joint responsibilities (joint finance, military, and foreign policy), the two prime ministers, some Archdukes and the monarch. Two delegations of representatives (60–60 members), one each from the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, met separately and voted on the expenditures of the Common Ministerial Council giving the two governments influence in the common administration. However, the ministers ultimately answered only to the monarch who had the final decision on matters of foreign and military policy.

Overlapping responsibilities between the joint ministries and the ministries of the two halves caused friction and inefficiencies. The armed forces suffered particularly from overlap. Although the unified government determined the overall military direction, the Austrian and Hungarian governments each remained in charge of recruiting, supplies and training. Each government could have a strong influence over common governmental responsibilities. Each half of the Dual Monarchy proved quite prepared to disrupt common operations to advance its own interests.

Relations during the half-century after 1867 between the two parts of the dual monarchy featured repeated disputes over shared external tariff arrangements and over the financial contribution of each government to the common treasury. Under the terms of the "Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867", an agreement renegotiated every ten years, determined these matters. There was political turmoil during the build-up to each renewal of the agreement. The disputes culminated in the early 1900s in a prolonged <a href="constitutional%20crisis">constitutional crisis</a>. It was triggered by disagreement over which language to use for command in <a href="Military%20of%20Hungary">Hungarian army</a> units, and deepened by the advent to power in Budapest in April 1906 of a Hungarian nationalist coalition. Provisional renewals of the common arrangements occurred in October 1907 and in November 1917 on the basis of the "status quo".

The judicial power was independent of the administrative power. After 1868 (Croatian-Hungarian Settlement), Croatia-Slavonia had its own independent judicial system (the Table of Seven was the court of last instance for Croatia-Slavonia with final civil and criminal jurisdiction). The judicial authorities in Hungary were:

The organization of the administrative system in the Austrian Empire was complicated by the fact that between the State and the purely local communal administration there intruded yet a third element, grounded in history, the territories (Länder). The State administration comprised all affairs having relation to rights, duties and interests "which are common to all territories"; all other administrative tasks were left to the territories. Finally, the communes had self-government within their own sphere.

To this division of the work of administration corresponded a three-fold organization of the authorities: State, territorial and communal. The State authorities were divided on geographical lines into central, intermediate and local, and side by side with this there was a division of the offices for the transaction of business according to the various branches of the administration. The central authorities, which as early as the 18th century worked together in a common mother cell of the State chancery, became differentiated so soon as the growing tasks of administration called for specialization; in 1869 there were seven departments, and in the concluding decade of the Austrian Empire there were set up Ministries of Labour, Food, Public Health and Social Care. Under these ministries came the Statthalter, whose administrative area had ordinarily the proportions of a Crown territory (Kronland); but the immense variations in area of the Crown territories made a uniform and consistent intermediate administrative organization practically impossible. The lowest administrative unit was the political sub-district ("Bezirk") under an official ("Bezirkshauptmann"), who united nearly all the administrative functions which were divided among the various ministries according to their attributions.

Side by side with the State administration certain Crown territory administrations also existed in the 17 Crown territories, carried on by selected honorary officials, having under them a staff of professional officials. Many branches of the territorial administration had great similarities with those of the State, so that their spheres of activity frequently overlapped and came into collision. This administrative "double track", as it was called, led, it is true, in many cases to lively emulation, but was on the whole highly extravagant. The evils of this complicated system are obvious, and easy to condemn. They can be explained, partly by the origin of the State – for the most part through a voluntary union of countries possessed by a strong sense of their own individuality – partly by the influence in Austria of the Germanic spirit, well understood by the Slays, which has nothing of the Latin tendency to reduce all questions of administration to clear-cut formulae as part of a logically consistent system. Like the English administrative system, the Austrian presented a rich variety, a variety indeed so rich that it clamoured for drastic reform.

Bienerth's last act as premier in May 1911 was the appointment of a commission nominated by the Emperor, to draw up a scheme of administrative reform. So early as 1904 KOrber had declared a complete change in the principles of administration to be essential if the machinery of State were to continue working. After seven years of inaction, however, this imperial rescript was pitched in a far lower key. The continuous progress of society, it said, had made increased demands on the administration, that is to say, it was assumed that reform was not demanded so much by the defects of the administration but by the progress of the times, not because the administration was bad, but because life was better. It was an attempt to reform the administration without first reforming the State on equivalent lines.

A reform commission without a programme naturally first occupied itself with reforms about which there was no controversy. After a year had gone by it drew up "Proposals for the training of State officials". After another two years it had indeed brought to light carefully prepared material for study, which was of great scientific value; but its proposals. though politically of importance, did not provide any basis for reform on a large scale. And so when the World War broke out the commission dispersed without practical results, leaving behind it an imposing array of folio volumes of great scientific value. It was not till March 1918 that the Seidler Government decided upon a programme of national autonomy as a basis for administrative reform, which was, however, never carried into effect.

Since 1867 the administrative and political divisions of the lands belonging to the Hungarian crown have been in great measure remodelled. In 1868 Transylvania was definitely reunited to Hungary proper, and the town and district of Fiume declared autonomous. In 1873 part of the "Military Frontier" was united with Hungary proper and part with Croatia-Slavonia. Hungary proper, according to ancient usage, was generally divided into four great divisions or circles, and Transylvania up to 1876 was regarded as the fifth. In 1876 a general system of counties was introduced. According to this division Hungary proper is divided into seven circles, of which Transylvania forms one. The whole country is divided into the following counties:

(a) The circle on the left bank of the Danube contains eleven counties: (1) Árva, (2) Bars, (3) Esztergom, (4) Hont, (5) Liptó, (6) Nógrád, (7) Nyitra, (8) Pozsony (9) Trencsén, (10) Túrócz and (11) Zólyom.

(b) The circle on the right bank of the Danube contains eleven counties: Baranya, Fejér, Győr, Komárom, Moson, Somogy, Sopron, Tolna, Vas, Veszprém and Zala.

(c) The circle between the Danube and Tisza contains five counties: Bács-Bodrog, Csongrád, Heves, Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok and Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun.

(d) The circle on the right bank of the Tisza contains eight counties: Abaúj-Torna, Bereg, Borsod, Gömör-es Kis-Hont, Sáros, Szepes, Ung, Zemplén.

(e) The circle on the left bank of the Tisza contains eight counties: Békés, Bihar, Hajdú, Máramaros, Szabolcs, Szatmár, Szilágy and Ugocsa.

(f) The circle between the Tisza and the Maros contains five counties: Arad, Csanád, Krassó-Szörény, Temes and Torontál.

(g) Transylvania contains fifteen counties: Also-Fehér, Besztercze-Naszód, Brassó, Csík, Fogaras, Háromszek, Hunyad, Kis-Küküllő, Kolozs, Maros-Torda, Nagy-Küküllő, Szeben, Szolnok-Doboka, Torda-Aranyos and Udvarhely.

Fiume town and district forms a separate division.

Croatia-Slavonia is divided into eight counties: Bjelovar-Križevci, Lika-Krbava, Modrus-Fiume, Pozega, Srijemska, Varaždin, Virovitica and Zagreb.

In regard to local government, the country was divided into municipalities or counties, which possessed a certain amount of self-government. Hungary proper was divided into sixty-three rural, and—including Fiume—twenty-six urban municipalities (see section on Administrative Divisions). These urban municipalities were towns which for their local government were independent of the counties in which they were situated, and have, therefore, a larger amount of municipal autonomy than the communes or the other towns. The administration of the municipalities is carried on by an official appointed by the king, aided by a representative body. Since 1876 each municipality had a council of twenty members to exercise control over its administration. According to this division Hungary proper is divided into seven circles.

Besides these sixty-three rural counties for Hungary, and eight for Croatia-Slavonia, Hungary had twenty-six urban counties or towns with municipal rights. These were: Arad, Baja, Debreczen, Győr, Hódmezővásárhely, Kassa, Kecskemét, Kolozsvár, Komárom, Marosvásárhely, Nagyvárad, Pancsova, Pécs, Pozsony, Selmecz- és Bélabanya, Sopron, Szabadka, Szatmárnémeti, Szeged, Székesfehervár, Temesvár, Újvidék, Versecz, Zombor, the town of Fiume and Budapest, the capital of the country.

In Croatia-Slavonia there are four urban counties or towns with municipal rights namely: Osijek, Varaždin and Zagreb and Zemun.

The first prime minister of Hungary after the Compromise was Count <a href="Gyula%20Andr%C3%A1ssy">Gyula Andrássy</a> (1867–1871). The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph was crowned as King of Hungary. Andrássy next served as the Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary (1871–1879).

The Empire relied increasingly on a cosmopolitan bureaucracy—in which Czechs played an important role—backed by loyal elements, including a large part of the German, Hungarian, Polish and Croat aristocracy.

The traditional aristocracy and land-based gentry class gradually faced increasingly wealthy men of the cities, who achieved wealth through trade and industrialization. The urban middle and upper class tended to seek their own power and supported progressive movements in the aftermath of revolutions in Europe. They were described as "leftist liberals" and their representatives began to be elected to the parliaments of Vienna and Budapest. These leftist liberal parliamentary parties were backed by the big industrialists, bankers, businessmen and the predominant majority of newspaper publishers.

As in the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire frequently used liberal economic policies and practices. From the 1860s, businessmen succeeded in industrializing parts of the Empire. Newly prosperous members of the <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> erected large homes, and began to take prominent roles in urban life that rivaled the aristocracy's. In the early period, they encouraged the government to seek foreign investment to build up infrastructure, such as railroads, in aid of industrialization, transportation and communications, and development.

The influence of liberals in Austria, most of them ethnic Germans, weakened under the leadership of <a href="Eduard%20Taaffe%2C%2011th%20Viscount%20Taaffe">Count Eduard von Taaffe</a>, the Austrian prime minister from 1879 to 1893. Taaffe used a coalition of clergy, conservatives and Slavic parties to weaken the liberals. In <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, for example, he authorized <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a> as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system, thus breaking the German speakers' monopoly on holding office. Such reforms encouraged other ethnic groups to push for greater autonomy as well. By playing nationalities off one another, the government ensured the monarchy's central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change.

During the First World War, rising national sentiments and labour movements contributed to strikes, protests and civil unrest in the Empire. After the war, republican, national parties contributed to the disintegration and collapse of the monarchy in Austria and Hungary. Republics were established in Vienna and Budapest.

 
In July 1849, the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament proclaimed and enacted ethnic and minority rights. (The next such laws were in Switzerland), but these were overturned after the Russian and Austrian armies crushed the Hungarian Revolution. After the Kingdom of Hungary reached the Compromise with the Habsburg Dynasty in 1867, one of the first acts of its restored Parliament was to pass a Law on Nationalities (Act Number XLIV of 1868). It was a liberal piece of legislation, and offered extensive language and cultural rights. It did not recognize non-Hungarians to have rights to form states with any territorial autonomy.

The "Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867" created the semi-independent states of Hungary and Austria linked by personal union under a common monarch. The Hungarian majority asserted more of their identity within the Kingdom of Hungary. The nationalism of German-speakers prevalent in the Empire of Austria created tension between <a href="ethnic%20Germans">ethnic Germans</a> and <a href="Czechs">ethnic Czechs</a>. In addition, the emergence of <a href="nation">national identity</a> in the newly independent Romania and Serbia also contributed to ethnic issues in the empire.

Article 19 of the 1867 "Basic State Act" ("Staatsgrundgesetz"), valid only for the Cisleithanian (Austrian) part of Austria-Hungary, said:
The implementation of this principle led to several disputes, as it was not clear which languages could be regarded as "customary". The Germans, the traditional bureaucratic, capitalist and cultural elite, demanded the recognition of their language as a customary language in every part of the empire. Italian was regarded as an old "culture language" ("") by German intellectuals and had always been granted <a href="Social%20equality">equal rights</a> as an <a href="official%20language">official language</a> of the Empire, but the Germans had difficulty in accepting the <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic languages</a> as equal to their own. On one occasion <a href="Count%20Anton%20Alexander%20von%20Auersperg">Count A. Auersperg</a> (Anastasius Grün) entered the Diet of <a href="Carniola">Carniola</a> carrying what he claimed to be the whole <a href="text%20corpus">corpus</a> of <a href="Slovene%20literature">Slovene literature</a> under his arm; this was to demonstrate that the <a href="Slovene%20language">Slovene language</a> could not be substituted for German as the language of higher education.

The following years saw official recognition of several languages, at least in Austria. From 1867, laws awarded <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a> equal status with Italian in <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>. From 1882, there was a Slovene majority in the Diet of Carniola and in the capital <a href="Ljubljana">Laibach (Ljubljana)</a>; they ruled to replace German with Slovene as their primary official language. <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia%20and%20Lodomeria">Galicia</a> designated Polish instead of German in 1869 as the customary language of government. The Poles systematically disregarded the large <a href="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> minority in their territory, and did not grant <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a> the status of an official language.

The language disputes were most fiercely fought in <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, where the Czech speakers formed a majority and sought equal status for their language to German. The <a href="Czechs">Czechs</a> had lived primarily in <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> since the 6th century and German immigrants had begun settling the Bohemian periphery since the 13th century. The constitution of 1627 made the German language a second official language and equal to Czech. German speakers lost their majority in the Bohemian Diet in 1880 and became a minority to Czech speakers in the cities of <a href="Prague">Prague</a> and <a href="Plze%C5%88">Pilsen</a> (while retaining a slight numerical majority in the city of <a href="Brno">Brno (Brünn)</a>). The old <a href="Charles%20University%20in%20Prague">Charles University in Prague</a>, hitherto dominated by German speakers, was divided into German and Czech-speaking faculties in 1882.

At the same time, Hungarian dominance faced challenges from the local majorities of <a href="Romanians">Romanians</a> in <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a> and in the eastern <a href="Banat">Banat</a>, <a href="Slovaks">Slovaks</a> in today's <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>, and <a href="Croats">Croats</a> and <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a> in the crown lands of <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> and of <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> (today's Croatia), in <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, and in the provinces known as the <a href="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> (today's northern <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>). The Romanians and the Serbs began to agitate for union with their fellow nationalists and language speakers in the newly founded states of <a href="Romania">Romania</a> (1859–78) and Serbia.

Hungary's leaders were generally less willing than their Austrian counterparts to share power with their subject minorities, but they granted a large measure of autonomy to <a href="Triune%20Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%2C%20Slavonia%2C%20and%20Dalmatia">Croatia</a> in 1868. To some extent, they modelled their relation to that kingdom on their own compromise with Austria of the previous year. In spite of nominal autonomy, the Croatian government was an economic and administrative part of Hungary, which the Croatians resented. In the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Croatia-Slavonia">Triune Kingdom of Croatia</a> and Bosnia and Herzegovina many advocated the idea of a <a href="Trialism%20in%20Austria-Hungary">trialist Austro-Hungaro-Croatian</a> monarchy among the supporters of the idea where <a href="Archduke%20Leopold%20Salvator%20of%20Austria">Archduke Leopold Salvator</a>, <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> and emperor and king <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Austria">Charles I. (IV.)</a> who during his short reign supported the trialist idea only to be vetoed by the Hungarian government and Count <a href="Istvan%20Tisza">Istvan Tisza</a>. The count finally signed the trialist proclamation after heavy pressure from the king on 23 October 1918. one day after the king.

Language was one of the most contentious issues in Austro-Hungarian politics. All governments faced difficult and divisive hurdles in deciding on the languages of government and of instruction. The minorities sought the widest opportunities for education in their own languages, as well as in the "dominant" languages—Hungarian and German. By the "Ordinance of 5 April 1897", the Austrian Prime Minister <a href="Count%20Kasimir%20Felix%20Badeni">Count Kasimir Felix Badeni</a> gave Czech equal standing with German in the internal government of <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>; this led to a crisis because of nationalist German agitation throughout the empire. The Crown dismissed Badeni.

The Hungarian Minority Act of 1868 gave the minorities (Slovaks, Romanians, Serbs, et al.) individual (but not also communal) rights to use their language in offices, schools (although in practice often only in those founded by them and not by the state), courts and municipalities (if 20% of the deputies demanded it). From June 1907, all public and <a href="private%20school">private school</a>s in Hungary were obliged to ensure that <a href="Magyarization">after the fourth grade, the pupils could express themselves fluently in Hungarian</a>. This led to the closing of several minority schools, devoted mostly to the Slovak and Rusyn languages.

The two kingdoms sometimes divided their <a href="sphere%20of%20influence">spheres of influence</a>. According to <a href="Misha%20Glenny">Misha Glenny</a> in his book, "The Balkans, 1804–1999", the Austrians responded to Hungarian support of Czechs by supporting the Croatian national movement in <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>.

In recognition that he reigned in a multi-ethnic country, Emperor Franz Joseph spoke (and used) German, Hungarian and Czech fluently, and Croatian, Serbian, Polish and Italian to some degree.

In 1914, Jews in the empire numbered about two million; their position was ambiguous. <a href="Antisemitism">Antisemitic</a> parties and movements existed, but the governments of Vienna and Budapest did not initiate <a href="pogroms">pogroms</a> or implement official antisemitic policies. They feared that such <a href="ethnic%20violence">ethnic violence</a> could ignite other <a href="minority%20group">ethnic minorities</a> and escalate out of control. The antisemitic parties remained on the periphery of the political sphere due to their low popularity among voters in the parliamentary elections.

In that period, the majority of Jews in Austria-Hungary lived in small towns ("<a href="shtetls">shtetls</a>") in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia%20and%20Lodomeria">Galicia</a> and rural areas in Hungary and Bohemia, although there were large communities in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and other large cities. Of the pre-World War military forces of the major European powers, the Austro-Hungarian army was almost alone in its regular promotion of Jews to positions of command. While the Jewish population of the lands of the Dual Monarchy was about five percent, Jews made up nearly eighteen percent of the reserve officer corps. Thanks to the constitution's modern laws and to the benevolence of emperor Franz Joseph, the Austrian Jews came to regard the era of Austria-Hungary as a golden era of their history. By 1910 about 900,000 Jews made up approximately 5 percent of the population of Hungary and about 23 percent of Budapest's citizenry. Jews accounted for 54 percent of commercial business owners, 85 percent of financial institution directors and owners, and 62 percent of all employees in commerce

 
The minister of foreign affairs conducted the foreign relations of the Dual Monarchy, and negotiated treaties.

The Dual Monarchy was created in the wake of a losing war in 1866 with Prussia and Italy. To rebuild Habsburg prestige and gain revenge against Prussia, <a href="Count%20Friedrich%20Ferdinand%20von%20Beust">Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust</a> became foreign secretary. He hated Prussia's diplomat, <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>, who had repeatedly outmaneuvered him. Beust looked to France and negotiated with Emperor <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> and Italy for an anti-Prussian alliance. No terms could be reached. The decisive victory of Prusso-German armies in the war of 1870 with France and the founding of the German Empire ended all hope of revenge and Beust retired.

After being forced out of Germany and Italy, the Dual Monarchy turned to the Balkans, which were in tumult as nationalistic efforts were trying to end the rule of the Ottomans. Both Russia and Austria-Hungary saw an opportunity to expand in this region. Russia in particular took on the role of protector of the Slavs and the orthodox Christians. Austria envisioned a multi-ethnic, religiously diverse empire under Vienna's control. Count <a href="Gyula%20Andr%C3%A1ssy">Gyula Andrássy</a>, a Hungarian who was Foreign Minister (1871 to 1879), made the centerpiece of his policy one of opposition to Russian expansion in the Balkans and blocking Serbian ambitions to dominate a new South Slav federation. He wanted Germany to ally with Austria, not Russia.

When Russia defeated Turkey in a war the resulting <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a> was seen in Austria as much too favourable for Russia and its Orthodox-Slavic goals. The <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> in 1878 let Austria occupy (but not annex) the province of <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, a predominantly Slavic area. In 1914, Slavic militants in Bosnia rejected Austria's plan to fully absorb the area; they <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">assassinated the Austrian heir</a> and precipitated World War I.

The Austro-Hungarian economy changed dramatically during the Dual Monarchy. The <a href="capitalism">capitalist</a> way of production spread throughout the Empire during its 50-year existence, replacing medieval institutions. <a href="Technological%20change">Technological change</a> accelerated <a href="industrialization">industrialization</a> and <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a>. The first Austrian stock exchange (the <a href="Wiener%20B%C3%B6rse">Wiener Börse</a>) was opened in 1771 in Vienna, the first stock exchange of the Kingdom of Hungary (the <a href="Budapest%20Stock%20Exchange">Budapest Stock Exchange</a>) was opened in Budapest in 1864. The <a href="central%20bank">central bank</a> (Bank of issue) was founded as Austrian National Bank in 1816. In 1878, it transformed into Austro-Hungarian National Bank with principal offices in both Vienna and Budapest. The central bank was governed by alternating Austrian or Hungarian governors and vice-governors.

The <a href="Measures%20of%20national%20income%20and%20output">gross national product</a> per capita grew roughly 1.76% per year from 1870 to 1913. That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%). However, in a comparison with Germany and Britain, the Austro-Hungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later. Like the German Empire, that of Austria-Hungary frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices. In 1873, the old Hungarian capital Buda and Óbuda (Ancient Buda) were officially merged with the third city, Pest, thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into Hungary's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period. Economic growth centered on Vienna and Budapest, the Austrian lands (areas of modern Austria), the Alpine region and the Bohemian lands. In the later years of the 19th century, rapid economic growth spread to the central <a href="Great%20Hungarian%20Plain">Hungarian plain</a> and to the Carpathian lands. As a result, wide disparities of development existed within the empire. In general, the western areas became more developed than the eastern. The Kingdom of Hungary became the world's second largest flour exporter after the United States. The large Hungarian food exports were not limited to neighbouring Germany and Italy: Hungary became the most important foreign food supplier of the large cities and industrial centres of the United Kingdom.

However, by the end of the 19th century, economic differences gradually began to even out as economic growth in the eastern parts of the monarchy consistently surpassed that in the western. The strong agriculture and <a href="food%20industry">food industry</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a> with the centre of <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> became predominant within the empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around <a href="Prague">Prague</a> and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This <a href="division%20of%20labour">division of labour</a> between the east and west, besides the existing <a href="economic%20and%20monetary%20union">economic and monetary union</a>, led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria-Hungary by the early 20th century. However, since the turn of the twentieth century, the Austrian half of the Monarchy could preserve its dominance within the empire in the sectors of the <a href="first%20industrial%20revolution">first industrial revolution</a>, but Hungary had a better position in the industries of the <a href="second%20industrial%20revolution">second industrial revolution</a>, in these modern sectors of the second industrial revolution the Austrian competition could not become dominant.

The empire's <a href="heavy%20industry">heavy industry</a> had mostly focused on machine building, especially for the <a href="electric%20power%20industry">electric power industry</a>, <a href="History%20of%20rail%20transport">locomotive industry</a> and <a href="automotive%20industry">automotive industry</a>, while in <a href="light%20industry">light industry</a> the <a href="precision%20mechanics">precision mechanics</a> industry was the most dominant. Through the years leading up to <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> the country became the 4th biggest machine manufacturer in the world.

The two most important trading partners were traditionally Germany (1910: 48% of all exports, 39% of all imports), and Great Britain (1910: almost 10% of all exports, 8% of all imports), the third most important partner was the United States, it followed by Russia, France, Switzerland, Romania, the Balkan states and South America. Trade with the geographically neighbouring Russia, however, had a relatively low weight (1910: 3% of all exports /mainly machinery for Russia, 7% of all imports /mainly raw materials from Russia).

Prior to World War I, the Austrian Empire had five car manufacturer companies. These were: <a href="Austro-Daimler">Austro-Daimler</a> in Wiener-Neustadt (cars trucks, buses), <a href="Gr%C3%A4f%20%26amp%3B%20Stift">Gräf & Stift</a> in Vienna (cars), <a href="Laurin%20%26amp%3B%20Klement">Laurin & Klement</a> in <a href="Mlad%C3%A1%20Boleslav">Mladá Boleslav</a> (motorcycles, cars), <a href="Tatra%20%28company%29">Nesselsdorfer</a> in Nesselsdorf (<a href="Kop%C5%99ivnice">Kopřivnice</a>), Moravia (automobiles), and <a href="Lohner-Werke">Lohner-Werke</a> in Vienna (cars). Austrian car production started in 1897.

Prior to World War I, the Kingdom of Hungary had four car manufacturer companies. These were: the <a href="Ganz%20company">Ganz company</a> in Budapest, <a href="Raba%20%28automobile%29">RÁBA Automobile</a> in <a href="Gy%C5%91r">Győr</a>, MÁG (later <a href="Magomobil">Magomobil</a>) in Budapest, and MARTA (<a href="Astra%20Automobile%20%26amp%3B%20Waggon%20Factory">Hungarian Automobile Joint-stock Company Arad</a>) in <a href="Arad%2C%20Romania">Arad</a>. Hungarian car production started in 1900. Automotive factories in the Kingdom of Hungary manufactured motorcycles, cars, taxicabs, trucks and buses.

The first airplane in Austria was <a href="Edvard%20Rusjan">Edvard Rusjan</a>'s design, the <a href="Eda%20I">Eda I</a>, which had its maiden flight in the vicinity of <a href="Gorizia">Gorizia</a> on 25 November 1909.

The first Hungarian hydrogen filled experimental ballons were built by István Szabik and József Domin in 1784.
The first Hungarian designed and produced airplane (powered by Hungarian built <a href="inline%20engine%20%28aviation%29">inline engine</a>) was flown at Rákosmező on 4 November 1909. The earliest Hungarian radial engine powered airplane was built in 1913. Between 1913 and 1918, the Hungarian aircraft industry began developing. The three greatest: <a href="UFAG">UFAG</a> Hungarian Aircraft Factory (1914), Hungarian General Aircraft Factory (1916), Hungarian Lloyd Aircraft, Engine Factory at <a href="Asz%C3%B3d">Aszód</a> (1916), and Marta in Arad (1914). During the First World War, fighter planes, bombers and reconnaissance planes were produced in these factories. The most important aeroengine factories were Weiss Manfred Works, GANZ Works, and Hungarian Automobile Joint-stock Company Arad.

The locomotive (steam engines and wagons, bridge and iron structures) factories were installed in Vienna (<a href="Lokomotivfabrik%20der%20StEG">Locomotive Factory of the State Railway Company</a>, founded in 1839), in <a href="Wiener%20Neustadt">Wiener Neustadt</a> (<a href="Wiener%20Neust%C3%A4dter%20Lokomotivfabrik">New Vienna Locomotive Factory</a>, founded in 1841), and in Floridsdorf (<a href="Lokomotivfabrik%20Floridsdorf">Floridsdorf Locomotive Factory</a>, founded in 1869).

The Hungarian Locomotive (engines and wagons bridge and iron structures) factories were the <a href="M%C3%81VAG">MÁVAG</a> company in Budapest (steam engines and wagons) and the <a href="Ganz%20company">Ganz company</a> in Budapest (steam engines, wagons, the production of <a href="electric%20locomotive">electric locomotive</a>s and electric trams started from 1894). and the <a href="R%C3%A1ba%20%28company%29">RÁBA Company</a> in <a href="Gy%C5%91r">Győr</a>.

By 1913, the combined length of the railway tracks of the Austrian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary reached . In Western Europe only Germany had more extended railway network (); the Austro-Hungarian Empire was followed by France (), the United Kingdom (), Italy () and Spain ().

<a href="Rail%20transport">Rail transport</a> expanded rapidly in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its <a href="predecessor%20state">predecessor state</a>, the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Empire</a>, had built a substantial core of railways in the west, originating from Vienna, by 1841. Austria's <a href="Emperor%20Ferdinand%20Northern%20Railway">first steam railway</a> from Vienna to <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a> with its terminus in <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a> (Bochnie) was opened in 1839. The first train travelled from Vienna to Lundenburg (Břeclav) on 6 June 1839 and one month later between the imperial capital in Vienna and the capital of Moravia <a href="Brno">Brünn</a> (Brno) on 7 July. At that point, the government realized the military possibilities of rail and began to invest heavily in construction. <a href="Pozsony">Pozsony</a> (<a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>), <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>, <a href="Graz">Graz</a>, Laibach (<a href="Ljubljana">Ljubljana</a>) and <a href="Venice">Venedig</a> (<a href="Venice">Venice</a>) became linked to the main network. By 1854, the empire had almost of track, about 60–70% of it in state hands. The government then began to sell off large portions of track to private investors to recoup some of its investments and because of the financial strains of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">1848 Revolution</a> and of the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>.

From 1854 to 1879, private interests conducted almost all rail construction. What would become Cisleithania gained of track, and Hungary built of track. During this time, many new areas joined the railway system and the existing rail networks gained connections and interconnections. This period marked the beginning of widespread rail transportation in Austria-Hungary, and also the integration of transportation systems in the area. Railways allowed the empire to integrate its economy far more than previously possible, when transportation depended on rivers.

After 1879, the Austrian and the Hungarian governments slowly began to renationalize their rail networks, largely because of the sluggish pace of development during the worldwide <a href="depression%20%28economics%29">depression</a> of the 1870s. Between 1879 and 1900, more than of railways were built in Cisleithania and Hungary. Most of this constituted "filling in" of the existing network, although some areas, primarily in the far east, gained rail connections for the first time. The railway reduced transportation costs throughout the empire, opening new markets for products from other lands of the Dual Monarchy. In 1914, of a total of of railway tracks in Austria, (82%) were state owned.

The first Hungarian steam locomotive railway line was opened on 15 July 1846 between <a href="Pest%2C%20Hungary">Pest</a> and <a href="V%C3%A1c">Vác</a>. In 1890 most large Hungarian private railway companies were nationalized as a consequence of the poor management of private companies, except the strong Austrian-owned Kaschau-Oderberg Railway (KsOd) and the Austrian-Hungarian Southern Railway (SB/DV). They also joined the zone tariff system of the MÁV (Hungarian State Railways). By 1910, the total length of the rail networks of Hungarian Kingdom reached , the Hungarian network linked more than 1,490 settlements. Nearly half (52%) of the empire's railways were built in Hungary, thus the railroad density there became higher than that of Cisleithania. This has ranked Hungarian railways the 6th most dense in the world (ahead of countries as Germany or France).

<a href="Horse-drawn%20tramway">Horse-drawn tramway</a>s appeared in the first half of the 19th century. Between the 1850s and 1880s many were built. <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> (1865), Budapest (1866), Brno (1869). Steam trams appeared in the late 1860s. The electrification of tramways started from the late 1880s. The first electrified tramway in Austria-Hungary was built in Budapest in 1887.

Electric tramway lines in the Kingdom of Hungary:



The <a href="Budapest%20Metro">Budapest metro</a> Line 1 (originally the "Franz Joseph Underground Electric Railway Company") is the second oldest underground railway in the world (the first being the London Underground's Metropolitan Line), and the first on the European mainland. It was built from 1894 to 1896 and opened on 2 May 1896. In 2002, it was listed as a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>.

In 1900 the engineer C. Wagenführer drew up plans to link the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> and the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> by a canal from Vienna to Trieste. It was born from the desire of Austria-Hungary to have a direct link to the Adriatic Sea but was never constructed.

In 1831 a plan had already been drafted to make the passage navigable, at the initiative of the Hungarian politician <a href="Istv%C3%A1n%20Sz%C3%A9chenyi">István Széchenyi</a>. Finally <a href="G%C3%A1bor%20Baross">Gábor Baross</a>, Hungary's "Iron Minister", succeeded in financing this project. The riverbed rocks and the associated rapids made the gorge valley an infamous passage for shipping. In German, the passage is still known as the Kataraktenstrecke, even though the cataracts are gone. Near the actual "<a href="Iron%20Gates">Iron Gates</a>" strait the Prigrada rock was the most important obstacle until 1896: the river widened considerably here and the water level was consequently low. Upstream, the Greben rock near the "Kazan" gorge was notorious.

The length of the <a href="Tisza">Tisza</a> in Hungary used to be . It flowed through the <a href="Great%20Hungarian%20Plain">Great Hungarian Plain</a>, which is one of the largest flat areas in central Europe. Since plains can cause a river to flow very slowly, the Tisza used to follow a path with many curves and turns, which led to many large floods in the area.

After several small-scale attempts, István Széchenyi organised the "regulation of the Tisza" (Hungarian: a Tisza szabályozása) which started on August 27, 1846, and substantially ended in 1880. The new length of the river in Hungary was ( total), with of "dead channels" and of new riverbed. The resultant length of the flood-protected river comprises (out of of all Hungarian protected rivers).

The first Hungarian steamship was built by Antal Bernhard in 1817, called S.S. "Carolina". It was also the first steamship in Habsburg ruled states. However it was Count <a href="Istv%C3%A1n%20Sz%C3%A9chenyi">István Széchenyi</a> (with the help of Austrian ship's company <a href="Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft">Erste Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft</a> (DDSG)), who established the Óbuda Shipyard on the Hungarian <a href="Haj%C3%B3gy%C3%A1ri%20Island">Hajógyári Island</a> in 1835, which was the first industrial scale steamship building company in the Habsburg Empire.

The most significant seaport was <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> (today part of Italy), where the Austrian merchant marine was based. In addition, the two major shipping companies (Austrian Lloyd and Austro-Americana) and several shipyards were located there. The k.u.k. navy used the port's shipyards to construct new naval ships. This port grew as Venice declined. From 1815 to 1866, Venice was included within the monarchy and was prevented from competing with Austrian-ruled ports. The merchant marine did not develop until Venice's shipping interest declined. The navy became significant during the time of the k.u.k. monarchy, as industrialization and development provided sufficient revenues to develop it.

The most important seaport for the Hungarian part of the k.u.k. was Fiume (<a href="Rijeka">Rijeka</a>, today part of Croatia), where the Hungarian shipping companies, such as the Adria, operated. The largest Hungarian shipbuilding company was the Ganz-Danubius. Another significant seaport was Pola (<a href="Pula">Pula</a>, today part of Croatia) – especially for the navy. In 1889, the Austrian merchant marine consisted of 10,022 ships, with 7,992 fishing vessels. The coast and sea trade had a total of 1,859 sailboats with crews of 6,489 men and a load capacity of 140,838 tons; and 171 steamers with a load capacity of 96,323 tons and a crew of 3,199 men.

The first Danubian steamer company, Donau-Dampfschiffahrt-Gesellschaft (DDSG), was the largest inland shipping company in the world until the collapse of the k.u.k. The Austrian Lloyd was one of the biggest ocean shipping companies of the time. Prior to the beginning of World War I, the company owned 65 middle-sized and large steamers. The Austro-Americana owned one third of them, including the biggest Austrian passenger ship, the SS "Kaiser Franz Joseph I". In comparison to the Austrian Lloyd, the Austro-American concentrated on destinations in North and South America.

In 1847, the first telegraph connection (Vienna – Brno – Prague) started operation. The first telegraph station on Hungarian territory was opened in December 1847 in Pressburg/ Pozsony /<a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>/. In 1848, during the Hungarian Revolution, another telegraph centre was built in <a href="Buda">Buda</a> to connect the most important governmental centres. The first telegraph connection between Vienna and Pest–Buda (later Budapest) was constructed in 1850, and Vienna–Zagreb (capital of the Triune Kingdom of Croatia) in 1850. Austria joined a telegraph union with German states.

In 1884, 2,406 telegraph post offices operated in the Kingdom of Hungary. By 1914 the number of telegraph offices reached 3,000 in post offices and further 2,400 were installed in the railway stations of the Kingdom of Hungary.

The first <a href="telephone%20exchange">telephone exchange</a> was opened in Zagreb (8 January 1881), the second was in Budapest (1 May 1881), and the third was opened in Vienna (3 June 1881). Initially telephony was available in the homes of individual subscribers, companies and offices. Public telephone stations appeared in the 1890s, and they quickly became widespread in post offices and railway stations. Austria-Hungary had 568 million telephone calls in 1913; only two Western European countries had more phone calls: the German Empire and the United Kingdom. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was followed by France with 396 million telephone calls and Italy with 230 million phone calls.

In 1916, there were 366 million telephone calls in the Austrian half of the monarchy, among them 8.4 million long distant calls.

All telephone exchanges of the cities, towns and larger villages in Kingdom of Hungary were linked until 1893.
By 1914, more than 2000 settlements had telephone exchange in Kingdom of Hungary.

The <a href="Telefon%20H%C3%ADrmond%C3%B3">Telefon Hírmondó</a> (Telephone Herald) news and entertainment service was introduced in Budapest in 1893. Two decades before the introduction of radio broadcasting, people could listen to political, economic and sport news, cabaret, music and opera in Budapest daily. It operated over a special type of telephone exchange system.

The following data is based on the official Austro-Hungarian census conducted in 1910.
The census of 1910 recorded "Umgangssprache", everyday language. Jews and those using German in offices often stated German as their "Umgangssprache", even when having a different "Muttersprache". In "Hungary proper", 5% of the population were Jews, who were included in speakers of the Hungarian language.

In the Austrian Empire, 36.8% of the total population spoke German as their native language, and more than 71% of the inhabitants spoke some German. In the Kingdom of Hungary, 54.4% of the total population spoke Hungarian as their native language. Not counting autonomous Croatia, more than 64% of the inhabitants of the Hungarian Kingdom spoke Hungarian.

Note that some languages are considered dialects of more widely spoken languages. For example, <a href="Rusyn%20language">Rusyn</a> and <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a> were both counted as "<a href="Ruthenian%20language">Ruthenian</a>" in the census, and <a href="Rhaeto-Romance%20languages">Rhaeto-Romance languages</a> were counted as "Italian".

Primary and secondary schools

The organization of the Austrian elementary schools was based on the principle of compulsory school attendance, free education, and the imparting of public instruction in the child's own language. Side by side with these existed private schools. The proportion of children attending private schools to those attending the public elementary schools in 1912 was 144,000 to 4.5 millions, i.e. a thirtieth part. Hence the accusation of denationalizing children through the Schulvereine must be accepted with caution. The expenses of education were distributed as follows: the communes built the schoolhouses, the political sub-districts (Bezirke) paid the teachers, the Crown territory gave a grant, and the State appointed the inspectors. Since the State supervised the schools without maintaining them, it was able to increase its demands without being hampered by financial considerations. It is remarkable that the difference between the State educational estimates in Austria and in Hungary was one of 9.3 millions in the former as opposed to 67.6 in the latter. Under Austria, since everywhere that 40 scholars of one nationality were to be found within a radius of 5 km. a school had to be set up in which their language was used, national schools were assured even to linguistic minorities. It is true that this mostly happened at the expense of the German industrial communities, since the Slav labourers as immigrants acquired schools in their own language. The number of elementary schools increased from 19,016 in two to 24,713 in 1913; the number of scholars from 3,49 0, 000 in 1900 to 4,630,000 in 1913.

Universities in Austrian Empire

The first University in the Austrian half of the Empire (<a href="Charles%20University">Charles University</a>) was founded by <a href="Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">H.R. Emperor Charles IV</a> in Prague in 1347. The second oldest university (<a href="University%20of%20Vienna">University of Vienna</a>) was founded by <a href="Rudolf%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Duke Rudolph IV</a> in 1365.

The higher educational establishments, which in the middle of the 19th century had had a predominantly German character, underwent in Galicia a conversion into Polish national institutions, in Bohemia and Moravia a separation into German and Czech ones. Thus Germans, Czechs and Poles were provided for. But now the smaller nations also made their voices heard: the Ruthenians, Slovenes and Italians. The Ruthenians demanded at first, in view of the predominantly Ruthenian character of East Galicia, a national partition of the Polish university existing there. Since the Poles were at first unyielding, Ruthenian demonstrations and strikes of students arose, and the Ruthenians were no longer content with the reversion of a few separate professorial chairs, and with parallel courses of lectures. By a pact concluded on Jan. 28 1914 the Poles promised a Ruthenian university; but owing to the war the question lapsed. The Italians could hardly claim a university of their own on grounds of population (in 19to they numbered 783,000), but they claimed it all the more on grounds of their ancient culture. All parties were agreed that an Italian faculty of laws should be created; the difficulty lay in the choice of the place. The Italians demanded Trieste; but the Government was afraid to let this Adriatic port become the centre of an irredenta; moreover the Southern Sla y s of the city wished it kept free from an Italian educational establishment. Bienerth in 1910 brought about a compromise; namely, that it should be founded at once, the situation to be provisionally in Vienna, and to be transferred within four years to Italian national territory. The German National Union (Nationalverband) agreed to extend temporary hospitality to the Italian university in Vienna, but the Southern Slav Hochschule Club demanded a guarantee that a later transfer to the coast provinces should not be contemplated, together with the simultaneous foundation of Slovene professorial chairs in Prague and Cracow, and preliminary steps towards the foundation of a Southern Slav university in Laibach. But in spite of the constant renewal of negotiations for a compromise it was impossible to arrive at any agreement, until the outbreak of war left all the projects for a Ruthenian university at Lemberg, a Slovene one in Laibach, and a second Czech one in Moravia, unrealized.

Primary and secondary schools

One of the first measures of newly established Hungarian government was to provide supplementary schools of a non-denominational character. By a law passed in 1868 attendance at school is obligatory on all children between the ages of 6 and 12 years. The communes or parishes are bound to maintain elementary schools, and they are entitled to levy an additional tax of 5% on the state taxes for their maintenance. But the number of state-aided elementary schools is continually increasing, as the spread of the Magyar language to the other races through the medium of the elementary schools is one of the principal concerns of the Hungarian government, and is vigorously pursued.' In 1902 there were in Hungary 18,729 elementary schools with 32,020 teachers, attended by 2,573,377 pupils, figures which compare favourably with those of 1877, when there were 15,486 schools with 20,717 teachers, attended by 1,559,636 pupils. In about 61% of these schools the language used was exclusively Magyar, in about 6 20% it was mixed, and in the remainder some non-Magyar language was used. In 1902, 80.56% of the children of school age actually attended school. Since 1891 infant schools, for children between the ages of 3 and 6 years, have been maintained either by the communes or by the state.

The public instruction of Hungary contains three other groups of educational institutions: middle or secondary schools, " high schools " and technical schools. The middle schools comprise classical schools (gymnasia) which are preparatory for the universities and other " high schools," and modern schools (Realschulen) preparatory for the technical schools. Their course of study is generally eight years, and they are maintained mostly by the state. The state-maintained gymnasia are mostly of recent foundation, but some schools maintained by the various churches have been in existence for three, or sometimes four, centuries. The number of middle schools in 1902 was 243 with 4705 teachers, attended by 71,788 pupils; in 1880 their number was 185, attended by 40,747 pupils.

Universities in Kingdom of Hungary

In the year 1276, the university of Veszprém was destroyed by the troops of <a href="P%C3%A9ter%20Cs%C3%A1k">Péter Csák</a> and it was never rebuilt. A university was established by <a href="Louis%20I%20of%20Hungary">Louis I of Hungary</a> in Pécs in 1367. Sigismund established a university at Óbuda in 1395. Another, Universitas Istropolitana, was established 1465 in Pozsony (now Bratislava in Slovakia) by <a href="Mattias%20Corvinus">Mattias Corvinus</a>. None of these medieval universities survived the Ottoman wars. Nagyszombat University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it is called Eötvös Loránd University today. The world's first institute of technology was founded in Selmecbánya, Kingdom of Hungary (since 1920 Banská Štiavnica, now Slovakia) in 1735. Its legal successor is the University of Miskolc in Hungary. The Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure. Its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II.

The high schools include the universities, of which Hungary possesses Five, all maintained by the state: at Budapest (founded in 1635), at Kolozsvár (founded in 1872), and at Zagreb (founded in 1874). Newer universities were established in Debrecen in 1912, and Pozsony university was reestablished after a half millennium in 1912. They have four faculties: of theology, law, philosophy and medicine (the university at Zagreb was without a faculty of medicine). There are besides ten high schools of law, called academies, which in 1900 were attended by 1569 pupils. The Polytechnicum in Budapest, founded in 1844, which contains four faculties and was attended in 1900 by 1772 pupils, is also considered a high school. There were in Hungary in 1900 forty-nine high theological colleges, twenty-nine Roman Catholic; five Greek Uniat, four Greek Orthodox, ten Protestant and one Jewish. Among special schools the principal mining schools are at Selmeczbánya, Nagyág and Felsőbánya; the principal agricultural colleges at Debreczen and Kolozsvár; and there are a school of forestry at Selmeczbánya, military colleges at Budapest, Kassa, Déva and Zagreb, and a naval school at Fiume. There are besides an adequate number of training institutes for teachers, a great number of schools of commerce, several art schools - for design, painting, sculpture, music.

The military system of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was similar in both states, and rested since 1868 upon the principle of the universal and personal obligation of the citizen to bear arms. Its military force was composed of the <a href="common%20army">common army</a>; the special armies, namely the <a href="Austrian%20Landwehr">Austrian Landwehr</a>, and the <a href="Hungarian%20Honved">Hungarian Honved</a>, which were separate national institutions, and the <a href="Landsturm">Landsturm</a> or levy-en masse. As stated above, the common army stood under the administration of the joint minister of war, while the special armies were under the administration of the respective ministries of national defence. The yearly contingent of recruits for the army was fixed by the military bills voted on by the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, and was generally determined on the basis of the population, according to the last census returns. It amounted in 1905 to 103,100 men, of which Austria furnished 59,211 men, and Hungary 43,889. Besides 10,000 men were annually allotted to the Austrian Landwehr, and 12,500 to the Hungarian Honved. The term of service was two years (three years in the cavalry) with the colours, seven or eight in the reserve and two in the Landwehr; in the case of men not drafted to the active army the same total period of service was spent in various special reserves.

The common minister of war was the head for the administration of all military affairs, except those of the Austrian Landwehr and of the Hungarian Honved, which were committed to the ministries for national defence of the two respective states. But the supreme command of the army was vested in the monarch, who had the power to take all measures regarding the whole army.

The Austro-Hungarian navy was mainly a coast defence force, and also included a flotilla of monitors for the Danube. It was administered by the naval department of the ministry of war.

Russian <a href="Pan-Slavic">Pan-Slavic</a> organizations sent aid to the Balkan rebels and so pressured the tsar's government to declare war on the Ottoman Empire in 1877 in the name of protecting Orthodox Christians. Unable to mediate between the Ottoman Empire and Russia over the control of Serbia, Austria-Hungary declared neutrality when the conflict between the two powers escalated into a <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%931878%29">war</a>. With help from Romania and Greece, Russia defeated the Ottomans and with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a> tried to create a large pro-Russian Bulgaria. This treaty sparked an international uproar that almost resulted in a general European war. Austria-Hungary and Britain feared that a large Bulgaria would become a Russian satellite that would enable the tsar to dominate the Balkans. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British prime minister</a> Benjamin Disraeli moved warships into position against Russia to halt the advance of Russian influence in the eastern Mediterranean so close to Britain's route through the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>.

The <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> rolled back the Russian victory by partitioning the large Bulgarian state that Russia had carved out of Ottoman territory and denying any part of Bulgaria full independence from the Ottomans. Austria occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina as a way of gaining clout in the Balkans. Serbia, Montenegro and Romania became fully independent. Nonetheless the Balkans remained a site of political unrest with teeming ambition for independence and great power rivalries. At the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> in 1878 <a href="Gyula%20Andr%C3%A1ssy">Gyula Andrássy</a> (Minister of Foreign Affairs) managed to force Russia to retreat from further demands in the Balkans. As a result, <a href="Greater%20Bulgaria">Greater Bulgaria</a> was broken up and Serbian independence was guaranteed. In that year, with Britain's support, Austria-Hungary stationed troops in Bosnia to prevent the Russians from expanding into nearby Serbia. In another measure to keep the Russians out of the Balkans Austria-Hungary formed an alliance, the Mediterranean Entente, with Britain and Italy in 1887 and concluded mutual defence pacts with Germany in 1879 and Romania in 1883 against a possible Russian attack. Following the Congress of Berlin the European powers attempted to guarantee stability through a complex series of alliances and treaties.

Anxious about Balkan instability and Russian aggression, and to counter French interests in Europe, Austria-Hungary forged a <a href="defensive%20alliance">defensive alliance</a> with Germany in October 1879 and in May 1882. In October 1882 Italy joined this partnership in the <a href="Triple%20Alliance%20%281882%29">Triple Alliance</a> largely because of Italy's imperial rivalries with France. Tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary remained high, so <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Bismarck</a> replaced the <a href="League%20of%20the%20Three%20Emperors">League of the Three Emperors</a> with the <a href="Reinsurance%20Treaty">Reinsurance Treaty</a> with Russia to keep the Habsburgs from recklessly starting a war over Pan-Slavism.
The <a href="Sand%C5%BEak">Sandžak-Raška / Novibazar</a> region was under Austro-Hungarian occupation between 1878 and 1909, when it was returned to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, before being ultimately divided between kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Montenegro">Montenegro</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a>.

On the heels of the Great Balkan Crisis, Austro-Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 1878 and the monarchy eventually <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20annexation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908</a> as a common holding of Cis- and Transleithania under the control of the <a href="finance%20minister">Imperial & Royal finance ministry</a> rather than attaching it to either territorial government. The annexation in 1908 led some in Vienna to contemplate combining Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia to form a third Slavic component of the monarchy. The deaths of Franz Joseph's brother, <a href="Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico">Maximilian</a> (1867), and his only son, <a href="Rudolf%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Austria">Rudolf</a> made the Emperor's nephew, <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Franz Ferdinand</a>, heir to the throne. The Archduke was rumoured to have been an advocate for this trialism as a means to limit the power of the Hungarian aristocracy.

A proclamation issued on the occasion of its annexation to the Habsburg Monarchy in 1908 promised these lands constitutional institutions, which should secure to their inhabitants full civil rights and a share in the management of their own affairs by means of a local representative assembly. In performance of this promise a constitution was promulgated in 1910. This included a Territorial Statute (Landesstatut) with the setting up of a Territorial Diet, regulations for the election and procedure of the Diet, a law of associations, a law of public meetings, and a law dealing with the district councils. According to this statute Bosnia-Herzegovina formed a single administrative territory under the responsible direction and supervision of the Ministry of Finance of the Dual Monarchy in Vienna. The administration of the country, together with the carrying out of the laws, devolved upon the Territorial Government in Sarajevo, which was subordinate and responsible to the Common Ministry of Finance. The existing judicial and administrative authorities of the Territory retained their previous organization and functions. That statute introduced the modern rights and laws in Bosnia – Herzegovina, and it guaranteed generally the civil rights of the inhabitants of the Territory, namely citizenship, personal liberty, protection by the competent judicial authorities, liberty of creed and conscience, preservation of the national individuality and language, freedom of speech, freedom of learning and education, inviolability of the domicile, secrecy of posts and telegraphs, inviolability of property, the right of petition, and finally the right of holding meetings.

The Diet (Sabor) of Bosnia-Herzegovina set up consisted of a single Chamber, elected on the principle of the representation of interests. It numbered 92 members. Of these 20 consisted of representatives of all the religious confessions, the president of the Supreme Court, the president of the Chamber of Advocates, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and the mayor of Sarajevo. In addition to these were 72 deputies, elected by three curiae or electoral groups. The first curia included the large landowners, the highest taxpayers, and people who had reached a certain standard of education without regard to the amount they paid in taxes. To the second curia belonged inhabitants of the towns not qualified to vote in the first; to the third, country dwellers disqualified in the same way. With this curial system was combined the grouping of the mandates and of the electors according to the three dominant creeds (Catholic, Serbian Orthodox, Muslim). To the adherents of other creeds the right was conceded of voting with one or other of the religious electoral bodies within the curia to which they belonged.

On 28 June 1914, <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> visited the <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnian</a> capital, <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>. A group of six assassins (<a href="Cvjetko%20Popovi%C4%87">Cvjetko Popović</a>, <a href="Gavrilo%20Princip">Gavrilo Princip</a>, <a href="Muhamed%20Mehmedba%C5%A1i%C4%87">Muhamed Mehmedbašić</a>, <a href="Nedeljko%20%C4%8Cabrinovi%C4%87">Nedeljko Čabrinović</a>, <a href="Trifko%20Grabe%C5%BE">Trifko Grabež</a>, <a href="Vaso%20%C4%8Cubrilovi%C4%87">Vaso Čubrilović</a>) from the nationalist group <a href="Young%20Bosnia">Mlada Bosna</a>, supplied by the <a href="Black%20Hand%20%28Serbia%29">Black Hand</a>, had gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade would pass. Čabrinović threw a <a href="Hand%20grenade">grenade</a> at the car, but missed. It injured some people nearby, and Franz Ferdinand's convoy could carry on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them quickly. About an hour later, when Franz Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where <a href="Gavrilo%20Princip">Gavrilo Princip</a> by coincidence stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie. The reaction among the Austrian people was mild, almost indifferent. As historian Z.A.B. Zeman later wrote, "the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday [June 28 and 29], the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened."

The assassination excessively intensified the existing traditional religion-based ethnic hostilities in Bosnia.
However, in Sarajevo itself, Austrian authorities encouraged violence against the Serb residents, which resulted in the <a href="Anti-Serb%20riots%20of%20Sarajevo">Anti-Serb riots of Sarajevo</a>, in which Catholic <a href="Croats">Croats</a> and <a href="Bosnian%20Muslims">Bosnian Muslims</a> killed two and damaged numerous Serb-owned buildings. Writer <a href="Ivo%20Andri%C4%87">Ivo Andrić</a> referred to the violence as the "Sarajevo frenzy of hate." Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were organized not only in Sarajevo but also in many other larger Austro-Hungarian cities in modern-day <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> and <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately 5,500 prominent Serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison. 460 Serbs were sentenced to death and a predominantly Muslim special militia known as the "<a href="Schutzkorps">Schutzkorps</a>" was established and carried out the persecution of Serbs.

While the empire's military spending had not even doubled since the 1878 <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a>, Germany's spending had risen fivefold, and the British, Russian, and French expenditures threefold. The empire had lost ethnic Italian areas to <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a> because of nationalist movements that had swept through Italy, and many Austro-Hungarians perceived as imminent the threat of losing to <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> the southern territories inhabited by Slavs. Serbia had recently gained considerable territory in the <a href="Second%20Balkan%20War">Second Balkan War</a> of 1913, causing much distress in government circles in Vienna and Budapest. Former ambassador and foreign minister Count <a href="Alois%20Aehrenthal">Alois Aehrenthal</a> had assumed that any future war would be in the Balkan region.

Hungarian prime minister and political scientist <a href="Istv%C3%A1n%20Tisza">István Tisza</a> opposed the expansion of the monarchy on the Balkan (see <a href="Bosnian%20crisis">Bosnian crisis</a> in 1908), because "the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.

In March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Franz Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown word "Weltkrieg" (means World War) phrase in his letter.
"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front." 

On the day of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Tisza immediately traveled to Vienna where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs <a href="Count%20Leopold%20Berchtold">Count Leopold Berchtold</a> and Army Commander <a href="Count%20Franz%20Conrad%20von%20H%C3%B6tzendorf">Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf</a>. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking Serbia. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to Emperor Franz Joseph saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war. He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the <a href="Second%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">Second Italian War of Independence</a>. He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza foresaw a possible Austrian military attack against the Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.

Some members of the government, such as Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, had wanted to confront the resurgent Serbian nation for some years in a preventive war, but the Emperor, 84 years old and an enemy of all adventures, disapproved.

The foreign ministry of Austro-Hungarian Empire sent ambassador <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Sz%C5%91gy%C3%A9ny-Marich%2C%20Jr.">László Szőgyény</a> to <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>, where he inquired about the standpoint of the <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">German Emperor</a> on 5 July.
Szőgyény described what happened in a secret report to Vienna later that day:

But now the leaders of Austria-Hungary, especially General Count Leopold von Berchtold, backed by its ally Germany, decided to confront Serbia militarily before it could incite a revolt; using the assassination as an excuse, they presented a list of ten demands called the <a href="July%20Ultimatum">July Ultimatum</a>, expecting Serbia would never accept. When Serbia accepted nine of the ten demands but only partially accepted the remaining one, Austria-Hungary declared war. Franz Joseph I finally followed the urgent counsel of his top advisers.

Over the course of July and August 1914, these events caused the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, as Russia mobilized in support of Serbia, setting off a series of counter-mobilizations. In support of his German ally, on Thursday, August 6, 1914, the Emperor Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war on Russia. Italy initially remained neutral, although it had an alliance with Austria-Hungary. In 1915, it switched to the side of the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Entente powers</a>, hoping to gain territory from its former ally.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire played a relatively passive diplomatic role in the war, as it was increasingly dominated and controlled by Germany. The only goal was to punish Serbia and try to stop the ethnic breakup of the Empire, and it completely failed. Instead as the war went on the ethnic unity declined; the Allies encouraged breakaway demands from minorities and the Empire faced disintegration. Starting in late 1916 the new Emperor Karl removed the pro-German officials and opened peace overtures to the Allies, whereby the entire war could be ended by compromise, or perhaps Austria would make a separate peace from Germany. The main effort was vetoed by Italy, which had been promised large slices of Austria for joining the Allies in 1915. Austria was only willing to turn over the Trentino region but nothing more. Karl was seen as a defeatist, which weakened his standing at home and with both the Allies and Germany.

As the Imperial economy collapsed into severe hardship and even starvation, its multi-ethnic army lost its morale and was increasingly hard pressed to hold its line. In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and opposition parties strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. As it became apparent that the Allies would win the war, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for their majority areas, started demanding full independence. The Emperor had lost much of his power to rule, as his realm disintegrated.

The heavily rural Empire did have a small industrial base, but its major contribution was manpower and food. Nevertheless, Austria-Hungary was more urbanized (25%) than its actual opponents in the First World War, like the Russian Empire (13.4%), Serbia (13.2%) or Romania (18.8%). Furthermore, the Austro-Hungarian Empire had also more industrialized economy and higher GDP per capita than the Kingdom of Italy, which was the economically most developed actual opponent of the Empire.

On the home front, food grew scarcer and scarcer, as did heating fuel. The hog population fell 90 percent, as the dwindling supplies of ham and bacon percent of the Army. Hungary, with its heavy agricultural base, was somewhat better fed. The Army conquered productive agricultural areas in Romania and elsewhere, but refused to allow food shipments to civilians back home. Morale fell every year, and the diverse nationalities gave up on the Empire and looked for ways to establish their own nation states.

Inflation soared, from an index of 129 in 1914 to 1589 in 1918, wiping out the cash savings of the middle-class. In terms of war damage to the economy, the war used up about 20 percent of the GDP. The dead soldiers amounted to about four percent of the 1914 labor force, and the wounded ones to another six percent. Compared all the major countries in the war, Austria's death and casualty rate was toward the high-end.

By summer 1918, "Green Cadres" of army deserters formed armed bands in the hills of Croatia-Slavonia and civil authority disintegrated. By late October violence and massive looting erupted and there were efforts to form peasant republics. However The Croatian political leadership was focused on creating a new state (Yugoslavia) and worked with the advancing Serbian army to impose control and end the uprisings.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire conscripted 7.8 million soldiers during the WW1.
General von Hötzendorf was the Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff. Franz Joseph I, who was much too old to command the army, appointed <a href="Archduke%20Friedrich%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Friedrich von Österreich-Teschen</a> as Supreme Army Commander (Armeeoberkommandant), but asked him to give Von Hötzendorf freedom to take any decisions. The latter remained in effective command of the military forces until Emperor <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Austria">Karl I</a> took the supreme command himself in late 1916 and dismissed Conrad von Hötzendorf in 1917. Meanwhile, economic conditions on the homefront deteriorated rapidly. The Empire depended on agriculture, and agriculture depended on the heavy labor of millions of men who are now in the Army. Food production fell, the transportation system became overcrowded, and industrial production could not successfully handle the overwhelming need for munitions. Germany provided a great deal of help, but it was not enough. Furthermore, the political instability of the multiple ethnic groups of Empire now ripped apart any hope for national consensus in support of the war. Increasingly there was a demand for breaking up the Empire and setting up autonomous national states based on historic language-based cultures. The new Emperor sought peace terms from the Allies, but his initiatives were vetoed by Italy.

At the start of the war, the army was divided in two: the smaller part attacked Serbia while the larger part fought against the formidable <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a>. The invasion of Serbia in 1914 was a disaster: by the end of the year, the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> had taken no territory, but had lost 227,000 out of a total force of 450,000 men. However, in the autumn of 1915, the Serbian Army was defeated by the Central Powers, which led to the occupation of Serbia. Near the end of 1915, in a massive rescue operation involving more than 1,000 trips made by Italian, French and British steamers, 260,000 Serb soldiers were transported to <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>, where they waited for the chance of the victory of Allied Powers to reclaim their country. Corfu hosted the Serbian government in exile after the collapse of Serbia, and served as a supply base to the Greek front. In April 1916 a large number of Serbian troops were transported in British and French naval vessels from Corfu to mainland Greece. The contingent numbering over 120,000 relieved a much smaller army at the <a href="Macedonian%20Front">Macedonian Front</a> and fought alongside British and French troops.

On the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern front</a>, the war started out equally poorly. The Austro-Hungarian Army was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Galicia">Battle of Lemberg</a> and the great fortress city of <a href="Siege%20of%20Przemy%C5%9Bl">Przemyśl was besieged</a> and fell in March 1915. The <a href="Gorlice%E2%80%93Tarn%C3%B3w%20Offensive">Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive</a> started as a minor German offensive to relieve the pressure of the Russian numerical superiority on the Austro-Hungarians, but the cooperation of the Central Powers resulted in huge Russian losses and the total collapse of the Russian lines, and their long retreat into Russia. The Russian Third Army perished. In summer 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Army, under a unified command with the Germans, participated in the successful <a href="Gorlice%E2%80%93Tarn%C3%B3w%20Offensive">Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive</a>. From June 1916, the Russians focused their attacks on the Austro-Hungarian army in the <a href="Brusilov%20Offensive">Brusilov Offensive</a>, recognizing the numerical inferiority of the Austro-Hungarian army. By the end of September 1916, Austria-Hungary mobilized and concentrated new divisions, and the successful Russian advance was halted and slowly repelled; but the Austrian armies took heavy losses (about 1 million men) and never recovered. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Zborov%20%281917%29">Battle of Zborov (1917)</a> was the first significant action of the <a href="Czechoslovak%20Legions">Czechoslovak Legions</a>, who fought for the independence of Czechoslovakia against the Austro-Hungarian army. However the huge losses in men and material inflicted on the Russians during the offensive contributed greatly to the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">revolutions of 1917</a>, and it caused an economic crash in the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>.

In May 1915, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a> attacked Austria-Hungary. Italy was the only military opponent of Austria-Hungary which had a similar degree of industrialization and economic level; moreover, her army was numerous (~1,000,000 men were immediately fielded), but suffered poor leadership, training and organization. <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff">Chief of Staff</a> <a href="Luigi%20Cadorna">Luigi Cadorna</a> marched his army towards the <a href="Isonzo">Isonzo</a> river, hoping to seize <a href="Ljubljana">Ljubljana</a>, and to eventually threaten Vienna. However, the <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Army">Royal Italian Army</a> were halted on the river, where <a href="Battles%20of%20the%20Isonzo">four battles</a> took place over five months (23 June – 2 December 1915). The fight was extremely bloody and exhausting for both the contenders. On 15 May 1916, the Austrian Chief of Staff Conrad von Hötzendorf launched the "<a href="Battle%20of%20Asiago">Strafexpedition</a>" ("<a href="punitive%20expedition">punitive expedition</a>"): the Austrians broke through the opposing front and occupied the <a href="Asiago%20plateau">Asiago plateau</a>. The Italians managed to resist and in a counteroffensive, seized <a href="Gorizia">Gorizia</a> on 9 August. Nonetheless, they had to stop on the <a href="Carso">Carso</a>, a few kilometres away from the border. At this point, several months of indecisive <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a> (analogous to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western front</a> one) ensued. As the Russian Empire collapsed as a result of the <a href="Bolshevik%20Revolution">Bolshevik Revolution</a> and <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk">Russians ended their involvement in the war</a>, Germans and Austrians were able to move on the Western and Southern fronts much manpower from the erstwhile Eastern fighting. On 24 October 1917, Austrians (now enjoying decisive German support) attacked at <a href="Battle%20of%20Caporetto">Caporetto</a> using new infiltration tactics; although they advanced more than in the direction of <a href="Venice">Venice</a> and gained considerable supplies, they were halted and could not cross the <a href="Piave%20%28river%29">Piave</a> river. Italy, although suffering massive casualties, recovered from the blow: a <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a> under <a href="Vittorio%20Emanuele%20Orlando">Vittorio Emanuele Orlando</a> was formed. Italy also enjoyed support by the Entente powers: by 1918, large amounts of war materials and a few auxiliary American, British, and French divisions arrived in the Italian battle zone. Cadorna was replaced by General <a href="Armando%20Diaz">Armando Diaz</a>; under his command, the Italians retook the initiative and won the decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Piave%20river">Battle of the Piave river</a> (15–23 June 1918), in which some 60,000 Austrian and 43,000 Italian soldiers were killed. The multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire started to disintegrate, leaving its army alone on the battlefields. The final battle was at <a href="Battle%20of%20Vittorio%20Veneto">Vittorio Veneto</a>; after 4 days of stiff resistance, Italian troops crossed the Piave River, and after losing 90,000 men the defeated Austrian troops retreated in disarray pursued by the Italians. The Italians captured 428,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers, 24 of whom were generals, 5,600 cannons and mortars, 4,000 <a href="Heavy%20machine%20guns">machine guns</a>. The military breakdown also marked the start of the rebellion for the numerous ethnicities who made up the multiethnic Empire, as they refused to keep on fighting for a cause which now appeared senseless. These events marked the end of Austria-Hungary, which collapsed on 31 October 1918. The armistice was signed at <a href="Armistice%20of%20Villa%20Giusti">Villa Giusti</a> on 3 November.

On 27 August 1916, <a href="Romania">Romania</a> declared war against Austria-Hungary. The <a href="Romanian%20Land%20Forces">Romanian Army</a> crossed the borders of Eastern Hungary (<a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>). By November 1916, the Central Powers had defeated the Romanian Army and occupied the southern and eastern parts of Romania. On 6 December the Central Powers captured <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, the Romanian capital city.

Whereas the German army realized it needed close cooperation from the homefront, Habsburg officers saw themselves as entirely separate from the civilian world, and superior to it. When they occupied productive areas, such as Romania, they seized food stocks and other supplies for their own purposes, and blocked any shipments intended for civilians back in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The result was that the officers lived well, as the civilians began to starve. Vienna even transferred training units to Serbia and Poland for the sole purpose of feeding them. In all, the Army obtained about 15 percent of its cereal needs from occupied territories.

Despite of Kingdom of Hungary consisted only 42% of the Austro-Hungarian population, the thin majority - more than 3.8 million soldiers – of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces were conscripted from Kingdom of Hungary during the WW1. Roughly 600,000 soldiers were killed in action, and 700,000 soldiers were wounded in the war.

Austria-Hungary held on for years, as the Hungarian half provided sufficient supplies for the military to continue to wage war. This was shown in a transition of power after which the Hungarian prime minister, Count <a href="Istv%C3%A1n%20Tisza">István Tisza</a>, and foreign minister, Count <a href="Istv%C3%A1n%20Buri%C3%A1n">István Burián</a>, had decisive influence over the internal and external affairs of the monarchy. By late 1916, food supply from Hungary became intermittent and the government sought an armistice with the Entente powers. However, this failed as Britain and France no longer had any regard for the integrity of the monarchy because of Austro-Hungarian support for Germany.

The setbacks that the Austrian army suffered in 1914 and 1915 can be attributed to a large extent to Austria-Hungary becoming a military satellite of <a href="Imperial%20Germany">Imperial Germany</a> from the first day of the war. They were made worse by the incompetence of the Austrian high command. After attacking Serbia, its forces soon had to be withdrawn to protect its eastern frontier against Russia's invasion, while German units were engaged in fighting on <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">the Western Front</a>. This resulted in a greater than expected loss of men in the invasion of Serbia. Furthermore, it became evident that the Austrian high command had had no plans for a possible continental war and that the army and navy were also ill-equipped to handle such a conflict.

From 1916, the Austro-Hungarian war effort became more and more subordinated to the direction of German planners. The Austrians viewed the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German army</a> favorably, on the other hand by 1916 the general belief in Germany was that Germany, in its alliance with Austria-Hungary, was "shackled to a corpse". The operational capability of the Austro-Hungarian army was seriously affected by supply shortages, low morale and a high casualty rate, and by the army's composition of multiple ethnicities with different languages and customs.

The last two successes for the Austrians, the Romanian Offensive and the Caporetto Offensive, were German-assisted operations. As the Dual Monarchy became more politically unstable, it became more and more dependent on German assistance. The majority of its people, other than Hungarians and German Austrians, became increasingly restless.

In 1917, the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern front</a> of the Entente Powers completely collapsed. The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated. Leftist and pacifist political movements organized strikes in factories, and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. During the Italian battles, the Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs declared their independence. On 31 October Hungary ended the personal union officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. At the last Italian offensive, the Austro-Hungarian Army took to the field without any food and munition supply, and fought without any political supports for a "de facto" non-existent empire. On the end of the decisive joint Italian, British and French offensive at Vittorio Veneto, the disintegrated Austria-Hungary signed the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Villa%20Giusti">Armistice of Villa Giusti</a> on 3 November 1918.

The government had failed badly on the homefront. Historian Alexander Watson reports:

In the autumn of 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed. In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and politicians (the opposition parties) strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. These leftist or left-liberal pro-Entente maverick parties opposed the monarchy as a form of government and considered themselves internationalist rather than patriotic. Eventually, the German defeat and the minor revolutions in Vienna and Budapest gave political power to the left/liberal political parties. As it became apparent that the Allied powers would win World War I, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for various areas, started pressing for full independence. The Emperor had lost much of his power to rule, as his realm disintegrated.

Alexander Watson argues that, "The Habsburg regime's doom was sealed when Wilson's response to the note sent two and a half weeks earlier arrived on 20 October." Wilson rejected the continuation of the dual monarchy as a negotiable possibility. As one of his <a href="Fourteen%20Points">Fourteen Points</a>, President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> demanded that the nationalities of Austria-Hungary have the "freest opportunity to autonomous development". In response, Emperor Karl I agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament in 1917 and allow the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However the leaders of these national groups rejected the idea; they deeply distrusted Vienna and were now determined to get independence.
On 14 October 1918, Foreign Minister <a href="Istv%C3%A1n%20Buri%C3%A1n">Baron István Burián von Rajecz</a> asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points. In an apparent attempt to demonstrate good faith, Emperor Karl issued a proclamation ("Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918") two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy. The Polish majority regions of <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a> and <a href="Lodomeria">Lodomeria</a> were to be granted the option of seceding from the empire, and it was understood that they would join their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in resurrecting a Polish state. The rest of <a href="Cisleithania">Cisleithania</a> was transformed into a federal union composed of four parts—German, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian. Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the empire with Vienna and <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> was to receive a special status. No such proclamation could be issued in Hungary, where Hungarian aristocrats still believed they could subdue other nationalities and maintain the "Holy Kingdom of St. Stephen".

It was a dead letter. Four days later, on 18 October United States Secretary of State <a href="Robert%20Lansing">Robert Lansing</a> replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, Lansing said, autonomy for the nationalities – the tenth of the Fourteen Points – was no longer enough and Washington could not deal on the basis of the Fourteen Points any more. In fact, a <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovak provisional government</a> had joined the Allies on 14 October. The South Slavs in both halves of the monarchy had already declared in favor of uniting with Serbia in a large South Slav state by way of the 1917 <a href="Corfu%20Declaration">Corfu Declaration</a> signed by members of the <a href="Yugoslav%20Committee">Yugoslav Committee</a>, and the Croatians had begun disregarding orders from Budapest earlier in October.

The Lansing note was, in effect, the death certificate of Austria-Hungary. The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries. With defeat in the war imminent after the Italian offensive in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto on 24 October, Czech politicians peacefully took over command in Prague on 28 October (later declared the birthday of Czechoslovakia) and followed up in other major cities in the next few days. On 30 October, the Slovaks followed in <a href="Martin%2C%20Slovakia">Martin</a>. On the 29th of October, the Slavs in both portions of what remained of Austria-Hungary proclaimed the <a href="State%20of%20Slovenes%2C%20Croats%20and%20Serbs">State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs</a>. They also declared their ultimate intention was to unite with Serbia and Montenegro in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">a large South Slav state</a>. On the same day, the Czechs and Slovaks formally proclaimed the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent state. Karl's last Hungarian prime minister, <a href="Mih%C3%A1ly%20K%C3%A1rolyi">Mihály Károlyi</a>, terminated the personal union with Austria on 31 October, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. By the end of October, there was nothing left of the Habsburg realm but its majority-German Danubian and Alpine provinces, and Karl's authority was being challenged even there by the German-Austrian state council.

Karl's last Austrian prime minister, <a href="Heinrich%20Lammasch">Heinrich Lammasch</a>, concluded that Karl was in an impossible situation, and persuaded Karl that the best course was to relinquish, at least temporarily, his right to exercise sovereign authority. On 11 November, Karl issued a proclamation in which he recognized Austria's right to determine the form of the state and renounced the right to participate in Austrian affairs of state. He also released the officials in Austria from their oath of loyalty to him. Two days later, he issued a similar proclamation for Hungary. However, he did not abdicate, remaining available in the event the people of either state should recall him. For all intents and purposes, this was the end of Habsburg rule.

Karl's refusal to abdicate was ultimately irrelevant. On the day after he announced his withdrawal from Austria's politics, the German-Austrian National Council proclaimed the <a href="Republic%20of%20German%20Austria">Republic of German Austria</a>. Károlyi followed suit on 16 November, proclaiming the <a href="Hungarian%20Democratic%20Republic">Hungarian Democratic Republic</a>.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a> (between the victors of World War I and Austria) and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Trianon">Treaty of Trianon</a> (between the victors and Hungary) regulated the new borders of Austria and Hungary, leaving both as small landlocked states. The Allies assumed without question that the minority nationalities wanted to leave Austria and Hungary, and also allowed them to annex significant blocks of German- and Hungarian-speaking territory. As a result, the <a href="First%20Austrian%20Republic">Republic of Austria</a> lost roughly 60% of the old <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>'s territory. It also had to drop its plans for union with Germany, as it was not allowed to unite with Germany without League approval. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920-1946%29">restored Kingdom of Hungary</a>, which had replaced the republican government in 1920, lost roughly 72% of the pre-war territory of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a>.

The decisions of the nations of the former Austria-Hungary and of the victors of the Great War, contained in the heavily one-sided treaties, had devastating political and economic effects. The previously rapid economic growth of the Dual Monarchy ground to a halt because the new borders became major economic barriers. All the formerly well established industries, as well as the infrastructure supporting them, were designed to satisfy the needs of an extensive realm. As a result, the emerging countries were forced to make considerable sacrifices to transform their economies. The treaties created major political unease. As a result of these economic difficulties, extremist movements gained strength; and there was no regional superpower in central Europe.

The new Austrian state was, at least on paper, on shakier ground than Hungary. While what was left of Austria had been a single unit for over 700 years, it was united only by loyalty to the Habsburgs. With the loss of 60% of the Austrian Empire's prewar territory, <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. By comparison, Hungary had been a nation and a state for over 900 years. However, after a brief period of upheaval and the Allies' foreclosure of union with Germany, Austria established itself as a federal republic. Despite the temporary "<a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>" with <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, it still survives today. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> cited that all "Germans", such as he and the other Austrians should be united with Germany, as all other Germans should.

Hungary, however, was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The Hungarian Democratic Republic was short-lived and was temporarily replaced by the communist <a href="Hungarian%20Soviet%20Republic">Hungarian Soviet Republic</a>. Romanian troops ousted <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Kun">Béla Kun</a> and his communist government during the <a href="Hungarian-Romanian%20War%20of%201919">Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919</a>.

In the summer of 1919, a Habsburg, <a href="Archduke%20Joseph%20August%20of%20Austria">Archduke Joseph August</a>, became regent, but was forced to stand down after only two weeks when it became apparent the Allies would not recognise him. Finally, in March 1920, royal powers were entrusted to a <a href="regent">regent</a>, <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Miklós Horthy</a>, who had been the last commanding <a href="admiral">admiral</a> of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> and had helped organize the counter-revolutionary forces. It was this government that signed the Treaty of Trianon under protest on 4 June 1920 at the <a href="Grand%20Trianon">Grand Trianon Palace</a> in <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a>, <a href="France">France</a>.

In March and again in October 1921, ill-prepared attempts by Karl to <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Austria%27s%20attempts%20to%20retake%20the%20throne%20of%20Hungary">regain the throne in Budapest</a> collapsed. The initially wavering Horthy, after receiving threats of intervention from the Allied Powers and neighboring countries, refused his cooperation. Soon afterward, the Hungarian government nullified the Pragmatic Sanction, effectively dethroning the Habsburgs. Two years later, Austria had passed the "<a href="Habsburg%20Law">Habsburg Law</a>," which not only dethroned the Habsburgs, but banned Karl from ever returning to Austria again.

Subsequently, the British took custody of Karl and removed him and his family to the Portuguese island of <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, where he died the following year.

The following <a href="successor%20state">successor state</a>s were formed (entirely or in part) on the territory of the former Austria-Hungary:

Austro-Hungarian lands were also ceded to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Kingdom of Romania</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29">Kingdom of Italy</a>. The <a href="Liechtenstein">Principality of Liechtenstein</a>, which had formerly looked to Vienna for protection, formed a customs and defense union with <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and adopted the Swiss currency instead of the Austrian. In April 1919, <a href="Vorarlberg">Vorarlberg</a> – the westernmost province of Austria – voted by a large majority to join Switzerland; however, both the Swiss and the Allies disregarded this result.

The following present-day countries and parts of countries were located within the boundaries of Austria-Hungary when the empire was dissolved:

<a href="Austrian%20Empire">Empire of Austria</a> (<a href="Cisleithania">Cisleithania</a>):

<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a> (<a href="Transleithania">Transleithania</a>):

<a href="Austro-Hungarian%20rule%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Austro-Hungarian Condominium</a>

"Possessions of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Monarchy">Austro-Hungarian Monarchy</a>"
Other parts of Europe had been part of the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburg</a> monarchy once but had left it before its dissolution in 1918. Prominent examples are the regions of <a href="Lombardy">Lombardy</a> and <a href="Veneto">Veneto</a> in Italy, <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a> in Poland, most of <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> and <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, and parts of northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany.
They persuaded the government to search out <a href="foreign%20direct%20investment">foreign investment</a> to build up infrastructure such as railroads. Despite these measures, Austria-Hungary remained resolutely monarchist and authoritarian.

Although Austria-Hungary did not have a common <a href="national%20flag">flag</a> (a "national flag" could not exist since both halves of the Dual Monarchy consisted of inhabitants of various nationalities), a common <a href="civil%20ensign">civil ensign</a> (introduced in 1869) did exist. Until 1918, the k.u.k. War Fleet continued to carry the Austrian ensign it had used since 1786; and the regiments of the k.u.k. Army carried the double-eagle flags they had used before 1867, as they had a long history in many cases. New ensigns created in 1915 had not been implemented until 1918 due to the war. At state functions, the Austrian black-yellow and the Hungarian red-white-green tricolor were used.

Austria was represented by the black-yellow flag. The Hungarian half of the state, on the other hand, legally had no flag of its own. According to the <a href="Croatian%E2%80%93Hungarian%20Settlement">Croatian–Hungarian Settlement</a> (art. 62 and 63), in all joint Croatian and Hungarian affairs symbols of both Croatia and Hungary respectively had to be used. For instance, whenever the joint Hungarian-Croatian Parliament held its session in Budapest, both the <a href="Croatian%20flag">Croatian</a> and <a href="Hungarian%20flag">Hungarian</a> flags were hoisted on the parliament building in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>. In Vienna, in front of <a href="Sch%C3%B6nbrunn%20Palace">Schönbrunn Palace</a>, the black and yellow flag was flown for <a href="Cisleithania">Cisleithania</a>, while both Croatian and Hungarian flags were flown for <a href="Transleithania">Transleithania</a>. Hungary proper used a red-white-green <a href="Tricolour%20%28flag%29">tricolor</a> defaced with the Hungarian coat of arms, sometimes used to represent the entirety of the Lands of the Hungarian Crown.

The <a href="double-headed%20eagle">double-headed eagle</a> of the House of Habsburg was used as the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Austria-Hungary">coat of arms</a> of the common institutions of Austria-Hungary between 1867 and 1915. In 1915, a new one was introduced, which combined the coat of arms of the two halves of the Dual Monarchy and that of the dynasty.

Additionally, each of the two parts of Austria-Hungary had its own coat of arms.

Abracadabra

Abracadabra is an <a href="incantation">incantation</a> used as a <a href="magic%20word">magic word</a> in <a href="stage%20magic">stage magic</a> tricks, and historically was believed to have healing powers when inscribed on an <a href="amulet">amulet</a>.

"Abracadabra" is of unknown origin, and its first occurrence is in the <a href="second%20century">second century</a> works of <a href="Serenus%20Sammonicus">Serenus Sammonicus</a>, according to the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>". Several folk etymologies are associated with the word: from phrases in Hebrew that mean "I will create as I speak", or Aramaic "I create like the word", to folk etymologies that point to similar words in Latin and Greek such as <a href="abraxas">abraxas</a>. According to the "OED Online", "no documentation has been found to support any of the various conjectures."

The first known mention of the word was in the third century AD in a book called "Liber Medicinalis" (sometimes known as "De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima") by <a href="Serenus%20Sammonicus">Quintus Serenus Sammonicus</a>, <a href="physician">physician</a> to the <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a> <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a>, who in chapter 51 prescribed that <a href="malaria">malaria</a> sufferers wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle, or "abracadabrangle":

The power of the amulet, he explained, makes lethal diseases go away. Other Roman emperors, including <a href="Publius%20Septimius%20Geta">Geta</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Severus">Alexander Severus</a>, were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.

It was used as a <a href="magical%20formula">magical formula</a> by the <a href="Gnostic">Gnostic</a>s of the sect of <a href="Basilides">Basilides</a> in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune. It is found on <a href="Abraxas%20stones">Abraxas stones</a>, which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.

The Puritan minister <a href="Increase%20Mather">Increase Mather</a> dismissed the word as bereft of power. <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> also wrote dismissively about Londoners who posted the word on their doorways to ward off sickness during the <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20London">Great Plague of London</a>. But <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> regarded it as possessing great power; he said its true form is <a href="abrahadabra">abrahadabra</a>.

The word is now commonly used as an <a href="incantation">incantation</a> by stage magicians when performing a magic trick. It is also applied <a href="contempt">contempt</a>uously to a conception or hypothesis purporting to be a simple solution of apparently insoluble phenomena.

Acts of Union 1707

The Acts of Union were two <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Acts of Parliament</a>: the Union with Scotland Act 1706 passed by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a>, and the Union with England Act passed in 1707 by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a>. They put into effect the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Union">Treaty of Union</a> that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a>which at the time were separate <a href="sovereign%20state">states</a> with separate legislatures, but <a href="Personal%20union">with the same monarch</a>were, in the words of the Treaty, "United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain".

The two countries had shared a monarch since the <a href="Union%20of%20the%20Crowns">Union of the Crowns</a> in 1603, when <a href="King%20James%20VI%20of%20Scotland">King James VI of Scotland</a> inherited the English throne from his <a href="double%20first%20cousin">double first cousin</a> twice removed, <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a>. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>). There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.

The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a>, based in the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> in London, the home of the English Parliament. Hence, the Acts are referred to as the Union of the Parliaments. On the Union, the historian <a href="Simon%20Schama">Simon Schama</a> said "What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history."

<a href="England">England</a> and <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> were separate states for several centuries before eventual union, and English attempts to take over Scotland by military force in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were ultimately unsuccessful (see the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a>). The first attempts at Union surrounded the foreseen unification of the Royal lines of Scotland and England. In pursuing the English throne in the 1560s, <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a> pledged herself to a peaceful union between the two kingdoms.

England and Scotland were ruled by the same king for the first time in 1603 when James VI of Scotland also became the king of England. However they remained two separate states until 1 May 1707.

The first attempt to unite the parliaments of England and Scotland was by Mary's son, King James VI and I. On his accession to the English throne in 1603 King James announced his intention to unite his two realms so that he would not be "guilty of bigamy". James used his <a href="royal%20prerogative%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal prerogative</a> powers to take the style of "King of Great Britain" and to give an explicitly British character to his court and person. Whilst James assumed the creation of a full union was a foregone conclusion, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a> was concerned that the formation of a new state would deprive England of its ancient liberties, taking on the more <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolutist</a> monarchical structure James had previously enjoyed in Scotland. In the meantime, James declared that Great Britain be viewed "as presently united, and as one realm and kingdom, and the subjects of both realms as one people".

The Scottish and English parliaments <a href="Union%20of%20England%20and%20Scotland%20Act%201603">established a commission to negotiate a union</a>, formulating an instrument of union between the two countries. However, the idea of political union was unpopular, and when James dropped his policy of a speedy union, the topic quietly disappeared from the legislative agenda. When the House of Commons attempted to revive the proposal in 1610, it was met with a more open hostility.

The <a href="Solemn%20League%20and%20Covenant">Solemn League and Covenant</a> 1643 sought a forced union of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> into the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>, and although the covenant referred repeatedly to union between the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a political union was not spelled out.

In the aftermath of the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, in which the <a href="Covenanter">Covenanter</a>s had fought for the King, <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> occupied Scotland and began a process of creating a "Godly Britannic" Union between the former Kingdoms. In 1651, the Parliament of England issued the <a href="Tender%20of%20Union">Tender of Union</a> declaration supporting Scotland's incorporation into the Commonwealth and sent Commissioners to Scotland with the express purpose of securing support for Union, which was assented to by the Commissioners (Members of Parliament) in Scotland. On 12 April 1654, Cromwell – styling himself <a href="Lord%20Protector">Lord Protector</a> of England, Scotland and Ireland – enacted "An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland," which created "one Commonwealth and under one Government" to be known as the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland</a>. The ordinance was ratified by the <a href="Second%20Protectorate%20Parliament">Second Protectorate Parliament</a>, as an <a href="Tender%20of%20Union">Act of Union</a>, on 26 June 1657. One united Parliament sat in Westminster, with 30 representatives from Scotland and 30 from Ireland joining the existing members from England. Whilst free trade was brought about amongst the new Commonwealth, the economic benefits were generally not felt as a result of heavy taxation used to fund Cromwell's <a href="New%20Model%20Army">New Model Army</a>.

This republican union was dissolved automatically with the <a href="English%20Restoration">restoration</a> of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">King Charles II</a> to the thrones of England and Scotland. Scottish members expelled from the Commonwealth <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> petitioned unsuccessfully for a continuance of the union. Cromwell's union had simultaneously raised interest in and suspicion of the concept of union and when <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> attempted to recreate the union and fulfil the work of his grandfather in 1669, negotiations between Commissioners ground to a halt.

An abortive scheme for union occurred in Scotland in 1670.

Following the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688, the records of the Parliament of Scotland show much discussion of possible union. <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> and <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary II</a>, whilst supportive of the idea, had no interest in allowing it to delay their enthronement. Impetus for this incorporating union came almost entirely from King William, who feared leaving Scotland open to a French invasion. In the 1690s, the economic position of Scotland worsened, and relations between Scotland and England became strained. In the following decade, however, union again became a significant topic of political debate.

Deeper political integration had been a key policy of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> from the time she acceded to the throne in 1702. Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.

Both countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations. Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials. At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor%20of%20Scotland">Lord Chancellor of Scotland</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Seafield">Earl of Seafield</a>. The English commissioners included the <a href="Lord%20High%20Treasurer">Lord High Treasurer</a>, the <a href="Sidney%20Godolphin%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Godolphin">Earl of Godolphin</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Keeper%20of%20the%20Great%20Seal">Lord Keeper</a>, <a href="William%20Cowper%2C%201st%20Earl%20Cowper">Baron Cowper</a>, and a large number of Whigs who supported union. Tories were not in favour of union and only one was represented among the commissioners.

Negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners took place between 16 April and 22 July 1706 at the <a href="Cockpit-in-Court">Cockpit</a> in London. Each side had its own particular concerns. Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">Hanoverian</a> dynasty would succeed Queen Anne to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.

After negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments. In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> were supportive of the <a href="Court%20Party">Court Party</a>. For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the <a href="Squadrone%20Volante%20%28Scotland%29">Squadrone Volante</a>, led by the <a href="James%20Graham%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Montrose">Marquess of Montrose</a> and the <a href="Duke%20of%20Roxburghe">Duke of Roxburghe</a>. Opponents of the court were generally known as the <a href="Country%20Party%20%28Britain%29">Country party</a>, and included various factions and individuals such as the <a href="Duke%20of%20Hamilton">Duke of Hamilton</a>, <a href="Lord%20Belhaven">Lord Belhaven</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Fletcher%20of%20Saltoun">Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun</a>, who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union. The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the <a href="Darien%20Disaster">Darien Disaster</a>.

In Scotland, the <a href="James%20Douglas%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Queensberry">Duke of Queensberry</a> was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>. In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action. He had received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster treasury for himself. In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road. From <a href="Chipping%20Barnet">Barnet</a>, the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed. On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a>.

The English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne. The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England. The English succession was provided for by the English <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">House of Hanover</a>. Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>: the Scottish <a href="Act%20of%20Security%201704">Act of Security 1704</a> granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation. Many people in England were unhappy about the prospect, however. <a href="English%20overseas%20possessions">English overseas possessions</a> made England very wealthy in comparison to Scotland, a poor country with few roads, very little industry and almost no Navy. This made some view unification as a markedly unequal relationship.

In Scotland, some claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the <a href="Darien%20scheme">Darien scheme</a> through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the <a href="Alien%20Act%201705">Alien Act</a> to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement.

The combined votes of the Court party with a majority of the <a href="Squadrone%20Volante%20%28Scotland%29">Squadrone Volante</a> were sufficient to ensure the final passage of the treaty through the House.

Personal financial interests were also allegedly involved. Many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien scheme and they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses; Article 15 granted <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>398,085 10<a href="Shilling">s</a> sterling to Scotland, a sum known as <a href="The%20Equivalent">The Equivalent</a>, to offset future liability towards the English national debt. In essence it was also used as a means of compensation for investors in the Company of Scotland's Darien scheme, as 58.6% was allocated to its shareholders and creditors.
Even more direct bribery was also said to be a factor. £20,000 (£240,000 <a href="Pound%20Scots">Scots</a>) was dispatched to Scotland for distribution by the <a href="Earl%20of%20Glasgow">Earl of Glasgow</a>. <a href="James%20Douglas%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Queensberry">James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry</a>, the <a href="Queen%27s%20Commissioner%20in%20Parliament">Queen's Commissioner in Parliament</a>, received £12,325, more than 60% of the funding. (Some contend that all of this money was properly accounted for as compensation for loss of office, pensions and so forth not outwith the usual run of government. It is perhaps a debate that will never be set to rest. However, modern research has shown that payments were made to supporters of union that appear not to have been overdue salaries. At least four payments were made to people who were not even members of the Scottish Parliament.) <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a> referred to this:

<poem>We're bought and sold for English Gold,
Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.</poem>

Some of the money was used to hire <a href="espionage">spies</a>, such as <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>; his first reports were of vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union. "A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind," he reported, "for every Scot in favour there is 99 against". Years later, <a href="Sir%20John%20Clerk%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Sir John Clerk of Penicuik</a>, originally a leading <a href="Unionism%20%28Scotland%29">Unionist</a>, wrote in his memoirs that Defoe "was a spy among us, but not known as such, otherwise the Mob of Edinburgh would pull him to pieces."

The Treaty could be considered very unpopular at the time. Popular unrest occurred in Edinburgh, as mentioned above, with some lesser but still substantial riots in Glasgow. The people of Edinburgh demonstrated against the treaty, and their apparent leader in opposition to the Unionists, was <a href="James%20Hamilton%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Hamilton">James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton</a>. However, Hamilton was actually on the side of the English Government. Demonstrators in Edinburgh were opposed to the Union, for many reasons: they feared the Kirk would be Anglicised; that Anglicisation would remove democracy from the only really elementally democratic part of the Kingdom and they feared that tax rises would come.

<a href="George%20Lockhart%20%28politician%29">Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath</a>, the only member of the Scottish negotiating team against union, noted that "The whole nation appears against the Union" and even Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, an ardent pro-unionist and Union negotiator, observed that the treaty was "contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom". Public opinion against the Treaty as it passed through the Scottish Parliament was voiced through petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes. The <a href="Convention%20of%20Royal%20Burghs">Convention of Royal Burghs</a> also petitioned against the Union as proposed:

Not one petition in favour of an incorporating union was received by Parliament. On the day the treaty was signed, the <a href="carillon">carillon</a>er in <a href="St%20Giles%20Cathedral">St Giles Cathedral</a>, Edinburgh, rang the bells in the tune "Why should I be so sad on my wedding day?" Threats of widespread civil unrest resulted in Parliament imposing <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Union">Treaty of Union</a>, agreed between representatives of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a> and the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature. In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees. Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706. To minimise the opposition of the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>, an Act was also passed to secure the <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy. The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.

The two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send <a href="Scottish%20representative%20peers">representative peers</a> from the <a href="Peerage%20of%20Scotland">Peerage of Scotland</a> to sit in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. It guaranteed that the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> would remain the <a href="established%20church">established church</a> in Scotland, that the <a href="Court%20of%20Session">Court of Session</a> would "remain in all time coming within Scotland", and that <a href="Scots%20law">Scots law</a> would "remain in the same force as before". Other provisions included the restatement of the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a> and the ban on <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholics</a> from taking the throne. It also created a <a href="customs%20union">customs union</a> and <a href="monetary%20union">monetary union</a>.

The Act provided that any "laws and statutes" that were "contrary to or inconsistent with the terms" of the Act would "cease and become void."

Soon after the Union, the Act 6 Anne c.40later <a href="wikt%3Ainfelicitously">infelicitously</a> named the <a href="Union%20with%20Scotland%20%28Amendment%29%20Act%201707">Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707</a>united the English and Scottish <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>s and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration. In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the <a href="College%20of%20Justice">College of Justice</a>.

Scotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining "freedom of trade with England and the colonies" as well as "a great expansion of markets." The agreement guaranteed the permanent status of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, and the separate system of laws and courts in Scotland. Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was:of inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations...The sweeping successes of the eighteenth-century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations.By the time <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> and <a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell</a> made their tour in 1773, recorded in "<a href="A%20Journey%20to%20the%20Western%20Islands%20of%20Scotland">A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland</a>", Johnson noted that Scotland was "a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing" and in particular that <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.

A commemorative <a href="two-pound%20coin">two-pound coin</a> was issued to mark the tercentennial—300th <a href="anniversary">anniversary</a>—of the Union, which occurred two days before the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202007">Scottish Parliament general election</a> on 3 May 2007.

The <a href="Scottish%20Executive">Scottish Executive</a> held a number of commemorative events through the year including an education project led by the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20the%20Ancient%20and%20Historical%20Monuments%20of%20Scotland">Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland</a>, an exhibition of Union-related objects and documents at the <a href="National%20Museums%20of%20Scotland">National Museums of Scotland</a> and an exhibition of portraits of people associated with the Union at the <a href="National%20Galleries%20of%20Scotland">National Galleries of Scotland</a>.

Admiralty

The Admiralty formerly known as the Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs, was the <a href="List%20of%20British%20governments">government</a> department responsible for the command of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> first in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a>, second in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>, and from 1801-1964, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and former <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. Originally exercised by a single person, the <a href="Lord%20High%20Admiral%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lord High Admiral</a>, the Admiralty was, from the early 18th century onwards, almost invariably put "in commission" and exercised by the <a href="Lords%20Commissioners%20of%20the%20Admiralty">Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty</a>, who sat on the Board of Admiralty.

In 1964, the functions of the Admiralty were transferred to a new <a href="Admiralty%20Board%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Admiralty Board</a>, which is a committee of the tri-service <a href="Defence%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Defence Council of the United Kingdom</a> and part of the <a href="Navy%20Department%20%28MOD%29">Navy Department</a> of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a>. The new Admiralty Board meets only twice a year, and the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy is controlled by a <a href="Navy%20Board%20%281964-present%29">Navy Board</a> (not to be confused with the historic Navy Board described later in this article). It is common for the various authorities now in charge of the Royal Navy to be referred to as simply "The Admiralty".

The title of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom was vested in the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">monarch</a> from 1964 to 2011. The title was awarded to <a href="Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a> by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> on his 90th birthday. There also continues to be a <a href="Vice-Admiral%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom</a> and a <a href="Rear-Admiral%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom</a>, both of which are honorary offices.

The office of "Admiral of England" (or "Lord Admiral" and later "Lord High Admiral") was created around 1400 although there had already been Admirals of the Northern and Western Seas. In 1546, King <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> established the Council of the Marine, later to become the <a href="Navy%20Board">Navy Board</a>, to oversee administrative affairs of the naval service. Operational control of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> remained the responsibility of the Lord High Admiral, who was one of the nine <a href="Great%20Officers%20of%20State">Great Officers of State</a>.

In 1628, <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission and control of the Royal Navy passed to a committee in the form of the Board of Admiralty. The office of Lord High Admiral passed a number of times in and out of commission until 1709 after which the office was almost permanently in commission (the last Lord High Admiral being the future <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King William IV</a> in the early 19th century).

In 1831, the first Navy Board was abolished as a separate entity, and its duties and responsibilities were given over to the Admiralty.

In 1964, the Admiralty along with the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> and the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> as separate departments of state were abolished, and re-emerged under one single new <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a>. Within the expanded Ministry of Defence are the new "<a href="Admiralty%20Board%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Admiralty Board</a>" which has a separate (second) <a href="Navy%20Board">Navy Board</a> responsible for the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy., the "<a href="Army%20Board">Army Board</a>" and the "<a href="Air%20Force%20Board">Air Force Board</a>", each headed by the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a>.

When the office of Lord High Admiral was in commission, as it was for most of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, until it reverted to <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>, it was exercised by <a href="The%20Board%20of%20Admiralty">a Board of Admiralty</a>, officially known as the "Commissioners for Exercising the Office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, &c." (alternatively of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> or the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> depending on the period).

The <a href="Board%20of%20Admiralty">Board of Admiralty</a> consisted of a number of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. The Lords Commissioners were always a mixture of <a href="admiral">admiral</a>s, known as <a href="Lords%20Commissioners%20of%20the%20Admiralty">Naval Lords or Sea Lords</a> and Civil Lords, normally politicians. The <a href="quorum">quorum</a> of the Board was two commissioners and a secretary.

The president of the Board was known as the First Lord of the Admiralty, who was a member of the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a>. After 1806, the First Lord of the Admiralty was always a civilian while the professional head of the navy came to be (and is still today) known as the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a>.

The first real concerted effort to professionally organize the Admiralty was started by <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a>, this management approach would continue in force in the Royal navy until to 1832. In this organization a dual system operated the Lord High Admiral (from 1546) then Commissioners of the Admiralty (from 1628) exercised the function of general control (military administration) of the Navy and they were usually responsible for the conduct of any war, while the actual supply lines, support and services were managed by four principal officers, namely, the <a href="Treasurer%20of%20the%20Navy">Treasurer</a>, <a href="Comptroller%20of%20the%20Navy%20%28Navy%20Board%29">Comptroller</a>, <a href="Surveyor%20of%20the%20Navy">Surveyor</a> and <a href="Clerk%20of%20the%20Acts">Clerk of the Acts</a>, responsible individually for <a href="finance">finance</a>, supervision of <a href="account%20%28accountancy%29">account</a>s, <a href="Shipbuilding">Shipbuilding</a> and maintenance of ships, and record of business. These principle officers came to be known as the <a href="Navy%20Board">Navy Board</a> responsible for (civil administration) of the navy, from 1546 to 1832.

This structure of administering the navy lasted for 285 years, however the supply system was often inefficient and corrupt its deficiencies were due as much to its limitations of the times they operated in. The various functions within the Admiralty were not coordinated effectively and lacked inter-dependency with each other, with the result that in 1832 <a href="Sir%20James%20Graham">Sir James Graham</a> abolished the <a href="Navy%20Board">Navy Board</a> and merged its functions within the <a href="Board%20of%20Admiralty">Board of Admiralty's</a> that at the time also had distinct advantages, however it failed to retain the principle of distinctions between the Admiralty and supply and a lot of bureaucracy followed with the merger.

In 1860 saw big growth in the development of technical crafts, the expansion of more admiralty branches that really began with <a href="Naval%20tactics%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Steam">age of steam</a> that would have an enormous influence on the navy and naval thought.

Between 1860 and 1908 there was no real study of strategy and of staff work conducted within the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Naval%20Service">naval service</a>; it was practically ignored. All the Navy's talent flowed to the great technical universities. This school of thought for the next 50 years was exclusively technically based. The first serious attempt to introduce a sole management body to administer the naval service manifested itself in the creation of the <a href="Admiralty%20Navy%20War%20Council">Admiralty Navy War Council</a> in 1909. It was believed by officials within the Admiralty at this time that the running of war was quite a simple matter for any flag officer who required no formal training. However this mentality would be severely questioned with the advent of the <a href="Agadir%20crisis">Agadir crisis</a>, when the Admiralty's war plans were heavily criticized. Following this, a new advisory body called the <a href="Admiralty%20War%20Staff">Admiralty War Staff</a> was then instituted in 1912, headed by the Chief of the War Staff who was responsible for administering three new sub-divisions. The new War Staff had hardly found its feet and it continually struggled with the opposition to its existence by senior officers they were categorically opposed to a staff. The deficiencies of the system within this <a href="department%20of%20state">department of state</a> could be seen in the conduct of the <a href="Dardanelles%20campaign">Dardanelles campaign</a>. There were no mechanisms in place to answer the big strategic questions. In 1914 a <a href="Trade%20Division">Trade Division</a> was created.

In 1916, <a href="Sir%20John%20Jellicoe">Sir John Jellicoe</a> came to the Admiralty, he re-organized the war staff as following: Chief of War Staff, <a href="Operations%20Division">Operations</a>, <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Intelligence</a>, <a href="Signal%20Section">Signal Section</a>, <a href="Mobilization%20Division">Mobilization</a>, <a href="Trade%20Division">Trade</a>.

It was not until 1917 that the admiralty department was again thoroughly reorganized and really began to function as a <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">military staff</a> role. In May that year, the term "Admiralty War Staff" was changed and that department and its functional role were replaced by a new "<a href="Admiralty%20Naval%20Staff">Admiralty Naval Staff</a>" and the new office of <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">Chief of the Naval Staff</a> was merged in the office of the First Sea Lord. There was also appointed a new <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20the%20Naval%20Staff">Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff</a> and an <a href="Assistant%20Chief%20of%20the%20Naval%20Staff">Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff</a> who were all given seats on the <a href="Board%20of%20Admiralty">Board of Admiralty</a>. This for the first time gave the naval staff direct representation on the Board, and the presence of three naval senior members ensured the necessary authority to carry through any operation of war. The D.C.N.S. would direct all operations and movements of the fleet, while the A.C.N.S. would be responsible for mercantile movements and anti-submarine operations.

The office of <a href="Third%20Sea%20Lord">Controller</a> would be re-established to deal with all questions relating to supply on September 6 a <a href="Deputy%20First%20Sea%20Lord">Deputy First Sea Lord</a>, was added to the Board who would administer operations abroad and questions of foreign policy.

In October 1917 the development of the staff was carried one step further by the creation of two sub-committees of the Board - the Operations Committee and the Maintenance Committee. The <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord</a> was chairman of both, and the former consisted of the First Sea Lord and C.N.S., the Deputy 1 st S.L., D.C.N.S., A.C.N.S., and 5th Sea Lord. The latter consisted of the Deputy 1st S.L. (representing the operations committee), 2nd S.L. (personnel), 3rd S.L. (material), 4th S.L. (transport and stores), Civil Lord, Controller and Financial Secretary.

The direction of fully operational control of the Royal Navy was finally handed over to the C.N.S. by an <a href="order%20in%20Council">order in Council</a>, effective October 1917, under which they became responsible for the issuing of orders affecting all <a href="Military%20operation">war operations</a> to the fleet. It also empowered the C.N.S to issue orders in their own name as opposed to previously by the <a href="Second%20Secretary%20to%20the%20Admiralty">Secretary</a> in the name of the Board. This would remain in place until the department was abolished in 1964; however the operational control and this system still remains in place with the Navy today. For the organisational structure of the admiralty department and how it developed through the centuries see the following articles below.

"Included:"

The Admiralty complex lies between <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>, <a href="Horse%20Guards%20Parade">Horse Guards Parade</a> and <a href="The%20Mall%20%28London%29">The Mall</a> and includes five inter-connected buildings. Since the Admiralty no longer exists as a department, these buildings are now used by separate government departments:

The oldest building was long known simply as "The Admiralty"; it is now known officially as the Ripley Building, a three storey U-shaped brick building designed by <a href="Thomas%20Ripley%20%28architect%29">Thomas Ripley</a> and completed in 1726. <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a> implied the architecture is rather dull, lacking either the vigour of the <a href="baroque">baroque</a> style, fading from fashion at the time, or the austere grandeur of the <a href="Palladian">Palladian</a> style just coming into vogue. It is mainly notable for being perhaps the first purpose-built office building in Great Britain. It contained the Admiralty board room, which is still used by the Admiralty, other state rooms, offices and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. <a href="Robert%20Adam">Robert Adam</a> designed the screen, which was added to the entrance front in 1788. The Ripley Building is currently occupied by the <a href="Department%20for%20International%20Development">Department for International Development</a>.

<a href="Admiralty%20House%2C%20London">Admiralty House</a> is a moderately proportioned mansion to the south of the Ripley Building, built in the late 18th century as the residence of the First Lord of the Admiralty. It served that purpose until 1964. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> was one of its occupants. It lacks its own entrance from Whitehall and is entered through the Ripley Building. It is a three-storey building in yellow brick with <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> interiors. Its rear facade faces directly onto Horse Guards Parade. The architect was <a href="Samuel%20Pepys%20Cockerell">Samuel Pepys Cockerell</a>. There are now three ministerial flats in the building, which were unoccupied in 2012.

This is the largest of the Admiralty Buildings. It was begun in the late 19th century and redesigned while the construction was in progress to accommodate the extra offices needed by the naval arms race with the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>. It is a red brick building with white stone, detailing in the <a href="Queen%20Anne%20style%20architecture">Queen Anne style</a> with French influences. It has been used by the <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> from the 1960s to 2016. The <a href="Department%20for%20Education">Department for Education</a> planned to move into the building in September 2017 following the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's decision to leave the building and consolidate its London staff into one building on King Charles Street.

<a href="Admiralty%20Arch">Admiralty Arch</a> is linked to the Old Admiralty Building by a bridge and is part of the ceremonial route from Trafalgar Square to <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>.

This is a squat, windowless <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> fortress north west of Horse Guards Parade, now covered in <a href="ivy">ivy</a>. See <a href="Military%20citadels%20under%20London">Military citadels under London</a> for further details.

In some cases, the term "admiralty" is used in a wider sense, as meaning "<a href="Naval%20warfare">sea power</a>" or "rule over the seas", rather than in strict reference to the institution exercising such power. For example, the well-known lines from <a href="Kipling">Kipling</a>'s "Song of the Dead":

Amputation

Amputation is the removal of a limb by <a href="Physical%20trauma">trauma</a>, <a href="medical%20illness">medical illness</a>, or <a href="surgery">surgery</a>. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as <a href="cancer">malignancy</a> or <a href="gangrene">gangrene</a>. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems. A special case is that of <a href="congenital%20amputation">congenital amputation</a>, a <a href="congenital%20disorder">congenital disorder</a>, where <a href="fetus">fetal</a> limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts is or was used as a form of <a href="punishment">punishment</a> for people who committed crimes. Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment.

In the US, the majority of new amputations occur due to complications of the vascular system (the blood vessels), especially from diabetes. Between 1988 and 1996, there were an average of 133,735 hospital discharges for amputation per year in the US.

The word amputation is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "amputare", "to cut away", from "ambi-" ("about", "around") and "putare" ("to prune"). The English word "amputation" was first applied to surgery in the 17th century, possibly first in Peter Lowe's "A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie" (published in either 1597 or 1612); his work was derived from 16th-century French texts and early English writers also used the words "extirpation" (16th-century French texts tended to use "extirper"), "<a href="disarticulation">disarticulation</a>", and "<a href="dismemberment">dismemberment</a>" (from the Old French "desmembrer" and a more common term before the 17th century for limb loss or removal), or simply "cutting", but by the end of the 17th century "amputation" had come to dominate as the accepted medical term.

Leg amputations can be divided into 2 broad categories:



<a href="Hemicorporectomy">Hemicorporectomy</a>, or amputation at the waist, and <a href="decapitation">decapitation</a>, or amputation at the neck, are the most radical amputations.

<a href="Genital%20modification%20and%20mutilation">Genital modification and mutilation</a> may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease.

In some rare cases when a person has become trapped in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated his or her own limb.

<a href="Body%20integrity%20identity%20disorder">Body integrity identity disorder</a> is a psychological condition in which an individual feels compelled to remove one or more of their body parts, usually a limb. In some cases, that individual may take drastic measures to remove the offending appendages, either by causing irreparable damage to the limb so that medical intervention cannot save the limb, or by causing the limb to be severed.








The first step is <a href="ligature%20%28medicine%29">ligating</a> the supplying <a href="artery">artery</a> and <a href="vein">vein</a>, to prevent <a href="hemorrhage">hemorrhage</a> (bleeding). The muscles are transected, and finally the <a href="bone">bone</a> is sawed through with an <a href="oscillating%20saw">oscillating saw</a>. Sharp and rough edges of the bone(s) are filed down, skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump, occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a <a href="prosthesis">prosthesis</a>.

Traumatic amputation is the partial or total avulsion of a part of a body during a serious accident, like traffic, labor, or combat.

Traumatic amputation of a human limb, either partial or total, creates the immediate danger of death from blood loss.

Orthopedic surgeons often assess the severity of different injuries using the Mangled Extremity Severity Score. Given different clinical and situational factors, they can predict the likelihood of amputation. This is especially useful for emergency physicians to quickly evaluate patients and decide on consultations.

Traumatic amputation is uncommon in humans (1 per 20,804 population per year). Loss of limb usually happens immediately during the accident, but sometimes a few days later after medical complications. Statistically the most common causes of traumatic amputations are:

The development of the science of <a href="microsurgery">microsurgery</a> over last 40 years has provided several treatment options for a traumatic amputation, depending on the patient's specific trauma and clinical situation:


Amputations are usually traumatic experiences. They can reduce the quality of life for patients in addition to being expensive. In the USA, a typical prosthetic limb costs in the range of $10,000–15,000 according to the American Diabetic Association. In some populations, preventing amputations is a critical task.

Methods in preventing amputation, <a href="limb-sparing%20techniques">limb-sparing techniques</a>, depend on the problems that might cause amputations to be necessary. Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or <a href="decubitus">decubitus</a> ulcers in bedridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation.

There are two key challenges: first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).
Crush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from <a href="Hyperbaric%20medicine">hyperbaric oxygen therapy</a> (HBOT). The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speed up recovery times and prevent infections.

A study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot achieved significant results in prevention of amputation in patients with diabetes and arterioscleorosis. Another study found it also effective for healing limb ulcers caused by peripheral vascular disease. The boot checks the heart rhythm and compresses the limb between heartbeats; the compression helps cure the wounds in the walls of veins and arteries, and helps to push the blood back to the heart.

For victims of trauma, advances in <a href="microsurgery">microsurgery</a> in the 1970s have made replantations of severed body parts possible.

The establishment of laws, rules and guidelines, and employment of modern equipment help protect people from traumatic amputations.

The individual may experience psychological trauma and emotional discomfort. The stump will remain an area of reduced mechanical stability. Limb loss can present significant or even drastic practical limitations.

A large proportion of amputees (50–80%) experience the phenomenon of <a href="phantom%20limb">phantom limb</a>s; they feel body parts that are no longer there. These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye (<a href="phantom%20eye%20syndrome">phantom eye syndrome</a>).

A similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, ("<a href="Phantoms%20in%20the%20Brain">Phantoms in the Brain</a>": <a href="V.S.%20Ramachandran">V.S. Ramachandran</a> and <a href="Sandra%20Blakeslee">Sandra Blakeslee</a>) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head.

In many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience <a href="proprioception">proprioception</a> of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of <a href="stump%20sock">stump sock</a>s may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.

Another side effect can be <a href="heterotopic%20ossification">heterotopic ossification</a>, especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by <a href="improvised%20explosive%20device">improvised explosive device</a>s in the <a href="Iraq%20war">Iraq war</a>.

Due to technologic advances in prosthetics, many amputees live active lives with little restriction. Organizations such as the <a href="Challenged%20Athletes%20Foundation">Challenged Athletes Foundation</a> have been developed to give amputees the opportunity to be involved in athletics and <a href="adaptive%20sports">adaptive sports</a> such as <a href="Team%20Zaryen">Amputee Soccer</a>.

<doc id="2994" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2994" title="Anemometer">
Anemometer

An anemometer is a device used for measuring <a href="wind">the speed of wind</a>, and is also a common <a href="weather%20station">weather station</a> instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word "anemos", which means wind, and is used to describe any wind speed measurement instrument used in <a href="meteorology">meteorology</a>. The first known description of an anemometer was given by Leon Battista Alberti in 1450.

The anemometer has changed little since its development in the 15th century. <a href="Leon%20Battista%20Alberti">Leon Battista Alberti</a> (1404–1472) is said to have invented the first mechanical anemometer around 1450. In following centuries, numerous others, including <a href="Robert%20Hooke">Robert Hooke</a>
(1635–1703), developed their own versions, with some being mistakenly credited as the inventor. In 1846, <a href="John%20Thomas%20Romney%20Robinson">John Thomas Romney Robinson</a> (1792–1882) improved upon the design by using four hemispherical cups and mechanical wheels. In 1926, Canadian meteorologist <a href="John%20Patterson%20%28meteorologist%29">John Patterson</a> (January 3, 1872 – February 22, 1956) developed a three-cup anemometer, which was improved by Brevoort and Joiner in 1935. In 1991, <a href="Derek%20Weston">Derek Weston</a> added the ability to measure wind direction. In 1994, <a href="Andrews%20Pflitsch">Andrews Pflitsch</a> developed the sonic anemometer.

A simple type of anemometer was invented in 1845 by Dr. <a href="John%20Thomas%20Romney%20Robinson">John Thomas Romney Robinson</a>, of <a href="Armagh%20Observatory">Armagh Observatory</a>. It consisted of four <a href="hemispherical">hemispherical</a> cups mounted on horizontal arms, which were mounted on a vertical shaft. The air flow past the cups in any horizontal direction turned the shaft at a rate that was proportional to the wind speed. Therefore, counting the turns of the shaft over a set time period produced a value proportional to the average wind speed for a wide range of speeds. On an anemometer with four cups, it is easy to see that since the cups are arranged symmetrically on the end of the arms, the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented to it and is blowing on the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross.

When Robinson first designed his anemometer, he asserted that the cups moved one-third of the speed of the wind, unaffected by the cup size or arm length. This was apparently confirmed by some early independent experiments, but it was incorrect. Instead, the ratio of the speed of the wind and that of the cups, the anemometer factor, depends on the dimensions of the cups and arms, and may have a value between two and a little over three. Every previous experiment involving an anemometer had to be repeated.

The three-cup anemometer developed by the Canadian <a href="John%20Patterson%20%28meteorologist%29">John Patterson</a> in 1926 and subsequent cup improvements by Brevoort & Joiner of the USA in 1935 led to a cupwheel design which was linear and had an error of less than 3% up to . Patterson found that each cup produced maximum torque when it was at 45° to the wind flow. The three-cup anemometer also had a more constant torque and responded more quickly to gusts than the four-cup anemometer.

The three-cup anemometer was further modified by the Australian Dr Derek Weston in 1991 to measure both wind direction and wind speed. Weston added a tag to one cup, which causes the cupwheel speed to increase and decrease as the tag moves alternately with and against the wind. Wind direction is calculated from these cyclical changes in cupwheel speed, while wind speed is determined from the average cupwheel speed.

Three-cup anemometers are currently used as the industry standard for <a href="wind%20resource%20assessment">wind resource assessment</a> studies & practice.

One of the other forms of mechanical velocity anemometer is the "vane anemometer". It may be described as a <a href="windmill">windmill</a> or a propeller anemometer. Unlike the Robinson anemometer, whose axis of rotation is vertical, the vane anemometer must have its axis parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes, a <a href="weather%20vane">wind vane</a> or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed.

A "vane anemometer" thus combines a propeller and a tail on the same axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument. The speed of the fan is measured by a rev counter and converted to a windspeed by an electronic chip. Hence, volumetric flowrate may be calculated if the cross-sectional area is known.

In cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same, as in ventilating shafts of mines and buildings, wind vanes known as air meters are employed, and give satisfactory results.

Hot wire anemometers use a very fine wire (on the order of several micrometres) electrically heated to some temperature above the ambient. Air flowing past the wire cools the wire. As the electrical resistance of most metals is dependent upon the temperature of the metal (<a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> is a popular choice for hot-wires), a relationship can be obtained between the resistance of the wire and the flow speed.

Several ways of implementing this exist, and hot-wire devices can be further classified as CCA (<a href="constant%20current">constant current</a> anemometer), CVA (<a href="Voltage%20source">constant voltage</a> anemometer) and CTA (constant-temperature anemometer). The voltage output from these anemometers is thus the result of some sort of circuit within the device trying to maintain the specific variable (current, voltage or temperature) constant, following <a href="Ohm%27s%20law">Ohm's law</a>.

Additionally, PWM (<a href="pulse-width%20modulation">pulse-width modulation</a>) anemometers are also used, wherein the velocity is inferred by the time length of a repeating pulse of current that brings the wire up to a specified resistance and then stops until a threshold "floor" is reached, at which time the pulse is sent again.

Hot-wire anemometers, while extremely delicate, have extremely high frequency-response and fine spatial resolution compared to other measurement methods, and as such are almost universally employed for the detailed study of turbulent flows, or any flow in which rapid velocity fluctuations are of interest.

An industrial version of the fine-wire anemometer is the <a href="Thermal%20mass%20flow%20meter">thermal flow meter</a>, which follows the same concept but uses two pins or strings to monitor the variation in temperature. The strings contain fine wires, but encasing the wires makes them much more durable and capable of accurately measuring air, gas, and emissions flow in pipes, ducts, and stacks. Industrial applications often contain dirt that will damage the classic hot-wire anemometer.

In <a href="laser%20Doppler%20velocimetry">laser Doppler velocimetry</a>, laser Doppler anemometers use a beam of light from a <a href="laser">laser</a> that is divided into two beams, with one propagated out of the anemometer. Particulates (or deliberately introduced seed material) flowing along with air molecules near where the beam exits reflect, or backscatter, the light back into a detector, where it is measured relative to the original laser beam. When the particles are in great motion, they produce a <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a> for measuring wind speed in the laser light, which is used to calculate the speed of the particles, and therefore the air around the anemometer.
Ultrasonic anemometers, first developed in the 1950s, use <a href="ultrasound">ultrasonic sound waves</a> to measure wind velocity. They measure wind speed based on the time of flight of sonic pulses between pairs of <a href="transducer">transducer</a>s. Measurements from pairs of transducers can be combined to yield a measurement of velocity in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional flow. The <a href="spatial%20resolution">spatial resolution</a> is given by the path length between transducers, which is typically 10 to 20 <a href="centimeter">cm</a>. Ultrasonic anemometers can take measurements with very fine <a href="temporal%20resolution">temporal resolution</a>, 20 <a href="hertz">Hz</a> or better, which makes them well suited for <a href="turbulence">turbulence</a> measurements. The lack of moving parts makes them appropriate for long-term use in exposed automated weather stations and weather buoys where the accuracy and reliability of traditional cup-and-vane anemometers are adversely affected by salty air or dust. Their main disadvantage is the distortion of the flow itself by the structure supporting the transducers, which requires a correction based upon wind tunnel measurements to minimize the effect. An international standard for this process, <a href="ISO%2016622">ISO 16622</a> "Meteorology—Ultrasonic anemometers/thermometers—Acceptance test methods for mean wind measurements" is in general circulation. Another disadvantage is lower accuracy due to precipitation, where rain drops may vary the <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a>.

Since the speed of sound varies with temperature, and is virtually stable with pressure change, ultrasonic anemometers are also used as <a href="thermometers">thermometers</a>.
Two-dimensional (wind speed and wind direction) sonic anemometers are used in applications such as <a href="weather%20station">weather station</a>s, ship navigation, aviation, <a href="weather%20buoy">weather buoy</a>s and wind turbines. Monitoring wind turbines usually requires a refresh rate of wind speed measurements of 3 Hz, easily achieved by sonic anemometers. Three-dimensional sonic anemometers are widely used to measure gas emissions and ecosystem fluxes using the <a href="eddy%20covariance">eddy covariance</a> method when used with fast-response <a href="infrared%20gas%20analyzer">infrared gas analyzer</a>s or <a href="laser">laser</a>-based analyzers.

Two-dimensional wind sensors are of two types:

Acoustic resonance anemometers are a more recent variant of sonic anemometer. The technology was invented by Dr Savvas Kapartis and patented (Acu-Res®) by FT Technologies in 2000. Whereas conventional sonic anemometers rely on time of flight measurement, acoustic resonance sensors use resonating acoustic (ultrasonic) waves within a small purpose-built cavity in order to perform their measurement.
Built into the cavity is an array of ultrasonic transducers, which are used to create the separate standing-wave patterns at ultrasonic frequencies. As wind passes through the cavity, a change in the wave’s property occurs (phase shift). By measuring the amount of phase shift in the received signals by each transducer, and then by mathematically processing the data, the sensor is able to provide an accurate horizontal measurement of wind speed and direction.

Acoustic resonance technology enables measurement within a small cavity, the sensors therefore tend to be typically smaller in size than other ultrasonic sensors. The small size of acoustic resonance anemometers makes them physically strong and easy to heat and therefore resistant to icing. This combination of features means that they achieve high levels of data availability and are well suited to wind turbine control and to other uses that require small robust sensors such as battlefield meteorology. One issue with this sensor type is measurement accuracy when compared to a calibrated mechanical sensor. For many end uses, this weakness is compensated for by the sensor's longevity and the fact that it does not require re-calibrating once installed.

A common anemometer for basic use is constructed from a <a href="ping-pong%20ball">ping-pong ball</a> attached to a string. When the wind blows horizontally, it presses on and moves the ball; because ping-pong balls are very lightweight, they move easily in light winds. Measuring the angle between the string-ball apparatus and the vertical gives an estimate of the wind speed.

This type of anemometer is mostly used for middle-school level instruction which most students make themselves, but a similar device was also flown on <a href="Phoenix%20Mars%20Lander%23Meteorological%20station">Phoenix Mars Lander</a>.

The first designs of anemometers which measure the pressure were divided into plate and tube classes.

These are the first modern anemometers. They consist of a flat plate suspended from the top so that the wind deflects the plate. In 1450, the Italian art architect Leon Battista Alberti invented the first mechanical anemometer; in 1664 it was re-invented by Robert Hooke (who is often mistakenly considered the inventor of the first anemometer). Later versions of this form consisted of a flat plate, either square or circular, which is kept normal to the wind by a wind vane. The pressure of the wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The compression of the spring determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate, and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or on a recorder. Instruments of this kind do not respond to light winds, are inaccurate for high wind readings, and are slow at responding to variable winds. Plate anemometers have been used to trigger high wind alarms on bridges.

<a href="James%20Lind%20%281736%E2%80%931812%29">James Lind</a>'s anemometer of 1775 consisted of a glass U tube containing a liquid <a href="manometer">manometer</a> (pressure gauge), with one end bent in a horizontal direction to face the wind and the other vertical end remains parallel to the wind flow. Though the Lind was not the first it was the most practical and best known anemometer of this type. If the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an increase of pressure on one side of the manometer. The wind over the open end of a vertical tube causes little change in pressure on the other side of the manometer. The resulting elevation difference in the two legs of the U tube is an indication of the wind speed. However, an accurate measurement requires that the wind speed be directly into the open end of the tube; small departures from the true direction of the wind causes large variations in the reading.

The successful metal pressure tube anemometer of William Henry Dines in 1892 utilized the same pressure difference between the open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind and a ring of small holes in a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end. Both are mounted at the same height. The pressure differences on which the action depends are very small, and special means are required to register them. The recorder consists of a float in a sealed chamber partially filled with water. The pipe from the straight tube is connected to the top of the sealed chamber and the pipe from the small tubes is directed into the bottom inside the float. Since the pressure difference determines the vertical position of the float this is a measure of the wind speed.

The great advantage of the tube anemometer lies in the fact that the exposed part can be mounted on a high pole, and requires no oiling or attention for years; and the registering part can be placed in any convenient position. Two connecting tubes are required. It might appear at first sight as though one connection would serve, but the differences in pressure on which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the chimney, an effect may be produced equal to a wind of 10 mi/h (16 km/h); and the opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may entirely alter the registration.

While the Dines anemometer had an error of only 1% at it did not respond very well to low winds due to the poor response of the flat plate vane required to turn the head into the wind. In 1918 an aerodynamic vane with eight times the torque of the flat plate overcame this problem.

Modern tube anemometers use the same principle as in the Dines anemometer but using a different design. The implementation uses a <a href="pitot%20tube">pitot-static tube</a> which is a pitot tube with two ports, pitot and static, that is normally used in measuring the airspeed of aircraft. The pitot port measures the dynamic pressure of the open mouth of a tube with pointed head facing wind, and the static port measures the static pressure from small holes along the side on that tube. The pitot tube is connected to a tail so that it always makes the tube's head to face the wind. Additionally, the tube is heated to prevent <a href="rime%20ice">rime ice</a> formation on the tube. There are two lines from the tube down to the devices to measure the difference in pressure of the two lines. The measurement devices can be <a href="manometer">manometer</a>s, <a href="pressure%20transducer">pressure transducer</a>s, or analog <a href="chart%20recorder">chart recorder</a>s.

In the tube anemometer the dynamic pressure is actually being measured, although the scale is usually graduated as a velocity scale. If the actual air density differs from the calibration value, due to differing temperature, elevation or barometric pressure, a correction is required to obtain the actual wind speed. Approximately 1.5% (1.6% above 6,000 feet) should be added to the velocity recorded by a tube anemometer for each 1000 ft (5% for each kilometer) above sea-level.

At airports, it is essential to have accurate wind data under all conditions, including freezing precipitation. Anemometry is also required in monitoring and controlling the operation of wind turbines, which in cold environments are prone to in-cloud icing. Icing alters the aerodynamics of an anemometer and may entirely block it from operating. Therefore, anemometers used in these applications must be internally heated. Both cup anemometers and sonic anemometers are presently available with heated versions.

In order for wind speeds to be comparable from location to location, the effect of the terrain needs to be considered, especially in regard to height. Other considerations are the presence of trees, and both natural canyons and artificial canyons (urban buildings). The standard anemometer height in open rural terrain is 10 meters.

Archaeopteryx

Archaeopteryx (), meaning "first wing" (sometimes referred to by its German name ("original bird" or "first bird")), is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of bird-like <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s that is <a href="transitional%20fossil">transitional</a> between non-avian <a href="feathered%20dinosaur">feathered dinosaur</a>s and modern <a href="bird">bird</a>s. The name derives from the <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> ("archaīos") meaning "ancient", and ("ptéryx"), meaning "feather" or "wing". Between the late nineteenth century and the early twenty-first century, "Archaeopteryx" had been generally accepted by <a href="Paleontology">palaeontologists</a> and popular reference books as the oldest known bird (member of the group <a href="Avialae">Avialae</a>). Older potential avialans have since been identified, including "<a href="Anchiornis">Anchiornis</a>", "<a href="Xiaotingia">Xiaotingia</a>", and "<a href="Aurornis">Aurornis</a>".

"Archaeopteryx" lived in the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> around 150 million years ago, in what is now southern Germany during a time when Europe was an archipelago of islands in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the <a href="equator">equator</a> than it is now. Similar in size to a <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">Eurasian magpie</a>, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a <a href="raven">raven</a>, the largest species of "Archaeopteryx" could grow to about in length. Despite their small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, "Archaeopteryx" had more in common with other small <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s than with modern birds. In particular, they shared the following features with the <a href="dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurids</a> and <a href="troodontidae">troodontids</a>: jaws with sharp <a href="Tooth">teeth</a>, three fingers with <a href="claw">claw</a>s, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which also suggest <a href="homeothermy">warm-bloodedness</a>), and various features of the <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>.

These features make "Archaeopteryx" a clear candidate for a <a href="transitional%20fossil">transitional fossil</a> between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Thus, "Archaeopteryx" plays an important role, not only in the study of the <a href="origin%20of%20birds">origin of birds</a>, but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a single <a href="feather">feather</a> in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of "Archaeopteryx" was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of "Archaeopteryx" have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.

Most of these eleven fossils include impressions of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form (<a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s), these fossils are evidence that the evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic. The <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> of "Archaeopteryx" was discovered just two years after <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> published "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>". "Archaeopteryx" seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>.

Most of the specimens of "Archaeopteryx" that have been discovered come from the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, southern Germany, which is a lagerstätte, a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils laid down during the early Tithonian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 150.8–148.5 million years ago.

"Archaeopteryx" was roughly the size of a <a href="raven">raven</a>, with broad wings that were rounded at the ends and a long tail compared to its body length. It could reach up to in body length, with an estimated mass of . "Archaeopteryx" feathers, although less documented than its other features, were very similar in structure to modern-day bird feathers. Despite the presence of numerous avian features, "Archaeopteryx" had many non-avian <a href="theropoda">theropod dinosaur</a> characteristics. Unlike modern birds, "Archaeopteryx" had small teeth, as well as a long bony tail, features which "Archaeopteryx" shared with other dinosaurs of the time.

Because it displays features common to both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, "Archaeopteryx" has often been considered a link between them. In the 1970s, <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a>, following <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a>'s lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and "Archaeopteryx" was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the <a href="Talus%20bone">ankle bone</a>, <a href="interdental%20plate">interdental plate</a>s, an <a href="obturator%20foramen">obturator</a> process of the <a href="ischium">ischium</a>, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that "Archaeopteryx" was remarkably similar to the theropod family <a href="Dromaeosauridae">Dromaeosauridae</a>.

Specimens of "Archaeopteryx" were most notable for their well-developed <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s. They were markedly asymmetrical and showed the structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a <a href="barb%20%28feather%29">barb</a>-<a href="barbule">barbule</a>-barbicel arrangement. The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again in line with the situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The <a href="thumb">thumb</a> did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of <a href="alula">stiff feathers</a>.

The body plumage of "Archaeopteryx" is less well documented and has only been properly researched in the well-preserved <a href="The%20Berlin%20specimen">Berlin specimen</a>. Thus, as more than one species seems to be involved, the research into the Berlin specimen's feathers does not necessarily hold true for the rest of the species of "Archaeopteryx". In the Berlin specimen, there are "trousers" of well-developed feathers on the legs; some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure, but are somewhat decomposed (they lack <a href="barbicel">barbicel</a>s as in <a href="ratite">ratite</a>s). In part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight.

A patch of <a href="pennaceous%20feather">pennaceous feather</a>s is found running along its back, which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm, although not as stiff as the flight-related feathers. Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of "proto-<a href="Down%20feather">down</a>" not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur "<a href="Sinosauropteryx">Sinosauropteryx</a>": decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appearing more like fur than feathers in life (although not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body—although some feathers did not fossilize and others were obliterated during preparation, leaving bare patches on specimens—and the lower neck.

There is no indication of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most "Archaeopteryx" specimens became embedded in <a href="Oxygen%20saturation">anoxic</a> sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, which suggests that the specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (<a href="death%20pose">death pose</a>) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.

In 2011, graduate student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an "Archaeopteryx" specimen. Using <a href="Scanning%20electron%20microscope">scanning electron microscopy</a> technology and <a href="Energy-dispersive%20X-ray%20spectroscopy">energy-dispersive X-ray</a> analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of <a href="melanosome">melanosome</a>s in the single-feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant structure was then compared to that of 87 modern bird species and was determined with a highest likelihood to be black. The feather studied was most probably a single <a href="Covert%20%28feather%29">covert</a>, which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The study does not mean that "Archaeopteryx" was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight. In a 2013 study published in the "Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry", new analyses of "Archaeopteryx"'s feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex light- and dark-coloured plumage, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tips and outer vanes. In a press release, Carney argued against this interpretation and one of his colleagues also brought up the subject in a review paper however, no new evidence was published.

As in the wings of modern birds, the flight feathers of "Archaeopteryx" were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but it is unclear whether "Archaeopteryx" was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony <a href="Sternum">breastbone</a> suggests that "Archaeopteryx" was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>s, or perhaps, to a <a href="cartilage">cartilaginous</a> <a href="sternum">sternum</a>. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between <a href="scapula">scapula</a>, coracoid, and <a href="humerus">humerus</a>—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that "Archaeopteryx" was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by <a href="Philip%20Senter">Philip Senter</a> in 2006, "Archaeopteryx" was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.

"Archaeopteryx" wings were relatively large, which would have resulted in a low stall speed and reduced <a href="turning%20radius">turning radius</a>. The short and rounded shape of the wings would have increased drag, but also could have improved its ability to fly through cluttered environments such as trees and brush (similar wing shapes are seen in birds that fly through trees and brush, such as <a href="crows">crows</a> and <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>s). The presence of "hind wings", asymmetrical flight feathers stemming from the legs similar to those seen in dromaeosaurids such as "<a href="Microraptor">Microraptor</a>", also would have added to the aerial mobility of "Archaeopteryx". The first detailed study of the hind wings by Longrich in 2006, suggested that the structures formed up to 12% of the total <a href="airfoil">airfoil</a>. This would have reduced stall speed by up to 6% and turning radius by up to 12%.

The feathers of "Archaeopteryx" were asymmetrical. This has been interpreted as evidence that it was a flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that the feathers of "Archaeopteryx" fall into this range. The degree of asymmetry seen in "Archaeopteryx" is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.

In 2010, Robert L. Nudds and Gareth J. Dyke in the journal "Science" published a paper in which they analysed the <a href="rachis">rachis</a>es of the primary feathers of "<a href="Confuciusornis">Confuciusornis</a>" and "Archaeopteryx". The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those of modern birds relative to body mass. The authors determined that "Archaeopteryx" and "Confuciusornis", were unable to use flapping flight. This study was criticized by <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a> and Luis Chiappe. Chiappe suggested that it is difficult to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers, and Currie speculated that "Archaeopteryx" and "<a href="Confuciusornis">Confuciusornis</a>" must have been able to fly to some degree, as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been marine or lake sediments, suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water. <a href="Gregory%20Paul">Gregory Paul</a> also disagreed with the study, arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the masses of these early birds, and that more accurate mass estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises. Nudds and Dyke had assumed a mass of for the Munich specimen "Archaeopteryx", a young juvenile, based on published mass estimates of larger specimens. Paul argued that a more reasonable body mass estimate for the Munich specimen is about . Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves, noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved. Nudds and Dyke reported a diameter of for the longest primary feather, which Paul could not confirm using photographs. Paul measured some of the inner primary feathers, finding rachises across. Despite these criticisms, Nudds and Dyke stood by their original conclusions. They claimed that Paul's statement, that an adult "Archaeopteryx" would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen, was dubious. This, they reasoned, would require an even thicker rachis, evidence for which has not yet been presented. Another possibility is that they had not achieved true flight, but instead used their wings as aids for extra lift while running over water after the fashion of the <a href="basilisk%20lizard">basilisk lizard</a>, which could explain their presence in lake and marine deposits (see <a href="Bird%20flight%23Evolution%20of%20bird%20flight">Evolution of bird flight</a>).

In 2004, scientists analysing a detailed <a href="Computed%20tomography">CT scan</a> of the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> of the London "Archaeopteryx" concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that "Archaeopteryx" had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. "Archaeopteryx" had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% of the way to modern birds from the condition of non-<a href="coelurosaurian">coelurosaurian</a> dinosaurs such as "<a href="Carcharodontosaurus">Carcharodontosaurus</a>" or "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear. Newer research shows that while the "Archaeopteryx" brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.

Recent studies of flight feather barb geometry reveal that modern birds possess a larger barb angle in the trailing vane of the feather, whereas "Archaeopteryx" lacks this large barb angle, indicating potentially weak flight abilities.

"Archaeopteryx" continues to play an important part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds. Some scientists see it as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the "trees down" hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">O. C. Marsh</a>). Other scientists see "Archaeopteryx" as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the "ground up" hypothesis proposed by <a href="Samuel%20Wendell%20Williston">Samuel Wendell Williston</a>). Still others suggest that "Archaeopteryx" might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground, like modern crows, and this latter view is what currently is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching. A scenario outlined by Elżanowski in 2002 suggested that "Archaeopteryx" used its wings mainly to escape <a href="Predation">predators</a> by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, and alternatively, to cover longer distances (mainly) by gliding down from cliffs or treetops.

A <a href="histological">histological</a> study by Erickson, Norell, Zhongue, and others in 2009 estimated that "Archaeopteryx" grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, presumably because the outermost portions of "Archaeopteryx" bones appear poorly vascularized; in living vertebrates poorly vascularized bone is correlated with slow growth rate. They also assume that all known skeletons of "Archaeopteryx" come from juvenile specimens. Because the bones of "Archaeopteryx" could not be histologically sectioned in a formal skeletochronological (growth ring) analysis, Erickson and colleagues used bone vascularity (porosity) to estimate bone growth rate. They assumed that poorly vascularized bone grows at similar rates in all birds and in "Archaeopteryx". The poorly vascularized bone of "Archaeopteryx" might have grown as slowly as that in a mallard (2.5 micrometres per day) or as fast as that in an ostrich (4.2 micrometres per day). Using this range of bone growth rates, they calculated how long it would take to "grow" each specimen of "Archaeopteryx" to the observed size; it may have taken at least 970 days (there were 375 days in a Late Jurassic year) to reach an adult size of . The study also found that the avialans "<a href="Jeholornis">Jeholornis</a>" and "<a href="Sapeornis">Sapeornis</a>" grew relatively slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid "<a href="Mahakala%20%28dinosaur%29">Mahakala</a>". The avialans "<a href="Confuciusornis">Confuciusornis</a>" and "<a href="Ichthyornis">Ichthyornis</a>" grew relatively quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds. One of the few modern birds that exhibit slow growth is the flightless <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>, and the authors speculated that "Archaeopteryx" and the kiwi had similar <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a>.

Comparisons between the <a href="sclerotic%20ring">scleral ring</a>s of "Archaeopteryx" and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a>, similar to most modern birds.

The richness and diversity of the <a href="Solnhofen%20limestone">Solnhofen limestone</a>s in which all specimens of "Archaeopteryx" have been found have shed light on an ancient Jurassic Bavaria strikingly different from the present day. The latitude was similar to <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, though the climate was likely to have been drier, as evidenced by fossils of plants with adaptations for arid conditions and a lack of terrestrial sediments characteristic of rivers. Evidence of plants, although scarce, include <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s and conifers while animals found include a large number of insects, small lizards, <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s, and "<a href="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a>".

The excellent preservation of "Archaeopteryx" fossils and other terrestrial fossils found at <a href="Solnhofen">Solnhofen</a> indicates that they did not travel far before becoming preserved. The "Archaeopteryx" specimens found were therefore likely to have lived on the low islands surrounding the Solnhofen lagoon rather than to have been corpses that drifted in from farther away. "Archaeopteryx" skeletons are considerably less numerous in the deposits of Solnhofen than those of pterosaurs, of which seven genera have been found. The pterosaurs included species such as "<a href="Rhamphorhynchus%20%28pterosaur%29">Rhamphorhynchus</a>" belonging to the <a href="Rhamphorhynchidae">Rhamphorhynchidae</a>, the group which dominated the <a href="Ecological%20niche">niche</a> currently occupied by <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, and which became extinct at the end of the Jurassic. The pterosaurs, which also included "<a href="Pterodactylus">Pterodactylus</a>", were common enough that it is unlikely that the specimens found are <a href="Vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrants</a> from the larger islands to the north.

The islands that surrounded the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying, <a href="semi-arid">semi-arid</a>, and sub-<a href="tropical">tropical</a> with a long <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a> and little rain. The closest modern analogue for the Solnhofen conditions is said to be <a href="Orca%20Basin">Orca Basin</a> in the northern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, although it is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons. The <a href="flora">flora</a> of these islands was adapted to these dry conditions and consisted mostly of low () shrubs. Contrary to reconstructions of "Archaeopteryx" climbing large trees, these seem to have been mostly absent from the islands; few trunks have been found in the sediments and fossilized tree <a href="pollen">pollen</a> also is absent.

The lifestyle of "Archaeopteryx" is difficult to reconstruct and there are several theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude "Archaeopteryx" from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of "Archaeopteryx" point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.

Over the years, twelve body fossil specimens of "Archaeopteryx" and a feather that may belong to it have been found. All of the fossils come from the <a href="limestone">limestone</a> deposits, quarried for centuries, near <a href="Solnhofen">Solnhofen</a>, Germany.
The initial discovery, a single feather, was unearthed in 1860 or 1861 and described in 1861 by <a href="Christian%20Erich%20Hermann%20von%20Meyer">Hermann von Meyer</a>. It is currently located at the <a href="Museum%20f%C3%BCr%20Naturkunde">Humboldt Museum für Naturkunde</a> in Berlin. This is generally assigned to "Archaeopteryx" and was the initial <a href="holotype">holotype</a>, but whether it is a feather of this species, or another, as yet undiscovered, proto-bird is unknown. There are some indications it is not from the same animal as most of the skeletons (the "typical" "A. lithographica").

The first skeleton, known as the London Specimen (BMNH 37001), was unearthed in 1861 near <a href="Langenaltheim">Langenaltheim</a>, Germany, and perhaps given to local physician Karl Häberlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for £700 to the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in London, where it remains. Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> as "Archaeopteryx macrura", allowing for the possibility it did not belong to the same species as the feather. In the subsequent fourth edition of his "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>", <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> described how some authors had maintained "that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the "Archaeopteryx", with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world."

The <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> term "pteryx" () primarily means "wing", but can also designate merely "feather". Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a single feather which appeared to resemble a modern bird's <a href="Flight%20feather">remex</a> (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the <a href="London">London</a> specimen, to which he referred as a ""Skelett eines mit ähnlichen Federn bedeckten "" ("skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers"). In German, this ambiguity is resolved by the term "Schwinge" which does not necessarily mean a wing used for flying. "Urschwinge" was the favoured translation of "Archaeopteryx" among German scholars in the late nineteenth century. In English, "ancient pinion" offers a rough approximation.

Since then twelve specimens have been recovered:

The Berlin Specimen (HMN 1880/81) was discovered in 1874 or 1875 on the Blumenberg near <a href="Eichst%C3%A4tt">Eichstätt</a>, Germany, by farmer Jakob Niemeyer. He sold this precious <a href="fossil">fossil</a> for the money to buy a cow in 1876, to innkeeper Johann Dörr, who again sold it to Ernst Otto Häberlein, the son of K. Häberlein. Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881, with potential buyers including <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">O. C. Marsh</a> of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>'s Peabody Museum, it eventually was bought for 20,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">Goldmark</a> by the Humboldt Museum für Naturkunde, where it now is displayed. The transaction was financed by <a href="Ernst%20Werner%20von%20Siemens">Ernst Werner von Siemens</a>, founder of the <a href="Siemens%20AG">famous company</a> that bears his name. Described in 1884 by <a href="Wilhelm%20Dames">Wilhelm Dames</a>, it is the most complete specimen, and the first with a complete head. In 1897 it was named by Dames as a new species, "A. siemensii"; though often considered a synonym of "A. lithographica", several 21st century studies have concluded that it is a distinct species which includes the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens.

Composed of a torso, the <a href="Maxberg%20specimen">Maxberg Specimen</a> (S5) was discovered in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it was brought to the attention of professor <a href="Florian%20Heller">Florian Heller</a> in 1958 and described by him in 1959. The specimen is missing its head and tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact. Although it was once exhibited at the <a href="Maxberg%20Museum">Maxberg Museum</a> in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to <a href="Eduard%20Opitsch">Eduard Opitsch</a>, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it was discovered that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.

The Haarlem Specimen (TM 6428/29, also known as the "Teyler Specimen") was discovered in 1855 near <a href="Riedenburg">Riedenburg</a>, Germany, and described as a "<a href="Pterodactylus">Pterodactylus</a> crassipes" in 1857 by Meyer. It was reclassified in 1970 by <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a> and is currently located at the <a href="Teylers%20Museum">Teylers Museum</a> in <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>, Netherlands. It was the very first specimen found, but was incorrectly classified at the time. It is also one of the least complete specimens, consisting mostly of limb bones, isolated cervical vertebrae, and ribs.

The Eichstätt Specimen (JM 2257) was discovered in 1951 near Workerszell, Germany, and described by <a href="Peter%20Wellnhofer">Peter Wellnhofer</a> in 1974. Currently located at the <a href="Jura%20Museum">Jura Museum</a> in <a href="Eichst%C3%A4tt">Eichstätt</a>, Germany, it is the smallest known specimen and has the second best head. It is possibly a separate genus ("Jurapteryx recurva") or species ("A. recurva").

The Solnhofen Specimen (unnumbered specimen) was discovered in the 1970s near <a href="Eichst%C3%A4tt">Eichstätt</a>, Germany, and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the <a href="B%C3%BCrgermeister-M%C3%BCller-Museum">Bürgermeister-Müller-Museum</a> in Solnhofen, it originally was classified as "<a href="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a>" by an amateur collector, the same mayor Friedrich Müller after which the museum is named. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, "<a href="Wellnhoferia">Wellnhoferia</a> grandis". It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.

The Munich Specimen (BSP 1999 I 50, formerly known as the "Solenhofer-Aktien-Verein Specimen") was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. It is currently located at the <a href="Pal%C3%A4ontologisches%20Museum%20M%C3%BCnchen">Paläontologisches Museum München</a> in Munich, to which it was sold in 1999 for 1.9 million <a href="Deutschmark">Deutschmark</a>. What was initially believed to be a bony <a href="sternum">sternum</a> turned out to be part of the <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>, but a <a href="cartilaginous">cartilaginous</a> sternum may have been present. Only the front of its face is missing. It has been used as the basis for a distinct species, "A. bavarica", but more recent studies suggest it belongs to "A. siemensii".

An eighth, fragmentary specimen was discovered in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at <a href="Daiting">Daiting</a>, Suevia. Therefore, it is known as the Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in <a href="Bamberg">Bamberg</a>. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009. It was on display for the first time with six other original fossils of "Archaeopteryx" at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009. A first, quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of "Archaeopteryx". It was found in a limestone bed that was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds.

Another fragmentary fossil was found in 2000. It is in private possession and, since 2004, on loan to the Bürgermeister-Müller Museum in Solnhofen, so it is called the Bürgermeister-Müller Specimen; the institute itself officially refers to it as the "Exemplar of the families Ottman & Steil, Solnhofen". As the fragment represents the remains of a single wing of "Archaeopteryx", the popular name of this fossil is "chicken wing".

Long in a private collection in Switzerland, the Thermopolis Specimen (WDC CSG 100) was discovered in Bavaria and described in 2005 by Mayr, Pohl, and Peters. Donated to the <a href="Wyoming%20Dinosaur%20Center">Wyoming Dinosaur Center</a> in <a href="Thermopolis%2C%20Wyoming">Thermopolis, Wyoming</a>, it has the best-preserved head and feet; most of the neck and the lower jaw have not been preserved. The "Thermopolis" specimen was described in 2 December 2005 "Science" journal article as "A well-preserved "Archaeopteryx" specimen with theropod features"; it shows that "Archaeopteryx" lacked a reversed toe—a universal feature of birds—limiting its ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk-climbing lifestyle. This has been interpreted as evidence of <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> ancestry. In 1988, <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> claimed to have found evidence of a hyperextensible second toe, but this was not verified and accepted by other scientists until the Thermopolis specimen was described. "Until now, the feature was thought to belong only to the species' close relatives, the deinonychosaurs." The Thermopolis Specimen was assigned to "Archaeopteryx siemensii" in 2007. The specimen is considered to represent the most complete and best-preserved "Archaeopteryx" remains yet.

The discovery of an eleventh specimen was announced in 2011, and it was described in 2014. It is one of the more complete specimens, but is missing much of the skull and one forelimb. It is privately owned and has yet to be given a name.
Palaeontologists of the <a href="Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University%20of%20Munich">Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich</a> studied the specimen, which revealed previously unknown features of the plumage, such as feathers on both the upper and lower legs and metatarsus, and the only preserved tail tip.

A twelfth specimen had been discovered by amateur collectors in 2010 at the Schamhaupten quarry, but the finding was only announced in February 2014. It is as yet not scientifically described.

Today, fossils of the genus "Archaeopteryx" are usually assigned to one or two species, "A. lithographica" and "A. siemensii", but their taxonomic history is complicated. Dozens of names have been published for the handful of specimens, most of which are simply spelling errors ("lapsus"). As interpreted today, the name "A. lithographica" only referred to the single feather described by <a href="Christian%20Erich%20Hermann%20von%20Meyer">Meyer</a>. In 1954 <a href="Gavin%20de%20Beer">Gavin de Beer</a> concluded that the London specimen was the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>. In 1960, Swinton accordingly proposed that the name "Archaeopteryx lithographica" be placed on the official genera list making the alternative names "Griphosaurus" and "Griphornis" invalid. The ICZN, implicitly accepting de Beer's standpoint, did indeed suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens, which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between Meyer and his opponent <a href="Johann%20Andreas%20Wagner">Johann Andreas Wagner</a> (whose "Griphosaurus problematicus" – "problematic <a href="riddle">riddle</a>-lizard" – was a vitriolic sneer at Meyer's "Archaeopteryx"). In addition, in 1977 the first specific name of the Haarlem specimen, "crassipes", described by Meyer as a <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> before its true nature was realized, also was suppressed.

It has been noted that the feather, the first specimen of "Archaeopteryx" described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of "Archaeopteryx". It certainly is a <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a> of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of <a href="feathered%20dinosaur">feathered theropod</a>, of which only this feather is known so far. As the feather had been designated the <a href="Biological%20type">type specimen</a>, the name "Archaeopteryx" should then no longer be applied to the skeletons, thus creating significant <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">nomenclatorial</a> confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">ICZN</a> requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or <a href="neotype">neotype</a>. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.

Below is a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> published in 2013 by <a href="Pascal%20Godefroit">Godefroit</a> "et al."

It has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species, "A. lithographica". Differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as "Archaeornis siemensii", the Eichstätt specimen as "Jurapteryx recurva", the Munich specimen as "Archaeopteryx bavarica", and the Solnhofen specimen as "Wellnhoferia grandis".

In 2007, a review of all well-preserved specimens including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of "Archaeopteryx" could be supported: "A. lithographica" (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens), and "A. siemensii" (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in "A. lithographica" (the claws of "A. siemensii" specimens being relatively simple and straight). "A. lithographica" also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. A supposed additional species, "Wellnhoferia grandis" (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from "A. lithographica" except in its larger size.

If two names are given, the first denotes the original describer of the "species", the second the author on whom the given name combination is based. As always in <a href="zoological%20nomenclature">zoological nomenclature</a>, putting an author's name in parentheses denotes that the <a href="taxon">taxon</a> was originally described in a different genus.

""Archaeopteryx" vicensensis" (Anon. "fide" Lambrecht, 1933) is a "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>" for what appears to be an undescribed pterosaur.

Beginning in 1985, a group including <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Fred%20Hoyle">Fred Hoyle</a> and <a href="physicist">physicist</a> <a href="Lee%20Spetner">Lee Spetner</a> published a series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of "Archaeopteryx" were forged. Their claims were repudiated by <a href="Alan%20J.%20Charig">Alan J. Charig</a> and others at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum in London</a>. Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of <a href="lithification">lithification</a>; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of <a href="cement">cement</a>, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather, when visibly this is not the case. In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of "Archaeopteryx" known at the time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers.

They also expressed disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that one half of a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the <a href="counterslab">counterslab</a>. These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave the bulk of the fossil on one side and little on the other.

Finally, the motives they suggested for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; one is that <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> wanted to forge evidence in support of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.

Charig "et al." pointed to the presence of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner "et al." then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account for the fact that the cracks were old and had been filled with <a href="calcite">calcite</a>, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through <a href="X-ray%20spectroscopy">X-ray spectroscopy</a>, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig "et al." reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.

Modern paleontology has often classified "Archaeopteryx" as the most primitive bird. It is not thought to be a true ancestor of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that ancestor. Nonetheless, "Archaeopteryx" was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so. Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether "Archaeopteryx" truly was the first bird. They suggested that "Archaeopteryx" was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that "<a href="Avimimus">Avimimus</a>" was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than "Archaeopteryx". Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many <a href="maniraptora">maniraptora</a>n lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.

The discovery of the closely related "<a href="Xiaotingia">Xiaotingia</a>" in 2011 led to new phylogenetic analyses that suggested that "Archaeopteryx" is a <a href="deinonychosaur">deinonychosaur</a> rather than an avialan, and therefore, not a "bird" under most common uses of that term. A more thorough analysis was published soon after to test this hypothesis, and failed to arrive at the same result; it found "Archaeopteryx" in its traditional position at the base of Avialae, while "Xiaotingia" was recovered as a basal dromaeosaurid or troodontid. The authors of the follow-up study noted that uncertainties still exist, and that it may not be possible to state confidently whether or not "Archaeopteryx" is a member of Avialae or not, barring new and better specimens of relevant species.

Phylogenetic studies conducted by Senter, "et al." (2012) and Turner, Makovicky, and Norell (2012) confirmed that "Archaeopteryx" was more closely related to living birds than to dromaeosaurids and troodontids. On the other hand, Godefroit, "et al." (2013) recovered "Archaeopteryx" as more closely related to dromaeosaurids and troodontids in the analysis included in their description of "<a href="Eosinopteryx">Eosinopteryx brevipenna</a>". The authors used a modified version of the matrix from the study describing "Xiaotingia", adding "<a href="Jinfengopteryx">Jinfengopteryx elegans</a>" and "Eosinopteryx brevipenna" to it, as well as adding four additional characters related to the development of the plumage. Unlike the analysis from the description of "Xiaotingia", the analysis conducted by Godefroit, "et al." did not find "Archaeopteryx" to be related particularly closely to "Anchiornis" and "Xiaotingia", which were recovered as basal troodontids instead.

Agnolín and Novas (2013) found "Archaeopteryx" and (possibly synonymous) "<a href="Wellnhoferia">Wellnhoferia</a>" to be the basalmost avialans (Avialae being defined by the authors as including "Archaeopteryx lithographica" and "<a href="Passer">Passer</a>", their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants), with <a href="Microraptoria">Microraptoria</a>, <a href="Unenlagiinae">Unenlagiinae</a>, and the clade containing "Anchiornis" and "Xiaotingia" being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae. Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, "et al.", using a more inclusive matrix than the one from the analysis in the description of "Eosinopteryx brevipenna", also found "Archaeopteryx" to be a member of Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing "<a href="house%20sparrow">Passer domesticus</a>", but not "<a href="Dromaeosaurus">Dromaeosaurus albertensis</a>" or "<a href="Troodon">Troodon formosus</a>"). "Archaeopteryx" was found to form a <a href="Evolutionary%20grade">grade</a> at the base of Avialae with "Xiaotingia", "Anchiornis", and "<a href="Aurornis">Aurornis</a>". Compared to "Archaeopteryx", "Xiaotingia" was found to be more closely related to extant birds, while both "Anchiornis" and "<a href="Aurornis">Aurornis</a>" were found to be more distantly so.

Arthur Laurents

Arthur Laurents (July 14, 1917 – May 5, 2011) was an American playwright, stage director and screenwriter.

After writing scripts for radio shows after college and then <a href="training%20film">training film</a>s for the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Laurents turned to writing for <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>, producing a body of work that includes "<a href="West%20Side%20Story">West Side Story</a>" (1957), "" (1959), and "<a href="Hallelujah%2C%20Baby%21">Hallelujah, Baby!</a>" (1967), and directing some of his own shows and other Broadway productions.

His early film scripts include "<a href="Rope%20%28film%29">Rope</a>" (1948) for <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, followed by "<a href="Anastasia%20%281956%20film%29">Anastasia</a>" (1956), "<a href="Bonjour%20Tristesse%20%28film%29">Bonjour Tristesse</a>" (1958), "<a href="The%20Way%20We%20Were">The Way We Were</a>" (1973), and "<a href="The%20Turning%20Point%20%281977%20film%29">The Turning Point</a>" (1977).

Born Arthur Levine, Laurents was the son of middle-class <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> parents, a lawyer and a schoolteacher who gave up her career when she married. He was born and raised in the <a href="Flatbush%2C%20Brooklyn">Flatbush</a> section of <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, a <a href="borough%20%28New%20York%20City%29">borough of New York City</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, the elder of two children, and attended <a href="Erasmus%20Hall%20High%20School">Erasmus Hall High School</a>. His sister Edith suffered from <a href="Chorea%20%28disease%29">chorea</a> as a child.

His paternal grandparents were <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox Jews</a>, and his mother's parents, although born Jewish, were <a href="Atheism">atheists</a>. His mother kept a <a href="Kashrut">kosher</a> home for her husband's sake, but was lax about attending synagogue and observing the <a href="Jewish%20holiday">Jewish holiday</a>s. His <a href="Bar%20and%20Bat%20Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvah</a> marked the end of Laurents's religious education and the beginning of his rejection of all fundamentalist religions, although he continued to identify himself as Jewish. However, late in life he admitted to having changed his last name from Levine to the less Jewish-sounding Laurents, "to get a job."

After graduating from <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a>, Laurents took an evening class in <a href="radio">radio</a> writing at <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>. <a href="William%20N.%20Robson">William N. Robson</a>, his instructor, a <a href="CBS%20Radio">CBS Radio</a> director/producer, submitted his script "Now Playing Tomorrow", a comedic fantasy about <a href="clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a>, to the network, and it was produced in the <a href="Columbia%20Workshop">Columbia Workshop</a> series on January 30, 1939, with <a href="Shirley%20Booth">Shirley Booth</a> in the lead role. It was Laurents' first professional credit. The show's success led to him being hired to write scripts for various radio shows, among them "<a href="Lux%20Radio%20Theater">Lux Radio Theater</a>". Laurents' career was interrupted when he was drafted into the U.S. Army in the middle of World War II. Through a series of clerical errors, he never saw battle, but instead was assigned to the U.S. Army Pictorial Service located in a <a href="Kaufman%20Astoria%20Studios">film studio</a> in <a href="Astoria%2C%20Queens">Astoria, Queens</a>, where he wrote <a href="training%20film">training film</a>s and met, among others, <a href="George%20Cukor">George Cukor</a> and <a href="William%20Holden">William Holden</a>. He later was reassigned to write plays for "Armed Service Force Presents", a radio show that dramatized the contributions of all branches of the armed forces.

According to John Clum, "Laurents was always a mirror of his times. Through his best work, one sees a staged history of leftist, gender, and gay politics in the decades after World War II." After graduating from <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> in 1937, Laurents went to work as a writer for radio drama at <a href="CBS">CBS</a> in New York. His military duties during World War II, which consisted of writing training films and radio scripts for "Armed Service Force Presents", brought him into contact with some of the best film directors—distinguished director George Cukor directed his first script. Laurents’s work in radio and film during World War II was an excellent apprenticeship for a budding playwright and screenwriter. He also had the good fortune to be based in New York City. His first stage play, "Home of the Brave", was produced in 1945. The sale of the play to a film studio gave Laurents the entrée he needed to become a <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> screenwriter though he continued, with mixed success, to write plays. The most important of his early screenplays is his adaptation of "Rope" for <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>.

Soon after being discharged from the Army, Laurents met ballerina <a href="Nora%20Kaye">Nora Kaye</a>, and the two became involved in an on-again, off-again romantic relationship. While Kaye was on tour with "<a href="Fancy%20Free%20%28ballet%29">Fancy Free</a>", Laurents continued to write for the radio but was becoming discontented with the medium. At the urging of <a href="Martin%20Gabel">Martin Gabel</a>, he spent nine consecutive nights writing a play In 1962, Laurents directed "<a href="I%20Can%20Get%20It%20for%20You%20Wholesale">I Can Get It for You Wholesale</a>", which helped to turn then-unknown <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> into a star. His next project was the stage musical "<a href="Anyone%20Can%20Whistle">Anyone Can Whistle</a>", which he directed and for which he wrote the book, but it proved to be an infamous flop. He later had success with the musicals "<a href="Hallelujah%2C%20Baby%21">Hallelujah, Baby!</a>" (written for <a href="Lena%20Horne">Lena Horne</a> but ultimately starring <a href="Leslie%20Uggams">Leslie Uggams</a>) and "<a href="La%20Cage%20aux%20Folles%20%28musical%29">La Cage Aux Folles</a>" (1983), which he directed, but "<a href="Nick%20%26amp%3B%20Nora">Nick & Nora</a>" was another flop.

In 2008, Laurents directed a Broadway revival of "Gypsy" starring <a href="Patti%20LuPone">Patti LuPone</a>, and in 2009, he tackled a bilingual revival of "<a href="West%20Side%20Story">West Side Story</a>", with Spanish translations of some dialogue and lyrics by <a href="Lin-Manuel%20Miranda">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a>. While preparing "West Side Story", he noted, "The musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity." Following the production's March 19 opening at the <a href="Palace%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29">Palace Theatre</a>, <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called the translations "an only partly successful experiment" and added, "Mr. Laurents has exchanged insolence for innocence and, as with most such bargains, there are dividends and losses." The production is on a national tour (2011-2012) with direction by <a href="David%20Saint">David Saint</a>, who was Laurents' assistant director on the Broadway production. The Spanish lyrics and dialog have been reduced from about 18% of the total to about 10%.

Laurents' first Hollywood experience proved to be a frustrating disappointment. Unhappy with the script for "<a href="The%20Snake%20Pit">The Snake Pit</a>" (1948), submitted by <a href="Frank%20Partos">Frank Partos</a> and <a href="Millen%20Brand">Millen Brand</a>, director <a href="Anatole%20Litvak">Anatole Litvak</a> hired Laurents to rewrite it. Partos and Brand later insisted the bulk of the shooting script was theirs, and produced carbon copies of many of the pages Laurents actually had written to bolster their claim. Having destroyed the original script and all his notes and rewritten pages after completing the project, Laurents had no way to prove most of the work was his, and the <a href="WGA%20screenwriting%20credit%20system">Writers Guild of America</a> denied him screen credit. Brand later confessed he and Partos had copied scenes written by Laurents and apologized for his role in the deception. Four decades later, Laurents learned he was ineligible for WGA health benefits because he had failed to accumulate enough credits to qualify. He was short by one, the one he failed to get for "The Snake Pit".

Upon hearing <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> executives were pleased with Laurents' work on "The Snake Pit", <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> hired him for his next project, the film "<a href="Rope%20%28film%29">Rope</a>" starring <a href="James%20Stewart">James Stewart</a>. Hitchcock wanted Laurents to Americanize the British play "<a href="Rope%20%28play%29">Rope</a>" (1929) by <a href="Patrick%20Hamilton%20%28writer%29">Patrick Hamilton</a> for the screen. With his then-lover <a href="Farley%20Granger">Farley Granger</a> set to star, Laurents was happy to accept the assignment. His dilemma was how to make the audience aware of the fact the three main characters were <a href="homosexuality">homosexual</a> without blatantly saying so. <a href="United%20States%20Motion%20Picture%20Production%20Code%20of%201930">The Hays Office</a> kept close tabs on his work, and the final script was so discreet that Laurents was unsure whether co-star James Stewart ever realized that his character was gay. In later years, Hitchcock asked him to script both "<a href="Torn%20Curtain">Torn Curtain</a>" (1966) and "<a href="Topaz%20%281969%20film%29">Topaz</a>" (1969), However, Laurents, in both cases unenthused by the material, declined the offers.

Laurents also scripted "<a href="Anastasia%20%281956%20film%29">Anastasia</a>" (1956) and "<a href="Bonjour%20Tristesse%20%28film%29">Bonjour Tristesse</a>" (1958). "<a href="The%20Way%20We%20Were">The Way We Were</a>" (1973), in which he incorporated many of his own experiences, particularly those with the HUAC, reunited him with Barbra Streisand, and "<a href="The%20Turning%20Point%20%281977%20film%29">The Turning Point</a>" (1977), inspired in part by his love for Nora Kaye, was directed by her husband <a href="Herbert%20Ross">Herbert Ross</a>. The Fox animated feature film "<a href="Anastasia%20%281997%20film%29">Anastasia</a>" (1997) was based in part from his screenplay of the live-action 1956 film of the same title.

Because of a casual remark made by <a href="Russel%20Crouse">Russel Crouse</a>, Laurents was called to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, to account for his political views. He explained himself to the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, and his appearance had no obvious impact on his career, which at the time was primarily in the theatre. When the <a href="McCarran%20Internal%20Security%20Act">McCarran Internal Security Act</a>, which prohibited individuals suspected of engaging in subversive activities from obtaining a passport, was passed in 1950, Laurents and Granger immediately applied for and received passports and departed for Paris with <a href="Harold%20Clurman">Harold Clurman</a> and his wife <a href="Stella%20Adler">Stella Adler</a>. Laurents and Granger remained abroad, traveling throughout Europe and northern Africa, for about 18 months.

Years earlier, Laurents and <a href="Jerome%20Robbins">Jerome Robbins</a> had developed "Look Ma, I'm Dancin'!" (1948), a stage musical about the world of ballet that ran for 188 performances on Broadway, and starred <a href="Nancy%20Walker">Nancy Walker</a> and <a href="Harold%20Lang">Harold Lang</a>. (Although the musical was ultimately produced with a book by <a href="Jerome%20Lawrence">Jerome Lawrence</a> and <a href="Robert%20Edwin%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, as Laurents left the project.) Robbins approached <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> about directing a screen version, and the studio agreed as long as Laurents was not part of the package.

It was not until then that Laurents learned he officially had been <a href="Hollywood%20blacklist">blacklisted</a>, primarily because a review of "Home of the Brave" had been published in the "<a href="Daily%20Worker">Daily Worker</a>". He decided to return to Paris, but the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a> refused to renew his passport. Laurents spent three months trying to clear his name, and after submitting a lengthy letter explaining his political beliefs in detail, it was determined they were so <a href="Idiosyncrasy">idiosyncratic</a> he couldn't have been a member of any subversive groups. Within a week his passport was renewed, and the following day he sailed for Europe on the "<a href="SS%20Ile%20de%20France">Ile de France</a>". While on board, he received a cable from <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> offering him a screenwriting assignment. The blacklist had ended.

Laurents wrote "Original Story By Arthur Laurents: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood", published in 2000. In it, he discusses his lengthy career and his many gay affairs and long-term relationships, including those with <a href="Farley%20Granger">Farley Granger</a> and Tom Hatcher (August 24, 1929 - October 26, 2006). Hatcher was an aspiring actor whom <a href="Gore%20Vidal">Gore Vidal</a> suggested Laurents seek out at the <a href="Beverly%20Hills">Beverly Hills</a> men's clothing store Hatcher was managing at the time. The couple remained together for 52 years until Hatcher's death on October 26, 2006.

Laurents wrote "Mainly on Directing: Gypsy, West Side Story and Other Musicals", published in 2009, in which he discussed musicals he directed and the work of other directors he admired.

His latest memoir was published posthumously in September 2012, titled "The Rest of the Story".

Laurents died at the age of 93 at his home in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> on May 5, 2011 of pneumonia complications, as reported by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". Following a long tradition, Broadway theatre lights were dimmed at 8 p.m. on May 6, 2011, for one minute in his memory. His ashes were buried alongside those of Tom Hatcher in a memorial bench in Quogue, Long Island, New York.




A new award was established in 2010, The Laurents/Hatcher Foundation Award. This is awarded annually "for an un-produced, full-length play of social relevance by an emerging American playwright." The Laurents/Hatcher Foundation will give $50,000 to the writer with a grant of $100,000 towards production costs at a nonprofit theatre. The first award will be given in 2011.

Adrian Lamo

Adrian Lamo (born February 20, 1981) is a Colombian-American <a href="threat%20analyst">threat analyst</a> and former <a href="Hacker%20%28computer%20security%29">hacker</a>.

Lamo first gained media attention for breaking into several high-profile computer networks, including those of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>, and <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, culminating in his 2003 arrest. 

In 2010, Lamo indirectly reported U.S. soldier <a href="Chelsea%20Manning">Chelsea Manning</a> to the Army's <a href="United_States_Army_Criminal_Investigation_Command">Criminal Investigation Command</a>, claiming that Manning had <a href="internet%20leak">leaked</a> hundreds of thousands of sensitive U.S. government documents to <a href="WikiLeaks">WikiLeaks</a>.

Born in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, Lamo did not graduate from high school, but received a <a href="General%20Educational%20Development">GED</a> and was court ordered to take courses at <a href="American%20River%20College">American River College</a>, a community college in <a href="Sacramento%20County%2C%20California">Sacramento County, California</a>. Known as the "Homeless Hacker" for his reportedly transient lifestyle, Lamo has claimed that he has spent much of his travels <a href="CouchSurfing">couch-surfing</a>, <a href="squatting">squatting</a> in abandoned buildings, and traveling to <a href="Internet%20cafe">Internet cafe</a>s, libraries, and universities to investigate networks, sometimes exploiting security holes. Despite performing authorized and unauthorized <a href="vulnerability%20assessment">vulnerability assessment</a>s for several large, high-profile entities, Lamo claims to have refused to accept payment for his services.

In the mid-1990s, Lamo volunteered for the gay and lesbian media firm <a href="PlanetOut.com">PlanetOut.com</a>. In 1998, Lamo was appointed to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Questioning Youth Task Force by the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Board%20of%20Supervisors">San Francisco Board of Supervisors</a>. In 1999, Lamo was ordained a minister in the Universal Life Church.

During this period, in 2001, he overdosed on prescription amphetamines.

In a 2004 interview with "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>", an ex-girlfriend of Lamo's described him as "very controlling," alleging, "He carried a <a href="electroshock%20weapon">stun gun</a>, which he used on me." According to the same article, a court allegedly issued a restraining order against Lamo. Lamo disputed the claim, writing, "I have never been subject to a restraining order in my life".

Lamo claimed in a "Wired" article that in May 2010, after he reported the theft of his backpack, an investigating officer noted unusual behavior and placed him under a <a href="5150%20%28involuntary%20psychiatric%20hold%29">72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold</a>, which was extended to a nine-day hold. Lamo says he was diagnosed with <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> at the psych ward.

For a period of time circa March 2011, Lamo was allegedly "in hiding," claiming that his "life was under threat" after turning in Manning. During this time he struggled with substance abuse, but claims he is now in recovery and his security situation has improved as well.

Lamo first became known for operating <a href="AOL">AOL</a> <a href="Watchdog%20journalism">watchdog</a> site "Inside-AOL.com".

In December 2001, Lamo was praised by <a href="Worldcom">Worldcom</a> for helping to fortify their corporate security. In February 2002, he broke into the internal computer network of "The New York Times", added his name to the internal database of expert sources, and used the paper's <a href="LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a> account to conduct research on high-profile subjects. The "New York Times" filed a complaint, and a warrant for Lamo's arrest was issued in August 2003 following a 15-month investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. At 10:15 AM on September 9, after spending a few days in hiding, he surrendered to the <a href="United%20States%20Marshals%20Service">US Marshals</a> in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>. He re-surrendered to the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> in New York City on September 11, and pleaded guilty to one felony count of <a href="computer%20crime">computer crime</a>s against <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a>, and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" on January 8, 2004.

Later in 2004, Lamo was sentenced to six months' detention at his parents' home, plus two years probation, and was ordered to pay roughly $65,000 in restitution. He was convicted of compromising security at "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>, and WorldCom.

When challenged for a response to allegations that he was glamorizing crime for the sake of publicity, his response was: "Anything I could say about my person or my actions would only cheapen what they have to say for themselves". When approached for comment during his criminal case, Lamo frustrated reporters with <a href="non%20sequitur%20%28absurdism%29">non sequiturs</a>, such as: "Faith manages". (likely a reference to science fiction television show "<a href="Babylon%205">Babylon 5</a>"), and "It's a beautiful day."

At his sentencing, Lamo expressed remorse for harm he had caused by his intrusions. The court record quotes him as adding: "I want to answer for what I have done and do better with my life."

He subsequently declared on the question and answer site Quora, that: "We all own our actions in fullness, not just the pleasant aspects of them." Lamo accepted that he had committed mistakes.

On May 9, 2006, while 18 months into a two-year probation sentence, Lamo refused to give the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States government</a> a blood sample, which they had demanded in order to record his <a href="DNA">DNA</a> in their <a href="Combined%20DNA%20Index%20System">CODIS</a> system. According to his attorney, Lamo has a religious objection to giving blood but is willing to give his DNA in another form. On June 15, 2007, lawyers for Lamo filed a motion citing the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Genesis">pageRank.Book of Genesis</a> as one basis for Lamo's religious opposition to the giving of blood.

On June 21, 2007, it was reported that Lamo's legal counsel had reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a> whereby Lamo would submit DNA via <a href="buccal%20swab">buccal swab</a>. According to <a href="Kevin%20Poulsen">Kevin Poulsen</a>'s blog, "the Justice Department formally settled the case, filing a joint stipulation along with Lamo's federal public defender dropping the demand for blood.

In February 2009, a partial list of the anonymous donors to the WikiLeaks not-for-profit website was leaked and published on the WikiLeaks website. Some media sources indicated at the time that Lamo was among the donors on the list. Lamo commented on his <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> page, "Thanks WikiLeaks, for leaking your donor list... That's dedication."

In May 2010, Lamo indirectly reported to U.S. Army authorities that Manning had claimed to have leaked a large body of classified documents, including 260,000 classified United States diplomatic cables. Lamo stated that Manning also "took credit for leaking" the video footage of the <a href="July%2012%2C%202007%20Baghdad%20airstrike">July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike</a>, which has since come to be known as the "<a href="Collateral%20Murder%23Leaked%20video%20footage">Collateral Murder</a>" video.

Lamo has stated that he would not have turned Manning in "if lives weren't in danger... [Manning] was in a war zone and basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as [she] could, and just throwing it up into the air." WikiLeaks responded by denouncing Lamo and "Wired Magazine" reporter <a href="Kevin%20Poulsen">Kevin Poulsen</a> as "notorious felons, informers & manipulators", and said: "journalists should take care."

According to Andy Greenberg of "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>", Lamo may have worked as a "security specialist" with <a href="Project%20Vigilant">Project Vigilant</a>, a private security institution that works with the <a href="FBI">FBI</a> and the <a href="NSA">NSA</a>. Chet Uber, the head of Project Vigilant, has claimed, "I'm the one who called the U.S. government... All the people who say that Adrian is a narc, he did a patriotic thing. He sees all kinds of hacks, and he was seriously worried about people dying."

Lamo has been criticized by fellow hackers, such as those at the <a href="Hackers%20on%20Planet%20Earth">Hackers on Planet Earth</a> conference in 2010, who called him a "<a href="Informant">snitch</a>". Another commented to Lamo, following his speech during a panel discussion, saying: "From my perspective, I see what you have done as treason."

WikiLeaks founder <a href="Julian%20Assange">Julian Assange</a> calls Lamo "a very disreputable character", and says that Lamo's monetary support for WikiLeaks amounted to only 20 U.S. dollars on one occasion. Assange says that it is "not right to call [Lamo] a contributor to WikiLeaks", and questions the electronic record associated with the Manning–Lamo chats, because, according to Assange, Lamo has "strange motivations" and "had been in a mental hospital three weeks beforehand".

Lamo has characterized his decision to work with the government as morally ambiguous but objectively necessary, writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>": "There were no right choices that day, only less wrong ones. It was cold, it was needful, and it was no one's to make except mine," adding to "The Guardian"'s Ed Pilkington: "There were hundreds of thousands of documents—let's drop the number to 250,000 to be conservative—and doing nothing meant gambling that each and every one would do no harm if no warning was given."

The <a href="Taliban%20insurgency">Taliban insurgency</a> later announced its intention to execute Afghan nationals named in the leaks as having cooperated with the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan. By that time, the United States had received months of advance warning that their names were among the leaks. Manning was arrested and incarcerated in the U.S. military justice system and later sentenced to 35 years in confinement, which President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> commuted to a total of seven years at the end of his term, including time served. Lamo responded to the commutation with a single post on <a href="Medium%20%28website%29">Medium</a> and an interview with <a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>.

Lamo's role in the Manning case drew criticism from <a href="Glenn%20Greenwald">Glenn Greenwald</a> of "<a href="Salon%20Magazine">Salon Magazine</a>". Greenwald suggested that Lamo lied to Manning by turning Manning in, and then lied after the fact to cover up the circumstances of Manning's confessions. Greenwald places the incident in the context of what he calls "the Obama administration's unprecedented war on whistle-blowers". Greenwald's critique of "Wired Magazine" has drawn a response from that magazine which suggests that Greenwald is writing disingenuously: "At his most reasonable, Greenwald impugns our motives, attacks the character of our staff and carefully selects his facts and sources to misrepresent the truth and generate outrage in his readership." In an article about the Manning case, Greenwald mentions "Wired" reporter <a href="Kevin%20Poulsen">Kevin Poulsen</a>'s 1994 felony conviction for computer hacking, suggesting that "over the years, Poulsen has served more or less as Lamo's personal media voice." Greenwald is skeptical of an earlier story written by Poulsen about Lamo's institutionalization on psychiatric grounds, writing: "Lamo claimed he was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a somewhat fashionable autism diagnosis which many stars in the computer world have also claimed." In an article entitled "The Worsening Journalistic Disgrace at Wired", Greenwald claimed that "Wired" was "actively conceal[ing] from the public, for months on end, the key evidence in a political story that has generated headlines around the world."

On July 13, 2011, "Wired" published the logs in full, stating: "The most significant of the unpublished details have now been publicly established with sufficient authority that we no longer believe any purpose is served by withholding the logs." Greenwald wrote of the newly released logs that in his opinion they validated his claim that "Wired" had concealed important evidence.

Lamo has been critical of media coverage of the hacker collective <a href="Anonymous%20%28group%29">Anonymous</a>, claiming that media outlets have over-hyped and mythologized the group. He also said that Anonymous is not the "invulnerable" group it is claimed to be, and he can see "no rational point in what they're doing."

On August 22, 2002, Lamo was removed from a segment of "<a href="NBC%20Nightly%20News">NBC Nightly News</a>" when, after being asked to demonstrate his skills for the camera, he gained access to NBC's internal network. NBC was concerned that they broke the law by taping Lamo while he (possibly) broke the law. Lamo was a guest on "<a href="The%20Screen%20Savers">The Screen Savers</a>" five times beginning in 2002.

"<a href="Hackers%20Wanted">Hackers Wanted</a>", a documentary film focusing on Lamo's life as a hacker, was produced by <a href="Trigger%20Street%20Productions">Trigger Street Productions</a>, and narrated by <a href="Kevin%20Spacey">Kevin Spacey</a>. Focusing on the 2003 hacking scene, the film features interviews with <a href="Kevin%20Rose">Kevin Rose</a> and <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>. The film has not been conventionally released. In May 2009, a video purporting to be a trailer for "Hackers Wanted" was allegedly leaked to or by the Internet film site Eye Crave. In May 2010, an earlier cut of the film was leaked via <a href="BitTorrent%20%28protocol%29">BitTorrent</a>. According to an insider, what was leaked on the Internet was a very different film from the newer version, which includes additional footage. On June 12, 2010, a director's cut version of the film was also leaked onto torrent sites.

Lamo has also appeared on <a href="Good%20Morning%20America">Good Morning America</a>, <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a>, <a href="Democracy%20Now%21">Democracy Now!</a>, <a href="Frontline%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Frontline (U.S. TV series)</a>, and repeatedly on <a href="KCRA-TV">KCRA-TV</a> News as an expert on netcentric crime and incidents. He was interviewed for the documentaries and .

Lamo reconnected with <a href="Leo%20Laporte">Leo Laporte</a> in 2015 as a result of a <a href="Quora">Quora</a> <a href="https%3A//www.quora.com/What-is-the-deep-dark-web-and-how-do-you-access-it/answer/Adri%25C3%25A1n-Lamo">article</a> on the "<a href="dark%20web">dark web</a>" for an episode of <a href="The%20New%20Screen%20Savers">The New Screen Savers</a>, bringing things full circle.

Lamo wrote his first book, "Ask Adrian" which is a collection of his best Q&A drawn from over 500 pages of <a href="Quora">Quora</a> answers, which have received over 28,000,000 views. The book is currently available as an ebook from <a href="https%3A//buk.io/%40ea1085">Buk.io</a>, but will see additional and revised release in late 2017.

<doc id="3004" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3004" title="Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States">
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States

Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States are the members of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> other than the <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice of the United States</a>. The number of Associate Justices is determined by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> and is currently set at eight by the <a href="Judiciary%20Act%20of%201869">Judiciary Act of 1869</a>.

Like the Chief Justice, Associate Justices are nominated by the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> and are confirmed by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> by majority vote. This is provided for in <a href="Article%20Two%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Article II</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>, which states that the President "shall nominate, and by and with the <a href="Advice%20and%20consent">Advice and Consent</a> of the Senate, shall appoint... Judges of the supreme Court." Although the Constitution refers to them as "Judges of the Supreme Court", the title actually used is "Associate Justice", introduced in the <a href="Judiciary%20Act%20of%201789">Judiciary Act of 1789</a>. Associate justices were traditionally styled "Mr. Justice" in court opinions, but the title was shortened to "Justice" in 1980, a year before the first female justice was appointed.

<a href="Article%20Three%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Article III</a> of the Constitution specifies that Associate Justices, and all other <a href="United%20States%20federal%20judge">United States federal judge</a>s "shall hold their Offices during good Behavior". This language means that the appointments are effectively <a href="Life%20tenure">for life</a>, and that, once <a href="Appointment%20and%20confirmation%20to%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Confirmation">confirmed</a>, a justice's tenure of office ends only when they <a href="Death">die</a>, <a href="Retirement">retire</a>, resign, or are removed from office through the <a href="Impeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States">impeachment process</a>.

Each of the Justices of the Supreme Court has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the Chief Justice's vote counts no more than that of any other Justice. However, in drafting opinions, the Chief Justice enjoys additional influence in case disposition if in the majority through his power to assign who writes the opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. Furthermore, the Chief Justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The Chief Justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other Justices do not and is paid slightly more ($255,500 per year for the Chief Justice and $244,400 per year for each Associate Justice).

Associate Justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the Chief Justice is always considered to be the most senior. If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior Justice of the two. Currently, the senior Associate Justice is <a href="Anthony%20Kennedy">Anthony Kennedy</a>. By tradition, when the Justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Court, the justices state their views in order of seniority. The senior Associate Justice is also tasked with carrying out the Chief Justices's duties when he is unable to, or if that office is vacant.

Currently, there are eight associate justices on the Court. The justices, ordered by seniority, are:

An associate justice who leaves the Court after attaining the age and meeting the service requirements prescribed by federal statute () may retire in <a href="senior%20status">senior status</a> rather than resign. After retirement, they keep their title, and by custom may also keep a set of chambers in the Supreme Court building, and employ law clerks. The names of retired associate justices continue to appear alongside those of the active justices in the bound volumes of Supreme Court decisions. Federal statute () provides that retired Supreme Court justices may serve—if designated and assigned by the Chief Justice—on panels of the U.S. courts of appeals, or on the U.S. district courts. Retired justices are not, however, authorized to take part in the consideration or decision of any cases before the Supreme Court (unlike other retired federal judges who may be permitted do so in their former courts); neither are they known or designated as a "senior judge". When, after his retirement, <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a> attempted to take a more active role than was customary, maintaining that it was his prerogative to do so because of his senior status, he was rebuffed by Chief Justice <a href="Warren%20Burger">Warren Burger</a> and admonished by the whole Court.

Currently, there are three living retired Associate Justices: <a href="Sandra%20Day%20O%27Connor">Sandra Day O'Connor</a>, retired January 31, 2006; <a href="David%20H.%20Souter">David H. Souter</a>, retired June 29, 2009; and <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a>, retired June 29, 2010. Both O'Connor and Souter occasionally serve on panels of the Courts of Appeals of various circuits. Stevens has not performed any judicial duties.

Since the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the following 101 persons have served as Associate Justice:

Alan Jay Lerner

Alan Jay Lerner (August 31, 1918 – June 14, 1986) was an <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="lyricist">lyricist</a> and <a href="librettist">librettist</a>. In collaboration with <a href="Frederick%20Loewe">Frederick Loewe</a>, and later <a href="Burton%20Lane">Burton Lane</a>, he created some of the world's most popular and enduring works of <a href="musical%20theatre">musical theatre</a> for both the stage and on film. He won three <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>s and three <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>, among other honors.

Born in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, he was the son of Edith Adelson Lerner and Joseph Jay Lerner, whose brother, Samuel Alexander Lerner, was founder and owner of the <a href="Lerner%20Stores">Lerner Stores</a>, a chain of dress shops. One of Lerner's cousins was the radio comedian and television game show panelist <a href="Henry%20Morgan%20%28comedian%29">Henry Morgan</a>. Lerner was educated at <a href="Bedales%20School">Bedales School</a> in England, <a href="Choate%20Rosemary%20Hall">The Choate School</a> (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, (where he wrote "The Choate Marching Song") and <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a>. He attended both <a href="Camp%20Androscoggin">Camp Androscoggin</a> and <a href="Camp%20Greylock">Camp Greylock</a>. At both Choate and Harvard, Lerner was a classmate of <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>; at Choate they had worked together on the yearbook staff. Like <a href="Cole%20Porter">Cole Porter</a> at <a href="Yale">Yale</a> and <a href="Richard%20Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a> at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia</a>, his career in musical theater began with his collegiate contributions, in Lerner's case to the annual Harvard <a href="Hasty%20Pudding%20Theatricals">Hasty Pudding</a> musicals. During the summers of 1936 and 1937, Lerner studied music composition at <a href="Juilliard">Juilliard</a>. While attending Harvard, he lost his sight in his left eye due to an accident in the boxing ring. In 1957, Lerner and <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>, another of Lerner's college classmates, collaborated on "Lonely Men of Harvard," a tongue-in-cheek salute to their alma mater.

Due to his injury, Lerner could not serve in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Instead he wrote <a href="radio">radio</a> scripts, including "<a href="Your%20Hit%20Parade">Your Hit Parade</a>", until he was introduced to <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n composer <a href="Frederick%20Loewe">Frederick Loewe</a>, who needed a partner, in 1942 at the <a href="Lamb%27s%20Club">Lamb's Club</a>. While at the Lamb's, he also met <a href="Lorenz%20Hart">Lorenz Hart</a>, with whom he would also collaborate.

Lerner and Loewe's first collaboration was a musical adaptation of Barry Conners's farce "The Patsy" called "Life of the Party" for a <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> <a href="Stock%20company%20%28acting%29">stock company</a>. The lyrics were mostly written by Earle Crooker, but he had left the project, with the score needing vast improvement. It enjoyed a nine-week run and encouraged the duo to join forces with Arthur Pierson for "<a href="What%27s%20Up%3F%20%28musical%29">What's Up?</a>", which opened on Broadway in 1943. It ran for 63 performances and was followed two years later by "<a href="The%20Day%20Before%20Spring">The Day Before Spring</a>".

Their first hit was "<a href="Brigadoon%20%28musical%29">Brigadoon</a>" (1947), a romantic fantasy set in a mystical Scottish village, directed by <a href="Robert%20Lewis%20%28actor%29">Robert Lewis</a>. It was followed in 1951 by the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">Gold Rush</a> story "<a href="Paint%20Your%20Wagon%20%28musical%29">Paint Your Wagon</a>". While the show ran for nearly a year and included songs that later became pop standards, it was less successful than Lerner's previous work. He later said of "Paint Your Wagon", it was "a success but not a hit."

Lerner worked with <a href="Kurt%20Weill">Kurt Weill</a> on the stage musical "<a href="Love%20Life%20%28musical%29">Love Life</a>" (1948) and <a href="Burton%20Lane">Burton Lane</a> on the movie musical "<a href="Royal%20Wedding">Royal Wedding</a>" (1951). In that same year Lerner also wrote the <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscar-winning</a> original <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a> for "<a href="An%20American%20in%20Paris%20%28Movie%29">An American in Paris</a>", produced by <a href="Arthur%20Freed">Arthur Freed</a> and directed by <a href="Vincente%20Minnelli">Vincente Minnelli</a>. This was the same team who would later join with Lerner and Loewe to create "<a href="Gigi%20%281958%20film%29">Gigi</a>".

In 1956, Lerner and Loewe unveiled "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>". Before finishing the musical, Lerner was eager to write while "My Fair Lady" was taking so long to complete. <a href="Burton%20Lane">Burton Lane</a> and Lerner were working on a musical about <a href="Li%27l%20Abner">Li'l Abner</a>. <a href="Gabriel%20Pascal">Gabriel Pascal</a> owned the rights to "Pygmalion", which had been unsuccessful with other composers who tried to adapt it into a musical. <a href="Arthur%20Schwartz">Arthur Schwartz</a> and <a href="Howard%20Dietz">Howard Dietz</a> first tried, and then <a href="Richard%20Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a> and <a href="Oscar%20Hammerstein%20II">Oscar Hammerstein II</a> attempted, but gave up and Hammerstein told Lerner, ""Pygmalion" had no subplot". Lerner and Loewe's adaptation of <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>'s "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28play%29">Pygmalion</a>" retained his social commentary and added appropriate songs for the characters of Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, played originally by <a href="Rex%20Harrison">Rex Harrison</a> and <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>. It set box-office records in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> and <a href="London">London</a>. When brought to the screen in 1964, the movie version won eight <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscars</a>, including Best Picture and Best Actor for <a href="Rex%20Harrison">Rex Harrison</a>.

Lerner and Loewe's run of success continued with their next project, a film adaptation of stories from <a href="Colette">Colette</a>, the <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>-winning film musical "<a href="Gigi%20%281958%20film%29">Gigi</a>", starring <a href="Leslie%20Caron">Leslie Caron</a>, <a href="Louis%20Jourdan">Louis Jourdan</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Chevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a>. The film won all of its nine Oscar nominations, a record at that time, and a special Oscar for co-star Maurice Chevalier.

The Lerner-Loewe partnership cracked under the stress of producing the Arthurian "<a href="Camelot%20%28musical%29">Camelot</a>" in 1960, with Loewe resisting Lerner's desire to direct as well as write when original director <a href="Moss%20Hart">Moss Hart</a> suffered a heart attack in the last few months of rehearsals and died shortly after the show's premiere. Lerner was hospitalized with <a href="bleeding%20ulcer">bleeding ulcer</a>s while Loewe continued to have heart troubles. "Camelot" was a hit nonetheless, and immediately following the assassination of <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, his widow told reporter <a href="Theodore%20H.%20White">Theodore H. White</a> that JFK's administration reminded her of the "one brief shining moment" of Lerner and Loewe's "Camelot". As of the early 21st century, "Camelot" was still invoked to describe the <a href="idealism">idealism</a>, <a href="Romanticism">romance</a>, and <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a> of the Kennedy years.

Loewe retired to <a href="Palm%20Springs%2C%20California">Palm Springs, California</a>, while Lerner went through a series of musicals—some successful, some not—with such composers as <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a> ("<a href="Coco%20%28musical%29">Coco</a>"), <a href="John%20Barry%20%28composer%29">John Barry</a> ("<a href="Lolita%2C%20My%20Love">Lolita, My Love</a>"), <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> ("<a href="1600%20Pennsylvania%20Avenue%20%28musical%29">1600 Pennsylvania Avenue</a>"), <a href="Burton%20Lane">Burton Lane</a> ("<a href="Carmelina">Carmelina</a>") and <a href="Charles%20Strouse">Charles Strouse</a> ("<a href="Dance%20a%20Little%20Closer">Dance a Little Closer</a>", based on the film, "<a href="Idiot%27s%20Delight%20%28film%29">Idiot's Delight</a>", nicknamed "Close A Little Faster" by Broadway humorists because it closed on opening night). Most biographers blame Lerner's professional decline on the lack of a strong director with whom Lerner could collaborate, as <a href="Neil%20Simon">Neil Simon</a> did with <a href="Mike%20Nichols">Mike Nichols</a> or <a href="Stephen%20Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a> with <a href="Harold%20Prince">Harold Prince</a> (<a href="Moss%20Hart">Moss Hart</a>, who had directed "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>," died shortly after "<a href="Camelot%20%28musical%29">Camelot</a>" opened). In 1965 Lerner collaborated again with <a href="Burton%20Lane">Burton Lane</a> on the musical "<a href="On%20a%20Clear%20Day%20You%20Can%20See%20Forever">On a Clear Day You Can See Forever</a>", which was adapted for film in 1970. At this time, Lerner was hired by film producer <a href="Arthur%20P.%20Jacobs">Arthur P. Jacobs</a> to write a treatment for an upcoming film project, "<a href="Doctor%20Dolittle%20%28film%29">Doctor Dolittle</a>", but Lerner abrogated his contract after several non-productive months of non-communicative procrastination and was replaced with <a href="Leslie%20Bricusse">Leslie Bricusse</a>. Lerner was inducted into the <a href="Songwriters%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Songwriters Hall of Fame</a> in 1971.

In 1973, Lerner coaxed Loewe out of retirement to augment the "Gigi" score for a <a href="Gigi%20%28musical%29">musical stage adaptation</a>. The following year they collaborated on a musical film version of "<a href="The%20Little%20Prince%20%281974%20film%29">The Little Prince</a>", based on the classic children's tale by <a href="Antoine%20de%20Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a>. This film was a critical and box office failure, but it has gained a modern following.

Lerner's autobiography, "The Street Where I Live" (1978), was an account of three of his and Loewe's successful collaborations, "My Fair Lady", "Gigi", and "Camelot", along with personal information. In the last year of his life he published "The Musical Theatre: A Celebration", a well-reviewed history of the theatre, with personal anecdotes and humor. A book of Lerner's lyrics entitled "A Hymn To Him", edited by British writer <a href="Benny%20Green%20%28saxophonist%29">Benny Green</a>, was published in 1987.

At the time of Lerner's death, he had been working with <a href="Gerard%20Kenny">Gerard Kenny</a> and <a href="Kristi%20Kane%20%28libretto%29">Kristi Kane</a> in London on a musical version of the film "<a href="My%20Man%20Godfrey">My Man Godfrey</a>". He had also received an urgent call from <a href="Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>, asking him to write the lyrics to "<a href="The%20Phantom%20of%20the%20Opera%20%281986%20musical%29">The Phantom of the Opera</a>". He wrote "<a href="Masquerade%20%28The%20Phantom%20of%20the%20Opera%20song%29">Masquerade</a>", but he then informed Webber that he wanted to leave the project because he was losing his memory (due to an undiagnosed brain tumor). He was replaced by <a href="Charles%20Hart%20%28lyricist%29">Charles Hart</a>. He had turned down an invitation to write the English-language lyrics for the musical version of "<a href="Les%20Mis%C3%A9rables%20%28musical%29">Les Misérables</a>".

After Lerner's death, Paul Blake made a musical revue based on Lerner's lyrics and life. "Almost Like Being in Love" featured music by <a href="Frederick%20Loewe">Frederick Loewe</a>, <a href="Burton%20Lane">Burton Lane</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a>, <a href="Charles%20Strouse">Charles Strouse</a>, and <a href="Kurt%20Weill">Kurt Weill</a>. The show ran for 10 days at the <a href="Herbst%20Theatre">Herbst Theatre</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco</a>.

Lerner often struggled with writing his lyrics. He was uncharacteristically able to complete "<a href="I%20Could%20Have%20Danced%20All%20Night">I Could Have Danced All Night</a>" from "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>" in one 24-hour period. He usually spent months on each song and was constantly rewriting them. Lerner was said to have insecurity about his talent. He would sometimes write songs with someone in mind, for instance, "<a href="I%27ve%20Grown%20Accustomed%20To%20Her%20Face">I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face</a>" from "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>" was written with <a href="Rex%20Harrison">Rex Harrison</a> in mind to complement his very limited vocal range.

Lerner said of writing:
You have to keep in mind that there is no such thing as realism or naturalism in the theater. That is a myth. If there was realism in the theater, there would never be a third act. Nothing ends that way. A man's life is made up of thousands and thousands of little pieces. In writing fiction, you select 20 or 30 of them. In a musical, you select even fewer than that. First, we decide where a song is needed in a play. Second, what is it going to be about? Third, we discuss the mood of the song. Fourth, I give (Loewe) a title. Then he writes the music to the title and the general feeling of the song is established. After he's written the melody, then I write the lyrics.

In a 1979 interview on <a href="NPR">NPR</a>'s "<a href="All%20Things%20Considered">All Things Considered</a>", Lerner went into some depth about his lyrics for "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>". Professor Henry Higgins sings, "Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters / Condemned by every syllable she utters / By right she should be taken out and hung / For the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue." Lerner said he knew the lyric used incorrect grammar for the sake of a rhyme. He was later approached about it by another lyricist:
I thought, oh well, maybe nobody will notice it, but not at all. Two nights after it opened, I ran into <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> in a restaurant, and he walked over and he said, "Dear boy, it is "hanged", not "hung"." I said, "Oh, Noel, I know it, I know it! You know, shut up!" So, and there's another, "Than to ever let a woman in my life." It should be, "as to ever let a woman in my life," but it just didn't sing well.
For nearly twenty years, Lerner was <a href="Substance%20use%20disorder">addicted</a> to <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>; during the 1960s he was a patient of <a href="Max%20Jacobson">Max Jacobson</a>, known as "Dr. Feelgood", who administered injections of "vitamins with enzymes" that were in fact laced with amphetamine. Lerner's addiction is believed to have been the result of Jacobson's practice.

Lerner married eight times: Ruth Boyd (1940–1947), singer <a href="Marion%20Bell">Marion Bell</a> (1947–1949), <a href="Nancy%20Olson">Nancy Olson</a> (1950–1957), lawyer Micheline Muselli Pozzo di Borgo (1957–1965), editor Karen Gundersen (1966–1974), <a href="Sandra%20Payne">Sandra Payne</a> (1974–1976), Nina Bushkin (1977–1981) and <a href="Liz%20Robertson">Liz Robertson</a> (1981–1986 [his death]). Four of his eight wives – Olson, Payne, Bushkin, and Robertson – were actresses.
His seventh wife, Nina Bushkin, whom he married on May 30, 1977, was the director of development at <a href="Mannes%20College%20of%20Music">Mannes College of Music</a> and the daughter of composer and musician <a href="Joey%20Bushkin">Joey Bushkin</a>. After their divorce in 1981, Lerner was ordered to pay her a settlement of $50,000. Lerner wrote in his autobiography (as quoted by "The New York Times"): "All I can say is that if I had no flair for marriage, I also had no flair for bachelorhood." One of his ex-wives reportedly said, "Marriage is Alan's way of saying goodbye."

Lerner had four children: three daughters, Susan (by Boyd), Liza and Jennifer (by Olson); and one son, screenwriter and journalist <a href="Michael%20Alan%20Lerner">Michael Alan Lerner</a> (by di Borgo).

Lerner's multiple divorces cost him much of his wealth, but he was primarily responsible for his own financial ups and downs and was apparently less than truthful about his financial fecklessness. One persistent fiction, widely publicized, was that his divorce settlement from Micheline Muselli Pozzo di Borgo (his fourth wife) cost him an estimated $1 million in 1965. This was a gross distortion of the truth. Lerner's pattern of financial mismanagement continued until his death from cancer in 1986, when he reportedly owed the <a href="US%20Internal%20Revenue%20Service">US Internal Revenue Service</a> over US$1,000,000 in back taxes and was unable to pay for his final medical expenses.

On June 14, 1986, Lerner died of <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> at the age of 67. At the time of his death he was married to actress <a href="Liz%20Robertson">Liz Robertson</a>, who was 36 years his junior. He lived in <a href="Center%20Island%2C%20New%20York">Center Island, New York</a>. He has a memorial plaque in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's Church</a>, the Actor's Church in <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a> in London.

Al Capp

Alfred Gerald Caplin (September 28, 1909 – November 5, 1979), better known as Al Capp, was an American <a href="cartoonist">cartoonist</a> and humorist best known for the satirical <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> "<a href="Li%27l%20Abner">Li'l Abner</a>", which he created in 1934 and continued writing and (with help from assistants) drawing until 1977. He also wrote the comic strips "<a href="Abbie%20an%27%20Slats">Abbie an' Slats</a>" (in the years 1937–45) and "<a href="Long%20Sam">Long Sam</a>" (1954). He won the <a href="National%20Cartoonists%20Society">National Cartoonists Society</a>'s <a href="National%20Cartoonists%20Society%23Reuben%20Award">Reuben Award</a> in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year, and their 1979 <a href="E.%20C.%20Segar">Elzie Segar Award</a>, posthumously for his "unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning." Comic strips dealt with northern urban experiences until the year Capp introduced "Li'l Abner," the first strip based in the South. Although Capp was from Connecticut, he spent 43 years teaching the world about Dogpatch, reaching an estimated 60 million readers in over 900 American newspapers and 100 foreign papers in 28 countries. <a href="M.%20Thomas%20Inge">M. Thomas Inge</a> says Capp made a large personal fortune on the strip and "had a profound influence on the way the world viewed the American South."

Born in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, of East European Jewish heritage, Capp was the eldest child of Otto Philip and Matilda (Davidson) Caplin. Capp's parents were both natives of <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> whose families had migrated to New Haven in the 1880s. "My mother and father had been brought to this country from Russia when they were infants," wrote Capp in 1978. "Their fathers had found that the great promise of America was true — it was no crime to be a Jew." The Caplins were dirt poor, and Capp later recalled stories of his mother going out in the night to sift through ash barrels for reusable bits of coal.

In August 1919, at the age of nine, Capp was run down by a <a href="Tram">trolley car</a> and had to have his left leg amputated, well above the knee. According to his father Otto's unpublished autobiography, young Capp was not prepared for the amputation beforehand; having been in a coma for days, he suddenly awoke to discover that his leg was removed. He was eventually given a prosthetic leg, but only learned to use it by adopting a slow way of walking which became increasingly painful as he grew older. The childhood tragedy of losing a leg likely helped shape Capp’s cynical worldview, which, funny as it was, was certainly darker and more sardonic than that of the average newspaper cartoonist. "I was indignant as hell about that leg," he would reveal in a November 1950 interview in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine.

"The secret of how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world in which I was different from everyone else," Capp philosophically wrote (in "<a href="Life%20magazine">Life magazine</a>" on May 23, 1960), "was to be indifferent to that difference." It was the prevailing opinion among his friends that Capp's <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Swiftian</a> satire was, to some degree, a creatively channeled, compensatory response to his disability.

Capp's father, a failed businessman and an amateur cartoonist, introduced him to drawing as a form of therapy. He became quite proficient, learning mostly on his own. Among his earliest influences were "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" cartoonist–illustrator <a href="Phil%20May%20%28caricaturist%29">Phil May</a>, and American comic strip cartoonists <a href="Thomas%20Aloysius%20Dorgan">Tad Dorgan</a>, <a href="Cliff%20Sterrett">Cliff Sterrett</a>, <a href="Rube%20Goldberg">Rube Goldberg</a>, <a href="Rudolph%20Dirks">Rudolph Dirks</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Burr%20Opper">Fred Opper</a>, <a href="Billy%20DeBeck">Billy DeBeck</a>, <a href="George%20McManus">George McManus</a> and <a href="Milt%20Gross">Milt Gross</a>. At about this same time, Capp became a voracious reader. According to Capp's brother Elliot, Alfred had finished all of Shakespeare and <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> by the time he turned 13. Among his childhood favorites were <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Dickens</a>, <a href="Tobias%20Smollett">Smollett</a>, <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>, <a href="Booth%20Tarkington">Booth Tarkington</a>, and later, <a href="Robert%20Benchley">Robert Benchley</a> and <a href="S.%20J.%20Perelman">S. J. Perelman</a>.

Capp spent five years at Bridgeport High School in <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Connecticut">Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>, without receiving a diploma. The cartoonist liked to joke about how he failed geometry for nine straight terms. His formal training came from a series of art schools in the <a href="New%20England">New England</a> area. Attending three of them in rapid succession, the impoverished Capp was thrown out of each for nonpayment of tuition—the <a href="School%20of%20the%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Boston">Boston Museum School of Fine Arts</a>, the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts</a>, and Designers Art School in Boston—the latter before launching his career. Capp had already decided to become a cartoonist. "I heard that <a href="Bud%20Fisher">Bud Fisher</a> (creator of "<a href="Mutt%20and%20Jeff">Mutt and Jeff</a>") got $3,000 a week and was constantly marrying French countesses," Capp said. "I decided that was for me."

In early 1932, Capp hitchhiked to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. He lived in "airless rat holes" in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> and turned out advertising strips at $2 apiece while scouring the city hunting for jobs. He eventually found work at the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> when he was 23 years old. By March 1932, Capp was drawing "Colonel Gilfeather", a single-panel, AP-owned property created in 1930 by <a href="Richard%20Dorgan">Dick Dorgan</a>. Capp changed the focus and title to "Mister Gilfeather", but soon grew to hate the feature. He left the Associated Press in September 1932. Before leaving, he met <a href="Milton%20Caniff">Milton Caniff</a>, and the two became lifelong friends. Capp moved to <a href="Boston">Boston</a> and married Catherine Wingate Cameron, whom he had met earlier in art class. She died in 2006 at the age of 96.

Leaving his new wife with her parents in <a href="Amesbury%2C%20Massachusetts">Amesbury, Massachusetts</a>, he subsequently returned to New York in 1933, in the midst of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. "I was 23, I carried a mass of drawings, and I had nearly five dollars in my pocket. People were sleeping in alleys then, willing to work at anything." There he met <a href="Ham%20Fisher">Ham Fisher</a>, who hired him to ghost on "<a href="Joe%20Palooka">Joe Palooka</a>". During one of Fisher's extended vacations, Capp's "Joe Palooka" <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> introduced a stupid, coarse, oafish mountaineer named "Big Leviticus," a crude <a href="prototype">prototype</a>. (Leviticus was actually much closer to Capp's later villains Lem and Luke Scragg, than to the much more appealing and innocent Li'l Abner.)

Also during this period, Capp was working at night on samples for the strip that would eventually become "<a href="Li%27l%20Abner">Li'l Abner</a>". He based his cast of characters on the authentic mountain-dwellers he met while hitchhiking through rural <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> and the <a href="Cumberland%20Valley">Cumberland Valley</a> as a teenager. (This was years before the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> Act brought basic utilities like electricity and running water to the region.) Leaving "Joe Palooka", Capp sold "Li'l Abner" to United Feature Syndicate (now known as <a href="United%20Media">United Media</a>). The feature was launched on Monday, August 13, 1934, in eight North American newspapers—including the "<a href="New%20York%20Mirror">New York Mirror</a>"—and was an immediate success. Alfred G. Caplin eventually became "Al Capp" because the syndicate felt the original would not fit in a cartoon frame. Capp had it changed legally in 1949.

His younger brother <a href="Elliot%20Caplin">Elliot Caplin</a> also became a comic strip writer, best known for co-creating the <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> strip "<a href="The%20Heart%20of%20Juliet%20Jones">The Heart of Juliet Jones</a>" with artist <a href="Stan%20Drake">Stan Drake</a> and conceiving the comic strip character "<a href="Broom-Hilda">Broom-Hilda</a>" with cartoonist <a href="Russell%20Myers">Russell Myers</a>. Elliot also authored several off-Broadway plays, including "A Nickel for Picasso" (1981), which was based on and dedicated to his mother and his famous brother.

What began as a <a href="hillbilly">hillbilly</a> <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> soon evolved into one of the most imaginative, popular and well-drawn strips of the 20th century. Featuring vividly outlandish characters, bizarre situations, and equal parts <a href="suspense">suspense</a>, <a href="slapstick">slapstick</a>, <a href="irony">irony</a>, <a href="satire">satire</a>, <a href="black%20humor">black humor</a> and biting <a href="social%20commentary">social commentary</a>, "Li'l Abner" is considered a classic of the genre. The comic strip stars Li'l Abner Yokum—the simple-minded, loutish but good-natured and eternally innocent hayseed who lives with his parents—scrawny but superhuman Mammy Yokum, and shiftless, childlike Pappy Yokum.

"Yokum" was a combination of "yokel" and "hokum", although Capp established a deeper meaning for the name during a series of visits around 1965–1970 with comics historians George E. Turner and Michael H. Price. “It’s phonetic <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a>—that’s what it is, all right—and that’s what I was getting at with the name Yokum, more so than any attempt to sound "hickish,"" said Capp. "That was a fortunate coincidence, of course, that the name should pack a backwoods connotation. But it’s a godly conceit, really, playing off a godly name—"<a href="Joachim">Joachim</a>" means 'God’s determination', something like that—that also happens to have a rustic ring to it."

The Yokums live in the backwater hamlet of <a href="Dogpatch">Dogpatch</a>, <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. Described by its creator as "an average stone-age community," Dogpatch mostly consists of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, pine trees, "tarnip" fields and "hawg" wallows. Whatever energy Abner had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae Scragg, his sexy, well-endowed (but virtuous) girlfriend—until Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This newsworthy event made the cover of "Life" on March 31, 1952.

Capp peopled his comic strip with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Hairless Joe, Lonesome Polecat, Evil-Eye Fleegle, General Bullmoose, Lena the Hyena, Senator Jack S. Phogbound (Capp's caricature of the anti-<a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> <a href="Dixiecrats">Dixiecrats</a>), the "(shudder!)" Scraggs, Available Jones, Nightmare Alice, Earthquake McGoon, and a host of others. Most notably, certainly from a <a href="GI%20%28military%29">G.I.</a> point of view, are the beautiful, full-figured women like Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Stupefyin' Jones and Moonbeam McSwine (a caricature of his wife Catherine, aside from the dirt)—all of whom found their way onto the <a href="nose%20art">painted noses</a> of <a href="bomber%20aircraft">bomber planes</a> during World War II and the Korean War. Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the <a href="Shmoo">Shmoo</a>s, creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it. Another famous character was <a href="Joe%20Btfsplk">Joe Btfsplk</a>, who wants to be a loving friend but is "the world's worst jinx," bringing bad luck to all those nearby. Btfsplk (his name is "pronounced" by simply blowing a "raspberry" or <a href="Bronx%20cheer%20%28gesture%29">Bronx cheer</a>) always has an iconic dark cloud over his head.

Dogpatch residents regularly combat the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials and intellectuals with their homespun simplicity. Situations often take the characters to other destinations, including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, and some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's invention. The latter includes El Passionato, Kigmyland, The Republic of Crumbumbo, Skunk Hollow, The Valley of the Shmoon, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, and a miserable frozen wasteland known as <a href="Lower%20Slobbovia">Lower Slobbovia</a>, a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy that remains a contemporary reference. "Indeed, "Li'l Abner" incorporates such a panoply of characters and ideas that it defies summary," according to cultural historian Anthony Harkins. "Yet though Capp's storylines often wandered far afield, his hillbilly setting remained a central touchstone, serving both as a microcosm and a distorting carnival mirror of broader American society."

The strip's popularity grew from an original eight papers, to ultimately more than 900. At its peak, "Li'l Abner" was estimated to have been read daily in the United States by 60 to 70 million people (the U.S. population at the time was only 180 million), with adult readers far outnumbering children. Many communities, high schools and colleges staged <a href="Sadie%20Hawkins%20dance">Sadie Hawkins dance</a>s, patterned after the similar annual event in the strip.

Li'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question “Which side does Abner part his hair on?," Capp would answer, “Both.” Capp said he finally found the right "look" for Li'l Abner with <a href="Henry%20Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>'s character Dave Tolliver, in "<a href="The%20Trail%20of%20the%20Lonesome%20Pine%20%281936%20film%29">The Trail of the Lonesome Pine</a>" (1936). In later years, Capp always claimed to have effectively created the <a href="miniskirt">miniskirt</a>, when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.

"Li'l Abner" also features a comic strip-within-the-strip: "<a href="Fearless%20Fosdick">Fearless Fosdick</a>" is a parody of <a href="Chester%20Gould">Chester Gould</a>'s "<a href="Dick%20Tracy">Dick Tracy</a>". It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently over the next 35 years. Gould was personally parodied in the series as cartoonist "Lester Gooch"—the diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged "creator" of Fosdick. The style of the "Fosdick" sequences closely mimicks "Tracy", including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a>, the crosshatched shadows, and even the lettering style. In 1952, Fosdick was the star of his own short-lived <a href="puppet%20show">puppet show</a> on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, featuring the Mary Chase <a href="marionette">marionette</a>s.

Besides "Dick Tracy", Capp parodied many other comic strips in "Li'l Abner"—including "<a href="Steve%20Canyon">Steve Canyon</a>", "<a href="Superman%20%28comic%20strip%29">Superman</a>" (at least twice; first as "Jack Jawbreaker" in 1947, and again in 1966 as "Chickensouperman"), "<a href="Mary%20Worth">Mary Worth</a>" as "Mary Worm", "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" {with "Peewee" a parody of Charlie Brown with "Croopy" parody of <a href="Snoopy">Snoopy</a>" {1968} drawn by Bedley Damp a parody of <a href="Charles%20Schulz">Charles Schulz</a>}, "<a href="Rex%20Morgan%2C%20M.D.">Rex Morgan, M.D.</a>", "<a href="Little%20Annie%20Rooney">Little Annie Rooney</a>" and "<a href="Little%20Orphan%20Annie">Little Orphan Annie</a>" (in which Punjab became "Punjbag," an oleaginous slob). "Fearless Fosdick"—and Capp's other spoofs like "Little Fanny Gooney" (1952) and "Jack Jawbreaker"—were almost certainly an early inspiration for <a href="Harvey%20Kurtzman">Harvey Kurtzman</a>'s "<a href="Mad%20Magazine">Mad Magazine</a>", which began in 1952 as a <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> that specifically parodied other comics in the same distinctive style and subversive manner.

Capp also lampooned popular recording idols of the day, such as <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> ("Hawg McCall," 1957), <a href="Liberace">Liberace</a> ("Loverboynik," 1956), <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> ("the Beasties," 1964)—and in 1944, <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>. "Sinatra was the first great public figure I ever wrote about," Capp once said. "I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, and we were all surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always made it a point to send me champagne whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant..." (from "Frank Sinatra, My Father" by <a href="Nancy%20Sinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a>, 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was "cut to the quick" over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action—as would <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a> later, over "Joanie Phoanie" in 1967.

Capp was just as likely to parody himself; his self-caricature made frequent, tongue-in-cheek appearances in "Li'l Abner". The gag was often at his own expense, as in the above 1951 sequence showing Capp's interaction with "fans" (see excerpt), or in his 1955 <a href="Disneyland%20Park%20%28Anaheim%29">Disneyland</a> parody, "Hal Yappland." Just about anything could be a target for Capp's satire—in one storyline Li'l Abner is revealed to be the <a href="Transitional%20fossil%23Missing%20links">missing link</a> between ape and man. In another, the search is on in Dogpatch for a pair of missing socks knitted by the first President of the United States.
In addition to creating "Li'l Abner", Capp also co-created two other newspaper strips: "<a href="Abbie%20an%27%20Slats">Abbie an' Slats</a>" with magazine illustrator <a href="Raeburn%20van%20Buren">Raeburn van Buren</a> in 1937, and "<a href="Long%20Sam">Long Sam</a>" with cartoonist <a href="Bob%20Lubbers">Bob Lubbers</a> in 1954, as well as the Sunday "<a href="topper%20%28comic%20strip%29">topper</a>" strips "Washable Jones," "Small Fry" (a.k.a. "Small Change"), and "Advice fo' Chillun."

According to comics historian <a href="Coulton%20Waugh">Coulton Waugh</a>, a 1947 poll of newspaper readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed to making a single exception: "Li'l Abner". "When "Li'l Abner" made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into "Li'l Abner". The strip was the first to regularly introduce characters and story lines having nothing to do with the nominal stars of the strip. The technique—as invigorating as it was unorthodox—was later adopted by cartoonists like <a href="Walt%20Kelly">Walt Kelly</a> ["<a href="Pogo%20%28comics%29">Pogo</a>"] and <a href="Garry%20Trudeau">Garry Trudeau</a> ["<a href="Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a>"]," wrote comic strip historian <a href="Rick%20Marschall">Rick Marschall</a>. According to Marschall, "Li'l Abner" gradually evolved into a broad satire of <a href="human%20nature">human nature</a>. In his book "America's Great Comic Strip Artists" (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly misanthropic subtext.

Over the years, "Li'l Abner" has been adapted to radio, <a href="Character%20animation">animated cartoons</a>, stage production, <a href="motion%20pictures">motion pictures</a> and television. Capp has been compared, at various times, to Mark Twain, <a href="Dostoevski">Dostoevski</a>, <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>, <a href="Lawrence%20Sterne">Lawrence Sterne</a> and <a href="Rabelais">Rabelais</a>. Fans of the strip ranged from novelist <a href="John%20Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>, who called Capp "possibly the best writer in the world today" in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature—to media critic and theorist <a href="Marshall%20McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a>, who considered Capp "the only robust satirical force in American life." <a href="John%20Updike">John Updike</a>, comparing Abner to a “hillbilly <a href="Candide">Candide</a>,” added that the strip’s “richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the <a href="Voltairean">Voltairean</a>.” <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>, <a href="William%20F.%20Buckley">William F. Buckley</a>, <a href="Al%20Hirschfeld">Al Hirschfeld</a>, <a href="Harpo%20Marx">Harpo Marx</a>, <a href="Russ%20Meyer">Russ Meyer</a>, <a href="John%20Kenneth%20Galbraith">John Kenneth Galbraith</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Bakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a>, <a href="Shel%20Silverstein">Shel Silverstein</a>, <a href="Hugh%20Downs">Hugh Downs</a>, <a href="Gene%20Shalit">Gene Shalit</a>, <a href="Frank%20Cho">Frank Cho</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Clowes">Daniel Clowes</a> and (reportedly) even <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth</a> have confessed to being fans of "Li'l Abner".

"Li'l Abner" was also the subject of the first book-length, scholarly assessment of an American comic strip ever published. "Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire" by <a href="Arthur%20Asa%20Berger">Arthur Asa Berger</a> (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature and grotesquerie, the place of "Li'l Abner" in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. "One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture," wrote Professor Berger, ""Li'l Abner" is worth studying... because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance." It was reprinted by the <a href="University%20Press%20of%20Mississippi">University Press of Mississippi</a> in 1994.

During World War II and for many years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to <a href="hospital">hospital</a>s to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his <a href="prosthetic">prosthetic</a> leg his whole life. In 1946 Capp created a special full-color comic book, "Al Capp by Li'l Abner", to be distributed by the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp was also involved with the <a href="Elizabeth%20Kenny">Sister Kenny Foundation</a>, which pioneered new treatments for <a href="polio">polio</a> in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fund-raising appeals, and entertained crippled and <a href="paraplegic">paraplegic</a> children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories and sketches.

In 1940, an <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO</a> <a href="Li%27l%20Abner%20%281940%20film%29">movie adaptation</a> starred Granville Owen (later known as <a href="Jeff%20York">Jeff York</a>) as Li'l Abner, with <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a> taking the role of Lonesome Polecat, and featuring a title song with lyrics by <a href="Milton%20Berle">Milton Berle</a>. A successful musical comedy adaptation of the strip opened on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> at the St. James Theater on November 15, 1956, and had a long run of 693 performances, followed by a nationwide tour. The <a href="Li%27l%20Abner%20%28musical%29">stage musical</a>, with music and lyrics by <a href="Gene%20de%20Paul">Gene de Paul</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Mercer">Johnny Mercer</a>, was adapted into a <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> <a href="Li%27l%20Abner%20%281959%20film%29">motion picture</a> at <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount</a> in 1959 by producer <a href="Norman%20Panama">Norman Panama</a> and director <a href="Melvin%20Frank">Melvin Frank</a>, with a score by <a href="Nelson%20Riddle">Nelson Riddle</a>. Several performers repeated their Broadway roles in the film, most memorably <a href="Julie%20Newmar">Julie Newmar</a> as Stupefyin' Jones and <a href="Stubby%20Kaye">Stubby Kaye</a> as Marryin' Sam.

Other highlights of that decade included the 1942 debut of Fearless Fosdick as Abner's "ideel" (hero); the 1946 Lena the Hyena Contest, in which a hideous Lower Slobbovian gal was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, <a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a> and <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>) drawn by noted cartoonist <a href="Basil%20Wolverton">Basil Wolverton</a>; and an ill-fated Sunday parody of "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28novel%29">Gone With the Wind</a>" that aroused anger and legal threats from author <a href="Margaret%20Mitchell">Margaret Mitchell</a>, and led to a printed apology within the strip. In October 1947, Li'l Abner met Rockwell P. Squeezeblood, head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Comic Strip Syndicate. The resulting sequence, "Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!," was a devastating satire of <a href="Jerry%20Siegel">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href="Joe%20Shuster">Joe Shuster</a>'s notorious exploitation by <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> over "<a href="Superman">Superman</a>". It was later reprinted in "The World of Li'l Abner" (1953). (Siegel and Shuster had earlier poked fun at Capp in a "Superman" story in "<a href="Action%20Comics">Action Comics</a> #55", December 1942, in which a cartoonist named "Al Hatt" invents a comic strip featuring the hillbilly "Tiny Rufe.")

In 1947, Capp earned a "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" cover story. That same year the "<a href="New%20Yorker%20magazine">New Yorker's</a>" profile on him was so long that it ran in consecutive issues. In 1948, Capp reached a creative peak with the introduction of the Shmoos, lovable and innocent fantasy creatures who reproduced at amazing speed and brought so many benefits that, ironically, the world economy was endangered. The much-copied storyline was a <a href="parable">parable</a> that was <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>ically interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

Following his close friend Milton Caniff's lead (with "<a href="Steve%20Canyon">Steve Canyon</a>"), Capp had recently fought a successful battle with the syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950—including a "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, "The Life and Times of the Shmoo", became a bestseller for <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a>. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including "Shmooveralls." The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, "The Return of the Shmoo", have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos would later have their own animated TV series.

Capp followed this success with other <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> fantasy critters, including the aboriginal and <a href="Self-defeating%20personality%20disorder">masochistic</a> "Kigmies", who craved abuse (a story that began as a veiled comment on racial and religious oppression), the dreaded "Nogoodniks" (or "bad" shmoos), and the irresistible "Bald Iggle", a guileless creature whose sad-eyed countenance compelled involuntary truthfulness—with predictably disastrous results.

"Li'l Abner" was <a href="censorship">censored</a> for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by <a href="Scripps-Howard">Scripps-Howard</a>. The controversy, as reported in "Time", centered on Capp's portrayal of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>. Said Edward Leech of Scripps, "We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks ... boobs and undesirables." He criticized <a href="Senator%20Joseph%20McCarthy">Senator Joseph McCarthy</a> in 1954, calling him a "poet." "He uses <a href="poetic%20license">poetic license</a> to try to create the beautifully ordered world of good guys and bad guys that he wants," said Capp. "He seems at his best when terrifying the helpless and naïve."

Capp received the <a href="National%20Cartoonists%20Society">National Cartoonists Society</a>'s <a href="National%20Cartoonists%20Society%23Billy%20DeBeck%20Memorial%20Award">Billy DeBeck Memorial Award</a> in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year. (When the award name was changed in 1954, Capp also retroactively received a <a href="National%20Cartoonists%20Society%23Reuben%20Award">Reuben</a> statuette.) He was an outspoken pioneer in favor of diversifying the NCS by admitting women cartoonists. Originally, the Society had disallowed female members. Capp briefly resigned his membership in 1949 to protest their refusal of admission to <a href="Hilda%20Terry">Hilda Terry</a>, creator of the comic strip "<a href="Teena">Teena</a>". According to Tom Roberts, author of "<a href="Alex%20Raymond">Alex Raymond</a>: His Life and Art" (2007), Capp delivered a stirring speech that was instrumental in changing those rules. The NCS finally accepted female members the following year. In December 1952, Capp published an article in "Real" magazine titled “The REAL Powers in America” that further challenged the conventional attitudes of the day: "The real powers in America are "women"—the wives and sweethearts behind the masculine dummies ..."

Highlights of the 1950s included the much-heralded marriage of Abner and Daisy Mae in 1952, the birth of their son "Honest Abe" Yokum in 1953, and in 1954, the introduction of Abner's enormous, long lost kid brother Tiny Yokum, who filled Abner's place as a bachelor in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. In 1952, Capp and his characters graced the covers of both "Life" and "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>". 1956 saw the debut of the Bald Iggle, considered by some "Abner" enthusiasts to be the creative high point of the strip, as well as Mammy's revelatory encounter with the "Square Eyes" Family—Capp’s thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. (This <a href="fable">fable</a>-like story was collected into an educational comic book called "Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!", and distributed by the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a> of <a href="B%27nai%20B%27rith">B'nai B'rith</a> later that year.) Two years later, Capp's studio issued "<a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20and%20the%20Montgomery%20Story">Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story</a>", a biographical comic book distributed by the <a href="Fellowship%20of%20Reconciliation">Fellowship of Reconciliation</a>.

Capp had often parodied corporate greed—pork tycoon J. Roaringham Fatback had figured prominently in wiping out the Shmoos. But in 1952, when <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> president <a href="Charles%20Erwin%20Wilson">Charles E. Wilson</a>, nominated for a cabinet post, told <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> "... what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa," he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires—the introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying "What's good for General Bullmoose is good for "everybody!"" Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of "haves" versus "have-nots". This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the <a href="Left-wing%20politics">Left</a>, and would increase their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.

After Capp quit his ghosting job on <a href="Ham%20Fisher">Ham Fisher</a>'s "Joe Palooka" in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had "stolen" his idea. For years, Fisher would bring the characters back to his strip, billing them as "The ORIGINAL Hillbilly Characters" and advising readers not to be "fooled by imitations." (In fact, Fisher's brutish hillbilly character—Big Leviticus, created by Capp in Fisher's absence—bore little resemblance to Li'l Abner.) According to a November 1950 "Time" article, "Capp parted from Fisher with a definite impression, (to put it mildly) that he had been underpaid and unappreciated. Fisher, a man of Roman self esteem, considered Capp an ingrate and a whippersnapper, and watched his rise to fame with unfeigned horror."

"Fisher repeatedly brought Leviticus and his clan back, claiming their primacy as comics' first hillbilly family — but he was missing the point. It wasn't the setting that made Capp's strip such a huge success. It was Capp's finely tuned sense of the absurd, his ability to milk an outrageous situation for every laugh in it and then, impossibly, to squeeze even more laughs from it, that found such favor with the public," (from <a href="Don%20Markstein">Don Markstein</a>'s "<a href="Toonopedia">Toonopedia</a>").

The Capp-Fisher feud was well known in cartooning circles, and it grew more personal as Capp's strip eclipsed "Joe Palooka" in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, <a href="Moe%20Leff">Moe Leff</a>. After Fisher underwent <a href="plastic%20surgery">plastic surgery</a>, Capp included a racehorse in "Li'l Abner" named "Ham's Nose-Bob." In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named "Happy Vermin"—a caricature of Fisher—who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet, (after sacking his previous "temporary" assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: "I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do — I'll get "you" a new light bulb!!"

Traveling in the same social circles, the two men engaged in a 20-year mutual vendetta, as described by the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" in 1998: "They crossed paths often, in the midtown watering holes and at National Cartoonists Society banquets, and the city's gossip columns were full of their snarling public donnybrooks." In 1950, Capp wrote a nasty article for "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>", titled "I Remember Monster." The article recounted Capp's days working for an unnamed "benefactor" with a miserly, swinish personality, who Capp claimed was a never-ending source of inspiration when it came time to create a new unregenerate villain for his comic strip. The thinly-veiled boss was understood to be Ham Fisher.

Fisher retaliated clumsily, doctoring photostats of "Li'l Abner" and falsely accusing Capp of sneaking obscenities into his comic strip. Fisher submitted examples of "Li'l Abner" to Capp's syndicate and to the New York courts, in which Fisher had identified pornographic images that were hidden in the background art. However, the X-rated material had actually been drawn there by Fisher. Capp was able to refute the accusation by simply showing the original artwork.

In 1954, when Capp was applying for a Boston television license, the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) received an anonymous packet of pornographic "Li'l Abner" drawings. The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) convened an ethics hearing, and Fisher was expelled for the forgery from the same organization that he had helped found; Fisher's scheme had backfired in spectacular fashion. Around the same time, his mansion in Wisconsin was destroyed by a storm. On December 27, 1955, Fisher committed suicide in his studio. The feud and Fisher's suicide were used as the basis for a lurid, highly fictionalized murder mystery, "Strip for Murder" by <a href="Max%20Allan%20Collins">Max Allan Collins</a>.

Another "feud" seemed to be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip "<a href="Mary%20Worth">Mary Worth</a>" as "Mary Worm." The title character was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. <a href="Allen%20Saunders">Allen Saunders</a>, the creator of the "Mary Worth" strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character "Hal Rapp," a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist, (Capp was a <a href="teetotaler">teetotaler</a>). Later, it was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders "feud" fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips—and Capp and Saunders had a good laugh when all was revealed.

Capp is often associated with two other giants of the medium: <a href="Milton%20Caniff">Milton Caniff</a> ("<a href="Terry%20and%20the%20Pirates%20%28comic%20strip%29">Terry and the Pirates</a>", "Steve Canyon") and <a href="Walt%20Kelly">Walt Kelly</a> ("<a href="Pogo%20%28comic%20strip%29">Pogo</a>"). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally referenced each other in their strips. According to one <a href="anecdote">anecdote</a> (from "Al Capp Remembered", 1994), Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home—leaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's <a href="baby%20grand%20piano">baby grand piano</a>. According to Capp, who loved to relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and the United States, and b. "Because you can't play the piano, anyway!" ("<a href="Beetle%20Bailey">Beetle Bailey</a>" creator <a href="Mort%20Walker">Mort Walker</a> confirmed the story, relating a slightly expanded version in his autobiography, "Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook", 2001.)

Milton Caniff offered another anecdote (from "Phi Beta Pogo", 1989) involving Capp and Walt Kelly, "two boys from <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Connecticut">Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>, nose to nose," onstage at a meeting of the Newspaper Comics Council in the sixties. "Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is really how you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only showing you this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing "his" version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them ..."

Although he was often considered a difficult person, some acquaintances of Capp have stressed that the cartoonist also had a sensitive side; in 1973, when learning that the son of his political rival <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> had had his right leg amputated, Capp wrote the boy a letter of encouragement, giving candid advice as to how to deal with the loss of a limb, which he himself had experienced as a boy. One of Capp's grandchildren recalls that at one point, tears were streaming down the cartoonist's cheeks while he was watching a documentary about the <a href="Jonestown">Jonestown</a> massacre. Capp is also reported to have given money anonymously to charities and "people in need" at various points in his life.

In her autobiography, American actress <a href="Goldie%20Hawn">Goldie Hawn</a> stated that Capp sexually propositioned her on a <a href="casting%20couch">casting couch</a> and exposed himself to her when she was nineteen years old. When she refused his advances, Capp became angry and told her that she was "never gonna make anything in your life" and that she should "go and marry a Jewish dentist. You'll never get anywhere in this business."

Like many cartoonists, Capp made extensive use of assistants (notably Andy Amato, Harvey Curtis, Walter Johnson and Frank Frazetta). During the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, public service comics and other specialty work—in addition to the regular six dailies and one <a href="Sunday%20strip">Sunday strip</a> per week. From the early 1940s to the late 1950s, there were scores of Sunday strip-style magazine ads for <a href="Cream%20of%20Wheat">Cream of Wheat</a> using the "Abner" characters, and in the 1950s, Fearless Fosdick became a spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic in a series of daily strip-style print ads. The characters also sold chainsaws, underwear, ties, detergent, candy, soft drinks—including a licensed version of Capp's moonshine creation, <a href="Kickapoo%20Joy%20Juice">Kickapoo Joy Juice</a>—and <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> and <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a> products, all requiring special artwork.

No matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on drawing and inking the characters' faces and hands—especially of Abner and Daisy Mae—himself, and his distinctive touch is often discernible. "He had "the touch,"" Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. "He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it "pop". I'll never knock his talent."

As is usual with collaborative efforts in comic strips, his name was the only one credited— although, sensitive to his own experience working on "Joe Palooka", Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" even included photos of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy (along with the subsequent fame of Frank Frazetta) has led to the misconception that his strip was "ghosted" by other hands. The production of "Li'l Abner" has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp himself originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the hands and faces of the characters. Frazetta authority David Winiewicz described the everyday working mode of operation in "Li'l Abner Dailies: 1954 Volume 20" (Kitchen Sink, 1994):

There was also a separate line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned <a href="Toby%20Press">Toby Press</a>, including "Shmoo Comics" featuring Washable Jones. Cartoonist <a href="Mell%20Lazarus">Mell Lazarus</a>, creator of "<a href="Miss%20Peach">Miss Peach</a>" and "<a href="Momma">Momma</a>", wrote a comic novel in 1963 titled "The Boss Is Crazy, Too" which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the <a href="Charles%20Schulz%20Museum">Charles Schulz Museum</a> on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby "the five funniest years of my life." Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the "four essentials" in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, <a href="Charles%20Schulz">Charles Schulz</a> and <a href="Milton%20Caniff">Milton Caniff</a>.

Capp detailed his approach to writing and drawing the stories in an instructional course book for the <a href="Famous%20Artists%20School">Famous Artists School</a>, beginning in 1956. In 1959, Capp recorded and released an album for <a href="Folkways%20Records">Folkways Records</a> (now owned by the <a href="Smithsonian">Smithsonian</a>) on which he identified and described "The Mechanics of the Comic Strip."

Frazetta, later famous as a <a href="fantasy%20art">fantasy art</a>ist, assisted on the strip from 1954 to December, 1961. Fascinated by Frazetta's abilities, Capp initially gave him a free hand in an extended daily sequence (about a biker named "Frankie," a caricature of Frazetta) to experiment with the basic look of the strip by adding a bit more realism and detail (particularly to the inking). After editors complained about the stylistic changes, the strip's previous look was restored. During most of his tenure with Capp, Frazetta's primary responsibility—along with various specialty art, such as a series of "Li'l Abner" greeting cards—was tight-penciling the Sunday pages from studio roughs. This work was collected by <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a> in a four-volume hardcover series entitled "Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Frazetta Years". In 1961, Capp, complaining of declining revenue, wanted to have Frazetta continue with a 50% pay cut. "[Capp] said he would cut the salary in half. Goodbye. That was that. "I" said goodbye," (from "Frazetta: Painting with Fire"). However, Frazetta returned briefly a few years later to draw a public service comic book called "Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space", distributed by the <a href="Job%20Corps">Job Corps</a> in 1965.

Capp provided specialty artwork for civic groups, government agencies and charitable or non-profit organizations, spanning several decades. The following titles are all single-issue, educational comic books and pamphlets produced for various <a href="public%20services">public services</a>:


In addition, Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the <a href="U.S.%20Treasury">U.S. Treasury</a>, the Cancer Foundation, the <a href="March%20of%20Dimes">March of Dimes</a>, the National Heart Fund, the <a href="Elizabeth%20Kenny">Sister Kenny Foundation</a>, the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a>, <a href="Community%20Chest%20%28organization%29">Community Chest</a>, the National Reading Council, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, <a href="Christmas%20Seal%20%26amp%3B%20Charity%20Stamp%20Society">Christmas Seals</a>, the National Amputation Foundation and <a href="Disabled%20American%20Veterans">Disabled American Veterans</a>, among others.

In the Golden Age of the American comic strip, successful cartoonists received a great deal of attention; their professional and private lives were reported in the press, and their celebrity was often nearly sufficient to rival their creations. As "Li'l Abner" reached its peak years, and following the success of the Shmoos and other high moments in his work, Al Capp achieved a public profile that is still unparalleled in his profession, and arguably exceeded the fame of his strip. "Capp was the best known, most influential and most controversial cartoonist of his era," writes publisher (and leading Shmoo collector) <a href="Denis%20Kitchen">Denis Kitchen</a>. "His personal celebrity transcended comics, reaching the public and influencing the culture in a variety of media. For many years he simultaneously produced the daily strip, a weekly syndicated <a href="newspaper%20column">newspaper column</a>, and a 500-station <a href="radio%20program">radio program</a>..." He ran the Boston Summer Theatre with "<a href="The%20Phantom%20%28comics%29">The Phantom</a>" cartoonist <a href="Lee%20Falk">Lee Falk</a>, bringing in Hollywood actors such as <a href="Mae%20West">Mae West</a>, <a href="Melvyn%20Douglas">Melvyn Douglas</a> and <a href="Claude%20Rains">Claude Rains</a> to star in their live productions. He even briefly considered running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> urged Capp to run in the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> primary in 1970 against <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a>, but Capp ultimately declined. (He did, however, donate his services as a speaker at a $100-a-plate fundraiser for Republican Congressman <a href="Jack%20Kemp">Jack Kemp</a>.)

Besides his use of the comic strip to voice his opinions and display his humor, Capp was a popular guest speaker at universities, and on radio and <a href="television">television</a>. He remains the only cartoonist to be embraced by TV; no other comic artist to date has come close to Capp's televised exposure. Capp appeared as a regular on "<a href="The%20Author%20Meets%20the%20Critics">The Author Meets the Critics</a>" (1948–'54) and made regular, weekly appearances on "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">Today</a>" in 1953. He was also a periodic panelist on ABC and NBC's "<a href="Who%20Said%20That%3F">Who Said That?</a>" (1948–'55), and co-hosted DuMont's "<a href="What%27s%20the%20Story">What's the Story?</a>" (1953). Between 1952 and 1972, he hosted at least "five" television shows–three different <a href="talk%20show">talk show</a>s called "The Al Capp Show" (1952 and 1968) and "Al Capp" (1971–'72), "Al Capp's America" (a live "chalk talk," with Capp providing a barbed commentary while sketching cartoons, 1954), and a CBS game show called "Anyone Can Win" (1953). He also hosted similar vehicles on the radio—and was a familiar celebrity guest on various other broadcast programs, including the long-running NBC Radio Monitor Beacon as a commentator dubbed "An expert of nothing with opinions on everything", "<a href="Monitor%20%28NBC%20radio%29">Monitor</a>".

His frequent appearances on NBC's "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show">The Tonight Show</a>" spanned three emcees (<a href="Steve%20Allen">Steve Allen</a>, <a href="Jack%20Paar">Jack Paar</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Carson">Johnny Carson</a>), from the 1950s to the 1970s. One memorable story, as recounted to Johnny Carson, was about his meeting with then-President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. As Capp was ushered into the <a href="Oval%20Office">Oval Office</a>, his <a href="Prosthesis">prosthetic leg</a> suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, "Call <a href="Walter%20Reed%20Army%20Medical%20Center">Walter Reed</a> (Hospital), or maybe <a href="National%20Naval%20Medical%20Center">Bethesda</a>," to which Capp replied, "Hell no, just call a good local mechanic!" (Capp also spoofed Carson in his strip, in a 1970 episode called "The Tommy Wholesome Show.")

Capp portrayed himself in a cameo role in the <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> film "That Certain Feeling", for which he also provided promotional art. He was interviewed live on "<a href="Person%20to%20Person">Person to Person</a>" on November 27, 1959, by host <a href="Charles%20Collingwood%20%28journalist%29">Charles Collingwood</a>. He also appeared as himself on "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>", <a href="Sid%20Caesar">Sid Caesar</a>'s "<a href="Your%20Show%20of%20Shows">Your Show of Shows</a>", "<a href="The%20Red%20Skelton%20Show">The Red Skelton Show</a>", "<a href="The%20Merv%20Griffin%20Show">The Merv Griffin Show</a>", "<a href="The%20Mike%20Douglas%20Show">The Mike Douglas Show</a>", and guested on <a href="Ralph%20Edwards">Ralph Edwards</a>' "<a href="This%20Is%20Your%20Life">This Is Your Life</a>" on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, in a wide variety of publications including "<a href="Life%20magazine">Life</a>", "Show", "Pageant", "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>", "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>", "Coronet", and "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>". Capp was impersonated by comedians <a href="Rich%20Little">Rich Little</a> and <a href="David%20Frye">David Frye</a>. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends <a href="Milton%20Caniff">Milton Caniff</a> and Walt Kelly), and—with an irony that would become apparent later—a brand of cigarettes, (<a href="Chesterfield%20cigarettes">Chesterfield</a>).

Capp would resume visiting war amputees during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. He toured Vietnam with the <a href="USO">USO</a>, entertaining troops along with <a href="Art%20Buchwald">Art Buchwald</a> and <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a>. He served as chairman of the Cartoonists' Committee in President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>'s People-to-People program in 1954 (although Capp had actually supported <a href="Adlai%20Stevenson%20II">Adlai Stevenson</a> for president in 1952 and 1956), which was organized to promote <a href="Savings%20bond">Savings bond</a>s for the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">U.S. Treasury</a>. Capp had earlier provided the Shmoo for a special Children's Savings Bond in 1949, accompanying President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> at the bond's unveiling ceremony. During the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s blockade of <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a> in 1948, the commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting inflatable shmoos as part of "Operation: Little Vittles." Candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron during the <a href="humanitarian">humanitarian</a> effort. "When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted," (reported in "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>"—October 11, 1948).

In addition to his public service work for charitable organizations for the handicapped, Capp also served on the National Reading Council, which was organized to combat illiteracy. He published a column ("Wrong Turn Onto Sesame Street") challenging federally funded <a href="Public%20Television">Public Television</a> endowments in favor of educational comics—which, according to Capp, "didn't cost a dime in taxes and never had. I pointed out that a kid could enjoy "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>" "without" learning how to read, but he couldn't enjoy comic strips "unless" he could read; and that a smaller investment in getting kids to read by supplying them with educational matter in such "reading" form might make better sense."

Capp's academic interests included being one of nineteen original "Trustees and Advisors" for "Endicott, Junior College for Young Woman", located in Pride's Crossing (Beverly), Massachusetts, which was founded in 1939. Al Capp is listed in the 1942 Mingotide Yearbook, representing the first graduating class from Endicott Junior College. The yearbook entry includes his credential as a "Cartoonist for United Feature Syndicate" and a resident of New York City.

"Comics,” wrote Capp in 1970, “can be a combination of the highest quality of art and text, and many of them are.” Capp would produce many giveaway educational comic books and <a href="public%20services">public services</a> pamphlets, spanning several decades, for the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20civil%20defense">Department of Civil Defense</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Navy">Department of the Navy</a>, the <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a>, the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor">Department of Labor</a>, <a href="Community%20Chest%20%28organization%29">Community Chest</a> (a forerunner of <a href="United%20Way%20of%20America">United Way</a>), and the <a href="Job%20Corps">Job Corps</a>. Capp's studio provided special artwork for various civic groups and <a href="non-profit%20organizations">non-profit organizations</a> as well. Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the Cancer Foundation, the <a href="March%20of%20Dimes">March of Dimes</a>, the National Heart Fund, the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a>, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, the National Amputation Foundation, and <a href="Disabled%20American%20Veterans">Disabled American Veterans</a>, among others. They were also used to help sell <a href="Christmas%20Seals">Christmas Seals</a>.
Capp was the "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" interview subject in December 1965, in a conversation conducted by <a href="Alvin%20Toffler">Alvin Toffler</a>. In August 1967 Capp was the narrator and host of an ABC network special called "Do Blondes Have More Fun?" In 1970, he was the subject of a provocative NBC documentary called "This Is Al Capp." In the early 1960s, Capp regularly wrote a column entitled "Al Capp's Column" for the New York newspaper "The Schenectady Gazette" (currently <a href="The%20Daily%20Gazette">The Daily Gazette</a>).

Capp and his family lived in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, near <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a> during the entire Vietnam War protest era. The turmoil that Americans were watching on their TV sets was happening live—right in his own neighborhood. Campus <a href="Far%20left">radicals</a> and “<a href="hippies">hippies</a>” inevitably became one of Capp’s favorite targets in the sixties. Alongside his long-established caricatures of right-wing, big business types such as General Bullmoose and J. Roaringham Fatback, Capp began spoofing <a href="counterculture">counterculture</a> icons such as <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a> (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage ten thousand dollars' worth of "protest songs"). The sequence implicitly labeled Baez a <a href="limousine%20liberal">limousine liberal</a>, a charge she took to heart, as detailed years later in her 1987 autobiography, "And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir". Another target was Senator <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a>, parodied as "Senator O. Noble McGesture," resident of "Hyideelsport." The town name is a play on <a href="Hyannisport%2C%20Massachusetts">Hyannisport, Massachusetts</a>, where a number of the Kennedy clan have lived.

Capp became a popular public speaker on college campuses, where he reportedly relished hecklers. He attacked militant antiwar demonstrators, both in his personal appearances and in his strip. He also satirized student political groups. The <a href="Youth%20International%20Party">Youth International Party</a> (YIP) and <a href="Students%20for%20a%20Democratic%20Society%20%281960%20organization%29">Students for a Democratic Society</a> (SDS) emerged in "Li'l Abner" as "Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!" (SWINE). In an April 1969 letter to "Time", Capp insisted, "The students I blast are not the dissenters, but the destroyers—the less than 4% who lock up deans in washrooms, who burn manuscripts of unpublished books, who make combination pigpens and playpens of their universities. The remaining 96% detest them as heartily as I do."

Capp's increasingly controversial remarks at his campus speeches and during TV appearances cost him his semi-regular spot on the "Tonight Show". His contentious public persona during this period was captured on a late sixties comedy LP called "Al Capp On Campus". The album features his interaction with students at Fresno State College (now <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20Fresno">California State University, Fresno</a>) on such topics as "sensitivity training," "humanitarianism," "abstract art" (Capp hated it), and "student protest." The cover features a cartoon drawing by Capp of wildly dressed, angry hippies carrying protest signs with slogans like "End Capp Brutality," "Abner and Daisy Mae Smoke Pot," "Capp Is Over [30, 40, 50—all crossed out] the Hill!!," and "If You Like Crap, You'll Like Capp!"

Highlights of the strip's final decades include "Boomchik" (1961), in which America's international prestige is saved by Mammy Yokum, "Daisy Mae Steps Out" (1966), a female-empowering tale of Daisy's brazenly audacious “homewrecker gland," "The Lips of Marcia Perkins" (1967), a satirical, thinly-veiled commentary on <a href="venereal%20disease">venereal disease</a> and public health warnings, "Ignoble Savages" (1968), in which <a href="Mafia">the Mob</a> takes over Harvard, and "Corporal Crock" (1973), in which Bullmoose reveals his reactionary cartoon role model, in a tale of obsession and the fanatical world of comic book collecting.

The cartoonist visited <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> and <a href="Yoko%20Ono">Yoko Ono</a> at their 1969 <a href="Bed-In%20for%20Peace">Bed-In for Peace</a> in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, and their testy exchange later appeared in the documentary film "" (1988). Introducing himself with the words "I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?," Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their "" nude album cover: "I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it." Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono ("Good God, you've gotta live with that?"), and is asked to "get out" by Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his "<a href="Ballad%20of%20John%20and%20Yoko">Ballad of John and Yoko</a>" song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: "Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify "Capp!" "

Despite his political conservatism in the last decade of his life, Capp is reported to have been liberal in some particular causes; he supported <a href="Gay%20Rights">Gay Rights</a>, and did not tolerate any attempts at homophobic jokes. He is also said to have supported <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> and the fight for racial equality in American society, although he was very sceptical of the tactics of <a href="Black%20Panthers">Black Panthers</a> and <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>.

In 1968, a <a href="theme%20park">theme park</a> called <a href="Dogpatch%20USA">Dogpatch USA</a> opened at Marble Falls, <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the 1970s but was abandoned in 1993 due to financial difficulties. By 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch "founder," General Jubilation T. Cornpone) had been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and was slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.

On April 22, 1971, syndicated <a href="columnist">columnist</a> <a href="Jack%20Anderson%20%28columnist%29">Jack Anderson</a> reported allegations that Capp made indecent advances to four female students when he was invited to speak at the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama">University of Alabama</a> in February 1968. Anderson and his associate <a href="Brit%20Hume">Brit Hume</a> confirmed that Capp was shown out of town by university police, but that the incident had been hushed up by the university to avoid negative publicity.

The following month, Capp was charged in <a href="Eau%20Claire%2C%20Wisconsin">Eau Claire, Wisconsin</a>, in connection with another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Eau%20Claire">University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire</a>. Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included <a href="Sodomy%20laws%20in%20the%20United%20States">"sodomy."</a> As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty to the charge of "attempted adultery" (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs. In a December 1992 article for "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>," <a href="Seymour%20Hersh">Seymour Hersh</a> reported that President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> and <a href="Charles%20Colson">Charles Colson</a> had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the <a href="National%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Administration">National Archives</a>. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> for the U.S. Senate. "Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to the White House would become embarrassingly public," Hersh wrote. "The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured the President by saying that he had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, the President was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and tried to talk to the prosecutors." Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge. In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.

The resulting publicity led to hundreds of papers dropping his comic strip, and Capp, already in failing health, withdrew from public speaking. <a href="Celebrity%20biographer">Celebrity biographer</a> James Spada has claimed that similar allegations were made by actress <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace Kelly</a>. However, no firsthand allegation has ever surfaced.

"From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in "Abner" waned, and this showed in the strip itself," according to <a href="Don%20Markstein">Don Markstein</a>'s "<a href="Toonopedia">Toonopedia</a>". On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to declining health. "If you have any sense of humor about your strip—and I had a sense of humor about mine—you knew that for three or four years "Abner" was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have," he admitted, adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. "When he retired "Li'l Abner", newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. "<a href="People%20magazine">People magazine</a>" ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" devoted nearly a full page to the event," wrote publisher <a href="Denis%20Kitchen">Denis Kitchen</a>.

Capp's final years were marked by advancing illness and by family tragedy. In October 1977, one of his two daughters died; a few weeks later, a beloved granddaughter was killed in a car accident. A lifelong chain smoker, Capp died in 1979 from <a href="Chronic%20obstructive%20pulmonary%20disease">emphysema</a> at his home in <a href="South%20Hampton%2C%20New%20Hampshire">South Hampton, New Hampshire</a>. Capp is buried in Mount Prospect Cemetery in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Engraved on his headstone is a stanza from <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Thomas Gray</a>: "The plowman homeward plods his weary way / And leaves the world to darkness and to me," (from "<a href="Elegy%20Written%20in%20a%20Country%20Churchyard">Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</a>," 1751).

"Neither the strip's shifting political leanings nor the slide of its final few years had any bearing on its status as a classic; and in 1995, it was recognized as such by the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">U.S. Postal Service</a>," according to "Toonopedia". "Li'l Abner" was one of 20 American comic strips included in the <a href="Comic%20Strip%20Classics">Comic Strip Classics</a> series of USPS <a href="commemorative%20stamp">commemorative stamp</a>s. Al Capp, an inductee into the <a href="National%20Cartoon%20Museum">National Cartoon Museum</a> (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art), is one of only 31 artists selected to their <a href="Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a>. Capp was also inducted into the <a href="Will%20Eisner%20Award">Will Eisner Award</a> Hall of Fame in 2004.

<a href="Sadie%20Hawkins%20Day">Sadie Hawkins Day</a> and <a href="%3Awikt%3Adouble%20whammy">double whammy</a> are two terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the <a href="English%20language">English language</a>. Other, less ubiquitous Cappisms include <a href="skunk%20works">skunk works</a> and <a href="Lower%20Slobbovia">Lower Slobbovia</a>. The term <a href="shmoo">shmoo</a> has also entered the <a href="lexicon">lexicon</a>, defining highly technical concepts in no less than "four" separate fields of science, including the variations <a href="Mating%20of%20yeast">shmooing</a> (a <a href="microbiological">microbiological</a> term for the "budding" process in yeast reproduction), and <a href="shmoo%20plot">shmoo plot</a> (a technical term in the field of <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a>). In <a href="socioeconomics">socioeconomics</a>, a "shmoo" refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to "<a href="widget%20%28economics%29">widget</a>s" which require resources and active production.) In the field of <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>, "shmoo" refers to a high energy survey instrument, as utilized at the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> to capture subatomic <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a> particles emitted from the <a href="Cygnus%20X-3">Cygnus X-3</a> <a href="constellation">constellation</a>. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as <a href="List%20of%20American%20words%20not%20widely%20used%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">druthers</a>, <a href="schmooze">schmooze</a> and <a href="-nik">nogoodnik, neatnik, etc.</a> In his book "<a href="The%20American%20Language">The American Language</a>", <a href="H.L.%20Mencken">H.L. Mencken</a> credits the postwar mania for adding "-nik" to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning—not with <a href="beatnik">beatnik</a> or <a href="Sputnik">Sputnik</a>—but earlier, in the pages of "Li'l Abner".

Al Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized <a href="mural">mural</a> commemorating his 100th birthday. Created by resident artist <a href="Jon%20P.%20Mooers">Jon P. Mooers</a>, the mural was unveiled in downtown Amesbury on May 15, 2010. According to the "<a href="Boston%20Globe">Boston Globe</a>" (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum. Capp is also the subject of an upcoming <a href="WNET-TV">WNET-TV</a> "<a href="American%20Masters">American Masters</a>" <a href="documentary">documentary</a>, "The Life and Times of Al Capp", produced by his granddaughter, independent filmmaker Caitlin Manning.

Since his death in 1979, Al Capp and his work have been the subject of more than 40 books, including three biographies. <a href="Underground%20comix">Underground cartoonist</a> and "Li'l Abner" expert <a href="Denis%20Kitchen">Denis Kitchen</a> has published, co-published, edited, or otherwise served as consultant on nearly all of them. Kitchen is currently compiling a biographical <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on Al Capp. Several unsuccessful attempts to resurrect the Li'l Abner comic strip by new hands never advanced past the initial planning stage. Paramount Studios retained it's option for a remake film or sequel until 1999.

At the <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic%20Con">San Diego Comic Con</a> in July 2009, <a href="IDW%20Publishing">IDW</a> announced the upcoming publication of "Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Complete Dailies and Color Sundays" as part of their ongoing Library of American Comics project. The comprehensive series, a reprinting of the entire 43-year history of "Li'l Abner" spanning a projected 20 volumes, began on April 7, 2010.

<doc id="3019" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3019" title="`Abdu'l-Bahá">
`Abdu'l-Bahá

`Abdu’l-Bahá' (<a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>/‎, 23 May 1844 – 28 November 1921), born ‘Abbás Effendí (), was the eldest son of <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Bahá'u'lláh</a>, the founder of the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a>. In 1892, `Abdu'l-Bahá was appointed in his father's <a href="Tablets%20of%20Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h%23Kit%C3%A1b-i-%60Ahd%20%28Book%20of%20the%20Covenant%29">will</a> to be his successor and head of the Bahá'í Faith. `Abdu'l-Bahá was born in <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a> to an aristocratic family of the realm. At the age of eight his father was imprisoned and the family's possessions were looted, leaving them in virtual poverty. Along with his father, `Abdu'l-Bahá was exiled to <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> where the family lived for nine years.

During his youth he was faithful to his father and was regarded as an outstanding member of the Bahá’í exile community. As a teenager he was his father’s <a href="amanuensis">amanuensis</a> and was regularly seen debating theological issues with the learned men of the area. In 1863, Bahá'u'lláh and his family were banished from Baghdad to <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. During the 1860s the family was further banished from Constantinople to <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a>, and then finally to the penal-colony of <a href="Acre%2C%20Palestine">Acre, Palestine</a>.

With his father's death in 1892, and his appointment as head of the Bahá’í Faith, there was much opposition to him, including virtually all his family members. Notwithstanding this, practically all of the worldwide Bahá’í community accepted his leadership. In 1908, at the age of 64 and after forty years imprisonment, `Abdu’l-Bahá was freed by the <a href="Young%20Turks">Young Turks</a> and he and his family began to live in relative safety. His <a href="%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1%27s%20journeys%20to%20the%20West">journeys to the West</a>, and his "<a href="Tablets%20of%20the%20Divine%20Plan">Tablets of the Divine Plan</a>" spread the Bahá'í message beyond its middle-eastern roots, and his <a href="Will%20and%20Testament%20of%20%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">Will and Testament</a> laid the foundation for the current <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20administration">Bahá'í administrative order</a>. Many of his writings, prayers and letters are extant, and his discourses with the Western Bahá'ís emphasize the growth of the faith by the late 1890s. `Abdu'l-Bahá's <a href="given%20name">given name</a> was `Abbás, but he preferred the title of `Abdu'l-Bahá (servant of the glory of God). He is commonly referred to in Bahá'í texts as "The Master", and received the title of <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">KBE</a> after his personal storage of grain was used to relieve famine in <a href="History%20of%20Palestine%23Ottoman%20era">Palestine</a> following <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, but never used the title.

`Abdu'l-Bahá was born in <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, Iran on 23 May 1844 (5th of <a href="Jumada%20al-awwal">Jamadiyu'l-Avval</a>, 1260 AH), the eldest son of <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Bahá'u'lláh</a> and <a href="%C3%81s%C3%ADyih%20Kh%C3%A1num">Navváb</a>. He was born on the very same night on which the <a href="B%C3%A1b">Báb</a> declared his mission. Born with the given name of `Abbás, he was named after his grandfather <a href="M%C3%ADrz%C3%A1%20%60Abb%C3%A1s%20N%C3%BAr%C3%AD">Mírzá `Abbás Núrí</a>, a prominent and powerful nobleman. As a child, `Abdu'l-Bahá was shaped by his father's position as a prominent <a href="B%C3%A1b%C3%AD">Bábí</a>. He recalled how he met the Bábí <a href="T%C3%A1hirih">Táhirih</a> and how she would take "me on to her knee, caress me, and talk to me. I admired her most deeply". `Abdu’l-Bahá had a happy and carefree childhood. The family’s Tehran home and country houses were comfortable and beautifully decorated. `Abdu'l-Bahá enjoyed playing in the gardens with his younger sister with whom he was very close. Along with his younger siblings – a sister, <a href="Bah%C3%ADyyih%20Kh%C3%A1num">Bahíyyih</a>, and a brother, <a href="M%C3%ADrz%C3%A1%20Mihd%C3%AD">Mihdí</a> – the three lived in an environment of privilege, happiness and comfort. With his father declining a position as minister of the royal court; during his young boyhood `Abdu’l-Bahá witnessed his parents' various charitable endeavours, which included converting part of the home to a hospital ward for women and children.

`Abdu'l-Bahá received a haphazard education during his childhood. It was customary not to send children of nobility to schools. Most noblemen were educated at home briefly in scripture, rhetoric, calligraphy and basic mathematics. Many were educated to prepare themselves for life in the royal court. Despite a brief spell at a traditional preparatory school at the age of seven for one year, `Abdu'l-Bahá received no formal education. As he grew he was educated by his mother, and uncle. Most of his education however, came from his father. Years later in 1890 <a href="Edward%20Granville%20Browne">Edward Granville Browne</a> described how `Abdu'l-Bahá was "one more eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of illustration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians, and the Muhammadans...scarcely be found even amongst the eloquent."

When `Abdu'l-Bahá was seven, he contracted tuberculosis and was expected to die. Though the malady faded away, he would be plagued with bouts of illness for the rest of his life.

One event that affected `Abdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment of his father when `Abdu'l-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children. `Abdu'l-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Bahá'u'lláh</a> who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the <a href="S%C3%ADy%C3%A1h-Ch%C3%A1l">Síyáh-Chál</a>. He described how "I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In the middle of the stairway, all of a sudden we heard His [Bahá’u’lláh's]…voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so they took me back".

Bahá'u'lláh was eventually released from prison but ordered into exile, and `Abdu'l-Bahá then eight joined his father on the journey to <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> in the winter (January to April) of 1853. During the journey `Abdu'l-Bahá suffered from frost-bite. After a year of difficulties Bahá'u'lláh absented himself rather than continue to face the conflict with <a href="Mirza%20Yahya">Mirza Yahya</a> and secretly secluded himself in the mountains of <a href="Sulaymaniyah">Sulaymaniyah</a> in April 1854 a month before `Abdu'l-Bahá's tenth birthday. Mutual sorrow resulted in him, his <a href="%C3%81s%C3%ADyih%20Kh%C3%A1num">mother</a> and <a href="Bahiyyih%20Kh%C3%A1num">sister</a> becoming constant companions. `Abdu'l-Bahá was particularly close to both, and his mother took active participation in his education and upbringing. During the two-year absence of his father `Abdu'l-Bahá took up the duty of managing the affairs of the family, before his <a href="age%20of%20majority">age of maturity</a> (14 in middle-eastern society) and was known to be occupied with reading and, at a time of hand-copied scriptures being the primary means of publishing, was also engaged in copying the writings of the <a href="B%C3%A1b">Báb</a>. `Abdu’l-Bahá also took an interest in the art of horse riding and, as he grew, became a renowned rider.

In 1856, news of an ascetic carrying on discourses with local Súfí leaders that seemed to possibly be Bahá'u'lláh reached the family and friends. Immediately, family members and friends went to search for the elusive dervish – and in March brought Bahá'u'lláh back to Baghdad. On seeing his father, `Abdu'l-Bahá fell to his knees and wept loudly "Why did you leave us?", and this followed with his mother and sister doing the same. `Abdu'l-Bahá soon became his father's secretary and shield. During the sojourn in the city `Abdu’l-Bahá grew from a boy into a young man. He was noted as a "remarkably fine looking youth", and remembered for his charity and amiableness. Having passed the age of maturity `Abdu'l-Bahá was regularly seen in the mosques of Baghdad discussing religious topics and the scripture as a young man. Whilst in Baghdad, `Abdu'l-Bahá composed a commentary at the request of his father on the Muslim tradition of "<a href="I%20was%20a%20Hidden%20Treasure">I was a Hidden Treasure</a>" for a Súfí leader named `Alí Shawkat Páshá. `Abdu'l-Bahá was fifteen or sixteen at the time and `Alí Shawkat Páshá regarded the more than 11000 word essay as a remarkable feat for somebody of his age. In 1863 in what became known as the <a href="Garden%20of%20Ridv%C3%A1n%2C%20Baghdad">Garden of Ridván</a> Bahá'u'lláh announced to a few that he was the <a href="manifestation%20of%20God">manifestation of God</a> and <a href="He%20whom%20God%20shall%20make%20manifest">He whom God shall make manifest</a> whose coming had been foretold by the <a href="B%C3%A1b">Báb</a>. On day eight of the twelve days, it is believed `Abdu'l-Baha was the first person Baha'u'llah revealed his claim to.

In 1863 Bahá'u'lláh was summoned to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> (<a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>), and thus his whole family including `Abdu'l-Bahá, then nineteen, accompanied him on his 110-day journey. The journey to Constantinople was another wearisome journey, and `Abdu'l-Bahá helped feed the exiles. It was here that his position became more prominent amongst the Bahá’ís. This was further solidified by <a href="Bah%C3%A1%E2%80%99u%E2%80%99ll%C3%A1h">Bahá’u’lláh</a>’s <a href="tablet%20of%20the%20Branch">tablet of the Branch</a> in which he constantly exalts his son's virtues and station. The family were soon exiled to <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a> and `Abdu'l-Bahá went with the family. `Abdu’l-Bahá again suffered from frostbite.

In Adrianople `Abdu’l-Bahá was regarded as the sole comforter of his family – in particular to his <a href="%C3%81s%C3%ADyih%20Kh%C3%A1num">mother</a>. At this point `Abdu'l-Bahá was known by the Bahá'ís as "the Master", and by non-Bahá'ís as `Abbás Effendi ("Effendi" signifies "Sir"). It was in Adrianople that Bahá’u’lláh referred to his son as "the Mystery of God". The title of "Mystery of God" symbolises, according to Bahá'ís, that `Abdu'l-Bahá is not a <a href="manifestation%20of%20God">manifestation of God</a> but how a "person of `Abdu'l-Bahá the incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been blended and are completely harmonized". `Abdu'l-Bahá was at this point noted for having black hair which flowed to his shoulders, large blue eyes, rose-through-alabaster coloured skin and a fine nose. Bahá'u'lláh gave his son many other titles such as "Ghusn-i-A'zam" (meaning "Mightiest Branch" or "Mightier Branch"), the "Branch of Holiness", "the Center of the Covenant" and the apple of his eye. `Abdu'l-Bahá ("the Master") was devastated when hearing the news that he and his family were to be exiled separately from <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Bahá'u'lláh</a>. It was, according to Bahá'ís, through his intercession that the idea was reverted and the family were allowed to be exiled together.

At the age of 24, `Abdu'l-Bahá was clearly chief-steward to his father and an outstanding member of the Bahá’í community. Bahá’u’lláh and his family were – in 1868 – exiled to the penal colony of <a href="Acre%2C%20Palestine">Acre, Palestine</a> where it was expected that the family would perish. Arrival in Acre was distressing for the family and exiles. They were greeted in a hostile manner by the surrounding population and his sister and father fell dangerously ill. When told that the women were to sit on the shoulders of the men to reach the shore, `Abdu'l-Bahá took a chair and carried the women to the bay of Acre. `Abdu'l-Bahá was able to procure some anesthetic and nursed the sick. The Bahá’ís were imprisoned under horrendous conditions in a cluster of cells covered in excrement and dirt. `Abdu'l-Bahá himself fell dangerously ill with <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, however a sympathetic soldier permitted a physician to help cure him. The population shunned them, the soldiers treated them the same, and the behaviour of Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani (an <a href="Azali">Azali</a>) did not help matters. Morale was further destroyed with the accidental death of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s youngest brother <a href="M%C3%ADrz%C3%A1%20Mihd%C3%AD">Mírzá Mihdí</a> at the age of 22. His death devastated the family – particularly his <a href="%C3%81s%C3%ADyih%20Kh%C3%A1num">mother</a> and father – and the grieving `Abdu'l-Bahá kept a night-long vigil beside his brother’s body.

Over time, he gradually took over responsibility for the relationships between the small <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'i</a> exile community and the outside world. It was through his interaction with the people of Acre that, according to the Bahá'ís, they recognized the innocence of the Bahá'ís, and thus the conditions of imprisonment were eased. Four months after the death of Mihdí the family moved from the prison to the <a href="House%20of%20%60Abb%C3%BAd">House of `Abbúd</a>. The people of Acre started to respect the Bahá'ís and in particular, `Abdu'l-Bahá. `Abdu'l-Bahá was able to arrange for <a href="House%20of%20%60Abb%C3%BAd%23Akk.C3.A1%20area">houses to be rented</a> for the family, the family later moved to the <a href="Mansion%20of%20Bahj%C3%AD">Mansion of Bahjí</a> around 1879 when an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee.

`Abdu'l-Bahá soon became very popular in the penal colony and <a href="Myron%20Henry%20Phelps">Myron Henry Phelps</a> a wealthy New York lawyer described how "a crowd of human beings...Syrians, Arabs, Ethiopians, and many others", all waited to talk and receive `Abdu'l-Bahá. He undertook a history of the Bábí religion through publication of <a href="A%20Traveller%27s%20Narrative">A Traveller's Narrative</a> (Makála-i-Shakhsí Sayyáh) in 1886, later translated and published in translation in 1891 through Cambridge University by the agency of <a href="Edward%20Granville%20Browne">Edward Granville Browne</a> who described `Abdu'l-Bahá as: 

As a young man speculation was rife amongst the Bahá’ís to whom `Abdu'l-Bahá would marry. Several young girls were seen as marriage prospects but `Abdu’l-Bahá seemed disinclined to marriage. On 8 March 1873, at the urging of his father, the twenty-eight-year-old `Abdu’l-Bahá married <a href="Mun%C3%ADrih%20Kh%C3%A1num">Fátimih Nahrí of Isfahán</a> (1847–1938) a twenty-five-year-old from an upper-class family of the city. Her father was Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí Nahrí of <a href="Isfahan">Isfahan</a> an eminent Bahá’í with prominent connections. Fátimih was brought from <a href="Persia">Persia</a> to <a href="Acre%2C%20Palestine">Acre, Palestine</a> after both <a href="Bah%C3%A1%E2%80%99u%E2%80%99ll%C3%A1h">Bahá’u’lláh</a> and his wife <a href="Navv%C3%A1b">Navváb</a> expressed an interest in her to marry `Abdu’l-Bahá. After a wearisome journey from Isfahán to Akka she finally arrived accompanied by her brother in 1872. The young couple were betrothed for about five months before the marriage itself commenced. In the meantime, Fátimih lived in the home of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s uncle <a href="M%C3%ADrz%C3%A1%20M%C3%BAs%C3%A1">Mírzá Músá</a>. According to her later memoirs, Fátimih fell in love with `Abdu'l-Bahá on seeing him. `Abdu'l-Bahá himself had showed little inkling to marriage until meeting Fátimih; who was entitled Munírih by <a href="Bah%C3%A1%E2%80%99u%E2%80%99ll%C3%A1h">Bahá’u’lláh</a>. Munírih is a title meaning "Luminous".

The marriage resulted in nine children. The first born was a son Mihdí Effendi who died aged about 3. He was followed by Ḍiyá'iyyih Khánum, Fu’ádíyyih Khánum (d. few years old), Rúhangíz Khánum (d. 1893), Túbá Khánum, Husayn Effendi (d.1887 aged 5), Túbá Khánum, Rúhá Khánum and Munnavar Khánum. The death of his children caused `Abdu’l-Bahá immense grief – in particular the death of his son Husayn Effendi came at a difficult time following the death of his mother and uncle. The surviving children (all daughters) were; Ḍiyá'iyyih Khánum (mother of <a href="Shoghi%20Effendi">Shoghi Effendi</a>) (d. 1951) Túbá Khánum (1880–1959) Rúḥá Khánum and Munavvar Khánum (d. 1971). <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Bahá'u'lláh</a> wished that the Bahá'ís follow the example of `Abdu'l-Bahá and gradually move away from polygamy. The marriage of `Abdu’l-Bahá to one woman and his choice to remain monogamous, from advice of his father and his own wish, legitimised the practice of monogamy to a people whom hitherto had regarded polygamy as a righteous way of life.

After Bahá'u'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the <a href="Tablets%20of%20Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h%23Kit%C3%A1b-i-%60Ahd%20%28Book%20of%20the%20Covenant%29">Will and Testament</a> of Bahá'u'lláh named `Abdu'l-Bahá as Centre of the Covenant, successor and interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings. In the Will and Testament `Abdu'l-Bahá's half-brother, <a href="M%C3%ADrz%C3%A1%20Muhammad%20%60Al%C3%AD">Muhammad `Alí</a>, was mentioned by name as being subordinate to `Abdu'l-Bahá. Muhammad `Alí became jealous of his half-brother and set out to establish authority for himself as an alternative leader with the support of his brothers Badi'u'llah and Diya'u'llah. He began correspondence with Bahá'ís in Iran, initially in secret, casting doubts in others' minds about `Abdu'l-Bahá. While most Bahá'ís followed `Abdu'l-Bahá, a handful followed Muhammad `Alí including such leaders as Mirza Javad and <a href="Ibrahim%20George%20Kheiralla">Ibrahim George Kheiralla</a>, an early Bahá'í missionary to America.

Muhammad `Alí and Mirza Javad began to openly accuse `Abdu'l-Bahá of taking on too much authority, suggesting that he believed himself to be a <a href="Manifestation%20of%20God">Manifestation of God</a>, equal in status to Bahá'u'lláh. It was at this time that `Abdu'l-Bahá, in order to provide proof of the falsity of the accusations leveled against him, in tablets to the West, stated that he was to be known as "`Abdu'l-Bahá" an <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> phrase meaning the Servant of Bahá to make it clear that he was not a Manifestation of God, and that his station was only servitude. `Abdu'l-Bahá left a <a href="Will%20and%20Testament%20of%20%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">Will and Testament</a> that set up the framework of administration. The two highest institutions were the Universal House of Justice, and the <a href="Guardian%20%28Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%29">Guardianship</a>, for which he appointed <a href="Shoghi%20Effendi">Shoghi Effendi</a> as the Guardian. With the exception of `Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, Muhammad `Alí was supported by all of the remaining <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h%27s%20family">male relatives of Bahá'u'lláh</a>, including Shoghi Effendi's father, Mírzá Hádí Shírází. However Muhammad `Alí's and his families statements had very little effect on the Bahá'ís in general - in the `Akká area, the followers of Muhammad `Alí represented six families at most, they had no common religious activities, and were almost wholly assimilated into Muslim society.

By the end of 1898, Western pilgrims started coming to Akka on pilgrimage to visit `Abdu'l-Bahá; this group of pilgrims, including <a href="Phoebe%20Hearst">Phoebe Hearst</a>, was the first time that Bahá'ís raised up in the West had met `Abdu'l-Bahá. The first group arrived in 1898 and throughout late 1898 to early 1899 Western Bahá’ís sporadically visited `Abdu'l-Bahá. The group was relatively young containing mainly women from high American society in their 20s. The group of Westerners aroused suspicion for the authorities, and consequently `Abdu'l-Bahá’s confinement was tightened. During the next decade `Abdu'l-Bahá would be in constant communication with Bahá'ís around the world, helping them to teach the religion; the group included <a href="May%20Maxwell">May Ellis Bolles</a> in Paris, Englishman <a href="Thomas%20Breakwell">Thomas Breakwell</a>, American Herbert Hopper, French , Susan Moody, Lua Getsinger, and American Laura Clifford Barney. It was Laura Clifford Barney who, by asking questions of `Abdu'l-Bahá over many years and many visits to Haifa, compiled what later became the book <a href="Some%20Answered%20Questions">Some Answered Questions</a>.

During the final years of the 19th century, while `Abdu'l-Bahá was still officially a prisoner and confined to `Akka, he organized the transfer of the remains of the <a href="B%C3%A1b">Báb</a> from Iran to Palestine. He then organized the purchase of land on <a href="Mount%20Carmel">Mount Carmel</a> that Bahá'u'lláh had instructed should be used to lay the remains of the Báb, and organized for the construction of the <a href="Shrine%20of%20the%20B%C3%A1b">Shrine of the Báb</a>. This process took another 10 years. With the increase of pilgrims visiting `Abdu'l-Bahá, Muhammad `Alí worked with the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman authorities</a> to re-introduce stricter terms on `Abdu'l-Bahá's imprisonment in August 1901. By 1902, however, due to the Governor of `Akka being supportive of `Abdu'l-Bahá, the situation was greatly eased; while pilgrims were able to once again visit `Abdu'l-Bahá, he was confined to the city. In February 1903, two followers of Muhammad `Alí, including Badi'u'llah and Siyyid `Aliy-i-Afnan, broke with Muhammad `Ali and wrote books and letters giving details of Muhammad `Ali's plots and noting that what was circulating about `Abdu'l-Bahá was fabrication.

From 1902 to 1904, in addition to the building of the <a href="Shrine%20of%20the%20B%C3%A1b">Shrine of the Báb</a> that `Abdu'l-Bahá was directing, he started to put into execution two different projects; the restoration of the <a href="House%20of%20the%20B%C3%A1b">House of the Báb</a> in <a href="Shiraz%2C%20Iran">Shiraz, Iran</a> and the construction of the first <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20House%20of%20Worship">Bahá'í House of Worship</a> in <a href="Ashgabat">Ashgabat</a>, Turkmenistan. `Abdu'l-Bahá asked Aqa Mirza Aqa to coordinate the work so that the house of the Báb would be restored to the state that it was at the time of the Báb's declaration to <a href="Mulla%20Husayn">Mulla Husayn</a> in 1844; he also entrusted the work on the House of Worship to <a href="Vakil-u%27d-Dawlih">Vakil-u'd-Dawlih</a>.

During this period, `Abdu'l-Bahá communicated with a number <a href="Young%20Turk">Young Turk</a>s, opposed to the reign of <a href="Abdul%20Hamid%20II">Sultan Abdul Hamid II</a>, including <a href="Nam%C4%B1k%20Kemal">Namık Kemal</a>, <a href="Ziya%20Pasha">Ziya Pasha</a> and <a href="Midhat%20Pasha">Midhat Pasha</a>, in an attempt to disseminate Bahá'í thought into their political ideology. He emphasized Bahá'ís "seek freedom and love liberty, hope for equality, are well-wishers of humanity and ready to sacrifice their lives to unite humanity" but on a more broad approach than the Young Turks. <a href="Abdullah%20Cevdet">Abdullah Cevdet</a>, one of the founders of the <a href="Committee%20of%20Union%20and%20Progress">Committee of Union and Progress</a> who considered the Bahá'í Faith an intermediary step between Islam and the ultimate abandonment of religious belief, would go on trial for defense of Bahá'ís in a periodical he founded.

‛Abdu'l-Bahá also had contact with military leaders as well, including such individuals as <a href="Bursal%C4%B1%20Mehmet%20Tahir%20Bey">Bursalı Mehmet Tahir Bey</a> and Hasan Bedreddin. The latter, who was involved in the overthrow of <a href="Abd%C3%BClaziz%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Sultan Abdülaziz</a>, is commonly known as Bedri Paşa or Bedri Pasha and is referred to in Persian Bahá'í sources as Bedri Bey (Badri Beg). He was a Bahá'í who translated ‛Abdu’l-Baha's works into French.

`Abdu'l-Bahá also met <a href="Muhammad%20Abduh">Muhammad Abduh</a>, one of the key figures of <a href="Islamic%20Modernism">Islamic Modernism</a> and the <a href="Salafi%20movement">Salafi movement</a>, in Beirut, at a time when the two men were both opposed to the Ottoman "<a href="ulama">ulama</a>" and shared similar goals of religious reform. <a href="Rashid%20Rida">Rashid Rida</a> asserts that during his visits to Beirut, `Abdu'l-Bahá would attend Abduh's study sessions. Regarding the meetings of `Abdu'l-Bahá and Muhammad 'Abduh, Shoghi Effendi asserts that "His several interviews with the well-known Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abdu served to enhance immensely the growing prestige of the community and spread abroad the fame of its most distinguished member."

Due to `Abdu'l-Bahá's political activities and alleged accusation against him by Muhammad `Ali, a Commission of Inquiry interviewed `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1905, with the result that he was almost exiled to <a href="Fezzan">Fezzan</a>. In response, `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote the sultan a letter protesting that his followers refrain from involvement in partisan politics and that his "<a href="tariqa">tariqa</a>" had guided many Americans to Islam. The next few years in `Akka were relatively free of pressures and pilgrims were able to come and visit `Abdu'l-Bahá. By 1909 the mausoleum of the Shrine of the Báb was completed.

The 1908 <a href="Young%20Turks">Young Turks</a> revolution freed all political prisoners in the Ottoman Empire, and `Abdu'l-Bahá was freed from imprisonment. His first action after his freedom was to visit the <a href="Shrine%20of%20Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh</a> in <a href="Bahji">Bahji</a>. While `Abdu'l-Bahá continued to live in `Akka immediately following the revolution, he soon moved <a href="House%20of%20%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">to live</a> in <a href="Haifa">Haifa</a> near the Shrine of the Báb. In 1910, with the freedom to leave the country, he embarked on a three-year journey to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, Europe, and North America, spreading the Bahá'í message.

From August to December 1911, `Abdu'l-Bahá visited cities in Europe, including London, Bristol, and Paris. The purpose of these trips was to support the Bahá'í communities in the west and to further spread his father's teachings.

In the following year, he undertook a much more extensive journey to the United States and Canada to once again spread his father's teachings. He arrived in New York City on 11 April 1912, after declining an offer of passage on the <a href="RMS%20Titanic">RMS Titanic</a>, telling the Bahá'í believers, instead, to "Donate this to charity." He instead travelled on a slower craft, the S.S. Cedric, and cited preference of a longer sea journey as the reason. After hearing of the Titanic's sinking on 16 April he was quoted as saying "I was asked to sail upon the Titanic, but my heart did not prompt me to do so." While he spent most of his time in New York, he visited Chicago, <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>, Washington, D.C., Boston and <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a>. In August of the same year he started a more extensive journey to places including <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, the <a href="Green%20Acre">Green Acre</a> school in <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, and <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> (his only visit to Canada). He then travelled west to <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, San Francisco, <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford</a>, and Los Angeles before starting to return east at the end of October. On 5 December 1912 he set sail back to Europe.

During his visit to North America he visited many missions, churches, and groups, as well as having scores of meetings in Bahá'ís' homes, and offering innumerable personal meetings with hundreds of people. During his talks he proclaimed Bahá'í principles such as the <a href="God%20in%20the%20Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">unity of God</a>, <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%20and%20the%20unity%20of%20religion">unity of the religions</a>, <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%20and%20the%20unity%20of%20humanity">oneness of humanity</a>, <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%20and%20gender%20equality">equality of women and men</a>, world peace and economic justice. He also insisted that all his meetings be open to all races.

His visit and talks were the subject of hundreds of newspaper articles. In Boston newspaper reporters asked `Abdu'l-Bahá why he had come to America, and he stated that he had come to participate in conferences on peace and that just giving warning messages is not enough. `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to Montreal provided notable newspaper coverage; on the night of his arrival the editor of the "<a href="Montreal%20Daily%20Star">Montreal Daily Star</a>" met with him and that newspaper along with <a href="The%20Montreal%20Gazette">The Montreal Gazette</a>, "Montreal Standard", <a href="Le%20Devoir">Le Devoir</a> and <a href="La%20Presse%20%28Canada%29">La Presse</a> among others reported on `Abdu'l-Bahá's activities. The headlines in those papers included "Persian Teacher to Preach Peace", "Racialism Wrong, Says Eastern Sage, Strife and War Caused by Religious and National Prejudices", and "Apostle of Peace Meets Socialists, Abdul Baha's Novel Scheme for Distribution of Surplus Wealth." The "Montreal Standard", which was distributed across Canada, took so much interest that it republished the articles a week later; the Gazette published six articles and Montreal's largest French language newspaper published two articles about him. His 1912 visit to Montreal also inspired humourist <a href="Stephen%20Leacock">Stephen Leacock</a> to parody him in his bestselling 1914 book "<a href="Arcadian%20Adventures%20with%20the%20Idle%20Rich">Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich</a>". In Chicago one newspaper headline included "His Holiness Visits Us, Not Pius X but A. Baha," and `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to California was reported in the "Palo Altan".

Back in Europe, he visited London, Paris (where he stayed for two months), <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. Finally, on June 12, 1913, he returned to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, where he stayed for six months before returning to <a href="Haifa">Haifa</a>.

During World War I `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in Palestine, under the continued threat of Allied bombardment and threats from the Turkish commander. As the war ended, the British Mandate over Palestine brought relative security to `Abdu'l-Bahá. During his final year, a growing number of visitors and pilgrims came to see him in <a href="Haifa">Haifa</a>.

According to <a href="Harry%20Luke">Harry Charles Luke</a>, an official in the British <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a> who served as assistant Governor of Jerusalem, `Abdu'l-Bahá "was created by King <a href="George%20V">George V</a> a K.B.E." on December 4, 1919, being conferred his knighthood "for valuable services rendered to the British Government in the early days of the Occupation." This has been judged to be humanitarian service to people following the privations of war and the chaos in its immediate aftermath by averting a famine in Northern Palestine. He was ceremonially knighted on April 27, 1920, an event which was prominently reported in the "<a href="Star%20of%20the%20West%20%28Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20magazine%29">Star of the West</a>" as " a most wonderful celebration."

`Abdu'l-Bahá praised the Zionist movement and encouraged the Zionists to "mingle with other races and live in unity with them" under a neutral government like the British administration following <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. He had earlier declared that the prophecies of the Old Testament would be fulfilled and that "the Israelites will all gather in the Holy Land".

`Abdu'l-Bahá died on November 28, 1921 (27th of <a href="Rabi%27%20al-awwal">Rabi'u'l-Avval</a>, 1340 AH.) at about 1:00 AM. The news of the death was however kept a secret from a number of his relatives, such as his half-brother <a href="M%C3%ADrz%C3%A1%20Muhammad%20%60Al%C3%AD">Mírzá Muhammad `Alí</a>, whom he had himself declared Covenant-breakers and were thus denied participation in the funeral. On his funeral, Esslemont notes:

He is buried in the front room of the <a href="Shrine%20of%20the%20B%C3%A1b">Shrine of the Báb</a> on <a href="Mount%20Carmel">Mount Carmel</a>. Plans are in place to one day build a <a href="Shrine%20of%20%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">Shrine of `Abdu'l-Bahá</a>. In his <a href="Will%20and%20Testament%20of%20%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">Will and Testament</a> he appointed his grandson <a href="Shoghi%20Effendi">Shoghi Effendi Rabbani</a> as the <a href="Guardian%20%28Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%29">Guardian</a> of the Bahá'í Faith.

The total estimated number of <a href="Tablet%20%28religious%29">tablets</a> that `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote are over 27,000, of which only a fraction have been translated into English. His works fall into two groups including first his direct writings and second his lectures and speeches as noted by others. The first group includes "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20Divine%20Civilization">The Secret of Divine Civilization</a>" written before 1875, "A Traveller's Narrative" written around 1886, the Resāla-ye sīāsīya or "Sermon on the Art of Governance" written in 1893, the "Memorials of the Faithful", and a large number of <a href="tablets%20%28religious%29">tablets</a> written to various people; including various Western intellectuals such as <a href="August%20Forel">August Forel</a> which has been translated and published as the <a href="Tablet%20to%20Dr.%20Forel">Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel</a>. The "Secret of Divine Civilization" and the "Sermon on the Art of Governance" were widely circulated anonymously.

The second group includes <a href="Some%20Answered%20Questions">Some Answered Questions</a>, which is an English translation of a series of table talks with Laura Barney, and <a href="Paris%20Talks">Paris Talks</a>, "`Abdu'l-Baha in London" and "Promulgation of Universal Peace" which are respectively addresses given by `Abdu'l-Bahá in Paris, London and the United States.

The following is a list of some of `Abdu'l-Bahá's many books, tablets, and talks:

Ambrose of Alexandria

Ambrose of Alexandria (before 212 – c. 250) was a friend of the <a href="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="theologian">theologian</a> <a href="Origen">Origen</a>. Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the <a href="Catechetical%20School%20of%20Alexandria">Catechetical School of Alexandria</a> in 212. At first a <a href="gnostic">gnostic</a> <a href="Valentinus%20%28Gnostic%29">Valentinian</a> and <a href="Marcionism">Marcionist</a>, Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion, and was ordained <a href="deacon">deacon</a>. He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries () on the books of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier, he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition.

He suffered during the persecution under the Roman emperor <a href="Maximinus%20Thrax">Maximinus Thrax</a> in 235. He was later released and died a <a href="confessor">confessor</a>. The last mention of Ambrose in the historical record is in Origen's "<a href="Contra%20Celsum">Contra Celsum</a>," which the latter wrote at the solicitation of Ambrose.

Origen often speaks of Ambrose in affectionately as a man of education with excellent literary and scholarly tastes. All of Origen's works written after 218 are dedicated to Ambrose, including his "On Martyrdom", "Contra Celsum", "Commentary on St. John's Gospel", and "On Prayer". Ambrose's letters to Origen (praised by <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>) are lost, although part of one exists.

Ambrose is venerated as a saint by some branches of Christianity. His feast day in the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> falls on 17 March.

Autonomous building

An autonomous building is a building designed to be operated independently from <a href="infrastructure">infrastructural</a> support services such as the <a href="electric%20power">electric power</a> grid, <a href="gas%20grid">gas grid</a>, municipal water systems, <a href="sewage%20treatment">sewage treatment</a> systems, <a href="storm%20drain">storm drain</a>s, communication services, and in some cases, <a href="public%20road">public road</a>s.

Advocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced <a href="environmental%20impact">environmental impact</a>s, increased security, and lower <a href="costs%20of%20ownership">costs of ownership</a>. Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of <a href="green%20building">green building</a>, not independence per se (see below). <a href="Off-the-grid">Off-grid</a> buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. (Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised for some reason.)

Most of the research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.

British architects <a href="Brenda%20and%20Robert%20Vale">Brenda and Robert Vale</a> have said that, as of 2002, "It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a "house with no bills" for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller."

In the 1970s, a group of activists and engineers calling themselves the <a href="New%20Alchemists">New Alchemists</a> believed the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. The New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional <a href="construction">construction</a> techniques, they designed a series of "<a href="bioshelter">bioshelter</a>" projects, the most famous of which was the <a href="Ark%20Bioshelter">Ark Bioshelter</a> community for <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a>. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, <a href="fish%20farming">fish</a> tanks raising <a href="tilapia">tilapia</a> for <a href="protein">protein</a>, a <a href="greenhouse">greenhouse</a> watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the "New Alchemy Institute". The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.

The 1990s saw the development of <a href="Earthship">Earthship</a>s, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by <a href="Mike%20Reynolds%20%28architect%29">Mike Reynolds</a>. The building material is <a href="tire">tire</a>s filled with <a href="soil">earth</a>. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see <a href="earth%20sheltering">earth sheltering</a>). <a href="Berm">Berm</a>s are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally <a href="blackwater%20%28waste%29">black water</a> is recycled again for more plant watering. The <a href="cistern">cistern</a>s are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from <a href="solar%20energy">solar power</a>.

1990s architects such as <a href="William%20McDonough">William McDonough</a> and <a href="Ken%20Yeang">Ken Yeang</a> applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building (<a href="ING%20Group">ING's</a> <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> headquarters) in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.

As an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.

Autonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.

Autonomous buildings are usually <a href="efficient%20energy%20use">energy-efficient</a> in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.

An autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of <a href="sustainability">sustainability</a> through the use of <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a> and other renewable resources, producing no more <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es than they consume, and other measures.

First and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree. Self sustainable living, for example, is eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is in fact relatively simple however, obtaining an efficient and reliable food source is a more demanding and time-consuming proposition.

Living within an autonomous shelter may also require that party to make sacrifices with lifestyle choices, personal behavior, and social expectations to name a few. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require some alterations upon the residents psychological behavior(s); while others may adjust easily, others may not. Others describe their experience as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.

An autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.

<a href="Brenda%20and%20Robert%20Vale">The Vales</a>, among others, have shown that living off-grid can be a practical, logical lifestyle choice—under certain conditions.

This section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.

There are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.

<a href="Greywater">Greywater</a> systems reuse drained wash water to flush <a href="toilet">toilet</a>s or to water lawns and <a href="garden">garden</a>s. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary <a href="plumbing">plumbing</a>. Some builders are installing <a href="waterless%20urinal">waterless urinal</a>s and even <a href="composting%20toilet">composting toilet</a>s that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.

The classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a <a href="water%20well">well</a>. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The <a href="sono%20arsenic%20filter">sono arsenic filter</a> eliminates unhealthy <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> in well water.

However drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas. It can also be expensive.

In regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use rain, with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment. If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.

Most <a href="desert">desert</a> and <a href="temperate">temperate</a> climates get at least of <a href="rain">rain</a> per year. This means that a typical one-story <a href="house">house</a> with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a <a href="cistern">cistern</a> of . Many areas average of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as .

In many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking. To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a "roof cleaner" tank that diverts the first 40 liters. Cistern water is usually <a href="water%20chlorination">chlorinated</a>, though <a href="reverse%20osmosis">reverse osmosis</a> systems provide even better quality drinking water.

Modern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks. Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent. The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.

Reducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below per person per day, so that in a <a href="drought">drought</a> a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.

It can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a <a href="heat%20pump">heat pump</a> or <a href="HVAC">air conditioning</a> system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.

<a href="Solar%20still">Solar still</a>s can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency <a href="multiple%20effect%20humidification">multiple effect humidification</a> designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).

New technologies, like <a href="reverse%20osmosis">reverse osmosis</a> can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into <a href="drinking%20water">potable water</a> and <a href="brine">brine</a>. <a href="Atmospheric%20water%20generator">Atmospheric water generator</a>s extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.

<a href="Composting%20toilet">Composting toilet</a>s use bacteria to decompose human <a href="feces">feces</a> into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens as well as most of the mass of the waste. Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of "<a href="humanure">humanure</a>" for growing food. The risk is microbial and viral contamination. In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months. To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.

Some home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free <a href="reclaimed%20water">reclaimed water</a> can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large <a href="aquarium">aquarium</a>.

Electric <a href="incinerating%20toilet">incinerating toilet</a>s turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.

<a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="bioreactor">bioreactor</a> is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned <a href="Mars">Mars</a> mission.

A big disadvantage of complex biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota may starve to death.

Another method is NASA's <a href="urine">urine</a>-to-water <a href="distill">distill</a>ation system.

Sewage handling is essential for public health. Many <a href="disease">disease</a>s are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.

The standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a <a href="septic%20tank">septic tank</a>. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary <a href="sewage%20treatment">sewage treatment</a>. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by <a href="anaerobic%20digestion">anaerobic digestion</a>, and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.

Septic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a <a href="Cesspool%20emptier">vacuum truck</a> to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.

However, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.

Composting or <a href="packaging%20toilet">packaging toilet</a>s make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.

Incinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.

Some of the oldest pre-system sewage types are <a href="pit%20toilet">pit toilet</a>s, <a href="latrine">latrine</a>s, and <a href="outhouse">outhouse</a>s. These are still used in many developing countries.

Drainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.

Typically, elaborate, capital-intensive <a href="storm%20sewer">storm sewer</a> networks are engineered to deal with <a href="stormwater">stormwater</a>. In some cities, such as the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> London sewers or much of the old City of <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.

Autonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:

If a water absorbing <a href="swale%20%28geographical%20feature%29">swale</a> for each yard is combined with permeable <a href="concrete">concrete</a> streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains. One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.

A <a href="green%20roof">green roof</a> captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.

Since electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards conservation is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. Fluorescent lights, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient. There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the <a href="Sun%20Frost">Sun Frost</a> company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market <a href="energy%20star">energy star</a>-rated refrigerator.

Using a solar roof, <a href="solar%20cell">solar cell</a>s can provide electric power. Solar roofs have the potential to be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.

However, there are some areas where there is not a sufficient amount of solar radiation to justify using solar power. A common alternative or supplement is using wind turbines. To generate power, the average autonomous house needs only one small <a href="wind%20turbine">wind generator</a>, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100 foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.

The main advantage of <a href="wind%20power">wind power</a> is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, there are many areas that lack sufficient wind to justify a turbine installation. In the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> of the United States, a 10-metre (33 foot) turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.

During times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the <a href="distributed%20generation">electric power grid</a> and operating the power system with <a href="net%20metering">net metering</a>. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).

A grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using <a href="single-wire%20earth%20return">single-wire earth return</a> systems (for example, the <a href="MALT%20%28electricity%20system%29">MALT</a>-system).

In areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced by including a generator to recharge the batteries during extended fogs or other low-power conditions. Auxiliary generators are usually run from <a href="propane">propane</a>, <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>, or sometimes <a href="Diesel%20fuel">diesel</a>. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.

Recent advances in <a href="magnetic%20levitation">passively stable magnetic bearings</a> may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a <a href="flywheel">flywheel</a> in a vacuum. Research groups like Canada's <a href="Ballard%20Power%20Systems">Ballard Power Systems</a> are also working to develop a "<a href="regenerative%20fuel%20cell">regenerative fuel cell</a>", a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.

<a href="Earth%20battery">Earth batteries</a> tap electric currents in the earth called <a href="telluric%20current">telluric current</a>. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power <a href="Telegraphy">telegraphs</a> in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.

<a href="Microbial%20fuel%20cell">Microbial fuel cell</a>s finally allow the generation of electricity from biomass. The plant can be chopped and converted as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.

Most autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are <a href="trombe%20wall">trombe wall</a>s and other technologies as <a href="Steve%20Baer">skylights</a>.

<a href="passive%20solar%20building%20design">Passive solar heating</a> can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.

The basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, north in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>), and the building must incorporate <a href="thermal%20mass">thermal mass</a> to keep it warm in the night.

A recent, somewhat experimental <a href="solar%20heating">solar heating</a> system "<a href="Annualized%20geo%20solar">Annualized geo solar</a> heating" is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter. It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.

In annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from <a href="Thermal%20insulation">insulation</a>, for example, <a href="straw-bale%20construction">straw-bale construction</a>. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.

A more modest "daily solar" design is very practical. For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the <a href="passive%20house">Passivhaus</a> building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern <a href="krypton">krypton</a>- or <a href="argon">argon</a>-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required <a href="thermal%20mass">thermal mass</a>. Passivhaus building codes in particular bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it though a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.

In all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small <a href="heat%20pump">heat pump</a>, which also provides <a href="air%20conditioning">air conditioning</a>, or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the <a href="water%20heater">water heater</a>. Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.

<a href="Earth%20sheltering">Earth sheltering</a> and <a href="windbreak">windbreak</a>s can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from in North Dakota to , in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.

Rounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.

An increasing number of commercial buildings use a <a href="combined%20cycle">combined cycle</a> with <a href="cogeneration">cogeneration</a> to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas <a href="reciprocating%20engine">reciprocating engine</a>, <a href="gas%20turbine">gas turbine</a> or <a href="stirling%20engine">stirling</a> <a href="electric%20generator">electric generator</a>.

Houses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a <a href="wood%20stove">wood stove</a>, or heat and power from <a href="diesel%20fuel">diesel fuel</a> or <a href="bottled%20gas">bottled gas</a>, regardless of their other heating mechanisms.

Electric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.

<a href="Hot%20water%20heat%20recycling">Hot water heat recycling</a> units recover heat from water drain lines. They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water. They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.

Current practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a <a href="water%20heater%23Tankless%20heaters">thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater</a>, so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.

<a href="Solar%20water%20heater">Solar water heater</a>s can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.

The basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a>- insulated, acting something like large <a href="thermos">thermos</a> bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.

<a href="Cogeneration">Cogeneration</a> systems produce hot water from <a href="waste%20heat">waste heat</a>. They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.

Heat recycling, <a href="cogeneration">cogeneration</a> and solar pre-heating can save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used. Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.
Some authorities advocate replacing <a href="bottled%20gas">bottled gas</a> or <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> with <a href="biogas">biogas</a>. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site. The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough <a href="methane">methane</a> for anything more than small amounts of cooking.

Annualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.

Less dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.

Another trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.

If a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the "dome effect." Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as () between the inside of the dome and the outside. <a href="Buckminster%20Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a> discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a <a href="grain%20silo">grain silo</a>, and adapted his <a href="Dymaxion%20house">Dymaxion house</a> and <a href="geodesic%20dome">geodesic dome</a>s to use it.

Refrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an "<a href="absorptive%20refrigeration">absorptive chiller</a>". The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.

Cogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or <a href="stirling%20engine">stirling engine</a>s powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an <a href="absorptive%20chiller">absorptive chiller</a>.

A truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's diesel exhaust was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.

A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50 °F (28 °C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.

If enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a <a href="heat%20pump">heat pump</a>.

Food production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.
Skilled, intensive <a href="garden">garden</a>ing can support an adult from as little as 100 square meters of land per person,
possibly requiring the use of organic farming and <a href="aeroponics">aeroponics</a>. Some proven intensive, low-effort food-production systems include <a href="urban%20agriculture">urban gardening</a> (indoors and outdoors). <a href="Grow%20house">Indoor cultivation</a> may be set up using <a href="hydroponics">hydroponics</a>, while outdoor cultivation may be done using <a href="permaculture">permaculture</a>, <a href="forest%20gardening">forest gardening</a>, <a href="no-till%20farming">no-till farming</a>, and <a href="do%20nothing%20farming">do nothing farming</a>.

<a href="Greenhouse">Greenhouse</a>s are also sometimes included. Sometimes they are also outfitted with irrigation systems or <a href="heat%20sink">heat sink</a>-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night (when the greenhouses starts to cool down).

Anubis

Anubis ( or ; , <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a>: "jnpw", Coptic: "Anoup") is the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Greek</a> name of a god associated with <a href="mummy">mummification</a> and the <a href="Afterlife%23Ancient%20Egypt">afterlife</a> in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">ancient Egyptian religion</a>, usually depicted as a <a href="Canis">canine</a> or a man with a <a href="cynocephaly">canine head</a>. Archeologists identified the sacred animal of Anubis as an Egyptian <a href="Canidae">canid</a>, that at the time was called the <a href="golden%20jackal">golden jackal</a>, but recent <a href="genetic%20testing">genetic testing</a> has caused the Egyptian animal to be reclassified as the <a href="African%20golden%20wolf">African golden wolf</a>.

Like many <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">ancient Egyptian deities</a>, Anubis assumed different roles in various contexts. Depicted as a protector of graves as early as the <a href="First%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">First Dynasty</a> (c. 3100 – c. 2890 BC), Anubis was also an <a href="Embalming">embalmer</a>. By the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (c. 2055 – 1650 BC) he was replaced by <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> in his role as lord of the <a href="underworld">underworld</a>. One of his prominent roles was as a <a href="psychopomp">god who ushered souls into the afterlife</a>. He attended the <a href="weighing%20scale">weighing scale</a> during the "Weighing of the Heart," in which it was determined whether a soul would be allowed to enter the realm of the dead. Despite being one of the most ancient and "one of the most frequently depicted and mentioned gods" in the <a href="List%20of%20Egyptian%20gods">Egyptian pantheon</a>, Anubis played almost no role in <a href="Egyptian%20myths">Egyptian myths</a>.

Anubis was depicted in black, a color that symbolized both rebirth and the discoloration of the corpse after embalming. Anubis is associated with <a href="Wepwawet">Wepwawet</a> (also called Upuaut), another Egyptian god portrayed with a dog's head or in canine form, but with grey or white fur. Historians assume that the two figures were eventually combined. Anubis' female counterpart is <a href="Anput">Anput</a>. His daughter is the serpent goddess <a href="Kebechet">Kebechet</a>.

Anubis' name "jnpw" was possibly pronounced [a.ˈna.pʰa], based on Coptic "Anoup" and the <a href="Akkadian">Akkadian</a> transcription <a-na-pa> in the name <ri-a-na-pa> "<a href="Reanap">Reanapa</a>" that appears in <a href="Amarna%20letters">Amarna letter</a> EA 315. However, this transcription may also be interpreted as "rˁ-nfr", a name similar to that of Prince <a href="Ranefer">Ranefer</a> of the <a href="Fourth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fourth Dynasty</a>.

In Egypt's <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Early Dynastic period</a> (c. 3100 – c. 2686 BC), Anubis was portrayed in full animal form, with a "jackal" head and body. A "jackal" god, probably Anubis, is depicted in stone inscriptions from the reigns of <a href="Hor-Aha">Hor-Aha</a>, <a href="Djer">Djer</a>, and other pharaohs of the <a href="First%20Dynasty">First Dynasty</a>. Since <a href="Predynastic%20Egypt">Predynastic Egypt</a>, when the dead were buried in shallow graves, "jackals" had been strongly associated with cemeteries because they were scavengers which uncovered human bodies and ate their flesh. In the spirit of "fighting like with like," a "jackal" was chosen to protect the dead, because "a common problem (and cause of concern) must have been the digging up of bodies, shortly after burial, by jackals and other wild dogs which lived on the margins of the cultivation."

The oldest known textual mention of Anubis is in the <a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a> of the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> (c. 2686 – c. 2181 BC), where he is associated with the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20burial%20customs">burial</a> of the <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>.

In the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>, Anubis was the most important god of the dead. He was replaced in that role by <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> during the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (2000–1700 BC). In the <a href="History%20of%20Roman%20Egypt">Roman era</a>, which started in 30 BC, tomb paintings depict him holding the hand of deceased persons to guide them to Osiris.

The parentage of Anubis varied between myths, times and sources. In early mythology, he was portrayed as a son of <a href="Ra">Ra</a>. In the <a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a>, which were written in the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a> (c. 2181–2055 BC), Anubis is the son of either the cow goddess <a href="Hesat">Hesat</a> or the cat-headed <a href="Bastet">Bastet</a>. Another tradition depicted him as the son of his father Ra and mother <a href="Nephthys">Nephthys</a>. The Greek <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> (c. 40–120 AD) stated that Anubis was the illegitimate son of Nephthys and <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, but that he was adopted by Osiris's wife <a href="Isis">Isis</a>:

George Hart sees this story as an "attempt to incorporate the independent deity Anubis into the <a href="Osiris%20myth">Osirian pantheon</a>." An Egyptian papyrus from the <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman period</a> (30–380 AD) simply called Anubis the "son of Isis."

In the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic</a> period (350–30 BC), when Egypt became a <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic</a> kingdom ruled by Greek pharaohs, Anubis was merged with the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> god <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, becoming <a href="Hermanubis">Hermanubis</a>. The two gods were considered similar because they both <a href="psychopomp">guided souls</a> to the afterlife. The center of this <a href="Cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cult</a> was in "uten-ha"/"Sa-ka"/ <a href="Cynopolis">Cynopolis</a>, a place whose Greek name means "city of dogs." In pageRank.Book XI of "<a href="The%20Golden%20Ass">The Golden Ass</a>" by <a href="Apuleius">Apuleius</a>, there is evidence that the worship of this god was continued in <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a> through at least the 2nd century. Indeed, Hermanubis also appears in the <a href="alchemy">alchemical</a> and <a href="Hermeticism">hermetical</a> literature of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>.

Although the Greeks and <a href="Ancient%20Romans">Romans</a> typically scorned Egypt's animal-headed gods as bizarre and primitive (Anubis was mockingly called "Barker" by the Greeks), Anubis was sometimes associated with <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> in the heavens and <a href="Cerberus">Cerberus</a> and <a href="Hades">Hades</a> in the underworld. In his dialogues, <a href="Plato">Plato</a> often has <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a> utter <a href="oath">oath</a>s "by the dog" ("kai me ton kuna"), "by the dog of Egypt", and "by the dog, the god of the Egyptians", both for emphasis and to appeal to Anubis as an arbiter of truth in the underworld.

In contrast to real wolves, Anubis was a protector of <a href="grave">grave</a>s and <a href="cemeteries">cemeteries</a>. Several epithets attached to his name in <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20literature">Egyptian texts and inscriptions</a> referred to that role. "Khenty-imentiu", which means "foremost of the westerners" and later became the name of a <a href="Khenti-Amentiu">different wolf god</a>, alluded to his protecting function because the dead were usually buried on the west bank of the Nile. He took other names in connection with his funerary role, such as "tpy-ḏw.f" "He who is upon his mountain" (i.e. keeping guard over tombs from above) and "nb-t3-ḏsr" "Lord of the sacred land", which designates him as a god of the desert <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a>.

The <a href="Jumilhac%20papyrus">Jumilhac papyrus</a> recounts another tale where Anubis protected the body of Osiris from Set. Set attempted to attack the body of Osiris by transforming himself into a <a href="leopard">leopard</a>. Anubis stopped and subdued Set, however, and he <a href="human%20branding">branded</a> Set's skin with a hot iron rod. Anubis then <a href="flaying">flayed</a> Set and wore his skin as a warning against evil-doers who would desecrate the <a href="necropolis">tombs of the dead</a>. Priests who attended to the dead wore leopard skin in order to commemorate Anubis' victory over Set. The legend of Anubis branding the hide of Set in leopard form was used to explain how the leopard got its spots.

Most ancient tombs had prayers to Anubis carved on them.

As "jmy-wt" "He who is in the place of <a href="embalming">embalming</a>", Anubis was associated with <a href="mummification">mummification</a>. He was also called "ḫnty zḥ-nṯr" "He who presides over the god's booth", in which "booth" could refer either to the place where embalming was carried out or the pharaoh's burial chamber.

In the <a href="Osiris%20myth">Osiris myth</a>, Anubis helped Isis to embalm Osiris. Indeed, when the Osiris myth emerged, it was said that after Osiris had been killed by Set, Osiris's organs were given to Anubis as a gift. With this connection, Anubis became the patron god of embalmers; during the rites of mummification, illustrations from the "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20the%20Dead">pageRank.Book of the Dead</a>" often show a wolf-mask-wearing priest supporting the upright mummy.

By the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">late pharaonic era</a> (664–332 BC), Anubis was often depicted as guiding individuals across the threshold from the world of the living to the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion%23Afterlife">afterlife</a>. Though a similar role was sometimes performed by the cow-headed <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a>, Anubis was more commonly chosen to fulfill that function. Greek writers from the <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman period</a> of Egyptian history designated that role as that of "<a href="psychopomp">psychopomp</a>", a Greek term meaning "guide of souls" that they used to refer to their own god <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, who also played that role in <a href="ancient%20Greek%20religion">Greek religion</a>. <a href="Funerary%20art%23Ancient%20Egypt%20and%20Nubia">Funerary art</a> from that period represents Anubis guiding either men or women dressed in Greek clothes into the presence of Osiris, who by then had long replaced Anubis as ruler of the underworld.

One of the roles of Anubis was as the "Guardian of the Scales." The critical scene depicting the weighing of the heart, in the "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20the%20Dead">pageRank.Book of the Dead</a>", shows Anubis performing a measurement that determined whether the person was worthy of entering the realm of the dead (the <a href="underworld">underworld</a>, known as "<a href="Duat">Duat</a>"). By weighing the heart of a deceased person against <a href="Ma%27at">Ma'at</a> (or "truth"), who was often represented as an ostrich feather, Anubis dictated the fate of souls. Souls heavier than a feather would be devoured by <a href="Ammit">Ammit</a>, and souls lighter than a feather would ascend to a heavenly existence.

Anubis was one of the most frequently represented gods in <a href="Art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egyptian art</a>. In the <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20of%20Egypt">early dynastic period</a>, he was depicted in animal form, as a black wolf. Anubis's distinctive black color did not represent the coat of real wolves, but it had several symbolic meanings. First it represented "the discolouration of the corpse after its treatment with <a href="natron">natron</a> and the smearing of the wrappings with a resinous substance during mummification". Being the color of the fertile <a href="silt">silt</a> of the <a href="Nile">River Nile</a>, to Egyptians black also symbolized fertility and the possibility of rebirth in the afterlife.

Later in the Middle Kingdom Anubis was often portrayed as a wolf-headed human. An extremely rare depiction of him in <a href="anthropomorphism">fully human form</a> was found in the tomb of <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a> in <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>.

Anubis is often depicted wearing a ribbon and holding a "nḫ3ḫ3" "<a href="crook%20and%20flail">flail</a>" in the crook of his arm. Another of Anubis's attributes was the "jmy-wt" or <a href="imiut%20fetish">imiut fetish</a>, named for his role in embalming.

In funerary contexts, Anubis is shown either attending to a deceased person's mummy or sitting atop a tomb protecting it. <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a> tomb-seals also depict Anubis sitting atop the <a href="nine%20bows">nine bows</a> that symbolize his domination over the enemies of Egypt.

Arthur Jensen

Arthur Robert Jensen (August 24, 1923 – October 22, 2012) was an American psychologist and author. He was a professor of <a href="educational%20psychology">educational psychology</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. Jensen was known for his work in <a href="psychometrics">psychometrics</a> and <a href="differential%20psychology">differential psychology</a>, which is concerned with how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.

He was a major proponent of the <a href="hereditarianism">hereditarian</a> position in the <a href="nature%20and%20nurture">nature and nurture</a> debate, the position that <a href="genetics">genetics</a> play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as <a href="intelligence%20%28trait%29">intelligence</a> and <a href="personality%20psychology">personality</a>. He was the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals and sat on the editorial boards of the <a href="scientific%20journals">scientific journals</a> "<a href="Intelligence%20%28journal%29">Intelligence</a>" and "<a href="Personality%20and%20Individual%20Differences">Personality and Individual Differences</a>".

He was rated as one of the 50 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century. He was also a controversial figure, largely for his conclusions regarding the causes of <a href="race%20and%20intelligence">race-based differences in intelligence</a>.

Jensen was born August 24, 1923, in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, California, the son of Linda Mary (née Schachtmayer) and Arthur Alfred Jensen, who operated and owned a lumber and building materials company. His paternal grandparents were Danish immigrants and his mother was of half <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Poland">Polish Jewish</a> and half German descent. He studied at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> (B.A. 1945), <a href="San%20Diego%20State%20College">San Diego State College</a> (M.A., 1952) and <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> (Ph.D., 1956), and did his doctoral thesis with Percival Symonds on the <a href="Thematic%20Apperception%20Test">Thematic Apperception Test</a>: He published this work. From 1956 through 1958, he did postdoctoral research at the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>, <a href="Institute%20of%20Psychiatry">Institute of Psychiatry</a> with <a href="Hans%20Eysenck">Hans Eysenck</a>.

Upon returning to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, he became a researcher and professor at the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a>, Berkeley, where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of <a href="culture">culture</a>, development, and genetics on intelligence and learning. He received <a href="tenure">tenure</a> at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first <a href="sabbatical">sabbatical</a> in 1964. He concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students. In 2003, he was awarded the <a href="Kistler%20Prize">Kistler Prize</a> for original contributions to the understanding of the connection between the human <a href="genome">genome</a> and human <a href="society">society</a>. In 2006, the <a href="International%20Society%20for%20Intelligence%20Research">International Society for Intelligence Research</a> awarded Jensen its Lifetime Achievement Award.

Jensen has had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a <a href="Conducting">conductor</a> himself. At 14, he conducted a <a href="Band%20%28music%29">band</a> that won a nationwide <a href="competition">contest</a> held in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a <a href="seminar">seminar</a> given by <a href="Nikolai%20Sokoloff">Nikolai Sokoloff</a>. Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, mainly to be near the conductor <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>. He was also deeply interested in the life and example of <a href="Gandhi">Gandhi</a>, producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life. During Jensen's period in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> he spent time working as a <a href="social%20worker">social worker</a> with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.

Jensen's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children. The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability. "Level I", or <a href="associative%20learning">associative learning</a>, may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills. "Level II", or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.

Later, Jensen was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of the <a href="g%20factor%20%28psychometrics%29">general factor of intelligence</a>, a concept which was essentially synonymous with his "Level II" conceptual learning. The general factor, or "g", is an abstraction that stems from the observation that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.

Jensen claimed, on the basis of his research, that <a href="Heritability%20of%20IQ">general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait</a>, determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions. He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.

Jensen's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the "<a href="Harvard%20Educational%20Review">Harvard Educational Review</a>", was titled "<a href="How%20Much%20Can%20We%20Boost%20IQ%20and%20Scholastic%20Achievement%3F">How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?</a>" It concluded, among other things, that <a href="Head%20Start%20%28education%29">Head Start</a> programs designed to boost <a href="African-American">African-American</a> <a href="IQ">IQ</a> scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.

The work became one of—if not the most—cited papers in the <a href="history">history</a> of <a href="psychological%20testing">psychological testing</a> and <a href="Psychometrics">intelligence research</a>.

After the paper was released, students and faculty staged large protests outside Jensen's <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">U.C. Berkeley</a> office. Jensen was denied reprints of his work by his <a href="publisher">publisher</a> and was not permitted to reply in response to letters of criticism — both extremely unusual policies for their day.
In a later article, Jensen argued that his claims had been misunderstood:
...nowhere have I "claimed" an "innate deficiency" of intelligence in blacks. My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: "The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations. The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question." (Jensen, 1981a, p. 213).
Although a critic of Jensen's thesis, economist <a href="Thomas%20Sowell">Thomas Sowell</a>, criticizing the taboo against research on <a href="race%20and%20intelligence">race and intelligence</a>, wrote:
Professor Jensen pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him. He did this because "I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate." What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor Jensen has had.

However, Jensen's 1998 "" gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ. In Chapter 12: Population Differences in "g": Causal Hypotheses, Jensen writes:

The relationship of the <a href="g%20factor%20%28psychometrics%29">g factor</a> to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e., <a href="Spearman%27s%20hypothesis">Spearman's hypothesis</a>) suggests that the average white-black difference in "g" has a biological component. Human races are viewed not as discrete, or <a href="Platonism">Platonic</a>, categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes. The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies. Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly "g".
In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on "<a href="Mainstream%20Science%20on%20Intelligence">Mainstream Science on Intelligence</a>, " an editorial written by <a href="Linda%20Gottfredson">Linda Gottfredson</a> and published in the "<a href="Wall%20Street%20Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>", which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on the meaning and significance of IQ following the publication of the book "<a href="The%20Bell%20Curve">The Bell Curve</a>".

In 2005, Jensen's article, co-written with <a href="J.%20Philippe%20Rushton">J. Philippe Rushton</a>, named "Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability", was published in the <a href="American%20Psychological%20Association">APA</a> journal "<a href="Psychology%2C%20Public%20Policy%20and%20Law">Psychology, Public Policy and Law</a>". Jensen and Rushton present ten categories of evidence in support of the notion that IQ differences between whites and blacks are partly genetic in origin.

He died on October 22, 2012 at his home in <a href="Kelseyville%2C%20California">Kelseyville, California</a> at age 89.

<a href="Melvin%20Konner">Melvin Konner</a> wrote in the notes to his book "The Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit":

Statements made by Arthur Jensen, William Shockley, and other investigators in the late 1960s and early 1970s about race and IQ or social class and IQ rapidly passed into currency in policy discussions. Many of these statements were proved wrong, but they had already influenced some policymakers, and that influence is very difficult to recant.
Many studies that purport to be both science-based and attempt to influence public policy have been accused of scientific racism. Konner wrote:
What of the latest currents of thought? Are they likely to lead to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy? The indications are not all encouraging. Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray published a book in 1994 clearly directed at policy, just as Jensen and others had in the 1960s and 1970s. "The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life" (New York: Free Press 1994) teamed a psychologist with a conservative policy advocate to try to prove that both the class structure and the <a href="racial%20segregation">racial divide</a> in the United States result from genetically determined differences in intelligence and ability.

Their general assertions about genes and IQ were not very controversial, but their speculations on race were something else again.

By 1994, the time of "The Bell Curve"'s publishing, Jensen had received $1.1 million from the <a href="Pioneer%20Fund">Pioneer Fund</a>,
an organization frequently described as racist and "white supremacist" in nature.
The fund contributed a total of $3.5 million to researchers cited in The Bell Curve's most controversial chapter "that suggests some races are naturally smarter than others" with Jensen's works being cited twenty-three times in the book's bibliography.

Lisa Suzuki and Joshua Aronson of <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> claimed in 2005 that, unwaveringly for over 30 years, Jensen has largely ignored evidence that fails to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent a <a href="Genetics">genetic</a> racial hierarchy.

Paleontologist and evolutionary biologist <a href="Stephen%20Jay%20Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a> attacked Jensen's work in his 1981 book "<a href="The%20Mismeasure%20of%20Man">The Mismeasure of Man</a>". Gould writes that Jensen misapplies the concept of "<a href="heritability">heritability</a>", which is defined as a measure of the <a href="Genetic%20diversity">variation</a> of a trait due to inheritance "within" a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156-157). According to Gould, Jensen uses heritability to measure differences "between" populations. Gould also disagrees with Jensen's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, "g", or "the <a href="general%20factor">general factor</a> common to a large number of cognitive abilities" which can be measured along a unilinear scale.

This is a claim most closely identified with <a href="Charles%20Spearman">Charles Spearman</a>. According to Gould, Jensen misunderstood the research of <a href="L.%20L.%20Thurstone">L. L. Thurstone</a> to ultimately support this claim; Gould, however, argues that Thurstone's <a href="factor%20analysis">factor analysis</a> of intelligence revealed "g" to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314). Gould criticizes Jensen's sources including his use of <a href="Catharine%20Cox">Catharine Cox</a>'s 1926 "Genetic Studies of Genius", which examines <a href="historiometric">historiometric</a>ally the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths (Gould 1981: 153-154).

In 1980 Jensen published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled "<a href="Bias%20in%20Mental%20Testing">Bias in Mental Testing</a>". Reviewing this book, psychologist <a href="Kenneth%20Kaye">Kenneth Kaye</a> endorsed Jensen's distinction between bias and discrimination. The purpose of tests is to discriminate (that is, reveal actual differences) on the basis of ability; bias constitutes error. Jensen defined any test as biased for a particular group if that group differs significantly from the majority group in the slopes, intercepts, or standard error of the estimates of their regression lines. Most studies found no difference in the regression lines between black and white groups, but those differences that had been found to be biased had overpredicted rather than underpredicted the minority group's performance (for example, grades in Officer Candidate courses). Jensen's conclusion:
Until we find out what the relevant psychological predictors are for which racial classification per se is merely a 'stand-in' variable, we have no choice but to include race (or other group membership) as a predictive variable along with the test scores or other predictive measures. On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.
Pointing out that "many of Jensen's opponents allowed their scientific conclusions to be far more biased by their political views than he did, Kaye quoted 18th-century <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>: "There is no Method of Reasoning more Common, and yet none more blameable, than in philosophical Debates, to endeavor the Refutation of any Hypothesis, by a Pretext of its dangerous Consequences to Religion and Morality."

In a 1982 review of "The Mismeasure of Man", Jensen gives point-by-point rebuttals to much of Gould's critique, including Gould's treatment of heritability, the "reification" of "g", and the use of Thurstone's analysis.

In Arthur Jensen's response to Gould's criticisms, in the paper titled "The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons", Jensen begins his paper with this observation:
Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and offers a course at Harvard entitled, "Biology as a Social Weapon." Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book. Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of Gould when he played a prominent role in a group called Science for the People and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist <a href="Edward%20O.%20Wilson">Edward O. Wilson</a>, a leader in the development of sociobiology...
While Jensen recognizes the validity of some of Gould's claims, in many places, he criticizes Gould's general approach:
This charge of a social, value-laden science undoubtedly contains an element of truth. In recent years, however, we recognize this charge as the keystone of the Marxist interpretation of the history of science.
Jensen adds that Gould made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present Jensen's own positions:
In his references to my own work, Gould includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases my views. Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources. While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.
Jensen expressed considerably greater praise of his frequent intellectual sparring partner, <a href="Jim%20Flynn%20%28academic%29">James R. Flynn</a>:
Now and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind. His book, "Race, IQ and Jensen" (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.

"" (1998) is a book on the <a href="general%20intelligence%20factor">general intelligence factor</a> ("g"). The book deals with the intellectual history of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.

"Clocking the Mind : Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences" (2006) deals with <a href="mental%20chronometry">mental chronometry</a> (MC), and covers a variety of techniques for measuring the speed with which the brain processes information. Whereas <a href="IQ">IQ</a> merely represents an interval (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true ratio scale properties, Jensen argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability.

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a <a href="Musical%20theatre">musical</a> with music and lyrics by <a href="Stephen%20Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a> and book by <a href="Burt%20Shevelove">Burt Shevelove</a> and <a href="Larry%20Gelbart">Larry Gelbart</a>.

Inspired by the <a href="farce">farce</a>s of the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">ancient Roman</a> playwright <a href="Plautus">Plautus</a> (251–183 BC), specifically "<a href="Pseudolus">Pseudolus</a>", "<a href="Miles%20Gloriosus%20%28play%29">Miles Gloriosus</a>", and "<a href="Mostellaria">Mostellaria</a>", the musical tells the bawdy story of a <a href="slavery">slave</a> named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of <a href="farce">farce</a>, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of <a href="mistaken%20identity">mistaken identity</a> (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> comedians to begin a story: "A funny thing happened on the way to the theater".

The musical's original 1962 <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> run won several <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>s, including Best Musical and Best Author (Musical). "A Funny Thing" has enjoyed several Broadway and <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> revivals and was made into a successful film starring the original lead of the musical, <a href="Zero%20Mostel">Zero Mostel</a>.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" opened on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> on May 8, 1962, at the <a href="Neil%20Simon%20Theatre">Alvin Theatre</a>, and then transferred to the <a href="Mark%20Hellinger%20Theatre">Mark Hellinger Theatre</a> and the <a href="Majestic%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29">Majestic Theatre</a>, where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.

The show's creators originally wanted <a href="Phil%20Silvers">Phil Silvers</a> in the lead role of <a href="Pseudolus">Pseudolus</a>, but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. He is also quoted as turning down the role for being "<a href="The%20Phil%20Silvers%20Show">Sgt. Bilko</a> in a toga". (Silvers eventually played the role — wearing his glasses — in a 1972 revival. In the film, he played Marcus Lycus.) <a href="Milton%20Berle">Milton Berle</a> also passed on the role. Eventually, Zero Mostel was cast.

During the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. <a href="Jerome%20Robbins">Jerome Robbins</a> was called in to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace "Love Is in the Air" and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song "Comedy Tonight" for this new opening. From that point on, the show was a success.

It was directed by <a href="George%20Abbott">George Abbott</a> and produced by <a href="Hal%20Prince">Hal Prince</a>, with choreography by <a href="Jack%20Cole%20%28choreographer%29">Jack Cole</a> and uncredited staging and choreography by Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by <a href="Tony%20Walton">Tony Walton</a>. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by <a href="Jean%20Rosenthal">Jean Rosenthal</a>. Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including <a href="Jack%20Gilford">Jack Gilford</a> (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), <a href="David%20Burns%20%28actor%29">David Burns</a>, <a href="John%20Carradine">John Carradine</a>, <a href="Ruth%20Kobart">Ruth Kobart</a>, and <a href="Raymond%20Walburn">Raymond Walburn</a>. The young lovers were played by <a href="Brian%20Davies%20%28actor%29">Brian Davies</a> and Preshy Marker. <a href="Karen%20Black">Karen Black</a>, originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.

The show won several <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>s: Best Musical, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Burns), Best pageRank.Book, and Best Director. The score, however, was coolly received; it was Sondheim's first musical on Broadway in which he wrote both the music and lyrics, and did not earn a nomination for Best Original Score.

The show was presented two times in London's <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>. The 1963 production and its 1986 revival were staged at the <a href="Novello%20Theatre">Strand Theatre</a> and the <a href="Piccadilly%20Theatre">Piccadilly Theatre</a> respectively, and featured <a href="Frankie%20Howerd">Frankie Howerd</a> starring as Pseudolus, <a href="Kenneth%20Connor">Kenneth Connor</a> as Hysterium, <a href="%27Monsewer%27%20Eddie%20Gray">'Monsewer' Eddie Gray</a> as <a href="Senex">Senex</a>, <a href="Jon%20Pertwee">Jon Pertwee</a> as Marcus Lycus, and <a href="Leon%20Greene">Leon Greene</a> as Miles Gloriosus.

In 2004 there was a limited-run revival at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a> Olivier Theatre, starring <a href="Desmond%20Barrit">Desmond Barrit</a> as Pseudolus, <a href="Philip%20Quast">Philip Quast</a> as Miles Gloriosus, <a href="Hamish%20McColl">Hamish McColl</a> as Hysterium and <a href="Isla%20Blair">Isla Blair</a> as Domina (who had previously played Philia in the 1963 production). This production was nominated for the 2005 <a href="Olivier%20Award">Olivier Award</a>, Outstanding Musical Production.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" was made into a <a href="musical%20film">musical film</a> in 1966, directed by <a href="Richard%20Lester">Richard Lester</a>, with Mostel and Gilford re-creating their Broadway stage roles, <a href="Leon%20Greene">Leon Greene</a> reprising his West End stage role, and Phil Silvers in an expanded role as "Marcus Lycus". <a href="David%20Burns%20%28actor%29">David Burns</a> did not return for the film role of Senex, which was played in the film by <a href="Michael%20Hordern">Michael Hordern</a>. <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a> made his final film appearance in the role of Erronius.

A <a href="Revival%20%28theatre%29">revival</a> opened on Broadway at the <a href="Lunt-Fontanne%20Theatre">Lunt-Fontanne Theatre</a> on April 4, 1972 and closed on August 12, 1972 after 156 performances. Directed by co-author <a href="Burt%20Shevelove">Burt Shevelove</a> the cast starred Phil Silvers as Pseudolus (later replaced by <a href="Tom%20Poston">Tom Poston</a>), <a href="Lew%20Parker">Lew Parker</a> as Senex, <a href="Carl%20Ballantine">Carl Ballantine</a> as Lycus and <a href="Reginald%20Owen">Reginald Owen</a> as Erronius. <a href="Larry%20Blyden">Larry Blyden</a>, who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. "Pretty Little Picture" and "That'll Show Him" were dropped from the show, and were replaced with "Echo Song" (sung by Hero and Philia), and "Farewell" (added for <a href="Nancy%20Walker">Nancy Walker</a> as Domina, as she and Senex depart for the country). "Echo Song" and "Farewell" had been added to a production staged in Los Angeles the previous year and were composed by Sondheim. They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden.

The musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the <a href="St.%20James%20Theatre">St. James Theatre</a> on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances. The cast starred <a href="Nathan%20Lane">Nathan Lane</a> as Pseudolus (replaced by <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a> and later by <a href="David%20Alan%20Grier">David Alan Grier</a>), <a href="Mark%20Linn-Baker">Mark Linn-Baker</a> as Hysterium, <a href="Ernie%20Sabella">Ernie Sabella</a> as Lycus, <a href="Jim%20Stanek">Jim Stanek</a> as Hero, <a href="Lewis%20J.%20Stadlen">Lewis J. Stadlen</a> as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by <a href="Jerry%20Zaks">Jerry Zaks</a>, with choreography by <a href="Rob%20Marshall">Rob Marshall</a>. Lane won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor and the Dramas Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical; the production was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, Revival of a Musical.

Every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance. In addition, <a href="Jason%20Alexander">Jason Alexander</a>, who performed as Pseudolus in one scene in "<a href="Jerome%20Robbins%27%20Broadway">Jerome Robbins' Broadway</a>", also won a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical.

The original Australian production with American actor <a href="Jack%20Collins%20%28actor%29">Jack Collins</a> as Pseudolus opened at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Sydney">Theatre Royal</a> in Sydney in July 1964, and toured other Australian cities through 1965.

The <a href="Stephen%20Sondheim%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Stephen Sondheim Center for the Performing Arts</a> produced a limited-run revival of the musical from January 11 to 27, 2008. The production was directed by Randal K. West, with Justin Hill as musical director and Adam Cates as choreographer. The cast featured <a href="Richard%20Kind">Richard Kind</a> as Pseudolus, Joel Blum as Senex, <a href="Stephen%20DeRosa">Stephen DeRosa</a> as Marcus Lycus, Sean McCall as Hysterium, and Steve Wilson as Miles Gloriosus. It also featured Diana Upton-Hill, Ryan Gaffney, Stephen Mark Crisp, Jack Kloppenborg, and Margret Clair.

The Chung Ying Theatre Company in Hong Kong staged a Cantonese version of the musical at <a href="Kwai%20Tsing%20Theatre">Kwai Tsing Theatre</a>, to celebrate the company's 30th anniversary. It was directed by <a href="Chung%20King%20Fai">Chung King Fai</a> and Ko Tin Lung and ran from 14 to 21 March 2009.

The <a href="Stratford%20Shakespeare%20Festival">Stratford Shakespeare Festival</a> in <a href="Stratford%2C%20Ontario">Stratford</a>, Ontario, Canada production ran from June 11 to November 7, 2009, with <a href="Des%20McAnuff">Des McAnuff</a> directing and <a href="Wayne%20Cilento">Wayne Cilento</a> as choreographer. <a href="Bruce%20Dow">Bruce Dow</a> originally performed the role of Pseudolus, but was forced to withdraw from the entire 2009 season due to an injury, and the role was then performed by <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20Cullen">Seán Cullen</a> as of September 5, 2009. <a href="Stephen%20Ouimette">Stephen Ouimette</a> played Hysterium. <a href="Mirvish%20Productions">Mirvish Productions</a> presented the earlier Stratford production at the Canon Theatre, <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, in December 2010 through January 2011. Bruce Dow and Sean Cullen were alternates in the lead role.

In October 2012 the play opened at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre%2C%20Melbourne">Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne</a>, Australia, with <a href="Geoffrey%20Rush">Geoffrey Rush</a> as Pseudolus, <a href="Magda%20Szubanski">Magda Szubanski</a> as Domina and <a href="Shane%20Bourne">Shane Bourne</a> as Senex. Stephen Sondheim came to Melbourne specifically to watch the show.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" was produced at Two River Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey from November 14, 2015 to December 13, 2015. The production was performed by an all male cast (Paul Castree, Eddie Cooper, Kevin Isola, David Josefsberg, Max Kumangai, Graham Rowat, Manny Stark, Bobby Conte Thornton, David Turner, <a href="Michael%20Urie">Michael Urie</a>, <a href="Tom%20Deckman">Tom Deckman</a>, and <a href="Christopher%20Fitzgerald%20%28actor%29">Christopher Fitzgerald</a>).

In ancient Rome, some neighbors live in three adjacent houses. In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).

One day, Senex and Domina go on a trip and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin). Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior <a href="Miles%20Gloriosus">Miles Gloriosus</a>, who is expected to claim her very soon. Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a <a href="Yersinia%20pestis">plague</a> from <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for "that is the way of a courtesan." To appease her, he tells her to wait ("that's what virgins do best, isn't it?") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is "mare's sweat", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.

Unexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted – a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).

When Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has "escaped," Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, "Lycus", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.

Complicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is "up to something low." She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in <a href="Drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a> and pretending to be Philia, "dead" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three "Philia"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia – all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus – who had been recruited as mourners at "Philia"'s ersatz funeral – have escaped, and Lycus sends his <a href="Eunuch%20%28court%20official%29">eunuch</a>s out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.

Finally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble – but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother, and, as the daughter or a free-born citizen, she's freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children. A happy ending prevails for all – except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.

Aleut

The Aleuts () ("Aleut'y"), who are usually known in the <a href="Aleut%20language">Aleut language</a> by the <a href="endonym">endonym</a> Unangax̂ Унаңан (<a href="literal%20translation">lit.</a> "people", Unangan, singular), are the <a href="Alaska%20Natives">indigenous people</a> of the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>.

Both the Unangax̂ and the islands are divided between the <a href="United%20States">US</a> state of <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n administrative division of <a href="Kamchatka%20Krai">Kamchatka Krai</a>.

While <a href="English%20language">English</a> and <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> are the dominant languages used by Aleuts living in the United States and Russia respectively, the <a href="Aleut%20language">Aleut language</a> is still spoken by an estimated 150 people in the United States and 5 people in Russia. The language belongs to the <a href="Eskimo%E2%80%93Aleut%20languages">Eskimo-Aleut language family</a> and includes three dialect groupings: Eastern Aleut, spoken on the Eastern Aleutian, <a href="Shumagin%20Islands">Shumagin</a>, <a href="Fox%20Islands%20%28Alaska%29">Fox</a> and <a href="Pribilof%20Islands">Pribilof Islands</a>; <a href="Atkan">Atkan</a>, spoken on <a href="Atka%20Island">Atka</a> and <a href="Bering%20Island">Bering</a> islands; and the now extinct <a href="Attu%20Island">Attuan</a> dialect. The Pribilof Islands boast the highest number of active speakers of Aleutian. Most of the Native elders speak Aleut, but it is very rare for an everyday person to speak the language fluently.

Aleut was written in the <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic script</a> beginning in 1829. From 1870, the language was written in the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>. An Aleut dictionary and grammar have been published, and portions of the Bible were translated into Aleut.

The Aleut (Unangan) dialects and tribes:


The Aleut people (Unangax̂) historically lived throughout the Aleutian Islands, the <a href="Shumagin%20Islands">Shumagin Islands</a>, and the far western part of the <a href="Alaska%20Peninsula">Alaska Peninsula</a>, with an estimated population of around 25,000 prior to European contact. In the 1820s, the <a href="Russian-American%20Company">Russian-American Company</a> administered a large portion of the North Pacific during a Russian-led expansion of the <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>. They resettled many Aleut families to the <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a> (within the <a href="Aleutsky%20District">Aleutsky District</a> of the <a href="Kamchatka%20Krai">Kamchatka Krai</a> in Russia) and to the <a href="Pribilof%20Islands">Pribilof Islands</a> (in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>). These continue to have majority-Aleut communities.

According to the 2000 Census, 11,941 people identified as being Aleut, while 17,000 identified as having partial Aleut ancestry. Prior to sustained European contact, approximately 25,000 Aleut lived in the archipelago. The <a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Online">Encyclopædia Britannica Online</a> says more than 15,000 people have Aleut ancestry in the early 21st century. The Aleut suffered high fatalities in the 19th and early 20th centuries from Eurasian <a href="infectious%20diseases">infectious diseases</a> to which they had no <a href="immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a>. In addition, the population suffered as their customary lifestyles were disrupted. Russian traders and later Europeans married Aleut women and had families with them.

After the arrival of <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox</a> <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> in the late 18th century, many Aleuts became <a href="Christianity">Christian</a>. Of the numerous Russian Orthodox congregations in Alaska, most are majority Alaska Native in ethnicity. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> was Saint <a href="Peter%20the%20Aleut">Peter the Aleut</a>.

In the 18th century, <a href="Russia">Russia</a> "<a href="promyshlenniki">promyshlenniki</a>" traders established settlements on the islands. There was high demand for the furs that the Aleut provided from hunting. In May 1784, local Aleut revolted on Amchitka against the Russian traders. (The Russians had a small trading post there.) According to what Aleut people said, in an account recorded by Japanese castaways and published in 2004, otters were decreasing year by year. The Russians paid the Aleut less and less in goods in return for the furs they made. The Japanese learned that the Aleut felt the situation was at crisis. The leading Aleuts negotiated with the Russians, saying they had failed to deliver enough supplies in return for furs. Nezimov, leader of the Russians, ordered two of his men, Stephanov (ステッパノ "Suteppano") and Kazhimov (カジモフ "Kazimofu") to kill his mistress Oniishin (オニイシン "Oniishin"), who was the Aleut chief's daughter, because he doubted that Oniishin had tried to dissuade her father and other leaders from pushing for more goods.

That evening, hundreds of Aleut men gathered on a mountain and marched to the Russians' houses. When five Russians opened fire, the Aleuts ran away. The next day the Aleut returned, but escaped again when the Russians started firing. While the men attempted another attack the next day, they yelled and moved more quickly towards the house. As Russians opened fire, they started to run away again. After they ran, the Russians noticed that all the men had left the village. The Russians took around 40 women and children hostage, forcing the Aleut to surrender. The Russians killed four Aleut leaders.

After the 4 leaders had been killed, the Aleut began to move from Amchitka to neighboring islands. Nezimov, leader of the Russian group, was jailed after the whole incident was reported to Russian officials. (According to , written by <a href="Katsuragawa%20Hosh%C5%AB">Katsuragawa Hoshū</a> after interviewing <a href="Daikokuya%20K%C5%8Dday%C5%AB">Daikokuya Kōdayū</a>.)

In 1811, in order to obtain more of the commercially valuable <a href="otter">otter</a> pelts, a party of Aleut hunters traveled to the <a href="San%20Nicolas%20Island">coastal island of San Nicolas</a>, near the <a href="Alta%20California-Baja%20California%20border">Alta California-Baja California border</a>. The locally resident <a href="Nicole%C3%B1o">Nicoleño nation</a> sought a payment from the Aleut hunters for the large number of otters being killed in the area. Disagreement arose, turning violent; in the ensuing battle, the Aleut killed nearly all the Nicoleño men. Together with high fatalities from European diseases, the Nicoleños suffered so much from the loss of their men that by 1853, only one living Nicoleña person remained. (See <a href="Juana%20Maria">Juana Maria</a>, "The Lone Woman of San Nicolas", also known as Karana)

In 1942, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Japanese forces occupied <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu</a> and <a href="Kiska">Kiska</a> Islands in the western Aleutians. They later transported captive Attu Islanders to <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a>, where they were held as <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> in harsh conditions. The United States government evacuated hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs during WWII, placing them in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died of starvation and disease. In total, about 75 died in American internment and 19 as a result of Japanese occupation. The <a href="Aleut%20Restitution%20Act%20of%201988">Aleut Restitution Act of 1988</a> was an attempt by <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to compensate the survivors. On June 17, 2017, the US Government formally apologized for the internment of the Unangan people and their treatment in the camps.

The <a href="Aleutian%20Islands%20Campaign">World War II campaign</a> by the United States to retake Attu and Kiska was a significant component of the operations in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">Pacific theater</a>.

Before major influence from outside, there were approximately 25,000 Aleuts on the archipelago. Foreign diseases, harsh treatment and disruption of traditional society soon reduced the population to less than one-tenth this number. The 1910 <a href="Census">Census</a> count showed 1,491 Aleuts. In the 2000 Census, 11,941 people identified as being Aleut; nearly 17,000 said Aleuts were among their ancestors. Alaskans generally recognize that <a href="Interracial%20marriage">intermarriage</a> during the Russian occupation, while the colonists were limited in number, resulted in few full-blooded Aleuts remaining today. Full-blooded Aleuts still exist and are growing in number, and there are also people who may be part Russian or other descent but solely identify as Aleut.

The Aleut constructed partially underground houses called "<a href="barabara">barabara</a>". According to <a href="Lillie%20McGarvey">Lillie McGarvey</a>, a 20th-century Aleut leader, "barabaras" keep "occupants dry from the frequent rains, warm at all times, and snugly sheltered from the high winds common to the area". Aleuts traditionally built houses by digging an oblong square pit in the ground, usually or smaller. The pit was then covered by a roof framed with driftwood, thatched with grass, then covered with earth for insulation. Inside benches were placed along the sides, with a hearth in the middle. The bedrooms were at the back of the lodge, opposite the entrance.

The Aleut survived by hunting and gathering. They fished for salmon, crabs, shellfish, and cod, as well as harvesting sea mammals such as seal, walrus and whales. The fish and sea animals were processed in a variety of ways: dried, smoked or roasted. Caribou, musk oxen, deer, moose, whale and other types of game were eaten roasted or preserved for later use. Berries were dried. They were also processed as "alutiqqutigaq", a mixture of berries, fat and fish. The boiled skin and blubber of a whale was a delicacy, as was walrus.
Today many Aleut continue to eat their traditional foods, but also buy the processed foods from <a href="Outside%20%28Alaska%29">Outside</a>, which are very expensive in Alaska.

Traditional arts of the Aleut include weapon-making, building of "<a href="baidarka">baidarka</a>s" (special hunting boats), <a href="weaving">weaving</a>, figurines, clothing, carving, and mask making. Men as well as women often carved ivory and wood. 19th-century craftsmen were famed for their ornate wooden hunting hats, which feature elaborate and colorful designs and may be trimmed with <a href="sea%20lion">sea lion</a> <a href="Vibrissae">whiskers</a>, feathers, and <a href="ivory">ivory</a>. <a href="Andrew%20Gronholdt">Andrew Gronholdt</a> of the Shumagin Islands has played a vital role in reviving the ancient art of building the "chaguda-x" or traditional bentwood hats.

Aleut women sewed finely stitched waterproof <a href="Anorak">parkas</a> from <a href="Seal%20%28mammal%29">seal</a> gut, and wove fine baskets from <a href="dune%20wildrye">dune wildrye</a> grass or "<a href="Elymus%20mollis">Elymus mollis</a>". Some women continue to make baskets in this way. Aleut arts are practiced and taught throughout the state of Alaska. As many Aleut have moved out of the islands to other parts of the state, they have taken with them the knowledge of their arts. They have also adopted new materials and methods for their art.

The Aleut carved work, distinct in each region, has attracted traders for centuries, including early Europeans and other Alaska Natives. Historically carving was a male art and leadership attribute; in today’s world it is an art of both sexes. Most commonly the carvings of ivory and wood originated as part of making hunting weapons. Other carvings depicted the animals of their world, which were so important: such as seals and whales. They also depicted humans.

The Aleut also carve walrus ivory for other uses, such as jewelry and sewing needles. Jewelry is made with designs specific to the region of each people. Each <a href="clan">clan</a> would have a specific style to signify their origin. Jewelry ornaments were made for piercing lips (labrum), nose, and ears, as well as for necklaces. Each woman had her own sewing needles, which she made, and that often had detailed end of animal heads.

The main Aleut method of <a href="basketry">basketry</a> was false embroidery (overlay). Strands of grasses or reeds were overlaid upon the basic weaving surface, to obtain a plastic effect. Basketry was an art reserved for women. Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality, using only their thumbnail, grown long and then sharpened, as a tool. Today, Aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. Birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the Aleut in basketry. The Aleut term for grass basket is "qiigam aygaaxsii". One Aleut leader recognized by the State of Alaska for her work in teaching and reviving Aleut basketry was <a href="Anfesia%20Shapsnikoff">Anfesia Shapsnikoff</a>. Her life and accomplishments are portrayed in the book "Moments Rightly Placed"(1998).

Masks were created to portray figures of their myths and oral history. The <a href="Atka%20people">Atka people</a> believed that another people lived in their land before them. They portrayed such ancients in their masks, which show anthropomorphic creatures named in their language. Knut Bergsland says their word means “like those found in caves.” Masks were generally carved from wood and were decorated with paints made from berries or other natural products. Feathers were inserted into holes carved out for extra decoration. These masks were used in ceremonies ranging from dances to praises, each with its own meaning and purpose.

The tattoos and piercings of the Aleut people demonstrated accomplishments as well as their religious views. They believed their body art would please the spirits of the animals and make any evil go away. The body orifices were believed to be pathways for the entry of evil entities. By piercing their orifices: the nose, the mouth, and ears, they would stop evil entities, "khoughkh", from entering their bodies (Osborn, 52). Body art also enhanced their beauty, social status, and spiritual authority.

Before the 19th century, piercings and tattoos were very common among the Aleut people, especially among women. Piercings, such as the nose pin, were common among both men and women and were usually performed a few days after birth. The ornament was made of various materials, a piece of bark or bone, or an eagle’s feather shaft. From time to time, adult women decorated the nose pins by hanging pieces of amber and coral from strings on it; the semi-precious objects dangled down to their chins.

Piercing ears was also very common. The Aleuts pierced holes around the rim of their ears with dentalium shells (tooth shells or tusk shells), bone, feathers, dried bird wings or skulls and/or amber. Materials associated with birds were important, as birds were considered to defend animals in the spirit world. A male would wear sea lion whiskers in his ears as a trophy of his expertise as a hunter. Worn for decorative reasons, and sometimes to signify social standing, reputation, and the age of the wearer, Aleuts would pierce their lower lips with walrus ivory and wear beads or bones. The individual with the most piercings held the highest respect.

Tattooing for women began when they reached physical maturity, or menstruation, at about age 20. Men traditionally received their first tattoo after killing their first animal, another rite of passage. Sometimes tattoos signaled social class. For example, the daughter of a rich, famous ancestor or father would work hard at her tattoos to show the accomplishments of that ancestor or father. They would sew, or prick, different designs on the chin, the side of the face, or under the nose.

The Russians arrived in the Aleutian Islands in 1786 and were active there, with small trading settlements and religious missions, through the mid-19th century.

The Aleut people developed in one of the harshest climates in the world, and learned to create and protect warmth. Both men and women wore parkas that extended below the knees. The women wore the skin of seal or sea-otter, and the men wore bird skin parkas, the feathers turned in or out depending on the weather. When the men were hunting on the water, they wore waterproof parkas made from seal or sea-lion guts, or the entrails of bear, walrus, or whales. Parkas had a hood that could be cinched, as could the wrist openings, so water could not get in. Men wore breeches made from the esophageal skin of seals. Children wore parkas made of downy eagle skin with tanned bird skin caps. They called these parkas "kameikas," meaning raingear in the English language.(Aleut Corp. Web.).

Sea-lions, harbor seals, and the sea otters are the most abundant marine mammals. The men brought home the skins and prepared them by soaking them in urine and stretching them. The women undertook the sewing ("Enthnohistory:" Gross & Khera pg. 32). Preparation of the gut for clothing involved several steps. The prepared intestines were turned inside out. A bone knife was used to remove the muscle tissue and fat from the walls of the intestine. The gut was cut and stretched, and fastened to stakes to dry. It was then cut and sewn to make waterproof parkas, bags, and other receptacles (Turner, Ch. 5, pg. 70). On some hunting trips, the men would take several women with them. They would catch birds and prepare the carcasses and feathers for future use. They caught Puffins, Lunda Cirrhata, Fratercula Corniculata, Guillemots, and Cephus & Murres.

It took 40 skins of tufted puffin and 60 skins of horned puffin to make one parka. A woman would need a year for all the labor to make one parka. Each lasted two years with proper care. All parkas were decorated with bird feathers, beard bristles of seal and sea-lion, beaks of sea parrots, bird claws, sea otter fur, dyed leather, and caribou hair sewn in the seams. (Gross & Khera, pg. 34).

Women made needles from the wingbones of seabirds. They made thread from the sinews of different animals and fish guts. A thin strip of seal intestine could also be used, twisted to form a thread. The women grew their thumbnail extra long and sharpened it. They could split threads to make them as fine as a hair. They used vermilion paint, hematite, the ink bag of the octopus, and the root of a kind of grass or vine to color the threads.

The interior regions of the rough, mountainous Aleutian Islands provided little in terms of natural resources for the Aleutian people. They collected stones for weapons, tools, stoves or lamps. They collected and dried grasses for their woven baskets. For everything else, the Aleuts had learned to use the fish and mammals they caught and processed to satisfy their needs.

In order to hunt sea mammals and to travel between islands, the Aleuts became experts of sailing and navigation. While hunting, they used small watercraft called "<a href="Aleutian%20kayak">baidarkas</a>." For regular travel, they used their large baidaras. 
The baidara was a large, open, walrus-skin-covered boat. Aleut families used it when traveling among the islands. It was also used to transport goods for trade, and warriors took them to battle.

The baidarka (small skin boat) was a small boat covered in sea lion skin. It was developed and used for hunting because of its sturdiness and maneuverability. The Aleut baidarka resembles that of a <a href="Yupik%20peoples">Yup'ik</a> <a href="kayak">kayak</a>, but it is hydrodynamically sleeker and faster. They made the baidarka for one or two persons only. The deck was made with a sturdy chamber, the sides of the craft were nearly vertical and the bottom was rounded. Most one-man baidarkas were about feet long and wide, whereas a two-man was on average about long and wide. It was from the baidarka that Aleut men would stand on the water to hunt from the sea.

The Aleuts hunted small sea mammals with barbed darts and harpoons slung from throwing boards. These boards gave precision as well as some extra distance to these weapons.

Harpoons were also called throwing-arrows when the pointed head fit loosely into the socket of the foreshaft and the head was able to detach from the harpoon when it penetrated an animal, and remain in the wound. There were three main kinds of harpoon that the Aleut’s used: a simple harpoon, with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a compound (toggle-head) harpoon in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the throwing-lance used to kill large animals.

The simple Aleut harpoon consisted of four main parts: the wooden shaft, the bone foreshaft, and the bonehead (tip) with barbs pointed backward. The barbed head was loosely fitted into the socket of the foreshaft so that when the animal was stabbed, it pulled the head away from the rest of the harpoon. The sharp barbs penetrated with ease, but could not be pulled out. The bone tip is fastened to a length of braided twine meanwhile; the hunter held the other end of the twine in his hand.

The compound harpoon was the most prevalent weapon of the Aleut people. Also known as the toggle-head spear, it was about the same size as the simple harpoon and used to hunt the same animals, however, this harpoon provided a more efficient and lethal weapon. This harpoon separated into four parts. The longest part was the shaft with the thicker stalk closer to the tip of the harpoon. The shaft was fitted into the socket of the fore shaft and a bone ring was then placed over the joint to hold the two pieces together, as well as, protecting the wooden shaft from splitting. Connected to the fore shaft of the harpoon is the toggle head spear tip. This tip was made of two sub shafts that break apart on impact with an animal. The upper sub shaft held the razor stone head and attached to the lower sub shaft with a small braided twine loop. Once the tip penetrates the animal the upper sub head broke off from the rest of the shaft, however, since it was still connected with the braided loop it rotated the head into a horizontal position inside the animal’s body so that it could not get away from the hunter.

The throwing lance may be distinguished from a harpoon because of the fact that all its pieces are fixed and immovable. A lance was a weapon of war and it was also used to kill large marine animals after it has already been harpooned. The throwing lance usually consisted of three parts: a wooden shaft, a bone ring or belt, and the compound head that was made with a barbed bonehead and a stone tip. The length of the compound head was equivalent to the distance between the planes of a man’s chest to his back. The lance would penetrate the chest and pass through the chest cavity and exit from the back. The bone ring was designed to break after impact so that the shaft could be used again for another kill.

They buried their dead ancestors near the village.
<a href="Archeologists">Archeologists</a> have found many different types of burials, dating from a variety of periods, in the Aleutian Islands. The Aleut developed a style of burials that were accommodated to local conditions, and honored the dead. They have had four main types of burials: "umqan", cave, above-ground sarcophagi, and burials connected to communal houses.

Umqan burials are the most widely known type of mortuary practice found in the Aleutian Islands. The people created burial mounds, that tend to be located on the edge of a bluff. They placed stone and earth over the mound to protect and mark it. Such mounds were first excavated by archeologists in 1972 on Southwestern Unmak Island, and dated to the early contact period. Researchers have found a prevalence of these umqan burials, and concluded it is a regional mortuary practice. It may be considered a pan-Aleutian mortuary practice.

Cave burials have been found throughout the Eastern Aleutian Islands. The human remains are buried in shallow graves at the rear of the cave. These caves tend to be located next to <a href="middens">middens</a> and near villages. Some <a href="grave%20goods">grave goods</a> have been found in the caves associated with such burials. For example, a deconstructed boat was found in a burial cave on Kanaga Island. There were no other major finds of grave goods in the vicinity.

Throughout the Aleutian Islands, gravesites have been found that are above-ground <a href="sarcophagi">sarcophagi</a>. These sarcophagi are left exposed, with no attempt to bury the dead in the ground. These burials tend to be isolated and limited to the remains of adult males, which may indicate a specific ritual practice. In the Near Islands, isolated graves have also been found with the remains, and not just the sarcophagus, left exposed on the surface. This way of erecting sarcophagi above ground is not as common as umqan and cave burials, but it is still widespread.

Another type of practice has been to bury remains in areas next to the communal houses of the settlement. Human remains are abundant in such sites. They indicate a pattern of burying the dead within the main activity areas of the settlement. These burials consist of small pits adjacent to the houses and scattered around them. In these instances, mass graves are common for women and children. This type of mortuary practice has been mainly found in the Near Islands.

In addition to these four main types, other kinds of burials have been found in the Aleutian Islands. These more isolated examples include <a href="mummification">mummification</a>, private burial houses, abandoned houses, etc. To date, such examples are not considered to be part of a larger, unifying tradition. The findings discussed represent only the sites that have been excavated.

The variety of mortuary practices mostly did not included the ritual of including extensive grave goods, as has been found in other cultures. The remains so far have been mainly found with other human and faunal remains. The addition of objects to "accompany" the dead is rare. Archaeologists have been trying to dissect the absence of a great tradition of grave goods, but findings have been ambiguous and do not really help the academic community to understand these practices more.

Not much information is known about the ritual parts of burying the dead. Archeologists and anthropologists have not found much evidence related to burial rituals. This lack of ritual evidence could hint at either no ritualized ceremony, or one that has not yet been revealed in the archaeological record. As a result, archaeologists cannot decipher the context to understand exactly why a certain type of burial was used in particular cases.

<doc id="3035" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3035" title="Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act">
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act

The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was signed into law by <a href="U.S.%20President">President</a> <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> on December 18, 1971, constituting at the time the largest land claims settlement in <a href="United%20States%20history">United States history</a>. ANCSA was intended to resolve long-standing issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska, as well as to stimulate economic development throughout <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. 

The settlement established <a href="Alaska%20Native">Alaska Native</a> claims to the land by transferring titles to twelve <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Regional%20Corporations">Alaska Native regional corporations</a> and over 200 local village corporations. A thirteenth regional corporation was later created for Alaska Natives who no longer resided in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. The act is codified as 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.

When Alaska became a state in 1959, section 4 of the <a href="Alaska%20Statehood%20Act">Alaska Statehood Act</a> provided that any existing Alaska Native land claims would be unaffected by statehood and held in status quo. Yet while section 4 of the act preserved Native land claims until later settlement, section 6 allowed for the state government to claim lands deemed vacant. Section 6 granted the state of Alaska the right to select lands then in the hands of the federal government, with the exception of Native territory. As a result, nearly from the public domain would eventually be transferred to the state. The state government also attempted to acquire lands under section 6 of the Statehood Act that were subject to Native claims under section 4, and that were currently occupied and used by Alaska Natives. The federal <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> began to process the Alaska government's selections without taking into account the Native claims and without informing the affected Native groups.

It was against this backdrop that the original language for a land claims settlement was developed. 

A 9.2-magnitude <a href="1964%20Alaska%20earthquake">earthquake</a> struck the state in 1964. Recovery efforts drew the attention of the federal government, which found that Alaska Natives had the poorest living conditions in the country. The Federal Field Committee for Development Planning in Alaska decided that Natives should receive $100 million and the 10% revenue royalty. Nothing was done with this proposal, however, and a freeze on land transfers remained in effect. 

In 1968, Governor <a href="Walter%20Hickel">Walter Hickel</a> summoned a group of Native leaders to work out a settlement that would be satisfactory to Natives. The group met for ten days and asked for $20 million in exchange for requested lands. They also asked for 10% of federal mineral lease revenue.

In 1969 President Nixon appointed Hickel as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>. The Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) protested against Hickel’s nomination, but he was eventually confirmed.

Hickel worked with the AFN, negotiating with Native leaders and state government over the disputed lands. Offers went back and forth, with each rejecting the other’s proposals. The AFN wanted rights to land, while then Governor <a href="Keith%20Harvey%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> believed Natives did not have legitimate claims to state land in light of the provisions of the <a href="Alaska%20Statehood%20Act">Alaska Statehood Act</a>. 

But a succeeding Alaska state administration under Governor William A. Egan would stake out positions upon which the AFN and other stakeholders could largely agree. Native leaders, in addition to the Alaska's congressional delegation and the state's newly elected Governor <a href="William%20A.%20Egan">William A. Egan</a>, eventually reached the basis for presenting an agreement to Congress. The proposed settlement terms faced challenges in both houses but found a strong ally in Senator <a href="Henry%20M.%20Jackson">Henry M. Jackson</a> from <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington state</a>. The most controversial issues that continued to hold up approval were methods for determining land selection by Alaska Natives and financial distribution.

In 1968, the <a href="ARCO">Atlantic-Richfield Company</a> discovered oil at <a href="Prudhoe%20Bay%20Oil%20Field">Prudhoe Bay</a> on the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic</a> coast, catapulting the issue of <a href="land%20ownership">land ownership</a> into headlines. In order to lessen the difficulty of drilling at such a remote location and transporting the oil to the <a href="lower%2048%20states">lower 48 states</a>, the oil companies proposed building a pipeline to carry the oil across Alaska to the port of <a href="Valdez%2C%20Alaska">Valdez</a> At Valdez, the oil would be loaded onto tankers and shipped to the contiguous states. The plan had been approved, but a permit to construct the pipeline, which would cross lands involved in the land claims dispute, could not be granted until the Native claims were settled.

With major petroleum dollars on the line, pressure mounted to achieve a definitive legislative resolution at the federal level. In 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was signed into law by President Nixon. It abrogated Native claims to aboriginal lands except those that are the subject of the law. In return, Natives received up to of land and were paid $963 million. The land and money were to be divided among regional, urban, and village tribal corporations established under the law, often recognizing existing leadership.

In 1971, barely one million acres of land in Alaska was in private hands. ANCSA, together with section 6 of <a href="Alaska%20Statehood%20Act">Alaska Statehood Act</a>, which the new act allowed to come to fruition, affected ownership to about of land in Alaska once wholly controlled by the federal government. That is larger by than the combined areas of <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>.

When the bill passed in 1971, it included provisions that had never before been attempted in previous United States settlements with Native Americans. The newly passed Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act created twelve Native regional economic development corporations. Each corporation was associated with a specific region of Alaska and the Natives who had traditionally lived there. This innovative approach to native settlements engaged the tribes in corporate capitalism. 

The idea originated with the AFN, who believed that the Natives would have to become a part of the capitalist system in order to survive. As stockholders in these corporations, the Natives could earn some income and stay in their traditional villages. If the corporations were managed properly, they could make profits that would enable individuals to stay, rather than having to leave Native villages to find better work. This was intended to help preserve Native culture.

Alaska Natives had three years from passage of ANCSA to make land selections of the granted under the act. In some cases Native corporations received outside aid in surveying the land. For instance, <a href="Doyon%2C%20Limited">Doyon, Limited</a> (one of the 13 <a href="Alaska%20native%20corporation">regional corporations</a>) was helped by the Geophysical Institute of the <a href="University%20of%20Alaska">University of Alaska</a>. The Institute determined which land contained resources such as minerals and coal. <a href="NASA">NASA</a> similarly provided satellite imagery to aid in Native corporations finding areas most suited for vegetation and their traditional subsistence culture. The imagery showed locations of caribou and moose, as well as forests with marketable timber. In total about were analyzed for Doyon. Natives were able to choose tens of thousands of acres of land rich with timber while Doyon used mineral analysis to attract businesses.

The state of Alaska to date has been granted approximately 85% or of the land claims it has made under ANCSA. The state is entitled to a total of under the terms of the Statehood Act. Originally the state had 25 years after passage of the <a href="Alaska%20Statehood%20Act">Alaska Statehood Act</a> to file claims under section 6 of the act with the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> (BLM). Amendments to ANCSA extended that deadline until 1994, with the expectation that BLM would complete processing of land transfers subject to overlapping Native claims by 2009. Nonetheless, some Native and state selections under ANCSA remained unresolved as late as December 2014.

There was largely positive reaction to ANCSA, although not entirely. The act was supported by Natives as well as non-Natives, and likewise enjoyed bipartisan support. Natives were heavily involved in the legislative process, and the final draft of the act used many AFN ideas. 

Some Natives have argued that ANCSA has hastened cultural genocide of Alaska Natives. Some Natives critiqued ANCSA as an illegitimate treaty since only tribal leaders were involved and the provisions of the act were not voted on by indigenous populations. One native described it as a social and political experiment. Critics have also argued that Natives so feared massacre or incarceration that they offered no resistance to the act. 

Others have argued that the settlement was arguably the most generous afforded by the United States to a Native group. They note that some of the largest and most profitable corporations in the state are the twelve created by ANCSA. Other critics attacked the act as "Native welfare" and such complaints continue to be expressed. 

The corporation system has been critiqued, as in some cases stockholders have sold land to outside corporations that have leveled forests and extracted minerals. But supporters of the system argue that it has provided economic benefits for indigenous peoples that outweigh these problems.


The following thirteen regional corporations were created under ANCSA:

Additionally, most regions and some villages have created their own nonprofits providing social services and health care through grant funding and federal compacts. The objectives of these nonprofits are varied, but focus generally on cultural and educational activities. These include scholarships for Native students, sponsorship of cultural and artistic events, preservation efforts for Native languages, and protection of sites with historic or religious importance.

ANCSA created about 224 village and urban corporations. Below is a representative list of village and urban corporations created under ANCSA:

Adoptionism

Adoptionism, sometimes called <a href="monarchianism">dynamic monarchianism</a>, is a <a href="nontrinitarian">nontrinitarian</a> <a href="Christian%20theology">theological doctrine</a> which holds that <a href="Jesus%20in%20Christianity">Jesus</a> was adopted as the <a href="Son%20of%20God%20%28Christianity%29">Son of God</a> at his <a href="Baptism%20of%20Jesus">baptism</a>, his <a href="resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a>, or his <a href="ascension%20of%20Jesus">ascension</a>. According to <a href="Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis">Epiphanius</a>'s account of the <a href="Ebionites">Ebionites</a>, the group believed that Jesus was chosen on account of his <a href="sinless">sinless</a> devotion to the <a href="will%20of%20God">will of God</a>.

Adoptionism was declared <a href="Heresy%20in%20Christianity">heresy</a> at the end of the 2nd century and was rejected by the <a href="Synods%20of%20Antioch">Synods of Antioch</a> and the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>, which defined the <a href="Orthodoxy">orthodox doctrine</a> of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> and identified the man Jesus with the eternally begotten Son or <a href="Logos%20%28Christianity%29">Word of God</a> in the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a>.

<a href="Bart%20D.%20Ehrman">Bart D. Ehrman</a> suggests in "The Orthodox Corruption of the Scripture" that Adoptionist theology may date back almost to the <a href="Cultural%20and%20historical%20background%20of%20Jesus">time of Jesus</a>.

The <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Gospel of Mark</a> is believed by most <a href="Historical%20criticism">modern scholars</a> to be the first of the four <a href="Biblical%20canon">canonical</a> <a href="gospel">gospel</a>s to have been written, dating from the time of the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28AD%2070%29">fall of Jerusalem</a> in AD 70. Mark gives prominent mention to the destruction of the <a href="Second%20Temple">Second Temple</a> and appears to have provided source material for <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Matthew</a> and <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Luke</a>. Many details found in later writings do not appear in the earliest manuscripts of Mark, including the phrase "Son of God" at . Ehrman notes that this places the first use of the title "Son of God" for Jesus at his baptism, suggesting that Mark's gospel may reflect early Adoptionist views. The words "Today I have begotten you" are omitted from Mark, however; it is therefore generally believed to have less Adoptionist tendencies than the lost, non-canonical <a href="Gospel%20of%20the%20Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a>.

Adoptionist theology may also be reflected in canonical <a href="epistle">epistle</a>s, the earliest of which pre-date the writing of the gospels. The letters of <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a>, for example, do not mention a <a href="virgin%20birth%20of%20Christ">virgin birth of Christ</a>. Paul describes Jesus as "born of a woman, born under the <a href="Law%20of%20Moses">law</a>" and "as to his <a href="human%20nature">human nature</a> was a descendant of David" in the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Galatians">Epistle to the Galatians</a> and the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a>. Many interpreters, however, take his statements in <a href="Philippians%202">Philippians 2</a> to imply that Paul believed Jesus to have existed as equal to God before his <a href="Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29">incarnation</a>. The <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Hebrews">pageRank.Book of Hebrews</a>, a contemporary sermon by an unknown author, describes God as saying "You are my son; today I have begotten you." () The latter phrase, a quote of , could reflect an early Adoptionist view.

The first known exponent of Adoptionism in the 2nd century is <a href="Theodotus%20of%20Byzantium">Theodotus of Byzantium</a>. According to <a href="Hippolytus%20of%20Rome">Hippolytus of Rome</a> ("<a href="Philosophumena">Philosophumena</a>", VII, xxiii) Theodotus taught that Jesus was a man born of a virgin, according to the Council of Jerusalem, that he lived like other men, and was most pious; but that at his baptism in the Jordan the "Christ" came down upon the man Jesus in the likeness of a dove. (Luke 3:22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. Luke 4:1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,) Therefore, wonders (Greek "dynameis") were not wrought in him until the Spirit (which Theodotus called Christ) came down and was manifested in Him. ("<a href="Philosophumena">Philosophumena</a>", VII, xxiii) The belief was declared heretical by <a href="Pope%20Victor%20I">Pope Victor I</a>.

The 2nd-century work <a href="Shepherd%20of%20Hermas">Shepherd of Hermas</a> also taught that Jesus was a virtuous man filled with the Holy Spirit and adopted as the Son. While the Shepherd of Hermas was popular and sometimes bound with the canonical scriptures, it didn't retain canonical status, if it ever had it.

In the 3rd century, <a href="Paul%20of%20Samosata">Paul of Samosata</a>, <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Antioch">Patriarch of Antioch</a>, promoted Adoptionism. He said Jesus had been a man who kept himself sinless and achieved union with God. His views, however, did not neatly fit in either of the two main forms of Monarchianism.

<a href="Spanish%20Adoptionism">Spanish Adoptionism</a> was a theological position which was articulated in <a href="Caliphate%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Umayyad</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Asturias">Christian</a>-held regions of the <a href="Iberian%20peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a> in the 8th and 9th centuries. The issue seems to have begun with the claim of archbishop <a href="Elipandus%20of%20Toledo">Elipandus of Toledo</a> that – in respect to his human nature – Christ was "adoptive" <a href="Son%20of%20God">Son of God</a>. Another leading advocate of this Christology was <a href="Felix%20of%20Urgel">Felix of Urgel</a>. In Spain, Adoptionism was opposed by <a href="Beatus%20of%20Liebana">Beatus of Liebana</a>, and in the <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> territories, the Adoptionist position was condemned by <a href="Pope%20Hadrian%20I">Pope Hadrian I</a>, <a href="Alcuin%20of%20York">Alcuin of York</a>, <a href="Agobard">Agobard</a>, and officially in Carolingian territory by the Council of Frankfurt (794).

Despite the shared name of "Adoptionism" the Spanish Adoptionist Christology appears to have differed sharply from the Adoptionism of early Christianity. Spanish advocates predicated the term "adoptivus" of Christ only in respect to his humanity; once the divine Son "emptied himself" of divinity and "took the form of a servant" (Philippians 2:7), Christ's human nature was "adopted" as divine.

Historically, many scholars have followed the Adoptionists' Carolingian opponents in labeling Spanish Adoptionism as a minor revival of “<a href="Nestorianism">Nestorian</a>” Christology. John C. Cavadini has challenged this notion by attempting to take the Spanish Christology in its own Spanish/North African context in his study, "The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785–820".

A third wave was the revived form ("Neo-Adoptionism") of <a href="Peter%20Abelard">Peter Abelard</a> in the 12th century. Later, various modified and qualified Adoptionist tenets emerged from some theologians in the 14th century. <a href="Duns%20Scotus">Duns Scotus</a> (1300) and <a href="Durandus%20of%20Saint-Pour%C3%A7ain">Durandus of Saint-Pourçain</a> (1320) admit the term "Filius adoptivus" in a qualified sense. In more recent times the Jesuit <a href="Gabriel%20V%C3%A1squez">Gabriel Vásquez</a>, and the Lutheran divines <a href="Georgius%20Calixtus">Georgius Calixtus</a> and <a href="Johann%20Ernst%20Immanuel%20Walch">Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch</a>, have defended Adoptionism as essentially orthodox.

A form of Adoptionism surfaced in <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a> during the 18th century as the <a href="Virgin%20birth%20of%20Jesus">virgin birth</a> was increasingly denied by Unitarians . In the 19th century the term <a href="Psilanthropism">Psilanthropism</a>, was applied by such as <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> who so called his own view that Jesus was the son of Joseph.

A similar form of Adoptionism was expressed in the writings of <a href="James%20Strang">James Strang</a>, a <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">Latter Day Saint</a> leader who founded the <a href="Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter%20Day%20Saints%20%28Strangite%29">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)</a> after the <a href="death%20of%20Joseph%20Smith">death of Joseph Smith</a> in 1844. In his <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20the%20Law%20of%20the%20Lord">pageRank.Book of the Law of the Lord</a>, a purported work of ancient scripture found and translated by Strang, he offers an essay entitled "Note on the Sacrifice of Christ" in which he explains his unique (for Mormonism as a whole) doctrines on the subject. Jesus Christ, said Strang, was the natural-born son of <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Mary</a> and <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Joseph</a>, who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind, but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents (rather than being begotten by the Father or the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>) to be able to truly fulfill his Messianic role. Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence "adopted" as God's son at birth, and fully revealed as such during the <a href="Transfiguration%20of%20Jesus">Transfiguration</a>. After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his <a href="Resurrection%20appearances%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a> and <a href="Ascension%20of%20Jesus%20Christ">ascension</a>.

Adoptionism is one of two main forms of <a href="monarchianism">monarchianism</a> (the other is <a href="modalism">modalism</a>, which regards "Father" and "Son" as two historical or <a href="soteriology">soteriological</a> roles of a single divine Person). Adoptionism (also known as <a href="dynamic%20monarchianism">dynamic monarchianism</a>) denies the eternal <a href="pre-existence%20of%20Christ">pre-existence of Christ</a>, and although it explicitly affirms his deity subsequent to events in his life, many classical <a href="Trinity">trinitarians</a> claim that the doctrine implicitly denies it by denying the constant hypostatic union of the eternal Logos to the human nature of Jesus. Under Adoptionism Jesus is currently divine and has been since his adoption, although he is not equal to the Father, per "my Father is greater than I" (). and as such is a kind of <a href="subordinationism">subordinationism</a>.

Adoptionism was one position in a long series of Christian disagreements about the precise nature of Christ (see <a href="Christology">Christology</a>) in the developing dogma of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>, an attempt to explain the relationship between Jesus of Nazareth, both as man and God, and God the Father while confidently claiming to be uncompromisingly <a href="monotheism">monotheistic</a>. It differs significantly from the doctrine of the Trinity that was later affirmed by the <a href="ecumenical%20council">ecumenical council</a>s.

Some scholars see Adoptionist concepts in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Gospel of Mark</a> and in the writings of the <a href="Apostle%20Paul">Apostle Paul</a>. According to this view, though Mark has Jesus as the Son of God, references occurring at the strategic points in 1:1 ("The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God", but not in all versions, see <a href="Mark%201">Mark 1</a>), 5:7 ("What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?") and 15:39 ("Surely this man was the Son of God!"), the concept of the <a href="Virgin%20Birth%20of%20Jesus">Virgin Birth of Jesus</a> had not been developed or elucidated at the time of the writing of this early Christian text. By the time the Gospels of <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Luke</a> and <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Matthew</a> were written, Jesus is identified as being the Son of God from the time of birth. Finally, the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a> portrays him as the pre-existent Word () <a href="Pre-existence%20of%20Christ">as existing "in the beginning"</a>.

Apollinarism

Apollinarism or Apollinarianism was a view proposed by <a href="Apollinaris%20of%20Laodicea">Apollinaris of Laodicea</a> (died 390) that <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> could not have had a human mind; rather, Jesus had a <a href="human">human</a> body and lower soul (the seat of the emotions) but a <a href="God">divine</a> mind. 

The <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> had been recognized at the Council of Nicea in 325, but debate about exactly what it meant continued. A rival to the more common belief that Jesus Christ had two natures was <a href="monophysitism">monophysitism</a> ("one nature"), the doctrine that Christ had only one nature. Apollinarism and <a href="Eutychianism">Eutychianism</a> were two forms of monophysitism. Apollinaris' rejection that Christ had a human mind was considered an over-reaction to <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a> and its teaching that Christ was not divine.

<a href="Theodoret">Theodoret</a> charged Apollinaris with confounding the persons of the <a href="Godhead%20%28Christianity%29">Godhead</a> and with giving in to the heretical ways of <a href="Sabellius">Sabellius</a>. <a href="Basil%20of%20Caesarea">Basil of Caesarea</a> accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense. His views were condemned in a <a href="Synod">Synod</a> at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, under <a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius of Alexandria</a>, in 362, and later subdivided into several different heresies, the main ones of which were the <a href="Polemian">Polemian</a>s and the <a href="Antidicomarianite">Antidicomarianite</a>s.

It was declared to be a <a href="Christian%20heresy">heresy</a> in 381 by the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">First Council of Constantinople</a>, since Christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully God. Followers of Apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a <a href="tertium%20quid">tertium quid</a> ("third thing," neither God nor man).

Apollinaris further taught, following <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a>, that the <a href="Soul%20%28spirit%29">soul</a>s of men were propagated by other souls, as well as their bodies (see <a href="traducianism">traducianism</a>). 

Christian philosopher <a href="William%20Lane%20Craig">William Lane Craig</a> has proposed a neo-Apollinarian Christology in which the divine Logos completes the human nature of Christ. Craig says his proposal is tentative and he welcomes critique and interaction from other scholars.

<doc id="3038" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3038" title="Acid–base reaction">
Acid–base reaction

An acid–base reaction is a <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a> that occurs between an <a href="acid">acid</a> and a <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a>. Several <a href="theory">theoretical</a> frameworks provide alternative conceptions of the reaction mechanisms and their application in solving related problems; these are called the acid–base theories, for example, <a href="Br%C3%B8nsted%E2%80%93Lowry%20acid%E2%80%93base%20theory">Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory</a>. Their importance becomes apparent in analyzing acid–base reactions for gaseous or liquid species, or when acid or base character may be somewhat less apparent. The first of these concepts was provided by the French <a href="chemist">chemist</a> <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>, around 1776.

The first scientific concept of acids and bases was provided by <a href="Lavoisier">Lavoisier</a> in around 1776. Since Lavoisier's knowledge of <a href="strong%20acid">strong acid</a>s was mainly restricted to <a href="oxoacid">oxoacid</a>s, such as (nitric acid) and (sulfuric acid), which tend to contain central atoms in high <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>s surrounded by oxygen, and since he was not aware of the true composition of the <a href="hydrogen%20halide">hydrohalic acids</a> (<a href="hydrogen%20fluoride">HF</a>, <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">HCl</a>, <a href="hydrogen%20bromide">HBr</a>, and <a href="hydrogen%20iodide">HI</a>), he defined acids in terms of their containing "<a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>", which in fact he named from Greek words meaning "acid-former" (from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> οξυς ("oxys") meaning "acid" or "sharp" and γεινομαι ("geinomai") meaning "engender"). The Lavoisier definition was held as absolute truth for over 30 years, until the 1810 article and subsequent lectures by <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Sir Humphry Davy</a> in which he proved the lack of oxygen in , <a href="hydrogen%20telluride">HTe</a>, and the <a href="hydrohalic%20acids">hydrohalic acids</a>. However, Davy failed to develop a new theory, concluding that "acidity does not depend upon any particular elementary substance, but upon peculiar arrangement of various substances". One notable modification of oxygen theory was provided by <a href="Berzelius">Berzelius</a>, who stated that acids are oxides of nonmetals while bases are oxides of metals.

In 1838, <a href="Justus%20von%20Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a> proposed that an acid is a hydrogen-containing substance in which the hydrogen could be replaced by a metal. This redefinition was based on his extensive work on the chemical composition of <a href="organic%20acid">organic acid</a>s, finishing the doctrinal shift from oxygen-based acids to hydrogen-based acids started by Davy. Liebig's definition, while completely empirical, remained in use for almost 50 years until the adoption of the Arrhenius definition.

The first modern definition of acids and bases in molecular terms was devised by <a href="Svante%20Arrhenius">Svante Arrhenius</a>. A hydrogen theory of acids, it followed from his 1884 work with <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Ostwald">Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald</a> in establishing the presence of ions in <a href="aqueous%20solution">aqueous solution</a> and led to Arrhenius receiving the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> in 1903.

As defined by Arrhenius:

This causes the <a href="protonation">protonation</a> of water, or the creation of the <a href="hydronium">hydronium</a> (HO) ion. Thus, in modern times, the symbol H is interpreted as a shorthand for HO, because it is now known that a bare proton does not exist as a free species in aqueous solution.
The Arrhenius definitions of <a href="acidity">acidity</a> and <a href="alkalinity">alkalinity</a> are restricted to aqueous solutions, and refer to the concentration of the solvent ions. Under this definition, pure HSO and HCl dissolved in toluene are not acidic, and molten NaOH and solutions of calcium amide in liquid ammonia are not alkaline.

Overall, to qualify as an Arrhenius acid, upon the introduction to water, the chemical must either cause, directly or otherwise:

Conversely, to qualify as an Arrhenius base, upon the introduction to water, the chemical must either cause, directly or otherwise:

The reaction of an acid with a base is called a <a href="neutralization%20%28chemistry%29">neutralization</a> reaction. The products of this reaction are a <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a> and water.

In this traditional representation an acid–base neutralization reaction is formulated as a <a href="salt%20metathesis%20reaction">double-replacement reaction</a>. For example, the reaction of <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, HCl, with <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a>, NaOH, solutions produces a solution of <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>, NaCl, and some additional water molecules.

The modifier (aq) in this equation was implied by Arrhenius, rather than included explicitly. It indicates that the substances are dissolved in water. Though all three substances, HCl, NaOH and NaCl are capable of existing as pure compounds, in aqueous solutions they are fully dissociated into the aquated ions H, Cl, Na and OH.

The Brønsted–Lowry definition, formulated in 1923, independently by <a href="Johannes%20Nicolaus%20Br%C3%B8nsted">Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted</a> in Denmark and <a href="Martin%20Lowry">Martin Lowry</a> in England, is based upon the idea of <a href="protonation">protonation</a> of bases through the <a href="deprotonation">de-protonation</a> of acids – that is, the ability of acids to "donate" hydrogen ions (H)—otherwise known as <a href="proton">proton</a>s—to bases, which "accept" them.

An acid–base reaction is, thus, the removal of a hydrogen ion from the acid and its addition to the base. The removal of a hydrogen ion from an acid produces its "<a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate base</a>", which is the acid with a hydrogen ion removed. The reception of a proton by a base produces its "<a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate acid</a>", which is the base with a hydrogen ion added.

Unlike the previous definitions, the Brønsted–Lowry definition does not refer to the formation of salt and solvent, but instead to the formation of "conjugate acids" and "conjugate bases", produced by the transfer of a proton from the acid to the base. In this approach, acids and bases are fundamentally different in behavior from salts, which are seen as electrolytes, subject to the theories of <a href="Peter%20Debye">Debye</a>, <a href="Lars%20Onsager">Onsager</a>, and others. An acid and a base react not to produce a salt and a solvent, but to form a new acid and a new base. The concept of neutralization is thus absent. Brønsted–Lowry acid–base behavior is formally independent of any solvent, making it more all-encompassing than the Arrhenius model.

The general formula for acid–base reactions according to the Brønsted–Lowry definition is:
where HA represents the acid, B represents the base, BH represents the conjugate acid of B, and A represents the conjugate base of HA.

For example, a Brønsted-Lowry model for the dissociation of <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> (HCl) in aqueous solution would be the following:

The removal of H from the HCl produces the <a href="chloride">chloride</a> ion, Cl, the conjugate base of the acid. The addition of H to the HO (acting as a base) forms the <a href="hydronium">hydronium</a> ion, HO, the conjugate acid of the base.

Water is <a href="amphoterism">amphoteric</a>—that is, it can act as both an acid and a base. The Brønsted-Lowry model explains this, showing the dissociation of water into low concentrations of hydronium and <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a> ions:

This equation is demonstrated in the image below:
Here, one molecule of water acts as an acid, donating an H and forming the conjugate base, OH, and a second molecule of water acts as a base, accepting the H ion and forming the conjugate acid, HO.

As an example of water acting as an acid, consider an aqueous solution of <a href="pyridine">pyridine</a>, CHN.

In this example, a water molecule is split into a hydrogen ion, which is donated to a pyridine molecule, and an hydroxide ion.

In the Brønsted-Lowry model, the solvent does not necessarily have to be water. For example, consider what happens when <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a>, CHCOOH, dissolves in <a href="liquid%20ammonia">liquid ammonia</a>.

An H ion is removed from acetic acid, forming its conjugate base, the <a href="acetate">acetate</a> ion, CHCOO. The addition of an H ion to an ammonia molecule of the solvent creates its conjugate acid, the ammonium ion, NH.

The Brønsted–Lowry model calls hydrogen-containing substances (like HCl) acids. Thus, some substances, which many chemists considered to be acids, such as SO or BCl, are excluded from this classification due to lack of hydrogen. <a href="Gilbert%20N.%20Lewis">Gilbert N. Lewis</a> wrote in 1938, "To restrict the group of acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizing agent</a> to substances containing <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>." Furthermore, KOH and KNH are not considered Brønsted bases, but rather salts containing the bases OH and NH.

The hydrogen requirement of Arrhenius and Brønsted–Lowry was removed by the Lewis definition of acid–base reactions, devised by <a href="Gilbert%20N.%20Lewis">Gilbert N. Lewis</a> in 1923, in the same year as Brønsted–Lowry, but it was not elaborated by him until 1938. Instead of defining acid–base reactions in terms of protons or other bonded substances, the Lewis definition defines a base (referred to as a "Lewis base") to be a compound that can donate an "<a href="electron%20pair">electron pair</a>", and an acid (a "Lewis acid") to be a compound that can receive this electron pair.

For example, <a href="boron%20trifluoride">boron trifluoride</a>, BF is a typical Lewis acid. It can accept a pair of electrons as it has a vacancy in its <a href="octet%20rule">octet</a>. The <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> ion has a full octet and can donate a pair of electrons. Thus
is a typical Lewis acid, Lewis base reaction. All compounds of <a href="boron%20group">group 13</a> elements with a formula AX can behave as Lewis acids. Similarly, compounds of <a href="group%2015">group 15</a> elements with a formula DY, such as <a href="amine">amine</a>s, NR, and <a href="phosphine">phosphine</a>s, PR, can behave as Lewis bases. Adducts between them have the formula XA←DY with a <a href="dative%20covalent%20bond">dative covalent bond</a>, shown symbolically as ←, between the atoms A (acceptor) and D (donor). Compounds of <a href="group%2016">group 16</a> with a formula DX may also act as Lewis bases; in this way, a compound like an <a href="ether">ether</a>, RO, or a <a href="thioether">thioether</a>, RS, can act as a Lewis base. The Lewis definition is not limited to these examples. For instance, <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> acts as a Lewis base when it forms an adduct with boron trifluoride, of formula FB←CO

Adducts involving metal ions are referred to as co-ordination compounds; each ligand donates a pair of electrons to the metal ion. The reaction
can be seen as an acid–base reaction in which a stronger base (ammonia) replaces a weaker one (water)

The Lewis and Brønsted–Lowry definitions are consistent with each other since the reaction
is an acid–base reaction in both theories.

One of the limitations of the Arrhenius definition is its reliance on water solutions. <a href="Edward%20Curtis%20Franklin">Edward Curtis Franklin</a> studied the acid–base reactions in liquid ammonia in 1905 and pointed out the similarities to the water-based Arrhenius theory. <a href="Albert%20Fredrick%20Ottomar%20Germann">Albert F. O. Germann</a>, working with liquid <a href="phosgene">phosgene</a>, , formulated the solvent-based theory in 1925, thereby generalizing the Arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents.

Germann pointed out that in many solutions, there are ions in equilibrium with the neutral solvent molecules:

For example, water and <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> undergo such dissociation into <a href="hydronium">hydronium</a> and <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a>, and <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> and <a href="metal%20amides%23Alkali%20metal%20amides">amide</a>, respectively:

Some aprotic systems also undergo such dissociation, such as <a href="dinitrogen%20tetroxide">dinitrogen tetroxide</a> into <a href="nitrosonium">nitrosonium</a> and <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>, <a href="antimony%20trichloride">antimony trichloride</a> into dichloroantimonium and tetrachloroantimonate, and phosgene into chlorocarboxonium and <a href="chloride">chloride</a>:

A solute that causes an increase in the concentration of the solvonium ions and a decrease in the concentration of solvate ions is defined as an "acid". A solute that causes an increase in the concentration of the solvate ions and a decrease in the concentration of the solvonium ions is defined as a "base".

Thus, in liquid ammonia, (supplying ) is a strong base, and (supplying ) is a strong acid. In liquid <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> (), <a href="thionyl">thionyl</a> compounds (supplying ) behave as acids, and <a href="sulfites">sulfites</a> (supplying ) behave as bases.

The non-aqueous acid–base reactions in liquid ammonia are similar to the reactions in water:

Nitric acid can be a base in liquid sulfuric acid:
The unique strength of this definition shows in describing the reactions in aprotic solvents; for example, in liquid :

Because the solvent system definition depends on the solute as well as on the solvent itself, a particular solute can be either an acid or a base depending on the choice of the solvent: is a strong acid in water, a weak acid in acetic acid, and a weak base in fluorosulfonic acid; this characteristic of the theory has been seen as both a strength and a weakness, because some substances (such as and ) have been seen to be acidic or basic on their own right. On the other hand, solvent system theory has been criticized as being too general to be useful. Also, it has been thought that there is something intrinsically acidic about hydrogen compounds, a property not shared by non-hydrogenic solvonium salts.

This acid–base theory was a revival of oxygen theory of acids and bases, proposed by German chemist <a href="Hermann%20Lux">Hermann Lux</a> in 1939, further improved by <a href="H%C3%A5kon%20Flood">Håkon Flood</a> circa 1947 and is still used in modern <a href="geochemistry">geochemistry</a> and <a href="electrochemistry">electrochemistry</a> of <a href="molten%20salt">molten salt</a>s. This definition describes an acid as an oxide ion () acceptor and a base as an oxide ion donor. For example:

This theory is also useful in the systematisation of the reactions of <a href="noble%20gas%20compound">noble gas compound</a>s, especially the xenon oxides, fluorides, and oxofluorides.

<a href="Mikhail%20Usanovich">Mikhail Usanovich</a> developed a general theory that does not restrict acidity to hydrogen-containing compounds, but his approach, published in 1938, was even more general than Lewis theory. Usanovich's theory can be summarized as defining an acid as anything that accepts negative species or donates positive ones, and a base as the reverse. This defined the concept of <a href="redox">redox</a> (oxidation-reduction) as a special case of acid–base reactions

Some examples of Usanovich acid–base reactions include:

In 1963, <a href="Ralph%20Pearson">Ralph Pearson</a> proposed a qualitative concept known as the <a href="HSAB%20theory">Hard and Soft Acids and Bases principle</a>. later made quantitative with help of <a href="Robert%20Parr">Robert Parr</a> in 1984. 'Hard' applies to species that are small, have high charge states, and are weakly polarizable. 'Soft' applies to species that are large, have low charge states and are strongly polarizable. Acids and bases interact, and the most stable interactions are hard–hard and soft–soft. This theory has found use in organic and inorganic chemistry.

The ECW Model is quantitative model that describes and predicts the strength of Lewis acid base interactions, -ΔH . The model assigned E and C parameters to many Lewis acids and bases. Each acid is characterized by an E and a C. Each base is likewise characterized by its own E and C. The E and C parameters refer, respectively, to the electrostatic and covalent contributions to the strength of the bonds that the acid and base will form. The equation is

The W term represents a constant energy contribution for acid–base reaction such as the cleavage of a dimeric acid or base. The equation predicts reversal of acids and base strengths. The graphical presentations of the equation show that there is no single order of Lewis base strengths or Lewis acid strengths.

The reaction of a strong acid with a strong base is essentially a quantitative reaction. For example,

In this reaction both the sodium and chloride ions are spectators as the neutralization reaction,
does not involve them. With weak bases addition of acid is not quantitative because a solution of a weak base is a <a href="buffer%20solution">buffer solution</a>. A solution of a weak acid is also a buffer solution. When a weak acid reacts with a weak base an equilibrium mixture is produced. For example, <a href="adenine">adenine</a>, written as AH can react with a hydrogen <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> ion, .

The equilibrium constant for this reaction can be derived from the acid dissociation constants of adenine and of the dihydrogen phosphate ion.

The notation [X] signifies "concentration of X". When these two equations are combined by eliminating the hydrogen ion concentration, an expression for the equilibrium constant, "K" is obtained.

An acid–alkali reaction is a special case of an acid–base reaction, where the base used is also an <a href="alkali">alkali</a>. When an acid reacts with an alkali salt (a metal hydroxide), the product is a metal <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a> and water. Acid–alkali reactions are also <a href="neutralization%20%28chemistry%29">neutralization</a> reactions.

In general, acid–alkali reactions can be simplified to
by omitting <a href="spectator%20ion">spectator ion</a>s.

Acids are in general pure substances that contain <a href="hydron%20%28chemistry%29">hydrogen cations</a> () or cause them to be produced in solutions. Hydrochloric acid () and sulfuric acid () are common examples. In water, these break apart into ions:

The alkali breaks apart in water, yielding dissolved hydroxide ions:

Alcobaça, Portugal

Alcobaça () is a city and a municipality in <a href="Oeste%20Subregion">Oeste Subregion</a>, region <a href="Centro%20Region%2C%20Portugal">Centro</a> in Portugal, formerly included in the <a href="Estremadura%20Province%20%281936-1976%29">Estremadura Province</a>. The city grew along the valleys of the rivers Alcoa and Baça, from which it derives its name. The municipality population in 2011 was 56,693, in an area of 408.14 km². The city proper has a population of 15,800 inhabitants.

The city of Alcobaça became notable after the <a href="List%20of%20Portuguese%20monarchs">first king</a> of Portugal, <a href="Afonso%20Henriques">Afonso Henriques</a>, decided to build a church to commemorate the <a href="Conquest%20of%20Santar%C3%A9m">Conquest of Santarém</a> from the Moors in 1147. The church later evolved into the <a href="Monastery%20of%20Alcoba%C3%A7a">Monastery of Alcobaça</a>, one of the most magnificent <a href="gothic%20architecture">gothic</a> monuments in the country. In the <a href="Church%20%28building%29">church</a> are the tombs of <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Portugal">Pedro I of Portugal</a> and his murdered mistress <a href="In%C3%AAs%20de%20Castro">Inês de Castro</a>. Over the centuries this monastery played an important role in shaping <a href="Portuguese%20culture">Portuguese culture</a>.

A few kilometers to the north of Alcobaça is the <a href="Monastery%20of%20Batalha">Monastery of Batalha</a>, another gothic building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of <a href="Battle%20of%20Aljubarrota">Aljubarrota</a>. To the west of Alcobaça is the fishing village of <a href="Nazar%C3%A9%2C%20Portugal">Nazaré</a>, now a popular resort town. To the south is the city of <a href="Caldas%20da%20Rainha">Caldas da Rainha</a> and the medieval town of <a href="%C3%93bidos%2C%20Portugal">Óbidos</a>. Also to the northeast is the town of <a href="Porto%20de%20M%C3%B3s">Porto de Mós</a> with its rebuilt castle.

A town that only became notable in the 12th century when it was chosen as the future site of Portugal's largest church. In March 1147, the fledgling King Dom <a href="Afonso%20Henriques">Afonso Henriques</a>, defeated the Moors by capturing the city of <a href="Santar%C3%A9m%2C%20Portugal">Santarém</a>. As a tribute to his victory he vowed to build a magnificent home for the <a href="Cistercian">Order of Cistercians</a>. It took another 76 years before this task was completed. The <a href="monarchy">monarchy</a> continued to carry out further construction and 60 years later <a href="Dinis%20I%20of%20Portugal">King Dinis</a> built the main cloister. The <a href="Monastery">Monastery</a> was consecrated in 1262.

The church contains the tombs of <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Portugal">Pedro I of Portugal</a> and his murdered mistress <a href="In%C3%AAs%20de%20Castro">Inês de Castro</a> and with it the story of the tragic liaison between Pedro and Inês. Forced at an early age as a royal duty, he was to marry Constanza, the "<a href="Infanta">Infanta</a>" (Princess) of <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>, but died shortly after the marriage. Dom Pedro escape with his true love and later lived in the city of <a href="Coimbra">Coimbra</a>. His father, <a href="Afonso%20IV%20of%20Portugal">King Afonso IV</a>, believing that the family of Inês was a threat to his own kingdom had her murdered. Shortly after the death of his father Dom Pedro declared that he had married Inês in a prior secret ceremony in <a href="Bragan%C3%A7a%2C%20Portugal">Bragança</a>, and promptly took a gruesome revenge on the killers and exhumed her body. He presented the embalmed corpse at the court with a crown on her head and demanded that all his courtiers kneel and individually pay homage to her decomposed hand. Today, their ornate tombs face each other so that on <a href="Judgment%20Day">Judgment Day</a> his first sight would be of his beloved Inês.

During the following centuries the monks from this monastery had a major influence on the development of Portuguese culture. Notably, in 1269 they were the first to give public lessons to their flock, and later they produced the first authoritative history on Portugal in a series of books. In 1810 the invading <a href="France">French</a> pillaged the Abbey taking with them most of its most important treasures, including the noteworthy library. The items that remained were later stolen in 1834 during an anti-clerical riot and the banning of the religious Orders in Portugal.

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 13 civil parishes ("<a href="freguesia%20%28Portugal%29">freguesias</a>"):

The main feature of the city is essentially the monastery that proudly presents a long and sombre façade with 18th-century embellishments. This austerity is further emphasized in the cloisters with its apt name of "Cloister of Silence". In contrast within the Abbey is the massive kitchen with a running stream specially diverted to pass through as a supply of fresh water. The open area of the kitchen chimney is large enough to take a whole ox for roasting. The surround to the sacristy doorway is an outstanding example of <a href="Manueline">Manueline</a> decoration. In 1794, Lord Beckford visited the Abbey and commented that he found some 300 monks "living in a very splendid manner"!

A few kilometers to the north of Alcobaça is another wondrous building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of <a href="Battle%20of%20Aljubarrota">Aljubarrota</a> in 1385, when <a href="Dom%20Jo%C3%A3o%20I%20of%20Portugal">Dom João I of Portugal</a> defeated the Castilians and ensuring two hundred years of independence from the Castilian invaders. The construction of the Abbey at <a href="Batalha%2C%20Portugal">Batalha</a> commenced in 1388 and was added to by various Portuguese Kings over these next two centuries. To the east of Batalha is the world-famous location of <a href="F%C3%A1tima">Fátima</a> and a point of pilgrimage for the Roman Catholic religion due to the <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20F%C3%A1tima">vision of the Virgin Mary</a> in 1917 by three young children whilst tending their flock. To the west of Alcobaça is the well-known fishing village of <a href="Nazar%C3%A9%2C%20Portugal">Nazaré</a>. Today, the village is now a small town and a popular holiday resort with most of its past and traditions having rapidly evaporated in the course of time. A very successful Portuguese feature film was made in the early 20th century that dramatically captured the primitive and dangerous life of these fishermen. Stoutly Catholic, the inhabitants have retained some of their past as can be still seen in their own particular style of costume. To the south is <a href="Caldas%20da%20Rainha">Caldas da Rainha</a> and the quaint medieval town of <a href="%C3%93bidos%2C%20Portugal">Óbidos</a> that is an attraction for any tourists that enjoys a true glimpse of the past. Also to the south is the town of <a href="Porto%20de%20M%C3%B3s">Porto de Mós</a> with its fanciful rebuilt castle. This town borders the Nature Reserve <a href="Parque%20Natural%20das%20Serras%20de%20Aire%20e%20Candeeiros">Parque Natural das Serras de Aire e Candeeiros</a>. These 390 square kilometres of limestone-covered landscape is also known for its underground caverns. The best known being the <a href="Gruta%20de%20Moinhos%20Velhos">Grutas de Mira de Aire</a> can be visited and consists of tunnels, caverns with stalactites, stalagmites, lakes, and a music and light finale.


Alcobaça is <a href="Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities">twinned</a> with:

<doc id="3044" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3044" title="Amphisbaena">
Amphisbaena

The amphisbaena (, plural: amphisbaenae) is a <a href="mythological">mythological</a>, <a href="ant">ant</a>-eating <a href="Serpent%20%28symbolism%29">serpent</a> with a head at each end. The creature is alternatively called the amphisbaina, amphisbene, amphisboena, amphisbona, amphista, amfivena, amphivena, or anphivena (the last two being feminine), and is also known as the "Mother of Ants". Its name comes from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> words "amphis", meaning "both ways", and "bainein", meaning "to go". According to <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the amphisbaena was spawned from the blood that dripped from the <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a>'s head as <a href="Perseus">Perseus</a> flew over the <a href="Libyan%20Desert">Libyan Desert</a> with it in his hand, after which <a href="Cato%20the%20Younger">Cato</a>'s army then encountered it along with other serpents on the march. Amphisbaena fed off of the corpses left behind. The amphisbaena has been referred to by various <a href="poet">poet</a>s such as <a href="Nicander">Nicander</a>, <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>, <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>, <a href="A.%20E.%20Housman">A. E. Housman</a> and <a href="Allen%20Mandelbaum">Allen Mandelbaum</a>; as a mythological and legendary creature, it has been referenced by <a href="Lucan%20%28poet%29">Lucan</a>, <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20Browne">Thomas Browne</a>, the last of whom debunked its existence.

This early description of the amphisbaena depicts a venomous, dual-headed snakelike creature. However, <a href="Medieval">Medieval</a> and later drawings often show it with two or more scaled feet, particularly chicken feet, and feathered wings. Some even depict it as a horned, dragon-like creature with a serpent-headed tail and small, round ears, while others have both "necks" of equal size so that it cannot be determined which is the rear head. Many descriptions of the amphisbaena say its eyes glow like candles or lightning, but the poet <a href="Nicander">Nicander</a> seems to contradict this by describing it as "always dull of eye". He also says: "From either end protrudes a blunt chin; each is far from each other." <a href="Nicander">Nicander</a>'s account seems to be referring to what is indeed called the <a href="Amphisbaenia">Amphisbaenia</a>.

The amphisbaena is said to make its home in the <a href="desert">desert</a>.

In ancient times, the supposedly dangerous amphisbaena had many uses in the art of <a href="folk%20medicine">folk medicine</a> and other such remedies. It was said that expecting women wearing a live amphisbaena around their necks would have safe pregnancies; however, if one's goal was to cure ailments such as <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a> or the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a>, one should wear only its skin. By eating the meat of the amphisbaena, one could supposedly attract many lovers of the opposite sex, and slaying one during the <a href="full%20moon">full moon</a> could give power to one who is pure of heart and mind. <a href="Lumberjacks">Lumberjacks</a> suffering from cold weather on the job could nail its carcass or skin to a tree to keep warm, while in the process allowing the tree to be felled more easily.

In "The pageRank.Book of Beasts", <a href="T.H.%20White">T.H. White</a> suggests that the creature derives from sightings of the <a href="Amphisbaenia">worm lizards</a> of the same name. These creatures are found in the Mediterranean countries where many of these legends originated.

In John Milton's Paradise Lost, after the Fall and the return of Satan to Hell, some of the fallen angelic host are transformed into the amphisbaena, to represent the animal by which the Fall was caused, i.e. a snake. 
The amphisbaena is mentioned in the first book of Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher series, i.e. The Last Wish, when The Witcher's protagonist, Geralt of Rivia, is recalling past events when he meets an old acquaintance named Irion. The amphisbaena was endangering the region of Kovir until the beast was slain by Geralt's hand.

Amyl alcohol

An amyl alcohol is any of 8 <a href="alcohols">alcohols</a> with the formula CHOH. A mixture of amyl alcohols (also called amyl alcohol) can be obtained from <a href="fusel%20alcohol">fusel alcohol</a>. Amyl alcohol is used as a solvent and in <a href="esterfication">esterfication</a>, by which is produced <a href="amyl%20acetate">amyl acetate</a> and other important products. The name "amyl alcohol" without further specification applies to the normal (straight-chain) form, <a href="1-Pentanol">1-pentanol</a>.

These are the 8 <a href="structural%20isomer">structural isomer</a>s of alcohols with <a href="molecular%20formula">molecular formula</a> CHO:

Three of these alcohols, active amyl alcohol (2-methylbutan-1-ol), methyl (n) propyl carbinol (pentan-2-ol), and methyl isopropyl carbinol (3-methylbutan-2-ol), contain an asymmetric carbon atom and are therefore <a href="optical%20isomerism">optically active</a>.

The most important is <a href="isobutyl%20carbinol">isobutyl carbinol</a>, the chief constituent of fermentation amyl alcohol and a constituent of <a href="fusel%20oil">fusel oil</a>. It can be separated from fusel oil by either of two methods: shaking with strong <a href="brine">brine</a> solution and separating the oily layer from the brine layer; <a href="distillation">distilling</a> it and collecting the fraction that boils between 125 and 140 °C. Further purification is possible with this procedure: shaking the product with hot <a href="limewater">limewater</a>, separating the oily layer, drying the product with <a href="calcium%20chloride">calcium chloride</a>, and distilling it, collecting the fraction boiling between 128 and 132 °C.

Isobutyl carbinol can be synthesized from <a href="isobutanol">isobutanol</a> by conversion into isovaleraldehyde, which is subsequently reduced to isobutyl carbinol by means of <a href="sodium%20amalgam">sodium amalgam</a>. It is a colourless liquid of density 0.8247 g/cm³ (0 °C), boiling at 131.6 °C, slightly soluble in water, and easily dissolved in organic solvents. It has a characteristic strong smell and a sharp burning taste. Amyl alcohol has an oral LD50 of 200 mg/kg in mice, suggesting that it is significantly more toxic than ethanol. On passing the vapour through a red-hot tube, it decomposes into <a href="acetylene">acetylene</a>, <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a>, <a href="propylene">propylene</a>, and other compounds. It is <a href="oxidation">oxidized</a> by <a href="chromic%20acid">chromic acid</a> to <a href="isovaleraldehyde">isovaleraldehyde</a>, and it forms <a href="addition%20compound">addition compound</a>s <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s with calcium chloride and <a href="tin%28IV%29%20chloride">tin(IV) chloride</a>.

The other amyl alcohols may be obtained synthetically. Of these, tertiary butyl carbinol has been the most difficult to obtain, with the first reported synthesis in 1891 by L. Tissier using the reduction of a mixture of trimethyl acetic acid and trimethylacetyl chloride with sodium amalgam. It is a solid that melts at 48 to 50 °C and boils at 112.3 °C.

Amyl nitrite

Amyl nitrite is a <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a> with the <a href="chemical%20formula">formula</a> CHONO. A variety of isomers are known, but they all feature an <a href="Pentyl">amyl</a> group attached to the <a href="nitrite">nitrite</a> functional group. The alkyl group is unreactive and the chemical and biological properties are mainly due to the nitrite group. Like other <a href="alkyl%20nitrite">alkyl nitrite</a>s, amyl nitrite is bioactive in mammals, being a <a href="vasodilator">vasodilator</a>, which is the basis of its use as a prescription medicine. As an inhalant, it also has a <a href="Psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive</a> effect, which has led to its recreational use with its smell being described as that of old socks or dirty feet. It is also referred to as banapple gas.


The term "amyl nitrite" encompasses several <a href="isomer">isomer</a>s. For example, a common form of amyl nitrite with the formula (CH)CHCHCHONO may be more specifically referred to as isoamyl nitrite. When the amyl group is a <a href="Alkane%23Linear%20alkanes">linear or normal (n)</a> <a href="alkyl">alkyl</a> group, the resulting amyl nitrite would have the structural formula CH(CH)ONO.

Despite a very similar name to amyl nitrite, <a href="amyl%20nitrate">amyl nitrate</a> has a different chemical composition and different properties. Vast numbers of people confuse the two drugs, especially those wishing to purchase "poppers" (amyl nitrite) for recreational purposes.

Alkyl nitrites are prepared by the reaction of <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>s with <a href="nitrous%20acid">nitrous acid</a>:

The reaction is called <a href="esterification">esterification</a>. Synthesis of alkyl nitrites is, in general, straightforward and can be accomplished in home laboratories. A common procedure includes the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to a cooled mixture of an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and an alcohol. The intermediately-formed stoichiometric mixture of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide then converts the alcohol to the alkyl nitrite, which, due to its low density, will form an upper layer that can be easily <a href="Decantation">decanted</a> from the reaction mixture.

Isoamyl nitrite decomposes in the presence of base to give nitrite salts and the <a href="Amyl%20alcohol">isoamyl alcohol</a>:

Amyl nitrite, like other alkyl nitrites, reacts with <a href="carbanion">carbanion</a>s to give <a href="oxime">oxime</a>s.

Amyl nitrites are also useful as reagents in a modification of the <a href="Sandmeyer%20reaction">Sandmeyer reaction</a>. The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic <a href="amine">amine</a> in a halogenated solvent produces a <a href="radical%20%28chemistry%29">radical</a> aromatic species, this then frees a <a href="halogen">halogen</a> atom from the solvent. For the synthesis of <a href="Organoiodine%20compound">aryl iodide</a>s <a href="diiodomethane">diiodomethane</a> is used, whereas <a href="bromoform">bromoform</a> is the solvent of choice for the synthesis of <a href="Organobromine%20compound">aryl bromide</a>s.

Amyl nitrite, in common with other <a href="alkyl%20nitrites">alkyl nitrites</a>, is a potent <a href="vasodilator">vasodilator</a>; it expands <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s, resulting in lowering of the <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a>. Alkyl nitrites are a source of <a href="nitric%20oxide">nitric oxide</a>, which signals for relaxation of the <a href="Cardiac%20muscle">involuntary muscles</a>. Physical effects include decrease in blood pressure, headache, flushing of the face, increased heart rate, dizziness, and relaxation of involuntary muscles, especially the <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a> walls and the <a href="internal%20anal%20sphincter">internal</a> and <a href="external%20anal%20sphincter">external anal sphincter</a>. There are no <a href="Drug%20withdrawal">withdrawal</a> symptoms. <a href="Overdose">Overdose</a> symptoms include <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="emesis">vomiting</a>, <a href="hypotension">hypotension</a>, <a href="hypoventilation">hypoventilation</a>, <a href="dyspnea">shortness of breath</a>, and <a href="fainting">fainting</a>. The effects set in very quickly, typically within a few seconds and disappear within a few minutes. Amyl nitrite may also intensify the experience of <a href="synesthesia">synesthesia</a>.

Autumn

Autumn, also known as fall in <a href="American%20English">American</a> and <a href="Canadian%20English">Canadian</a> English, is one of the four <a href="temperate">temperate</a> <a href="season">season</a>s. Autumn marks the transition from <a href="summer">summer</a> to <a href="winter">winter</a>, in September (<a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>) or March (<a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>), when the duration of <a href="daylight">daylight</a> becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools down considerably. One of its main features is the <a href="leaf%23Seasonal%20leaf%20loss">shedding of leaves</a> from <a href="deciduous%20trees">deciduous trees</a>.

Some cultures regard the autumnal <a href="equinox">equinox</a> as "mid-autumn", while others with a longer <a href="Seasonal%20lag">temperature lag</a> treat it as the start of autumn. Meteorologists (and most of the <a href="temperate%20countries">temperate countries</a> in the southern hemisphere) use a definition based on months, with autumn being September, October and November in the northern hemisphere, and March, April and May in the southern hemisphere.

In <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, autumn is usually considered to start with the <a href="September%20equinox">September equinox</a> (21 to 24 September) and end with the <a href="winter%20solstice">winter solstice</a> (21 or 22 December). Popular culture in North America associates <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a>, the first Monday in September, as the end of summer and the start of autumn; certain summer traditions, such as wearing white, are discouraged after that date. As daytime and nighttime temperatures decrease, trees shed their leaves. In traditional East Asian <a href="solar%20term">solar term</a>, autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on or about 7 November. In <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the autumn months according to the national meteorological service, <a href="Met%20%C3%89ireann">Met Éireann</a>, are September, October and November. However, according to the <a href="Irish%20Calendar">Irish Calendar</a>, which is based on ancient <a href="Gaelic%20Ireland">Gaelic</a> traditions, autumn lasts throughout the months of August, September and October, or possibly a few days later, depending on tradition. In <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, autumn officially begins on 1 March and ends on 31 May.

The word "autumn" comes from the ancient <a href="Etruscan%20language">Etruscan</a> root "autu-" and has within it connotations of the passing of the year. It was borrowed by the neighbouring <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, and became the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word '. After the Roman era, the word continued to be used as the <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> word ' (' in <a href="modern%20French">modern French</a>) or ' in Middle English, and was later normalised to the original Latin. In the <a href="Medieval">Medieval</a> period, there are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but by the 16th century, it was in common use.

Before the 16th century, "<a href="harvest">harvest</a>" was the term usually used to refer to the season, as it is common in other <a href="West%20Germanic%20languages">West Germanic languages</a> to this day (<a href="cf.">cf.</a> Dutch ', German ' and Scots ""). However, as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns, the word "harvest" lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping, and "autumn", as well as "fall", began to replace it as a reference to the season.

The alternative word "fall" for the season traces its origins to old <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a>. The exact derivation is unclear, with the <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> ' or ' and the <a href="Old%20Norse%20language">Old Norse</a> "" all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning "to fall from a height" and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in <a href="16th-century%20England">16th-century England</a>, a contraction of <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> expressions like "<a href="Abscission">fall of the leaf</a>" and "fall of the year".

During the 17th century, <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">English emigration to the British colonies</a> in North America was at its peak, and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term "fall" gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America.

The name "backend", a once common name for the season in <a href="Northern%20England">Northern England</a>, has today been largely replaced by the name autumn.

Association with the transition from warm to cold weather, and its related status as the season of the primary <a href="harvest">harvest</a>, has dominated its themes and popular images. In Western cultures, personifications of autumn are usually pretty, well-fed females adorned with fruits, vegetables and grains that ripen at this time. Many cultures feature autumnal <a href="harvest%20festival">harvest festival</a>s, often the most important on their calendars. Still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the autumn <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> holiday of the United States and Canada, and the Jewish <a href="Sukkot">Sukkot</a> holiday with its roots as a full-moon harvest festival of "tabernacles" (living in outdoor huts around the time of harvest). There are also the many North American Indian festivals tied to harvest of ripe foods gathered in the wild, the Chinese Mid-Autumn or <a href="Moon%20festival">Moon festival</a>, and many others. The predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminent arrival of harsh weather.

This view is presented in English poet <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>' poem "<a href="To%20Autumn">To Autumn</a>", where he describes the season as a time of bounteous fecundity, a time of 'mellow fruitfulness'.

While most foods are harvested during the autumn, foods particularly associated with the season include <a href="pumpkin">pumpkin</a>s (which are integral parts of both Thanksgiving and <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a>) and <a href="apple">apple</a>s, which are used to make the seasonal beverage <a href="apple%20cider">apple cider</a>.

Autumn, especially in poetry, has often been associated with <a href="melancholia">melancholia</a>. The possibilities of summer are gone, and the chill of winter is on the horizon. Skies turn grey, the amount of usable daylight drops rapidly, and many people turn inward, both physically and mentally. It has been referred to as an unhealthy season.

Similar examples may be found in Irish poet <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a>' poem "<a href="The%20Wild%20Swans%20at%20Coole">The Wild Swans at Coole</a>" where the maturing season that the poet observes symbolically represents his own ageing self. Like the natural world that he observes, he too has reached his prime and now must look forward to the inevitability of old age and death. French poet <a href="Paul%20Verlaine">Paul Verlaine</a>'s ""<a href="Chanson%20d%27automne">Chanson d'automne</a>"" ("Autumn Song") is likewise characterised by strong, painful feelings of sorrow. <a href="John%20Keats">Keats</a>' "<a href="To%20Autumn">To Autumn</a>", written in September 1819, echoes this sense of melancholic reflection, but also emphasises the lush abundance of the season.

Autumn is associated with <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> (influenced by <a href="Samhain">Samhain</a>, a Celtic autumn festival), and with it a widespread marketing campaign that promotes it. Halloween is in autumn in the northern hemisphere. The television, film, book, costume, home decoration, and confectionery industries use this time of year to promote products closely associated with such a holiday, with promotions going from early September to 31 October, since their themes rapidly lose strength once the holiday ends, and advertising starts concentrating on Christmas.

Autumn also has a strong association with the end of <a href="summer%20vacation">summer holiday</a> and the <a href="first%20day%20of%20school">start of a new school year</a>, particularly for children in primary and secondary education. "<a href="Back%20to%20school%20%28marketing%29">Back to School</a>" advertising and preparations usually occurs in the weeks leading to the beginning of autumn.

Easter is in autumn in the southern hemisphere. 

<a href="Thanksgiving%20Day">Thanksgiving Day</a> is a national holiday celebrated in Canada, in the United States, in some of the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean islands</a> and in <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28Canada%29">second Monday of October</a> in Canada and on the <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">fourth Thursday of November</a> in the United States, and around the same part of the year in other places. Similarly named festival holidays occur in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>.

Television stations and networks, particularly in North America, traditionally begin their regular seasons in autumn, with new series and new episodes of existing series debuting mostly during late September or early October (series that debut outside the fall season are usually known as <a href="mid-season%20replacement">mid-season replacement</a>s). A sweeps period takes place in November to measure <a href="Nielsen%20Ratings">Nielsen Ratings</a>.

<a href="American%20football">American football</a> is played almost exclusively in the autumn months; at the <a href="high%20school%20football">high school level</a>, seasons run through September and October, with some playoff games and <a href="American%20football%20on%20Thanksgiving">holiday rivalry contests</a> being played as late as Thanksgiving. <a href="College%20football">College football</a>'s regular season runs from September through November, while the main <a href="professional%20football%20%28gridiron%29">professional</a> circuit, the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>, plays from September through December. Summer sports, such as <a href="stock%20car%20racing">stock car racing</a> and <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, wrap up their seasons in early autumn; MLB's championship <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> is known popularly as the "Fall Classic". (Amateur baseball is usually finished by August.) Likewise, professional winter sports, such as <a href="professional%20ice%20hockey">professional ice hockey</a>, <a href="basketball">basketball</a> and most leagues of <a href="association%20football">soccer football</a> in Europe, are in the early stages of their seasons during autumn; American <a href="college%20basketball">college basketball</a> and <a href="college%20ice%20hockey">college ice hockey</a> play teams outside their <a href="athletic%20conference">athletic conference</a>s during the late autumn before their in-conference schedules begin in winter.

The <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> religious holidays of <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Day">All Saints' Day</a> and <a href="All%20Souls%27%20Day">All Souls' Day</a> are observed in autumn in the Northern hemisphere.

Since 1997, <a href="Autumn%20%28given%20name%29">Autumn</a> has been one of the top 100 names for girls in the United States.

In Indian mythology, autumn is considered to be the preferred season for the goddess of learning <a href="Saraswati">Saraswati</a>, who is also known by the name of "goddess of autumn" (Sharada).

In Asian mysticism, Autumn is associated with the <a href="Wu%20Xing">element</a> of <a href="Metal%20%28Wu%20Xing%29">metal</a>, and subsequently with the colour <a href="white">white</a>, the <a href="Bai%20Hu">White Tiger of the West</a>, and death and mourning.

In the United States, <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a> is a <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20the%20United%20States">public holiday</a> celebrated on the first Monday in September.

Although <a href="Autumn%20leaf%20color">colour change in leaves</a> occurs wherever <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees are found, coloured autumn <a href="foliage">foliage</a> is noted in various regions of the world: most of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Asia">Eastern Asia</a> (including China, <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, and Japan), <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, the forest of <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>, eastern <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>'s <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a>.

Eastern <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="New%20England">New England</a> are famous for their autumnal foliage, and this attracts major tourism (worth billions of US dollars) for the regions.

Alameda, California

Alameda ( ; <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>: ) is a city in <a href="Alameda%20County%2C%20California">Alameda County</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It is located on <a href="Alameda%20%28island%29">Alameda Island</a> and <a href="Bay%20Farm%20Island%2C%20Alameda%2C%20California">Bay Farm Island</a>, and is adjacent to and south of <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a> and east of <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> across the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. Bay Farm Island, a portion of which is also known as "Harbor Bay Isle", is not actually an island, and is part of the mainland adjacent to the <a href="Oakland%20International%20Airport">Oakland International Airport</a>. The city's estimated 2017 population was 79,928. Alameda is a <a href="charter%20city">charter city</a>, rather than a <a href="general%20law%20city">general law city</a>, allowing the city to provide for any form of government. Alameda became a charter city and adopted a <a href="council%E2%80%93manager%20government">council–manager government</a> in 1916, which it retains to the present.

The island Alameda occupies what was originally a <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a> connected to Oakland. Much of it was low-lying and marshy, but on higher ground than the peninsula and adjacent parts of what is now <a href="downtown%20Oakland">downtown Oakland</a> were home to one of the largest coastal oak forests in the world. The area was therefore called "Encinal", Spanish for "forest of evergreen oak". "Alameda" is Spanish for "grove of poplar trees" or "tree-lined avenue", and was chosen in 1853 by popular vote.

The inhabitants at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the late 18th century were a local band of the <a href="Ohlone">Ohlone</a> tribe. The peninsula became part of the vast <a href="Rancho%20San%20Antonio%20%28Peralta%29">Rancho San Antonio</a> granted in 1820 to Luis Peralta by the Spanish king who claimed California. The grant was later confirmed by the new <a href="Mexico">Republic of Mexico</a> upon its independence from Spain.

Over time, the place became known as Bolsa de Encinal or Encinal de San Antonio.

The city was founded on June 6, 1853, and the town originally contained three small settlements. "Alameda" referred to the village at Encinal and High Streets, <a href="Hibbardsville%2C%20Alameda%2C%20California">Hibbardsville</a> was at the North Shore ferry and shipping terminal, and <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Alameda%2C%20California">Woodstock</a> was on the west near the ferry piers of the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Coast%20Railroad">South Pacific Coast Railroad</a> and the <a href="Central%20Pacific%20Railroad">Central Pacific</a>. Eventually, the Central Pacific's ferry pier became the <a href="Alameda%20Mole">Alameda Mole</a>, featuring transit connections between San Francisco ferries, local trollies and <a href="Southern%20Pacific%20Railroad">Southern Pacific</a> (formerly Central Pacific) commuter lines.

The first post office opened in 1854. The first school, Schmermerhorn School, was opened in 1855 (and eventually became Lincoln School), Encinal School was opened in 1860 (and closed in 1980). The <a href="San%20Francisco%20and%20Alameda%20Railroad">San Francisco and Alameda Railroad</a> opened the Encinal station in 1864. The Encinal area was also known as Fasskings Station in honor of Frederick Louis Fassking. Encinal's own post office opened in 1876, was renamed West End in 1877, and closed in 1891. The West End area was originally called Bowman's Point in honor of Charles G. Bowman, an early settler.

The <a href="Alameda%20Terminal">Alameda Terminal</a> was the site of the arrival of the first train via the <a href="First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a> into the San Francisco Bay Area on September 6, 1869. The transcontinental terminus was switched to the <a href="Oakland%20Mole">Oakland Mole</a> two months later, on November 8, 1869.

The borders of Alameda were made coextensive with the island in 1872, incorporating Woodstock into Alameda.
<a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> described Alameda as being "The Garden of California." 

In 1917, an attraction called <a href="Neptune%20Beach%2C%20California">Neptune Beach</a> was built in the area now known as Crab Cove. Often compared to <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a>, the park was a major attraction in the 1920s and 1930s. The original owners of the facility, the Strehlow family, partnered with a local confectioner to create tastes unique to Neptune Beach. Both the American <a href="snow%20cone">snow cone</a> and the <a href="popsicle">popsicle</a> were first sold at Neptune Beach. The <a href="Kewpie%20doll%20%28toy%29">Kewpie doll</a>, hand-painted and dressed in unique hand-sewn dresses, became the original prize for winning games at the beach – another Neptune Beach invention. The Strehlows owned and operated the beach on their own, even filling in a section of the bay to add an additional Olympic-size swimming pool and an exceptional roller coaster which must have given riders a tremendous view of the bay. The "Cottage Baths" were available for rent.

Neptune Beach's two huge outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by such famous swimmers as Olympian <a href="Johnny%20Weissmuller">Johnny Weissmuller</a>, who later starred as the original Tarzan, and <a href="Jack%20LaLanne">Jack LaLanne</a>, who started a chain of health clubs. The park closed down in 1939 because of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, the completion of the <a href="San%20Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland%20Bay%20Bridge">San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge</a>, people circumventing paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran right past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side just by swimming around the fence.

Some of the resort homes and buildings from the Neptune beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The <a href="Croll%20Building">Croll Building</a>, on the corner of Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, famous as training quarters for some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jefferies, Jack Johnson, and many other champions all stayed and trained here. Today this beautifully preserved building is home to Croll's Pizza and the 1400 Bar & Grill Restaurant. Neptune Court, just a block away on the corner of Central Ave. and McKay Ave., provides another glimpse of what resort life was like in Alameda in the 1920s. A short walk near Crab Cove will reveal many more historic gems.

The vast majority of the Neptune Beach structures – the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, the <a href="Ferris%20wheel">Ferris wheel</a>, the roller coaster, and other rides – were auctioned off in 1940 for mere pennies on the dollar of their original cost. Today, A consequence of the Neptune Beach closing around 1940 was a total dearth of quality, clean swimming facilities in town. A grass roots effort to create swimming pools at two high schools and two city parks would continue into the early 1960s.

When the railroad came to town in the 1860s Park Street developed into the major thoroughfare of the city and the location of the main Alameda train station, residents of Old Alameda pulled up stakes and moved across town to the new downtown. The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land. As a result, they designated their mutual property line as Park Street.

In 1902, the need for expanded shipping facilities led to the dredging of a canal through the marshland between Oakland and Alameda, turning Alameda into an island. Most of the soil from the canal was used to fill in nearby marshland. The area of Alameda called Bay Farm Island is no longer an island, but is attached by fill to Oakland. In his youth, author <a href="Jack%20London">Jack London</a> was known to take part in oyster pirating in the highly productive oyster beds near Bay Farm Island, today long gone. The <a href="Alameda%20Works%20Shipyard">Alameda Works Shipyard</a> was one of the largest and best equipped shipyards in the country. In the 1950s, Alameda's industrial and ship building industries thrived along the <a href="Oakland%20Estuary">Alameda Estuary</a>, where the world's first-ever, land-based, containerized shipping crane was used. Currently, the <a href="Port%20of%20Oakland">Port of Oakland</a> across the estuary serves as one of the largest ports on the West Coast, using the shipping technologies originally experimented with in Alameda. As of March 21, 2006, Alameda is a "Coast Guard City", one of seven in the country.

In addition to the regular trains running to the Alameda Mole, Alameda was also served by local steam commuter lines of the Southern Pacific (initially, the Central Pacific) which were later transformed into the <a href="East%20Bay%20Electric%20Lines">East Bay Electric Lines</a>. Southern Pacific's electrified trains were not <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a>s, but full-sized railroad cars which connected to the mainland by bridges at Webster Street and Fruitvale (only the latter bridge survives today). The trains ran to both the <a href="Oakland%20Long%20Wharf">Oakland Mole</a> and the Alameda Mole. In fact, one line which ran between the two moles was dubbed the "Horseshoe Line" for the shape of the route on a map. Soon after the completion of the Bay Bridge, Alameda trains ran directly to San Francisco on the lower deck of the bridge, the ferries having been rendered unnecessary. Alameda was the site of the Southern Pacific's West Alameda Shops where all the electric trains were maintained and repaired.

In the 1930s <a href="Pan%20American%20Airways">Pan American Airways</a> established a <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> port along the fill that led to the Alameda Mole. This was the original home base for the famous <a href="China%20Clipper">China Clipper</a> flying boat.
In 1929, the University of California established the San Francisco Airdrome located near the current Webster Street tube as a public airport. The Bay Airdrome had its gala christening party in 1930. The airfield was a busy place, as an early home base for Coastal Air Freight, Varney Air Lines, West Coast Air Transport, Western Air Express, the transbay Air Ferries, and Boeing's Pacific Air Transport. The Airdrome was closed in 1941 when its air traffic interfered with the newly built <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Alameda">Naval Air Station Alameda</a> (NAS Alameda). With the advent of World War II, a vast stretch of the marshy area southwest of the Alameda Mole was filled and the NAS Alameda established. This major Naval facility included a large airfield, as well as docks for several <a href="aircraft%20carriers">aircraft carriers</a>. It closed in 1997.

In the late 1950s the Utah Construction Company began a landfill beyond the "Old Sea Wall" and created "South Shore".

On February 7, 1973, a USN <a href="Ling-Temco-Vought">Vought</a> <a href="LTV%20A-7%20Corsair%20II">A-7E Corsair II</a> fighter jet on a routine training mission from <a href="Lemoore%20Naval%20Air%20Station">Lemoore Naval Air Station</a>, suddenly caught fire, 28,000 feet over the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> and crashed into the Tahoe Apartments in Alameda. Eleven people, including pilot Lieutenant Robert Lee Ward died in the crash and fire.

According to the <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (53.79%) is water.

Although Alameda's nickname is "The Island City" (or simply "the island"), the current city occupies two islands as well as a small section of the mainland. Today, the city consists of the main original section, with the former <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Alameda">Naval Air Station Alameda</a> (NAS Alameda) at the west end of Alameda Island, <a href="South%20Shore%2C%20Alameda%2C%20California">Southshore</a> along the southern side of Alameda Island, and <a href="Bay%20Farm%20Island">Bay Farm Island</a>, which is part of the mainland proper. The area of the former NAS is now known as "Alameda Point." The Southshore area is separated from the main part of Alameda Island by a lagoon; the north shore of the lagoon is located approximately where the original south shore of the island was. Alameda Point and Southshore are built on bay fill.

Not all of Alameda Island is part of the City of Alameda. Although nearly all of the island is in Alameda city limits, a small portion of a dump site west of the former runways at Alameda Point extends far enough into San Francisco Bay that it is over the county line and part of the <a href="San%20Francisco">City and County of San Francisco</a>. 

<a href="Coast%20Guard%20Island">Coast Guard Island</a>, a small island between Alameda Island and Oakland, is also part of Alameda and is the home of <a href="Integrated%20Support%20Command%20Alameda">Integrated Support Command Alameda</a>

This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> system, Alameda has a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate%23Warm-summer%20Mediterranean%20climate">warm-summer Mediterranean climate</a>, abbreviated "Csb" on climate maps.

At the turn of the 19th century, the city of Alameda took a large chunk of Charles Froling's land away to build a street. Froling had planned to build his dream house on the plot of land he received through inheritance.

The area of the former NAS is now known as Alameda Point. In late July 2006, the City of Alameda announced a deal with the Navy that would turn the land over to the city for $108M. The transfer process was initially slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the city regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land.

In September 2010 the US Veterans Administration proposed construction of a $209 million state-of-the-art facility at Alameda Point that would provide primary care, specialty care, and mental health, substance abuse and other services. <a href="http%3A//alamedapointva.blogspot.com"></a> The VA received Congressional $17.33 million in budget authority for the project in 2011. But concerns over the proximity to a nesting site for an endangered bird, the <a href="California%20least%20tern">California least tern</a>, have led to delays in moving the project forward. The VA's 2012 and 2013 budget requests to Congress contain no funding requests for Alameda Point. <a href="http%3A//alamedapointva.blogspot.com"></a>

In September 2011 Alameda and the Navy reached an agreement on the terms of a no-cost conveyance for the entire 918 acres at Alameda Point.

Alameda's first newspaper, the "Encinal", appeared in the early 1850s and the paper's editor was instrumental in the movement to incorporate the city. Following the "Encinal", several other papers appeared along geographic lines, and the "Daily Argus" eventually rose to prominence. A young Alameda native, <a href="Joseph%20R.%20Knowland">Joseph R. Knowland</a>, wrote political and historical articles for the Alameda papers. Later, Knowland owned the powerful "<a href="Oakland%20Tribune">Oakland Tribune</a>".

In addition, the aircraft carrier has been used for television shows such as "<a href="JAG%20%28TV%20series%29">JAG</a>", "<a href="Carrier%20%28documentary%29">Carrier</a>", "<a href="Looking">Looking</a>", "<a href="The%20Great%20Escape%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Great Escape</a>", and the special military episode of "<a href="Fear%20Factor">Fear Factor</a>"; plus a number of television commercials.

The Altarena Playhouse, which performs comedies, dramas and musicals, was founded in 1938 and is the longest continuously operating community theater in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Rhythmix Cultural Works (RCW) brings people of all ages together to experience and explore music, dance, visual art and educational opportunities. RCW's programs are housed in a restored industrial waterfront building that speaks to Alameda’s history while creating an inclusive venue that reflects the Bay Area’s rich diversity. The organization offers an array of arts programming to the community including Island Arts, Island City Waterways, Round the World Festival and its Performance Art and Learning program (PAL) that serves more than 2000 youth with free cultural arts assemblies each year.

Webster Street in Alameda has long been the host of many arts, crafts and holiday festivals. During some of these festivals, the Chamber of Commerce along with the West Alameda Business Association (WABA) will block of a portion of Webster St. for the entertainment of festival goers. Festivals such as The Island JAM formerly known as the <a href="http%3A//westalamedabusiness.com/events/">Peanut Butter Jam Festival</a> brings a lot of local and outside visitors. Other event on the "West-End" include Trick-or-Treat on Webster Street where merchants supply goodies for local children and culminates with a parade and costume contest; in December "Santa Claus Meet-n-Greet on Webster Street" happens with elves, and a photo with the big guy.

There are three major events when the street in Alameda's historic downtown district is closed to vehicular traffic. The "Park Street Spring Festival" takes place every May during the weekend of Mother's Day and attracts over 50,000 visitors. The "Park Street Art & Wine Faire" takes place the last weekend of every July and attracts over 100,000 visitors. Both street fairs feature over 150 arts & crafts vendors, food vendors, beer and wine pouring, a children's area, and two stages with regional entertainment. The "Park Street Classic Car Show" is held on the second Saturday every October and displays over 400 vintage vehicles.


Public primary and secondary education in Alameda is the responsibility of the <a href="Alameda%20Unified%20School%20District">Alameda Unified School District</a>, which is legally separate from the City of Alameda government (as is common throughout California). The <a href="College%20of%20Alameda">College of Alameda</a>, a two-year <a href="community%20college">community college</a> in the West End is part of the <a href="Peralta%20Community%20College%20District">Peralta Community College District</a>. The city has numerous private primary schools, and one private high school, <a href="St.%20Joseph%20Notre%20Dame%20High%20School">St. Joseph Notre Dame High School</a>, a Catholic school.

Alameda's relationships with Wuxi and Jiangyin were initiated in 2005, in part, by Stewart Chen, who then served on the City of Alameda Social Service and Human Relations board, and who went on to be elected to Alameda City Council in November, 2012.

Wuxi, China, is a so-called friendship city, because the diplomacy organization <a href="Sister%20Cities%20International">Sister Cities International</a> does not recognize the relationship.



In September, 2013, a Tibetan rights group initiated a social media and e-mail campaign targeting the Mayor of Alameda, complaining that City of Alameda's participation in, and association with, a flag-raising ceremony to recognize <a href="National%20Day%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">National Day of the People's Republic of China</a> on October 1 was tantamount to endorsing the communist regime in China, its human rights abuses, and the occupation of <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>. The City of Alameda responded that the ceremony was a function of the Alameda Sister City Association and the Alameda Wuxi Friendship Committee, not a function of the City of Alameda. The Tibetan rights group responded that on September 26, the City of Alameda Social Service and Human Relations board appointed a member, Michael Robles-Wong, as a representative to the Sister City Association.

On October 1, 2013, the Tibetan rights groupsTibetTruth and Bay Area Friends of Tibet sent roughly 75 protesters to Alameda City Hall to protest the ceremony, which organizers ultimately canceled before it began. Former City of Alameda Councilmember Frank Matarrese announced the cancellation. Then-city councilmember <a href="Stewart%20Chen">Stewart Chen</a> subsequently defended the ceremony, as a diplomatic, not political, exercise.

Alpha helix

The Alpha Helix (α-helix) is a common <a href="structural%20motif">motif</a> in the <a href="Protein%20secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a> of <a href="protein">protein</a>s and is a <a href="righthand">righthand</a>-spiral conformation (i.e. <a href="helix">helix</a>) in which every backbone <a href="amino">N−H</a> group donates a <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a> to the backbone <a href="carbonyl">C=O</a> group of the <a href="Amino%20acid">amino acid</a> located three or four <a href="residue%20%28biochemistry%29">residues</a> earlier along the protein sequence. 

Alpha Helix is also called a classic Pauling–Corey–Branson α-helix. The name 3.6-helix is also used for this type of helix, denoting the average number of residues per helical turn, with 13 atoms being involved in the ring formed by the hydrogen bond. 

Among types of local structure in proteins, the α-helix is the most regular and the most predictable from sequence, as well as the most prevalent.

In the early 1930s, <a href="William%20Astbury">William Astbury</a> showed that there were drastic changes in the <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> <a href="fiber%20diffraction">fiber diffraction</a> of moist wool or hair fibers upon significant stretching. The data suggested that the unstretched fibers had a coiled molecular structure with a characteristic repeat of ~.

Astbury initially proposed a kinked-chain structure for the fibers. He later joined other researchers (notably the American chemist Maurice Huggins) in proposing that:


Although incorrect in their details, Astbury's models of these forms were correct in essence and correspond to modern elements of <a href="secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a>, the α-helix and the <a href="Beta%20sheet">β-strand</a> (Astbury's nomenclature was kept), which were developed by <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>, <a href="Robert%20Corey">Robert Corey</a> and <a href="Herman%20Branson">Herman Branson</a> in 1951 (see below); that paper showed both right- and left-handed helices, although in 1960 the crystal structure of myoglobin showed that the right-handed form is the common one. <a href="Hans%20Neurath">Hans Neurath</a> was the first to show that Astbury's models could not be correct in detail, because they involved clashes of atoms. Neurath's paper and Astbury's data inspired <a href="Hugh%20Stott%20Taylor">H. S. Taylor</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Loyal%20Huggins">Maurice Huggins</a> and <a href="William%20Lawrence%20Bragg">Bragg</a> and collaborators to propose models of <a href="keratin">keratin</a> that somewhat resemble the modern α-helix.

Two key developments in the modeling of the modern α-helix were: the correct bond geometry, thanks to the <a href="crystallography">crystal structure determinations</a> of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s and <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s and Pauling's prediction of "planar" <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s; and his relinquishing of the assumption of an integral number of residues per turn of the helix. The pivotal moment came in the early spring of 1948, when Pauling caught a cold and went to bed. Being bored, he drew a polypeptide chain of roughly correct dimensions on a strip of paper and folded it into a helix, being careful to maintain the planar peptide bonds. After a few attempts, he produced a model with physically plausible hydrogen bonds. Pauling then worked with Corey and Branson to confirm his model before publication. In 1954, Pauling was awarded his first Nobel Prize "for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances"<a href="http%3A//nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/"></a> (such as proteins), prominently including the structure of the α-helix.

The amino acids in an α-helix are arranged in a right-handed <a href="helix">helical</a> structure where each amino acid residue corresponds to a 100° turn in the helix (i.e., the helix has 3.6 residues per turn), and a translation of along the helical axis. Dunitz describes how Pauling's first article on the theme in fact shows a left-handed helix, the enantiomer of the true structure. Short pieces of left-handed helix sometimes occur with a large content of achiral <a href="glycine">glycine</a> amino acids, but are unfavorable for the other normal, biological <a href="amino%20acids">-amino acids</a>. The pitch of the alpha-helix (the vertical distance between consecutive turns of the helix) is , which is the product of 1.5 and 3.6. What is most important is that the <a href="amine">N-H</a> group of an amino acid forms a <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a> with the <a href="carbonyl">C=O</a> group of the amino acid "four" residues earlier; this repeated "i" + 4 → "i" hydrogen bonding is the most prominent characteristic of an α-helix. Official international nomenclature <a href="http%3A//www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/ppep1.html"></a> specifies two ways of defining α-helices, rule 6.2 in terms of repeating "φ", "ψ" torsion angles (see below) and rule 6.3 in terms of the combined pattern of pitch and hydrogen bonding. The α-helices can be identified in protein structure using several computational methods, one of which being <a href="DSSP%20%28protein%29">DSSP</a> (Dictionary of Protein <a href="Secondary%20structure">Secondary Structure</a>).
Similar structures include the <a href="310%20helix">3 helix</a> ("i" + 3 → "i" hydrogen bonding) and the <a href="Pi%20helix">π-helix</a> ("i" + 5 → "i" hydrogen bonding). The α-helix can be described as a 3.6 helix, since the "i" + 4 spacing adds three more atoms to the H-bonded loop compared to the tighter 3 helix, and on average, 3.6 amino acids are involved in one ring of α-helix. The subscripts refer to the number of atoms (including the hydrogen) in the closed loop formed by the hydrogen bond.
Residues in α-helices typically adopt backbone ("φ", "ψ") <a href="dihedral%20angle">dihedral angle</a>s around (−60°, −45°), as shown in the image at right. In more general terms, they adopt dihedral angles such that the "ψ" dihedral angle of one residue and the "φ" dihedral angle of the "next" residue sum to roughly −105°. As a consequence, α-helical dihedral angles, in general, fall on a diagonal stripe on the <a href="Ramachandran%20diagram">Ramachandran diagram</a> (of slope −1), ranging from (−90°, −15°) to (−35°, −70°). For comparison, the sum of the dihedral angles for a 3 helix is roughly −75°, whereas that for the π-helix is roughly −130°. The general formula for the rotation angle "Ω" per residue of any polypeptide helix with "trans" isomers is given by the equation

The α-helix is tightly packed; there is almost no free space within the helix. The amino-acid side-chains are on the outside of the helix, and point roughly "downward" (i.e., toward the N-terminus), like the branches of an evergreen tree (<a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a> effect). This directionality is sometimes used in preliminary, low-resolution electron-density maps to determine the direction of the protein backbone.

Three differently arranged styles of 2D diagrams are used to represent different aspects of the sequence and structure relationships that confer specific physical and interaction properties on individual α-helices. Two of these emphasize circular placement around the cylindrical cross-section: The first-developed such diagram is called the "<a href="helical%20wheel">helical wheel</a>", and a more recent version is called the "<a href="wenxiang%20diagram">wenxiang diagram</a>". The latter name came from the fact that it resembles a coil-like <a href="incense">incense</a> used in China to repel mosquitos ().

The helical wheel represents a helix by a projection of the C backbone structure down the helix axis, while the wenxiang diagram represents it more abstractly as a smooth spiral coiled on the plane of the page. Both label the sequence with one-letter amino-acid code (see <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>) at each C position, using different colors or symbols to code the amino-acid properties. <a href="Hydrophobic">Hydrophobic</a> vs <a href="hydrophilic">hydrophilic</a> amino acids are always distinguished, as the most important property governing helix interactions. Sometimes positively vs negatively charged hydrophilics are distinguished, and sometimes ambiguous amino acids such as glycine (G) are distinguished. Color-coding conventions are various. The helical wheel does not change representation along the helix, while the wenxiang diagram is able to show the relative locations of the amino acids in an α-helix regardless of how long it is.

Either circular style of diagram can provide an intuitive and easily visualizable 2D picture that characterizes the disposition of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in α-helices, and can be used to study helix–helix interactions, helix-membrane interactions as quantified by the helical hydrophobic moment, or protein-protein interactions.

Various utilities and web sites are available to generate helical wheels, such as the page by Kael Fischer.

The third style of 2D diagram is called a "helical net". It is generated by opening the cylindrical surface of each helix along a line parallel to the axis and laying the result out vertically. The helix net is not suitable for studying helix–helix packing interactions, but it has become the dominant means of representing the sequence arrangement for <a href="integral%20membrane%20protein">integral membrane protein</a>s because it shows important relationships of the helical sequence to vertical positioning within the membrane even without knowledge of how the helices are arranged in 3D.

Helices observed in proteins can range from four to over forty residues long, but a typical helix contains about ten amino acids (about three turns). In general, short <a href="polypeptide">polypeptide</a>s do not exhibit much α-helical structure in solution, since the <a href="entropy">entropic</a> cost associated with the folding of the polypeptide chain is not compensated for by a sufficient amount of stabilizing interactions. In general, the backbone <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s of α-helices are considered slightly weaker than those found in <a href="beta%20sheet">β-sheets</a>, and are readily attacked by the ambient water molecules. However, in more hydrophobic environments such as the <a href="cellular%20membrane">plasma membrane</a>, or in the presence of co-solvents such as <a href="trifluoroethanol">trifluoroethanol</a> (TFE), or isolated from solvent in the gas phase, oligopeptides readily adopt stable α-helical structure. Furthermore, crosslinks can be incorporated into peptides to conformationally stabilize helical folds. Crosslinks stabilize the helical state by entropically destabilizing the unfolded state and by removing enthalpically stabilized "decoy" folds that compete with the fully helical state. It has been shown that α-helices are more stable, robust to mutations and designable than β-strands in natural proteins, and also in artificial designed proteins. 

Since the α-helix is defined by its hydrogen bonds and backbone conformation, the most detailed experimental evidence for α-helical structure comes from atomic-resolution <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> such as the example shown at right. It is clear that all the backbone carbonyl oxygens point downward (toward the C-terminus) but splay out slightly, and the H-bonds are approximately parallel to the helix axis. Protein structures from <a href="protein%20NMR">NMR spectroscopy</a> also show helices well, with characteristic observations of <a href="nuclear%20Overhauser%20effect">nuclear Overhauser effect</a> (NOE) couplings between atoms on adjacent helical turns. In some cases, the individual hydrogen bonds can be observed directly as a small scalar coupling in NMR.

There are several lower-resolution methods for assigning general helical structure. The <a href="protein%20NMR">NMR</a> <a href="chemical%20shift">chemical shift</a>s (in particular of the C, C and C′) and <a href="residual%20dipolar%20coupling">residual dipolar coupling</a>s are often characteristic of helices. The far-UV (170–250 nm) <a href="circular%20dichroism">circular dichroism</a> spectrum of helices is also idiosyncratic, exhibiting a pronounced double minimum at around 208 and 222 nm. <a href="Infrared">Infrared</a> spectroscopy is rarely used, since the α-helical spectrum resembles that of a <a href="random%20coil">random coil</a> (although these might be discerned by, e.g., <a href="hydrogen-deuterium%20exchange">hydrogen-deuterium exchange</a>). Finally, cryo <a href="electron%20microscopy">electron microscopy</a> is now capable of discerning individual α-helices within a protein, although their assignment to residues is still an active area of research.

Long homopolymers of amino acids often form helices if soluble. Such long, isolated helices can also be detected by other methods, such as <a href="dielectric%20relaxation">dielectric relaxation</a>, <a href="flow%20birefringence">flow birefringence</a>, and measurements of the <a href="diffusion%20constant">diffusion constant</a>. In stricter terms, these methods detect only the characteristic <a href="Prolate%20spheroid">prolate</a> (long cigar-like) hydrodynamic shape of a helix, or its large <a href="Molecular%20dipole%20moment">dipole moment</a>.

Different amino-acid sequences have different propensities for forming α-helical structure. <a href="Methionine">Methionine</a>, <a href="alanine">alanine</a>, <a href="leucine">leucine</a>, <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a>, and <a href="lysine">lysine</a> uncharged ("MALEK" in the <a href="amino-acid">amino-acid</a> 1-letter codes) all have especially high helix-forming propensities, whereas <a href="proline">proline</a> and <a href="glycine">glycine</a> have poor helix-forming propensities. <a href="Proline">Proline</a> either breaks or kinks a helix, both because it cannot donate an amide <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a> (having no amide hydrogen), and also because its sidechain interferes sterically with the backbone of the preceding turn inside a helix, this forces a bend of about 30° in the helix's axis. However, proline is often seen as the "first" residue of a helix, it is presumed due to its structural rigidity. At the other extreme, <a href="glycine">glycine</a> also tends to disrupt helices because its high conformational flexibility makes it entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained α-helical structure.

Estimated differences in <a href="Gibbs%20free%20energy">free energy</a>, Δ(Δ"G"), estimated in <a href="kcal/mol">kcal/mol</a> per residue in an α-helical configuration, relative to alanine arbitrarily set as zero. Higher numbers (more positive free energies) are less favoured. Significant deviations from these average numbers are possible, depending on the identities of the neighbouring residues.

A helix has an overall <a href="Molecular%20dipole%20moment">dipole moment</a> due to the aggregate effect of the individual microdipoles from the <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> groups of the peptide bond pointing along the helix axis. The effects of this macrodipole are a matter of some controversy. α-helices often occur with the N-terminal end bound by a negatively charged group, sometimes an <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> side chain such as <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a> or <a href="aspartate">aspartate</a>, or sometimes a phosphate ion. Some regard the helix macrodipole as interacting electrostatically with such groups. Others feel that this is misleading and it is more realistic to say that the hydrogen bond potential of the free NH groups at the N-terminus of an α-helix can be satisfied by hydrogen bonding; this can also be regarded as set of interactions between local microdipoles such as .

Coiled-coil α helices are highly stable forms in which two or more helices wrap around each other in a "supercoil" structure. <a href="Coiled%20coil">Coiled coil</a>s contain a highly characteristic <a href="sequence%20motif">sequence motif</a> known as a <a href="heptad%20repeat">heptad repeat</a>, in which the motif repeats itself every seven residues along the sequence ("amino acid" residues, not DNA base-pairs). The first and especially the fourth residues (known as the "a" and "d" positions) are almost always <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a>; the fourth residue is typically <a href="leucine">leucine</a> this gives rise to the name of the <a href="structural%20motif">structural motif</a> called a "<a href="leucine%20zipper">leucine zipper</a>", which is a type of coiled-coil. These hydrophobic residues pack together in the interior of the helix bundle. In general, the fifth and seventh residues (the "e" and "g" positions) have opposing charges and form a salt bridge stabilized by <a href="electrostatic">electrostatic</a> interactions. <a href="Fibrous%20protein">Fibrous protein</a>s such as <a href="keratin">keratin</a> or the "stalks" of <a href="myosin">myosin</a> or <a href="kinesin">kinesin</a> often adopt coiled-coil structures, as do several <a href="protein%20dimer">dimerizing</a> proteins. A pair of coiled-coils a four-<a href="helix%20bundle">helix bundle</a> is a very common structural motif in proteins. For example, it occurs in human <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a> and several varieties of <a href="cytochrome">cytochrome</a>. The <a href="Rop%20protein">Rop protein</a>, which promotes plasmid replication in bacteria, is an interesting case in which a single polypeptide forms a coiled-coil and two monomers assemble to form a four-helix bundle.

The amino acids that make up a particular helix can be plotted on a <a href="helical%20wheel">helical wheel</a>, a representation that illustrates the orientations of the constituent amino acids (see the article for <a href="leucine%20zipper">leucine zipper</a> for such a diagram). Often in <a href="globular%20protein">globular protein</a>s, as well as in specialized structures such as coiled-coils and <a href="leucine%20zipper">leucine zipper</a>s, an α-helix will exhibit two "faces" one containing predominantly <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> amino acids oriented toward the interior of the protein, in the <a href="hydrophobic%20core">hydrophobic core</a>, and one containing predominantly <a href="polarity%20%28chemistry%29">polar</a> amino acids oriented toward the <a href="solvent">solvent</a>-exposed surface of the protein.

<a href="Myoglobin">Myoglobin</a> and <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>, the first two proteins whose structures were solved by X-ray <a href="crystallography">crystallography</a>, have very similar folds made up of about 70% α-helix, with the rest being non-repetitive regions, or "loops" that connect the helices. In classifying proteins by their dominant fold, the <a href="http%3A//scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/">Structural Classification of Proteins</a> database maintains a large category specifically for all-α proteins.

Hemoglobin then has an even larger-scale <a href="quaternary%20structure">quaternary structure</a>, in which the functional oxygen-binding molecule is made up of four subunits.

α-Helices have particular significance in <a href="DNA">DNA</a> binding motifs, including <a href="helix-turn-helix">helix-turn-helix</a> motifs, <a href="leucine%20zipper">leucine zipper</a> motifs and <a href="zinc%20finger">zinc finger</a> motifs. This is because of the convenient structural fact that the diameter of an α-helix is about including an average set of sidechains, about the same as the width of the major groove in B-form <a href="DNA">DNA</a>, and also because <a href="coiled-coil">coiled-coil</a> (or leucine zipper) dimers of helices can readily position a pair of interaction surfaces to contact the sort of symmetrical repeat common in double-helical DNA. An example of both aspects is the <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a> Max (see image at left), which uses a helical coiled coil to dimerize, positioning another pair of helices for interaction in two successive turns of the DNA major groove.

α-Helices are also the most common protein structure element that crosses biological membranes (<a href="transmembrane%20protein">transmembrane protein</a>) it is presumed because the helical structure can satisfy all backbone hydrogen-bonds internally, leaving no polar groups exposed to the membrane if the sidechains are hydrophobic. Proteins are sometimes anchored by a single membrane-spanning helix, sometimes by a pair, and sometimes by a helix bundle, most classically consisting of seven helices arranged up-and-down in a ring such as for <a href="rhodopsin">rhodopsin</a>s (see image at right) or for <a href="G%20protein%E2%80%93coupled%20receptor">G protein–coupled receptor</a>s (GPCRs).

α-Helices under axial tensile deformation, a characteristic loading condition that appears in many alpha-helix-rich filaments and tissues, results in a characteristic three-phase behavior of stiff-soft-stiff tangent modulus. Phase I corresponds to the small-deformation regime during which the helix is stretched homogeneously, followed by phase II, in which alpha-helical turns break mediated by the rupture of groups of H-bonds. Phase III is typically associated with large-deformation covalent bond stretching.

Alpha-helices in proteins may have <a href="low-frequency%20collective%20motion%20in%20proteins%20and%20DNA">low-frequency</a> accordion-like motion as observed by the <a href="Raman%20spectroscopy">Raman spectroscopy</a> and analyzed via the quasi-continuum model. Helices not stabilized by tertiary interactions show dynamic behavior, which can be mainly attributed to helix fraying from the ends.

Homopolymers of amino acids (such as <a href="polylysine">polylysine</a>) can adopt α-helical structure at low temperature that is "melted out" at high temperatures. This helix–coil transition was once thought to be analogous to protein <a href="Denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denaturation</a>. The <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a> of this transition can be modeled using an elegant <a href="transfer%20matrix">transfer matrix</a> method, characterized by two parameters: the propensity to initiate a helix and the propensity to extend a helix.

At least five artists have made explicit reference to the α-helix in their work: Julie Newdoll in painting and <a href="Julian%20Voss-Andreae">Julian Voss-Andreae</a>, <a href="Bathsheba%20Grossman">Bathsheba Grossman</a>, Byron Rubin, and Mike Tyka in sculpture.

San Francisco area artist Julie Newdoll, who holds a degree in Microbiology with a minor in art, has specialized in paintings inspired by microscopic images and molecules since 1990. Her painting "Rise of the Alpha Helix" (2003) features human figures arranged in an α helical arrangement. According to the artist, "the flowers reflect the various types of sidechains that each amino acid holds out to the world". It is interesting to note that this same metaphor is also echoed from the scientist's side: "β sheets do not show a stiff repetitious regularity but flow in graceful, twisting curves, and even the α-helix is regular more in the manner of a flower stem, whose branching nodes show the influence of environment, developmental history, and the evolution of each part to match its own idiosyncratic function."

<a href="Julian%20Voss-Andreae">Julian Voss-Andreae</a> is a German-born sculptor with degrees in experimental physics and sculpture. Since 2001 Voss-Andreae creates "protein sculptures" based on protein structure with the α-helix being one of his preferred objects. Voss-Andreae has made α-helix sculptures from diverse materials including bamboo and whole trees. A monument Voss-Andreae created in 2004 to celebrate the memory of <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>, the discoverer of the α-helix, is fashioned from a large steel beam rearranged in the structure of the α-helix. The , bright-red sculpture stands in front of Pauling's childhood home in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>.

<a href="Ribbon%20diagrams">Ribbon diagrams</a> of α-helices are a prominent element in the laser-etched crystal sculptures of protein structures created by artist <a href="Bathsheba%20Grossman">Bathsheba Grossman</a>, such as those of <a href="insulin">insulin</a>, <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>, and <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a>. Byron Rubin is a former protein crystallographer now professional sculptor in metal of proteins, nucleic acids, and drug molecules many of which featuring α-helices, such as <a href="subtilisin">subtilisin</a>, <a href="human%20growth%20hormone">human growth hormone</a>, and <a href="phospholipase%20A2">phospholipase A2</a>.

Mike Tyka is a computational biochemist at the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> working with <a href="David%20Baker%20%28biochemist%29">David Baker</a>. Tyka has been making sculptures of protein molecules since 2010 from copper and steel, including <a href="ubiquitin">ubiquitin</a> and a <a href="potassium%20channel">potassium channel</a> tetramer.

Accrington

Accrington is a town in the <a href="Hyndburn">Hyndburn</a> borough of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, England. It lies about east of <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a>, west of <a href="Burnley">Burnley</a>, east of <a href="Preston%2C%20Lancashire">Preston</a>, north of <a href="Manchester%20city%20centre">Manchester city centre</a> and is situated on the mostly <a href="culvert">culvert</a>ed <a href="River%20Hyndburn">River Hyndburn</a>. Commonly abbreviated by locals to "Accy", the town has a population of 54,800 according to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">2001 census</a> and the urban area has a population of over 85,000.

Accrington is a former centre of the cotton and textile machinery industries. The town is famed for manufacturing the hardest and densest building bricks in the world, <a href="Accrington%20brick">"The Accrington NORI"</a> (iron), which were used in the construction of the <a href="Empire%20State%20Building">Empire State Building</a> and for the foundations of <a href="Blackpool%20Tower">Blackpool Tower</a>; famous for <a href="Accrington%20Stanley%20F.C.">Accrington Stanley F.C.</a> and the <a href="Haworth%20Art%20Gallery">Haworth Art Gallery</a> which holds Europe's largest collection of <a href="Tiffany%20glass">Tiffany glass</a>.

The name Accrington appears to be <a href="Old%20English">Anglo-Saxon</a> in origin. In the records it variously appears as "Akarinton" in 1194; "Akerunton", "Akerinton" and "Akerynton" in 1258; "Acrinton" in 1292; "Ackryngton" in 1311 and "Acryngton" in 1324.

The name may mean "acorn farmstead" from Anglo-Saxon "æcern" meaning "acorn" and "tun" meaning "farmstead" or "village". The southern part of Accrington, the township of New Accrington, was formerly in the Forest of Blackburnshire and the presence of oak trees may be inferred from local place names like Broad Oak and Oak Hill. The products of oak trees were once an important food for swine and a farmstead may have been named for such produce. Anglo-Saxon "ᴁcerntun" might become <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> "Akerenton", "Akerinton" and the like. Also worth considering is that in the Lancashire dialect "acorn" was "akran".

There is no known Old English personal name from which the first element can be derived. But if the <a href="Frisian%20languages">Frisian</a> names "Akkrum", "Akkeringa" and <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> name "Akkerghem", are derived from the personal name "Akker" there may be a corresponding Old English name from which "Accrington" may be derived.

Accrington covers two <a href="Township%20%28England%29">townships</a> which were established in 1507 following disafforestation; those of Old Accrington and New Accrington which were merged in 1878 with the incorporation of the borough council. There have been settlements there since the medieval period, likely in the Grange Lane and Black Abbey area, and the King's Highway which passes above the town was at one time used by the kings and queens of England when they used the area for hunting when the <a href="Royal%20forest">Forest of Accrington</a> was one of the four forests of the <a href="Hundred%20%28administrative%20division%29">hundred</a> of <a href="Blackburnshire">Blackburnshire</a>.

<a href="Robert%20de%20Lacy">Robert de Lacy</a> gave the <a href="Manorialism">manor</a> of Accrington to the monks of <a href="Kirkstall%20Abbey">Kirkstall</a> in the 12th century. The monks built a <a href="Monastic%20grange">grange</a> there; removing the inhabitants to make room for it. The locals got their revenge by setting fire to the new building, destroying its contents and in the process killing the three lay brothers who occupied it. An area of the town is named 'Black Abbey', a possible reference to the murders. Regardless of whatever happened, Accrington did not remain under monastic control for long before reverting to the <a href="de%20Lacy">de Lacy</a>s.

It is thought the monks of Kirkstall may have built a small chapel there during their tenure for the convenience of those in charge residing there and their tenants, but the records are uncertain. What is known is that there was a chapel in Accrington prior to 1553 where the vicar of Whalley was responsible for the maintenance of divine worship. However it did not have its own minister and it was served, when at all, by the curate of one of the adjacent chapels. In 1717 Accrington was served by the curate of Church, who preached there only once a month. St. James's Church was built in 1763, replacing the old chapel however it did not achieve parochial status until as late as 1870.

Until around 1830 visitors considered Accrington to be just a "considerable village". The <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, however, resulted in large changes and Accrington's location on the confluence of a number of streams made it attractive to industry and a number of mills were built in the town in the mid-eighteenth century. Further industrialisation then followed in the late eighteenth century and local landowners began building mansions in the area on the outskirts of the settlement where their mills were located while their employees lived in overcrowded unsanitary conditions in the centre.

Industrialisation resulted in rapid population growth during the nineteenth century, as people moved from over north-west England to Accrington, with the population increasing from 3,266 in 1811 to 10,376 in 1851 to 43,211 in 1901 to its peak in 1911 at 45,029.

This fast population growth and slow response from the <a href="Church%20of%20England">established church</a> allowed <a href="nonconformism">non-conformism</a> to flourish in the town. By the mid-nineteenth century there were Wesleyan, Primitive Methodist, United Free Methodist, Congregationalist, Baptist, Swedenborgian, Unitarian, Roman Catholic and Catholic Apostolic churches in the town. The <a href="Swedenborgian%20Church">Swedenborgian church</a> was so grand that it was considered to be the ‘Cathedral' of that denomination.

For many decades the textiles industry, the engineering industry and coal mining were the central activities of the town. <a href="Cotton%20mills">Cotton mills</a> and <a href="dye">dye</a> works provided work for the inhabitants, but often in very difficult conditions. There was regular conflict with employers over wages and working conditions. On 24 April 1826 over 1,000 men and women, many armed, gathered at Whinney Hill in <a href="Clayton-le-Moors">Clayton-le-Moors</a> to listen to a speaker from where they marched on Sykes's Mill at Higher Grange Lane, near the site of the modern police station and Magistrate's Courts, and smashed over 60 looms. These riots spread from Accrington through Oswaldtwistle, Blackburn, Darwen, Rossendale, Bury and Chorley. In the end after three days of riots 1,139 looms were destroyed, 4 rioters and 2 bystanders shot dead by the authorities in Rossendale and 41 rioters sentenced to death (all of whose sentences were commuted).

In the 1842 <a href="1842%20General%20Strike">'plug riots'</a> a <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> spread from town to town due to conditions in the town. In a population of 9,000 people as few as 100 were fully employed. From 15 August 1842 the situation boiled over and bands of men entered the mills which were running and stopped the machinery by knocking out the boiler plugs. This allowed the water and steam to escape shutting down the mill machinery. Thousands of strikers walked over the hills from one town to another to persuade people to join the strike in civil disturbances that lasted about a week. The strike was associated with the <a href="Chartism">Chartist</a> movement but eventually proved unsuccessful in its aims.

In the early 1860s the <a href="Lancashire%20cotton%20famine">Lancashire cotton famine</a> badly affected Accrington, although less so than the wider area due to its more diverse economy, with as many as half of the town's mill employees out of work at one time.

Conditions were such that a Local Board of Health was constituted in 1853 and the town itself incorporated in 1878 allowing the enforcement of local laws to improve the town.

One well-known association the town has is with the '<a href="Accrington%20Pals">Accrington Pals</a>', the nickname given to the smallest home town <a href="battalion">battalion</a> of volunteers formed to fight in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. The <a href="Pals%20battalion">Pals battalion</a>s were a peculiarity of the 1914-18 war: <a href="Horatio%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener%20of%20Khartoum">Lord Kitchener</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a>, believed that it would help recruitment if friends and work-mates from the same town were able to join up and fight together. Strictly speaking, the 'Accrington Pals' battalion is properly known as the '11th <a href="East%20Lancashire%20Regiment">East Lancashire Regiment</a>': the nickname is a little misleading, since of the four 250-strong companies that made up the original battalion only one was composed of men from Accrington. The rest volunteered from other east <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> towns such as <a href="Burnley">Burnley</a>, <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a> and <a href="Chorley">Chorley</a>.

The Pals' first day of action, 1 July 1916, took place in Serre, near <a href="Montauban-de-Picardie">Montauban</a> in the north of France. It was part of the 'Big Push' (later known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme%20%281916%29">Battle of the Somme</a>) that was intended to force the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> into a retreat from the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, a line they had held since late 1914. The German defences in Serre were supposed to have been obliterated by sustained, heavy, British shelling during the preceding week; however, as the battalion advanced it met with fierce resistance. 235 men were killed and a further 350 wounded — more than half of the battalion — within half an hour. Similarly desperate losses were suffered elsewhere on the front, <a href="First%20day%20on%20the%20Somme">in a disastrous day</a> for the British Army (approximately 19,000 British soldiers were killed in a single day).

Later in the year, the East Lancashire Regiment was rebuilt with new volunteers — in all, 865 Accrington men were killed during World War I. All of these names are recorded on a war memorial, an imposing white stone cenotaph, which stands in Oak Hill Park in the south of the town. The <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> also lists the names of 173 local fatalities from <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The trenches from which the Accrington Pals advanced on 1 July 1916 are still visible in John Copse west of the village of Serre, and there is a memorial there made of Accrington brick.

After the war and until 1986, Accrington Corporation buses were painted in the regimental colours of red and blue with gold lining. The mudguards were painted black as a sign of mourning.

The 2001 census gave the population of Accrington town as 45,600. The figure for the urban area was 78,224, increased from 70,442 in 1991. This total includes Accrington, <a href="Church%2C%20Lancashire">Church</a>, <a href="Clayton-le-Moors">Clayton-le-Moors</a>, <a href="Great%20Harwood">Great Harwood</a> and <a href="Oswaldtwistle">Oswaldtwistle</a>. For comparison purposes that is approximately the same size as <a href="Aylesbury">Aylesbury</a>, <a href="City%20of%20Carlisle">Carlisle</a>, <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a> or <a href="Scunthorpe">Scunthorpe</a> urban areas.

The borough of <a href="Hyndburn">Hyndburn</a> as a whole has a population of 88,996. This includes Accrington Urban Area and other outlying towns and villages such as; <a href="Altham%2C%20Lancashire">Altham</a>, <a href="Baxenden">Baxenden</a>, part of <a href="Belthorn">Belthorn</a>, <a href="Huncoat">Huncoat</a>, <a href="Rishton">Rishton</a> and Stanhill.

Formerly cotton and textile machinery were important industries in the town. <a href="Accrington%20brick">NORI</a>s, a type of iron hard engineering brick, were produced nearby in <a href="Huncoat">Huncoat</a> was closed in 2013, but later reopened in 2015. Mills and factories are Accrington's past but there a few factories and garages now occupy the old building.

The council has a regeneration plan in place, which will, according to the council, boost the local economy. The plan is to upgrade many old shops, and build a bus station. A memorial for the <a href="Accrington%20Pals">Accrington Pals</a> may be built outside the town hall.

The Hyndburn Borough Council plans to spend £10 million to refurbish the town centre, which includes:


Half of Blackburn Road is being refurbished and is now being made into a more attractive shopping street, upgrading shops, adding more trees, and repaving the pavements.

Two new phases are being built, the first one called the Acorn Park, where new houses are being built with balconies and greener spaces, and Phoenix Place, which will also include new housing and the building of a new mosque to help the overcrowding of nearby mosques. The wood nook area has the highest amount of abandoned housing in Hyndburn, which is also being refurbished and extended for sale to new families.

Accrington is a hill town located at the western edge of the Pennines within a bowl and largely encircled by surrounding hills to heights of 300-400m. The Hyndburn or Accrington Brook flows through the centre of the town. Hill settlements origins were as the economic foci of the district engaging in the spinning and weaving of woolen cloth. Wool, lead and coal were other local industries.

<a href="Accrington%20Stanley%20F.C.">Accrington Stanley F.C.</a>, entered the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1921 with the formation of the old <a href="Third%20Division%20%28North%29">Third Division (North)</a>; after haunting the lower reaches of English football for forty years, they eventually resigned from the League in 1962, due to financial problems, and folded in 1965. The club was reformed three years later and then worked its way through the non-league divisions to reach the <a href="Football%20Conference">Nationwide Conference</a> in 2003. In the 2005–06 season, Stanley, after winning against <a href="Woking%20F.C.">Woking</a> with three matches to spare, secured a place back in the Football League and the town celebrated with a small parade and honours placed on senior executives of the team. One of the teams relegated—and thus being replaced by Stanley—were <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a>, who were voted into the Football League to replace the previous Accrington Stanley. The football stadium is called the Crown Ground.

An earlier club, <a href="Accrington%20F.C.">Accrington F.C.</a>, were one of the twelve founder members of the Football League in 1888. However, their time in league football was even less successful and considerably briefer than that of Accrington Stanley: they dropped out of the league in 1893 and folded shortly afterwards due to financial problems. The town of Accrington thus has the unique "distinction" of having lost two separate clubs from league football. They are currently placed in League 2 alongside local club [Blackpool]
