Battle of Gettysburg

The Battle of Gettysburg (, with an sound) was fought July 1–3, 1863, in and around the town of <a href="Gettysburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gettysburg</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, by <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> and <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> forces during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's <a href="Turning%20point%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">turning point</a>. Union <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="George%20Meade">George Meade</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> defeated attacks by Confederate <a href="General%20%28CSA%29">Gen.</a> <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>, halting Lee's invasion of the North.

After his success at <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Chancellorsville</a> in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> in May 1863, Lee led his army through the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a> to begin his second invasion of the North—the <a href="Gettysburg%20Campaign">Gettysburg Campaign</a>. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</a>, or even <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Prodded by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, Maj. Gen. <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a> moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.

Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. <a href="John%20Buford">John Buford</a>, and soon reinforced with two <a href="corps">corps</a> of Union <a href="infantry">infantry</a>. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south.

On the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at <a href="Little%20Round%20Top">Little Round Top</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg%2C%20Second%20Day%23Wheatfield">Wheatfield</a>, <a href="Devil%27s%20Den">Devil's Den</a>, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg%2C%20Second%20Day%23Peach%20Orchard">Peach Orchard</a>. On the Union right, Confederate <a href="demonstration%20%28military%29">demonstrations</a> escalated into full-scale assaults on <a href="Culp%27s%20Hill">Culp's Hill</a> and <a href="Cemetery%20Hill">Cemetery Hill</a>. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.

On the third day of battle, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on <a href="Cemetery%20Ridge">Cemetery Ridge</a>, known as <a href="Pickett%27s%20Charge">Pickett's Charge</a>. The charge was repulsed by Union <a href="Civil%20War%20rifles">rifle</a> and artillery fire, at great loss to the Confederate army.

Lee led his army on a torturous <a href="Retreat%20from%20Gettysburg">retreat back to Virginia</a>. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle, the most costly in US history.

On November 19, President Lincoln used the dedication ceremony for the <a href="Gettysburg%20National%20Cemetery">Gettysburg National Cemetery</a> to honor the fallen Union soldiers and redefine the purpose of the war in his historic <a href="Gettysburg%20Address">Gettysburg Address</a>.

Shortly after the Army of Northern Virginia won a major victory over the Army of the Potomac at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a> (April 30 – May 6, 1863), Robert E. Lee decided upon a second invasion of the North (the first was the unsuccessful <a href="Maryland%20Campaign">Maryland Campaign</a> of September 1862, which ended in the bloody <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>). Such a move would upset <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">U.S.</a> plans for the summer campaigning season and possibly reduce the pressure on the besieged Confederate garrison at <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg</a>. The invasion would allow the Confederates to live off the bounty of the rich Northern farms while giving war-ravaged <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> a much-needed rest. In addition, Lee's 72,000-man army could threaten Philadelphia, <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore</a>, and <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a>, and possibly strengthen the growing peace movement in the North.

Thus, on June 3, Lee's army began to shift northward from <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>. Following the death of <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson</a>, Lee reorganized his two large corps into three new corps, commanded by <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28CSA%29">Lt. Gen.</a> <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a> (First Corps), Lt. Gen. <a href="Richard%20S.%20Ewell">Richard S. Ewell</a> (Second), and Lt. Gen. <a href="A.P.%20Hill">A.P. Hill</a> (Third); both Ewell and Hill, who had formerly reported to Jackson as division commanders, were new to this level of responsibility. The Cavalry Division remained under the command of Maj. Gen. <a href="J.E.B.%20Stuart">J.E.B. Stuart</a>.

The Union Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>, consisted of seven infantry corps, a cavalry corps, and an Artillery Reserve, for a combined strength of more than 100,000 men.

The first major action of the campaign took place on June 9 between cavalry forces at <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandy%20Station">Brandy Station</a>, near <a href="Culpeper%2C%20Virginia">Culpeper, Virginia</a>. The 9,500 Confederate cavalrymen under Stuart were surprised by Maj. Gen. <a href="Alfred%20Pleasonton">Alfred Pleasonton</a>'s <a href="combined%20arms">combined arms</a> force of two cavalry divisions (8,000 troopers) and 3,000 infantry, but Stuart eventually repulsed the Union attack. The inconclusive battle, the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war, proved for the first time that the Union horse soldier was equal to his Southern counterpart.

By mid-June, the Army of Northern Virginia was poised to cross the Potomac River and enter <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. After defeating the U.S. garrisons at <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Winchester">Winchester</a> and <a href="Martinsburg%2C%20West%20Virginia">Martinsburg</a>, Ewell's Second Corps began crossing the river on June 15. Hill's and Longstreet's corps followed on June 24 and 25. Hooker's army pursued, keeping between the U.S. capital and Lee's army. The U.S. crossed the Potomac from June 25 to 27.

Lee gave strict orders for his army to minimize any negative impacts on the civilian population. Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America%20dollar">Confederate money</a> were not well received. Various towns, most notably <a href="York%2C%20Pennsylvania">York, Pennsylvania</a>, were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a>. A few of them were escaped fugitive <a href="History%20of%20slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a>, but most were freemen; all were sent south into slavery under guard.

On June 26, elements of Maj. Gen. <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a>'s division of Ewell's Corps occupied the town of Gettysburg after chasing off newly raised Pennsylvania <a href="militia">militia</a> in a series of minor skirmishes. Early laid the borough under tribute but did not collect any significant supplies. Soldiers burned several railroad cars and a <a href="covered%20bridge">covered bridge</a>, and destroyed nearby rails and <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a> lines. The following morning, Early departed for adjacent <a href="York%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">York County</a>.

Meanwhile, in a controversial move, Lee allowed J.E.B. Stuart to take a portion of the army's cavalry and ride around the east flank of the Union army. Lee's orders gave Stuart much latitude, and both generals share the blame for the long absence of Stuart's cavalry, as well as for the failure to assign a more active role to the cavalry left with the army. Stuart and his three best brigades were absent from the army during the crucial phase of the approach to Gettysburg and the first two days of battle. By June 29, Lee's army was strung out in an arc from <a href="Chambersburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Chambersburg</a> ( northwest of Gettysburg) to <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Pennsylvania">Carlisle</a> ( north of Gettysburg) to near <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a> and <a href="Wrightsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wrightsville</a> on the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a>.

In a dispute over the use of the forces defending the <a href="Harpers%20Ferry%2C%20West%20Virginia">Harpers Ferry</a> garrison, Hooker offered his resignation, and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and General-in-Chief <a href="Henry%20W.%20Halleck">Henry W. Halleck</a>, who were looking for an excuse to get rid of him, immediately accepted. They replaced Hooker early on the morning of June 28 with Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, then commander of the <a href="V%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">V Corps</a>.

On June 29, when Lee learned that the Army of the Potomac had crossed the Potomac River, he ordered a concentration of his forces around <a href="Cashtown-McKnightstown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Cashtown</a>, located at the eastern base of <a href="South%20Mountain%20%28Maryland%20and%20Pennsylvania%29">South Mountain</a> and west of Gettysburg. On June 30, while part of Hill's Corps was in Cashtown, one of Hill's brigades, North Carolinians under <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28CSA%29">Brig. Gen.</a> <a href="J.%20Johnston%20Pettigrew">J. Johnston Pettigrew</a>, ventured toward Gettysburg. In his memoirs, Maj. Gen. <a href="Henry%20Heth">Henry Heth</a>, Pettigrew's division commander, claimed that he sent Pettigrew to search for supplies in town—especially shoes.

When Pettigrew's troops approached Gettysburg on June 30, they noticed Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. <a href="John%20Buford">John Buford</a> arriving south of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth what he had seen, neither general believed that there was a substantial U.S. force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant <a href="Reconnaissance-in-force">reconnaissance in force</a> the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.

The <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>, initially under Maj. Gen. <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a> (Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20Meade">George Meade</a> replaced Hooker in command on June 28), consisted of more than 100,000 men in the following organization:

During the advance on Gettysburg, Maj. Gen. Reynolds was in operational command of the left, or advanced, wing of the Army, consisting of the I, III, and XI Corps. Note that many other Union units (not part of the Army of the Potomac) were actively involved in the Gettysburg Campaign, but not directly involved in the Battle of Gettysburg. These included portions of the Union <a href="IV%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">IV Corps</a>, the militia and state troops of the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Susquehanna">Department of the Susquehanna</a>, and various garrisons, including that at Harpers Ferry.
In reaction to the death of <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28CSA%29">Lt. Gen.</a> <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson</a> after Chancellorsville, Lee reorganized his <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> (75,000 men) from two infantry corps into three.

Anticipating that the Confederates would march on Gettysburg from the west on the morning of July 1, Buford laid out his defenses on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at <a href="Cemetery%20Hill">Cemetery Hill</a>, <a href="Cemetery%20Ridge">Cemetery Ridge</a>, and <a href="Culp%27s%20Hill">Culp's Hill</a>. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.
Heth's division advanced with two brigades forward, commanded by Brig. Gens. <a href="James%20J.%20Archer">James J. Archer</a> and <a href="Joseph%20R.%20Davis">Joseph R. Davis</a>. They proceeded easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. west of town, about 7:30 a.m. on July 1, the two brigades met light resistance from <a href="vedette%20%28sentry%29">vedettes</a> of Union cavalry, and deployed into line. According to lore, the Union soldier to fire the first shot of the battle was Lt. <a href="Marcellus%20Jones">Marcellus Jones</a>. In 1886 Lt. Jones returned to Gettysburg to mark the spot where he fired the first shot with a monument. Eventually, Heth's men reached dismounted troopers of Col. <a href="William%20Gamble%20%28USA%29">William Gamble's</a> cavalry brigade, who raised determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with fire from their breechloading <a href="carbine">carbine</a>s. Still, by 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had pushed the Union cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">I Corps</a> (Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20F.%20Reynolds">John F. Reynolds</a>) finally arrived.

North of the pike, Davis gained a temporary success against Brig. Gen. <a href="Lysander%20Cutler">Lysander Cutler</a>'s brigade but was repulsed with heavy losses in an action around an unfinished railroad bed cut in the ridge. South of the pike, Archer's brigade assaulted through Herbst (also known as McPherson's) Woods. The U.S. <a href="Iron%20Brigade">Iron Brigade</a> under Brig. Gen. <a href="Solomon%20Meredith">Solomon Meredith</a> enjoyed initial success against Archer, capturing several hundred men, including Archer himself.

General Reynolds was shot and killed early in the fighting while directing troop and artillery placements just to the east of the woods. Shelby Foote wrote that the Union cause lost a man considered by many to be "the best general in the army." Maj. Gen. <a href="Abner%20Doubleday">Abner Doubleday</a> assumed command. Fighting in the Chambersburg Pike area lasted until about 12:30 p.m. It resumed around 2:30 p.m., when Heth's entire division engaged, adding the brigades of Pettigrew and Col. <a href="John%20M.%20Brockenbrough">John M. Brockenbrough</a>.

As Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line, they flanked the 19th Indiana and drove the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest regiment in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By the end of the three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South. Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen. <a href="William%20Dorsey%20Pender">William Dorsey Pender</a>'s division to the assault, and the I Corps was driven back through the grounds of the <a href="Lutheran%20Theological%20Seminary%20at%20Gettysburg">Lutheran Seminary</a> and Gettysburg streets.

As the fighting to the west proceeded, two divisions of Ewell's Second Corps, marching west toward Cashtown in accordance with Lee's order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity, turned south on the Carlisle and Harrisburg roads toward Gettysburg, while the Union <a href="XI%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">XI Corps</a> (Maj. Gen. <a href="Oliver%20O.%20Howard">Oliver O. Howard</a>) raced north on the Baltimore Pike and Taneytown Road. By early afternoon, the U.S. line ran in a semicircle west, north, and northeast of Gettysburg.

However, the U.S. did not have enough troops; Cutler, whose brigade was deployed north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air. The leftmost division of the XI Corps was unable to deploy in time to strengthen the line, so Doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line.

Around 2 p.m., the Confederate Second Corps divisions of Maj. Gens. <a href="Robert%20E.%20Rodes">Robert E. Rodes</a> and Jubal Early assaulted and out-flanked the Union I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The Confederate brigades of Col. <a href="Edward%20A.%20O%27Neal">Edward A. O'Neal</a> and Brig. Gen. <a href="Alfred%20Iverson%2C%20Jr.">Alfred Iverson</a> suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of Brig. Gen. <a href="John%20C.%20Robinson">John C. Robinson</a> south of Oak Hill. Early's division profited from a blunder by Brig. Gen. <a href="Francis%20C.%20Barlow">Francis C. Barlow</a>, when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly north of town and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a <a href="Salient%20%28military%29">salient</a> in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran Barlow's division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.

As U.S. positions collapsed both north and west of town, Gen. Howard ordered a retreat to the high ground south of town at Cemetery Hill, where he had left the division of Brig. Gen. <a href="Adolph%20von%20Steinwehr">Adolph von Steinwehr</a> in reserve. Maj. Gen. <a href="Winfield%20S.%20Hancock">Winfield S. Hancock</a> assumed command of the battlefield, sent by Meade when he heard that Reynolds had been killed. Hancock, commander of the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">II Corps</a> and Meade's most trusted subordinate, was ordered to take command of the field and to determine whether Gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle. Hancock told Howard, "I think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle that I ever saw." When Howard agreed, Hancock concluded the discussion: "Very well, sir, I select this as the battle-field." Hancock's determination had a morale-boosting effect on the retreating Union soldiers, but he played no direct tactical role on the first day.

General Lee understood the defensive potential to the Union if they held this high ground. He sent orders to Ewell that Cemetery Hill be taken "if practicable." Ewell, who had previously served under Stonewall Jackson, a general well known for issuing peremptory orders, determined such an assault was not practicable and, thus, did not attempt it; this decision is considered by historians to be a great missed opportunity.

The first day at Gettysburg, more significant than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days, ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged. About one quarter of Meade's army (22,000 men) and one third of Lee's army (27,000) were engaged.

Throughout the evening of July 1 and morning of July 2, most of the remaining infantry of both armies arrived on the field, including the Union <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">II</a>, <a href="III%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">III</a>, <a href="V%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">V</a>, <a href="VI%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">VI</a>, and <a href="XII%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">XII Corps</a>. Two of Longstreet's brigades were on the road: Brig. Gen. <a href="George%20Pickett">George Pickett</a>, had begun the 22 mile (35 km) march from Chambersburg, while Brig. Gen. E. M. Law had begun the march from Guilford. Both arrived late in the morning. Law completed his 28-mile (45 km) march in eleven hours.

The Union line ran from Culp's Hill southeast of the town, northwest to Cemetery Hill just south of town, then south for nearly along Cemetery Ridge, terminating just north of Little Round Top. Most of the XII Corps was on Culp's Hill; the remnants of I and XI Corps defended Cemetery Hill; II Corps covered most of the northern half of Cemetery Ridge; and III Corps was ordered to take up a position to its flank. The shape of the Union line is popularly described as a "fishhook" formation.

The Confederate line paralleled the Union line about a mile (1,600 m) to the west on Seminary Ridge, ran east through the town, then curved southeast to a point opposite Culp's Hill. Thus, the Union army had interior lines, while the Confederate line was nearly long.

Lee's battle plan for July 2 called for a general assault of Meade's positions. On the right, Longstreet's First Corps was to position itself to attack the Union left flank, facing northeast astraddle the <a href="Emmitsburg">Emmitsburg</a> Road, and to roll up the U.S.line. The attack sequence was to begin with Maj. Gens. <a href="John%20Bell%20Hood">John Bell Hood</a>'s and <a href="Lafayette%20McLaws">Lafayette McLaws</a>'s divisions, followed by Maj. Gen. <a href="Richard%20H.%20Anderson">Richard H. Anderson</a>'s division of Hill's Third Corps.

On the left, Lee instructed Ewell to position his Second Corps to attack Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill when he heard the gunfire from Longstreet's assault, preventing Meade from shifting troops to bolster his left. Though it does not appear in either his or Lee's Official Report, Ewell claimed years later that Lee had changed the order to simultaneously attack, calling for only a "diversion", to be turned into a full-scale attack if a favorable opportunity presented itself.

Lee's plan, however, was based on faulty intelligence, exacerbated by Stuart's continued absence from the battlefield. Though Lee personally reconnoitered his left during the morning, he did not visit Longstreet's position on the Confederate right. Even so, Lee rejected suggestions that Longstreet move beyond Meade's left and attack the Union flank, capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking Meade's escape route.

Lee did not issue orders for the attack until 11:00 a.m. About noon, General Anderson's advancing troops were discovered by General Sickles' outpost guard and the Third Corps–upon which Longstreet's First Corps was to form–did not get into position until 1:00 p.m.

Hood and McLaws, after their long march, were not yet in position and did not launch their attacks until just after 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., respectively.

As Longstreet's left division, under Maj. Gen. <a href="Lafayette%20McLaws">Lafayette McLaws</a>, advanced, they unexpectedly found Maj. Gen. <a href="Daniel%20Sickles">Daniel Sickles</a>'s III Corps directly in their path. Sickles had been dissatisfied with the position assigned him on the southern end of Cemetery Ridge. Seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a half mile (800 m) to the west, he advanced his corps—without orders—to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Sherfy farm's peach orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. <a href="Andrew%20A.%20Humphreys">Andrew A. Humphreys</a>'s division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. <a href="David%20B.%20Birney">David B. Birney</a>'s division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively. The Confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 3:00 p.m. Meade was with Sickles at the time, urging Sickles to return to his assigned position.

Meade was forced to send 20,000 reinforcements: the entire V Corps, Brig. Gen. <a href="John%20C.%20Caldwell">John C. Caldwell</a>'s division of the II Corps, most of the XII Corps, and portions of the newly arrived VI Corps. Hood's division moved more to the east than intended, losing its alignment with the Emmitsburg Road, attacking Devil's Den and Little Round Top. McLaws, coming in on Hood's left, drove multiple attacks into the thinly stretched III Corps in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg%2C%20Second%20Day%23Wheatfield">Wheatfield</a> and overwhelmed them in Sherfy's <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg%2C%20Second%20Day%23Peach%20Orchard">Peach Orchard</a>. McLaws's attack eventually reached Plum Run Valley (the "Valley of Death") before being beaten back by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Reserves">Pennsylvania Reserves</a> division of the V Corps, moving down from Little Round Top. The III Corps was virtually destroyed as a combat unit in this battle, and Sickles's leg was amputated after it was shattered by a cannonball. Caldwell's division was destroyed piecemeal in the Wheatfield. Anderson's division, coming from McLaws's left and starting forward around 6 p.m., reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge, but could not hold the position in the face of counterattacks from the II Corps, including an almost suicidal bayonet charge by the <a href="1st%20Minnesota%20Volunteer%20Infantry">1st Minnesota</a> regiment against a Confederate brigade, ordered in desperation by Hancock to buy time for reinforcements to arrive.

As fighting raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. <a href="Strong%20Vincent">Strong Vincent</a> of V Corps had a precarious hold on Little Round Top, an important hill at the extreme left of the Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. <a href="Evander%20M.%20Law">Evander M. Law</a>'s brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. <a href="Gouverneur%20K.%20Warren">Gouverneur K. Warren</a>, had realized the importance of this position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the <a href="20th%20Maine%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">20th Maine</a>, ordered by Col. <a href="Joshua%20L.%20Chamberlain">Joshua L. Chamberlain</a> but possibly led by Lt. <a href="Holman%20S.%20Melcher">Holman S. Melcher</a>, was one of the most fabled episodes in the Civil War and propelled Col. Chamberlain into prominence after the war.

Ewell interpreted his orders as calling only for a cannonade. His 32 guns, along with A. P. Hill's 55 guns, engaged in a two-hour artillery barrage at extreme range that had little effect. Finally, about six o'clock, Ewell sent orders to each of his division commanders to attack the Union lines in his front.

Maj. Gen. <a href="Edward%20Johnson%20%28general%29">Edward "Allegheny" Johnson</a>'s Division "had not been pushed close to [Culp's Hill] in preparation for an assault, although one had been contemplated all day. It now had a full mile (1,600 m) to advance and Rock Creek had to be crossed. This could only be done at few places and involved much delay. Only three of Johnson's four brigades moved to the attack." Most of the hill's defenders, the Union XII Corps, had been sent to the left to defend against Longstreet's attacks, leaving only a brigade of New Yorkers under Brig. Gen. <a href="George%20S.%20Greene">George S. Greene</a> behind strong, newly constructed defensive works. With reinforcements from the I and XI Corps, Greene's men held off the Confederate attackers, though giving up some of the lower earthworks on the lower part of Culp's Hill.

Early was similarly unprepared when he ordered <a href="Harry%20T.%20Hays">Harry T. Hays</a>' and <a href="Isaac%20E.%20Avery">Isaac E. Avery</a>'s Brigades to attack the Union XI Corps positions on East Cemetery Hill. Once started, fighting was fierce: Col. <a href="Andrew%20L.%20Harris">Andrew L. Harris</a> of the Union 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, came under a withering attack, losing half his men. Avery was wounded early on, but the Confederates reached the crest of the hill and entered the Union breastworks, capturing one or two batteries. Seeing he was not supported on his right, Hays withdrew. His right was to be supported by <a href="Robert%20E.%20Rodes">Robert E. Rodes</a>' Division, but Rodes—like Early and Johnson—had not been ordered up in preparation for the attack. He had twice as far to travel as Early; by the time he came in contact with the Union skirmish line, Early's troops had already begun to withdraw.

<a href="Jeb%20Stuart">Jeb Stuart</a> and his three cavalry brigades arrived in Gettysburg around noon but had no role in the second day's battle. Brig. Gen. <a href="Wade%20Hampton%20III">Wade Hampton</a>'s brigade fought a minor engagement with newly promoted 23-year-old Brig. Gen. <a href="George%20Armstrong%20Custer">George Armstrong Custer</a>'s <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> cavalry near <a href="Battle%20of%20Hunterstown">Hunterstown</a> to the northeast of Gettysburg.

General Lee wished to renew the attack on Friday, July 3, using the same basic plan as the previous day: Longstreet would attack the U.S. left, while Ewell attacked Culp's Hill. However, before Longstreet was ready, Union XII Corps troops started a dawn artillery bombardment against the Confederates on Culp's Hill in an effort to regain a portion of their lost works. The Confederates attacked, and the second fight for Culp's Hill ended around 11 a.m. Harry Pfanz judged that, after some seven hours of bitter combat, "the Union line was intact and held more strongly than before."

Lee was forced to change his plans. Longstreet would command Pickett's Virginia division of his own First Corps, plus six brigades from Hill's Corps, in an attack on the U.S. II Corps position at the right center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Prior to the attack, all the artillery the Confederacy could bring to bear on the U.S. positions would bombard and weaken the enemy's line.

Much has been made over the years of General Longstreet's objections to General Lee's plan. In his memoirs, Longstreet described their discussion as follows:

Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns began an artillery bombardment that was probably the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. <a href="Henry%20Jackson%20Hunt">Henry Jackson Hunt</a>, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.

Around 3 p.m., the cannon fire subsided, and 12,500 Southern soldiers stepped from the ridgeline and advanced the three-quarters of a mile (1,200 m) to Cemetery Ridge in what is known to history as "<a href="Pickett%27s%20Charge">Pickett's Charge</a>". As the Confederates approached, there was fierce flanking artillery fire from Union positions on Cemetery Hill and north of Little Round Top, and musket and canister fire from Hancock's II Corps. In the Union center, the commander of artillery had held fire during the Confederate bombardment (in order to save it for the infantry assault, which Meade had correctly predicted the day before), leading Southern commanders to believe the Northern cannon batteries had been knocked out. However, they opened fire on the Confederate infantry during their approach with devastating results. Nearly one half of the attackers did not return to their own lines.

Although the U.S. line wavered and broke temporarily at a jog called the "Angle" in a low stone fence, just north of a patch of vegetation called the Copse of Trees, reinforcements rushed into the breach, and the Confederate attack was repulsed. The farthest advance of Brig. Gen. <a href="Lewis%20A.%20Armistead">Lewis A. Armistead</a>'s brigade of Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20Pickett">George Pickett</a>'s division at the Angle is referred to as the "<a href="High-water%20mark%20of%20the%20Confederacy">High-water mark of the Confederacy</a>", arguably representing the closest the South ever came to its goal of achieving independence from the Union via military victory. Union and Confederate soldiers locked in hand-to-hand combat, attacking with their rifles, bayonets, rocks and even their bare hands. Armistead ordered his Confederates to turn two captured cannons against Union troops, but discovered that there was no ammunition left, the last <a href="Canister%20shot">double canister</a> shots having been used against the charging Confederates. Armistead was wounded shortly afterward three times.

There were two significant cavalry engagements on July 3. Stuart was sent to guard the Confederate left flank and was to be prepared to exploit any success the infantry might achieve on Cemetery Hill by flanking the U.S. right and hitting their trains and lines of communications. east of Gettysburg, in what is now called "East Cavalry Field" (not shown on the accompanying map, but between the York and Hanover Roads), Stuart's forces collided with U.S. cavalry: Brig. Gen. <a href="David%20McMurtrie%20Gregg">David McMurtrie Gregg</a>'s division and Brig. Gen. Custer's brigade. A lengthy mounted battle, including hand-to-hand sabre combat, ensued. Custer's charge, leading the 1st Michigan Cavalry, blunted the attack by <a href="Wade%20Hampton%20III">Wade Hampton's</a> brigade, blocking Stuart from achieving his objectives in the U.S. rear.

Meanwhile, after hearing news of the day's victory, Brig. Gen. <a href="Judson%20Kilpatrick">Judson Kilpatrick</a> launched a cavalry attack against the infantry positions of Longstreet's Corps southwest of <a href="Big%20Round%20Top">Big Round Top</a>. Brig. Gen. <a href="Elon%20J.%20Farnsworth">Elon J. Farnsworth</a> protested against the futility of such a move, but obeyed orders. Farnsworth was killed in the attack, and his brigade suffered significant losses.

The two armies suffered between 46,000 and 51,000 casualties. Union casualties were 23,055 (3,155 killed, 14,531 wounded, 5,369 captured or missing), while Confederate casualties are more difficult to estimate. Many authors have referred to as many as "28,000 Confederate casualties", and Busey and Martin's more recent 2005 work, "Regimental Strengths and Losses at Gettysburg", documents 23,231 (4,708 killed, 12,693 wounded, 5,830 captured or missing). Nearly a third of Lee's general officers were killed, wounded, or captured. The casualties for both sides during the entire campaign were 57,225.

In addition to being the deadliest battle of the war in terms of total casualties, Gettysburg also had the highest number of Generals killed in action of any battle in the war. The Confederacy lost generals <a href="Paul%20Jones%20Semmes">Paul Jones Semmes</a>, <a href="William%20Barksdale">William Barksdale</a>, <a href="Richard%20B.%20Garnett">Richard Garnett</a>, and <a href="Lewis%20Armistead">Lewis Armistead</a>, as well as <a href="J.%20Johnston%20Pettigrew">J. Johnston Pettigrew</a> during the retreat after the battle. The Union lost Generals <a href="John%20F.%20Reynolds">John Reynolds</a>, <a href="Samuel%20K.%20Zook">Samuel K. Zook</a>, <a href="Stephen%20H.%20Weed">Stephen H. Weed</a>, and <a href="Elon%20J.%20Farnsworth">Elon J. Farnsworth</a>, as well as <a href="Strong%20Vincent">Strong Vincent</a>, who after being mortally wounded was given a deathbed promotion to brigadier general. Additional senior officer casualties included the wounding of Union Generals <a href="Dan%20Sickles">Dan Sickles</a> (lost a leg), <a href="Francis%20C.%20Barlow">Francis C. Barlow</a>, and <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>. For the Confederacy, Major General <a href="John%20Bell%20Hood">John Bell Hood</a> lost the use of his left arm, while Major General <a href="Henry%20Heth">Henry Heth</a> received a shot to the head on the first day of battle (though incapacitated for the rest of the battle, he remarkably survived without long term injuries, credited in part due to his hat stuffed full of paper dispatches). Confederate Generals <a href="James%20Kemper">James Kemper</a> and <a href="Isaac%20R.%20Trimble">Isaac R. Trimble</a> were severely wounded during Pickett's charge and captured during the Confederate retreat. General <a href="James%20J.%20Archer">James J. Archer</a>, in command of a brigade that most likely was responsible for killing Reynolds, was taken prisoner shortly after Reynolds' death.

The following tables summarize casualties by corps for the Union and Confederate forces during the three-day battle.

<a href="Bruce%20Catton">Bruce Catton</a> wrote, "The town of Gettysburg looked as if some universal moving day had been interrupted by catastrophe." But there was only one documented civilian death during the battle: <a href="Ginnie%20Wade">Ginnie Wade</a> (also widely known as Jennie), 20 years old, was hit by a stray bullet that passed through her kitchen in town while she was making bread. Another notable civilian casualty was <a href="John%20L.%20Burns">John L. Burns</a>, a 69-year old veteran of the War of 1812 who walked to the front lines on the first day of battle and participated in heavy combat as a volunteer, receiving numerous wounds in the process. Despite his age and injuries, Burns survived the battle and lived until 1872. Nearly 8,000 had been killed outright; these bodies, lying in the hot summer sun, needed to be buried quickly. Over 3,000 horse carcasses were burned in a series of piles south of town; townsfolk became violently ill from the stench. Meanwhile, the town of Gettysburg, with its population of just 2,400, found itself tasked with taking care of 14,000 wounded Union troops and an additional 8,000 Confederate prisoners.

The armies stared at one another in a heavy rain across the bloody fields on July 4, the same day that the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vicksburg">Vicksburg</a> garrison surrendered to Maj. Gen. <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.

Lee started his Army of Northern Virginia in motion late the evening of July 4 towards <a href="Fairfield%2C%20Pennsylvania">Fairfield</a> and Chambersburg. Cavalry under Brig. Gen. <a href="John%20D.%20Imboden">John D. Imboden</a> was entrusted to escort the miles-long wagon train of supplies and wounded men that Lee wanted to take back to Virginia with him, using the route through Cashtown and Hagerstown to <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Maryland">Williamsport, Maryland</a>. Meade's army followed, although the pursuit was half-spirited. The recently rain-swollen Potomac trapped Lee's army on the north bank of the river for a time, but when the Union troops finally caught up, the Confederates had forded the river. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Williamsport">rear-guard action at Falling Waters</a> on July 14 added some more names to the long casualty lists, including General Pettigrew, who was mortally wounded. General <a href="James%20Kemper">James Kemper</a>, severely wounded during Pickett's charge, was captured during Lee's retreat.

In a brief letter to Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck written on July 7, Lincoln remarked on the two major Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. He continued:

Halleck then relayed the contents of Lincoln's letter to Meade in a telegram. Despite repeated pleas from Lincoln and Halleck, which continued over the next week, Meade did not pursue Lee's army aggressively enough to destroy it before it crossed back over the Potomac River to safety in the South. The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor <a href="Battle%20of%20Manassas%20Gap">Battle of Manassas Gap</a>, after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions across from each other on the <a href="Rappahannock%20River">Rappahannock River</a>.

The news of the Union victory electrified the North. A headline in "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>" proclaimed "VICTORY! <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">WATERLOO</a> ECLIPSED!" New York diarist <a href="George%20Templeton%20Strong">George Templeton Strong</a> wrote:

However, the Union enthusiasm soon dissipated as the public realized that Lee's army had escaped destruction and the war would continue. Lincoln complained to Secretary of the Navy <a href="Gideon%20Welles">Gideon Welles</a> that "Our army held the war in the hollow of their hand and they would not close it!" Brig. Gen. <a href="Alexander%20S.%20Webb">Alexander S. Webb</a> wrote to his father on July 17, stating that such Washington politicians as "<a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Chase</a>, <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">Seward</a> and others," disgusted with Meade, "write to me that Lee really won that Battle!"

In fact, the Confederates had lost militarily and also politically. During the final hours of the battle, Confederate Vice President <a href="Alexander%20Stephens">Alexander Stephens</a> was approaching the Union lines at <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, under a <a href="White%20flag">flag of truce</a>. Although his formal instructions from <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate President</a> <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> had limited his powers to negotiate on prisoner exchanges and other procedural matters, historian <a href="James%20M.%20McPherson">James M. McPherson</a> speculates that he had informal goals of presenting peace overtures. Davis had hoped that Stephens would reach Washington from the south while Lee's victorious army was marching toward it from the north. President Lincoln, upon hearing of the Gettysburg results, refused Stephens's request to pass through the lines. Furthermore, when the news reached London, any lingering hopes of European recognition of the Confederacy were finally abandoned. <a href="Henry%20Brooks%20Adams">Henry Adams</a> wrote, "The disasters of the rebels are unredeemed by even any hope of success. It is now conceded that all idea of intervention is at an end."

Compounding the effects of the defeat would be end of the <a href="Siege%20of%20Vicksburg">Siege of Vicksburg</a>, which surrendered to Grant's Federal armies in the West on July 4, the day after the Gettysburg battle.

The immediate reaction of the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2–3, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac that could have been a disaster was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them for the rest of the year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned "rather sooner than I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished what I proposed on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac." He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, "Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that "that army" will be as quiet as a sucking dove." Some Southern publications, such as the "Charleston Mercury", criticized Lee's actions in the campaign and on August 8, he offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.

Gettysburg became a postbellum focus of the <a href="Lost%20Cause%20of%20the%20Confederacy">"Lost Cause"</a>, a movement by writers such as Edward A. Pollard and Jubal Early to explain the reasons for the Confederate defeat in the war. A fundamental premise of their argument was that the South was doomed because of the overwhelming advantage in manpower and industrial might possessed by the North. However, they claim it also suffered because Robert E. Lee, who up until this time had been almost invincible, was betrayed by the failures of some of his key subordinates at Gettysburg: Ewell, for failing to seize Cemetery Hill on July 1; Stuart, for depriving the army of cavalry intelligence for a key part of the campaign; and especially Longstreet, for failing to attack on July 2 as early and as forcefully as Lee had originally intended. In this view, Gettysburg was seen as a great lost opportunity, in which a decisive victory by Lee could have meant the end of the war in the Confederacy's favor.

After the war, General Pickett was asked why Confederates lost at Gettysburg. He replied "I always thought the Yankees had something to do with it."

The ravages of war were still evident in Gettysburg more than four months later when, on November 19, the <a href="Soldiers%27%20National%20Cemetery">Soldiers' National Cemetery</a> was dedicated. During this ceremony, President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> honored the fallen and redefined the purpose of the war in his historic <a href="Gettysburg%20Address">Gettysburg Address</a>.

The nature of the result of the Battle of Gettysburg has been the subject of controversy for years. Although not seen as overwhelmingly significant at the time, particularly since the war continued for almost two years, in retrospect it has often been cited as the <a href="Turning%20point%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">"turning point"</a>, usually in combination with the fall of Vicksburg the following day. This is based on the observation that after Gettysburg Lee's army conducted no more strategic offensives—his army merely reacted to the initiative of <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> in 1864 and 1865—and by the speculative viewpoint of the Lost Cause writers that a Confederate victory at Gettysburg might have resulted in the end of the war.
It is currently a widely held view that Gettysburg was a <a href="decisive%20victory">decisive victory</a> for the Union, but the term is considered imprecise. It is inarguable that Lee's offensive on July 3 was turned back decisively and his campaign in Pennsylvania was terminated prematurely (although the Confederates at the time argued that this was a temporary setback and that the goals of the campaign were largely met). However, when the more common definition of "decisive victory" is intended—an indisputable military victory of a battle that determines or significantly influences the ultimate result of a conflict—historians are divided. For example, <a href="David%20J.%20Eicher">David J. Eicher</a> called Gettysburg a "strategic loss for the Confederacy" and <a href="James%20M.%20McPherson">James M. McPherson</a> wrote that "Lee and his men would go on to earn further laurels. But they never again possessed the power and reputation they carried into Pennsylvania those palmy summer days of 1863."

However, Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote that the "strategic impact of the Battle of Gettysburg was ... fairly limited." Steven E. Woodworth wrote that "Gettysburg proved only the near impossibility of decisive action in the Eastern theater." Edwin Coddington pointed out the heavy toll on the Army of the Potomac and that "after the battle Meade no longer possessed a truly effective instrument for the accomplishments of his task. The army needed a thorough reorganization with new commanders and fresh troops, but these changes were not made until Grant appeared on the scene in March 1864." Joseph T. Glatthaar wrote that "Lost opportunities and near successes plagued the Army of Northern Virginia during its Northern invasion," yet after Gettysburg, "without the distractions of duty as an invading force, without the breakdown of discipline, the Army of Northern Virginia [remained] an extremely formidable force." <a href="Ed%20Bearss">Ed Bearss</a> wrote, "Lee's invasion of the North had been a costly failure. Nevertheless, at best the Army of the Potomac had simply preserved the strategic stalemate in the Eastern Theater ..." Furthermore, the Confederacy soon proved it was still capable of winning significant victories over the Northern forces in both the East (<a href="Battle%20of%20Cold%20Harbor">Battle of Cold Harbor</a>) and West (<a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a>).

Peter Carmichael refers to the military context for the armies, the "horrendous losses at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, which effectively destroyed Lee's offensive capacity," implying that these cumulative losses were not the result of a single battle. Thomas Goss, writing in the U.S. Army's "Military Review" journal on the definition of "decisive" and the application of that description to Gettysburg, concludes: "For all that was decided and accomplished, the Battle of Gettysburg fails to earn the label 'decisive battle'." The military historian <a href="John%20Keegan">John Keegan</a> agrees. Gettysburg was a landmark battle, the largest of the war and it would not be surpassed. The Union had restored to it the belief in certain victory, and the loss dispirited the Confederacy. If "not exactly a decisive battle", Gettysburg was the end of Confederate use of Northern Virginia as a military buffer zone, the setting for Grant's <a href="Overland%20Campaign">Overland Campaign</a>.

Prior to Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee had established a reputation as an almost invincible general, achieving stunning victories against superior numbers—although usually at the cost of high casualties to his army—during the <a href="Seven%20Days%20Battles">Seven Days</a>, the <a href="Northern%20Virginia%20Campaign">Northern Virginia Campaign</a> (including the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>), <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Fredericksburg</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Chancellorsville</a>. Only the <a href="Maryland%20Campaign">Maryland Campaign</a>, with its tactically inconclusive <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>, had been less than successful. Therefore, historians have attempted to explain how Lee's winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at Gettysburg. Although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and Lee's reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals, the major factors in Lee's loss arguably can be attributed to: (1) his overconfidence in the invincibility of his men; (2) the performance of his subordinates, and his management thereof; (3) his failing health, and (4) the performance of his opponent, George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac.
Throughout the campaign, Lee was influenced by the belief that his men were invincible; most of Lee's experiences with the Army of Northern Virginia had convinced him of this, including the great victory at Chancellorsville in early May and the rout of the Union troops at Gettysburg on July 1. Since morale plays an important role in military victory when other factors are equal, Lee did not want to dampen his army's desire to fight and resisted suggestions, principally by Longstreet, to withdraw from the recently captured Gettysburg to select a ground more favorable to his army. War correspondent Peter W. Alexander wrote that Lee "acted, probably, under the impression that his troops were able to carry any position however formidable. If such was the case, he committed an error, such however as the ablest commanders will sometimes fall into." Lee himself concurred with this judgment, writing to President Davis, "No blame can be attached to the army for its failure to accomplish what was projected by me, nor should it be censured for the unreasonable expectations of the public—I am alone to blame, in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor."

The most controversial assessments of the battle involve the performance of Lee's subordinates. The dominant theme of the Lost Cause writers and many other historians is that Lee's senior generals failed him in crucial ways, directly causing the loss of the battle; the alternative viewpoint is that Lee did not manage his subordinates adequately, and did not thereby compensate for their shortcomings. Two of his corps commanders—<a href="Richard%20S.%20Ewell">Richard S. Ewell</a> and <a href="A.P.%20Hill">A.P. Hill</a>—had only recently been promoted and were not fully accustomed to Lee's style of command, in which he provided only general objectives and guidance to their former commander, <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a>; Jackson translated these into detailed, specific orders to his division commanders. All four of Lee's principal commanders received criticism during the campaign and battle:
In addition to Hill's illness, Lee's performance was affected by heart troubles, which would eventually lead to his death in 1870; he had been diagnosed with <a href="pericarditis">pericarditis</a> by his staff physicians in March 1863, though modern doctors believe he had in fact suffered a heart attack. He wrote to Jefferson Davis that his physical condition prevented him from offering full supervision in the field, and said, "I am so dull that in making use of the eyes of others I am frequently misled."

As a final factor, Lee faced a new and formidable opponent in <a href="George%20G.%20Meade">George G. Meade</a>, and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as <a href="Winfield%20S.%20Hancock">Winfield S. Hancock</a> to make decisions where and when they were needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the battle in the face of fierce Confederate attacks.

Lee was quoted before the battle as saying Meade "would commit no blunders on my front and if I make one ... will make haste to take advantage of it." That prediction proved to be correct at Gettysburg. Stephen Sears wrote, "The fact of the matter is that George G. Meade, unexpectedly and against all odds, thoroughly outgeneraled Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg." Edwin B. Coddington wrote that the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac received a "sense of triumph which grew into an imperishable faith in [themselves]. The men knew what they could do under an extremely competent general; one of lesser ability and courage could well have lost the battle."

Meade had his own detractors as well. Similar to the situation with Lee, Meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at Gettysburg, but he had the misfortune of experiencing them in person. Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>, lambasted Meade before the <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a>'s <a href="Joint%20Committee%20on%20the%20Conduct%20of%20the%20War">Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War</a>, where <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> suspected that Meade was a <a href="Copperheads%20%28politics%29">Copperhead</a> and tried in vain to relieve him from command. <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Sickles">Daniel E. Sickles</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Butterfield">Daniel Butterfield</a> accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. Most politicians, including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his half-hearted pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates—<a href="Winfield%20S.%20Hancock">Winfield S. Hancock</a>, <a href="John%20Gibbon">John Gibbon</a>, <a href="Gouverneur%20K.%20Warren">Gouverneur K. Warren</a>, and <a href="Henry%20J.%20Hunt">Henry J. Hunt</a>, all heroes of the battle—defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.

Today, the <a href="Gettysburg%20National%20Cemetery">Gettysburg National Cemetery</a> and <a href="Gettysburg%20Battlefield">Gettysburg National Military Park</a> are maintained by the <a href="U.S.%20National%20Park%20Service">U.S. National Park Service</a> as two of the nation's most revered historical landmarks. Although Gettysburg is one of the best known of all Civil War battlefields, it too faces threats to its preservation and interpretation. Many historically significant locations on the battlefield lie outside the boundaries of <a href="Gettysburg%20Battlefield">Gettysburg National Military Park</a> and are vulnerable to residential or commercial development.

On July 20, 2009, a Comfort Inn and Suites opened on <a href="Cemetery%20Hill">Cemetery Hill</a>, adjacent to <a href="Evergreen%20Cemetery%20%28Adams%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania%29">Evergreen Cemetery</a>, just one of many modern edifices infringing on the historic field. The Baltimore Pike corridor attracts development that concerns preservationists.

Some preservation successes have emerged in recent years. Two proposals to open a casino at Gettysburg were defeated in 2006 and most recently in 2011, when public pressure forced the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Gaming%20Control%20Board">Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board</a> to reject the proposed gambling hub at the intersection of Routes 15 and 30, near <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg%2C%20Third%20Day%20cavalry%20battles">East Cavalry Field</a>. The <a href="Civil%20War%20Trust">Civil War Trust</a> also successfully purchased and transferred 95 acres at the former site of the Gettysburg Country Club to the control of the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">U.S. Department of the Interior</a> in 2011.

Less than half of the over 11,500 acres on the old Gettysburg Battlefield have been preserved for posterity thus far. The Civil War Trust has preserved 815 acres around the site, some of which is now part of the 4,998 acres of Gettysburg National Military Park.

During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War%20Centennial">Civil War Centennial</a>, the U.S. Post Office issued five postage stamps commemorating the 100th anniversaries of famous battles, as they occurred over a four-year period, beginning with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">Battle of Fort Sumter</a> Centennial issue of 1961. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> commemorative stamp was issued in 1962, the Battle of Gettysburg in 1963, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Wilderness">Battle of the Wilderness</a> in 1964, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House">Appomattox</a> Centennial commemorative stamp in 1965.

A <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative half dollar</a> for the battle was produced in 1936. As was typical for the period, mintage for <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg%20half%20dollar">the coin</a> was very low, just 26,928. On January 24, 2011, the <a href="America%20the%20Beautiful%20quarters">America the Beautiful quarters</a> released a 25-cent coin commemorating Gettysburg National Military Park and the Battle of Gettysburg. The reverse side of the coin depicts the monument on Cemetery Ridge to the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry.
Film records survive of two Gettysburg reunions, held on the battlefield. At the 50th anniversary (1913), veterans re-enacted Pickett's Charge in a spirit of reconciliation, a meeting that carried great emotional force for both sides. At the <a href="1938%20Gettysburg%20reunion">75th anniversary (1938)</a>, 2500 veterans attended, and there was a ceremonial mass hand-shake across a stone wall. This was recorded on sound film, and some Confederates can be heard giving the <a href="Rebel%20Yell">Rebel Yell</a>.

<a href="Iced%20Earth">Iced Earth</a>'s three-part <a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a> "<a href="Gettysburg%20%281863%29">Gettysburg (1863)</a>", published in 2004, dramatizes the battle.

The Battle of Gettysburg was depicted in the 1993 film "<a href="Gettysburg%20%281993%20film%29">Gettysburg</a>", based on <a href="Michael%20Shaara">Michael Shaara</a>'s 1974 novel "<a href="The%20Killer%20Angels">The Killer Angels</a>".

Budweiser

Budweiser () is an <a href="American%20lager">American-style</a> <a href="pale%20lager">pale lager</a> produced by <a href="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a>, currently part of the multinational corporation <a href="Anheuser-Busch%20InBev">Anheuser-Busch InBev</a>. Introduced in 1876 by Carl Conrad & Co. of <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, it has grown to become one of the largest selling <a href="beers%20in%20the%20United%20States">beers in the United States</a>, and is available in over 80 markets worldwidethough, due to a <a href="Budweiser%20trademark%20dispute">trademark dispute</a>, does not necessarily do so under the Budweiser name. It is made with up to 30% rice in addition to <a href="hops">hops</a> and <a href="barley">barley</a> <a href="malt">malt</a>. Produced in various breweries around the world, Budweiser is a <a href="filtered%20beer">filtered beer</a> available in <a href="draught%20beer">draft</a> and packaged forms.

Anheuser–Busch has been involved in a trademark dispute with European beer companies, in particular the <a href="Budweiser%20Budvar%20Brewery">Budweiser Budvar Brewery</a> of <a href="%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9%20Bud%C4%9Bjovice">České Budějovice</a>, Czech Republic, over the trademark rights to the name "Budweiser". Beer has been brewed in České Budějovice (known as "Budweis" in German) since it was founded by King <a href="Ottokar%20II%20of%20Bohemia">Ottokar II of Bohemia</a> in 1245. The name Budweiser is a derivative adjective, meaning "of Budweis". In 1876, <a href="Adolphus%20Busch">Adolphus Busch</a> and his friend Carl Conrad, a liquor importer, developed a "Bohemian-style" lager in the United States, inspired after a trip to the region.

In the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, excluding the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, the American beer is marketed as "Bud", as the Budweiser trademark name is owned solely by the Czech beer maker, <a href="Budweiser%20Budvar">Budweiser Budvar</a>.

In 2008, Anheuser-Busch had a market share in the United States of 50.9% for all beers sold. Budweiser brands account for about half of Anheuser-Busch's sales volume, a figure which has been steadily declining at 1½-2% per year. In 2008, the Belgian-Brazilian beer giant <a href="InBev">InBev</a> bought the majority of Anheuser-Busch stock at $70 per share in an all-cash agreement, creating the largest brewing company in the world.

Anheuser-Busch advertises the Budweiser brand heavily, expending $449 million in 2012 in the United States. This made it the most advertised beverage brand in America and accounted for a third of the company's US marketing budget.

The Budweiser from Budějovice has been called "The Beer of Kings" since the 16th century. Adolphus Busch adapted this slogan to "The King Of Beers."

This history notwithstanding, Anheuser Busch owns the trademark to both slogans in the United States.

In 2010, the Bud Light brand paid $1 billion for a six-year licensing agreement with the <a href="NFL">NFL</a>. Budweiser pays $20 million annually for <a href="MLB">MLB</a> licensing rights.

Budweiser has produced a number of TV advertisements, such as the <a href="Budweiser%20Frogs">Budweiser Frogs</a>, lizards impersonating the Budweiser frogs, a campaign built around the phrase "<a href="Whassup%3F">Whassup?</a>", and a team of <a href="Clydesdale%20horse">Clydesdale horse</a>s commonly known as the <a href="Budweiser%20Clydesdales">Budweiser Clydesdales</a>.

Budweiser also advertises extensively in motorsports, from <a href="Bernie%20Little">Bernie Little</a>'s <a href="Miss%20Budweiser">Miss Budweiser</a> hydroplane boat to sponsorship of the Budweiser King Top Fuel Dragster driven by Brandon Bernstein. Anheuser-Busch has sponsored the <a href="Champ%20Car">CART</a> championship. It is the "Official Beer of <a href="NHRA">NHRA</a>" and it was the "Official Beer of <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a>" from 1998 to 2007. It has sponsored motorsport events such as the <a href="Daytona%20Speedweeks">Daytona Speedweeks</a>, <a href="Budweiser%20Shootout">Budweiser Shootout</a>, <a href="Budweiser%20Duel">Budweiser Duel</a>, <a href="Budweiser%20Pole%20Award">Budweiser Pole Award</a>, <a href="Budweiser%20500%20%28Spring%20Dover%29">Budweiser 500</a>, <a href="Budweiser%20400">Budweiser 400</a>, <a href="Budweiser%20300">Budweiser 300</a>, <a href="Budweiser%20250">Budweiser 250</a>, <a href="Budweiser%20200%20%28Dover%29">Budweiser 200</a>, and <a href="Carolina%20Pride%20/%20Budweiser%20200">Carolina Pride / Budweiser 200</a>. However, starting in 2016, the focus of A-B's NASCAR sponsorship became its Busch brand.

Budweiser has been sponsor of NASCAR teams such as <a href="Junior%20Johnson">Junior Johnson</a>, <a href="Hendrick%20Motorsports">Hendrick Motorsports</a>, <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%2C%20Inc.">DEI</a>, and <a href="Stewart-Haas%20Racing">Stewart-Haas Racing</a>. Sponsored drivers include <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%2C%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt, Jr.</a> (1999-2007), <a href="Kasey%20Kahne">Kasey Kahne</a> (2008-2010), and <a href="Kevin%20Harvick">Kevin Harvick</a> (2011–2015). In <a href="IndyCar">IndyCar</a>, Budweiser sponsored <a href="Mario%20Andretti">Mario Andretti</a> (1983-1984), <a href="Bobby%20Rahal">Bobby Rahal</a> (1985-1988), <a href="Scott%20Pruett">Scott Pruett</a> (1989-1992), <a href="Roberto%20Guerrero">Roberto Guerrero</a> (1993), <a href="Scott%20Goodyear">Scott Goodyear</a> (1994), <a href="Paul%20Tracy">Paul Tracy</a> (1995), <a href="Christian%20Fittipaldi">Christian Fittipaldi</a> (1996-1997), and <a href="Richie%20Hearn">Richie Hearn</a> (1998-1999).

Anheuser-Busch has placed Budweiser as an official partner and sponsor of <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> and <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Galaxy">Los Angeles Galaxy</a> and was the headline sponsor of the <a href="British%20Basketball%20League">British Basketball League</a> in the 1990s. Anheuser-Busch has also placed Budweiser as an official sponsor of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> and the presenting sponsor of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>.

In the early 20th century, the company commissioned a play-on-words song called "<a href="Under%20the%20Anheuser%20Bush">Under the Anheuser Bush</a>," which was recorded by several early phonograph companies.

In 2009, Anheuser-Busch partnered with popular Chinese <a href="video-sharing">video-sharing</a> site, <a href="Tudou.com">Tudou.com</a> for a user-generated online video contest. The contest encourages users to suggest ideas that include ants for a Bud TV spot set to run in February 2010 during the <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">Chinese New Year</a>.

In 2010, Budweiser produced an online reality TV series, called "Bud House," centered around the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a> in South Africa, following the lives of 32 international football fans (one representing each nation in the World Cup) living together in a house in South Africa.

On November 5, 2012, Anheuser-Busch asked <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> to obscure or remove the Budweiser logo from the film "<a href="Flight%20%282012%20film%29">Flight</a>" (2012), directed by <a href="Robert%20Zemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a> and starring <a href="Denzel%20Washington">Denzel Washington</a>.

In an advertisement titled "Brewed the Hard Way" that aired during <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLIX">Super Bowl XLIX</a>, Budweiser touted itself as "Proudly A Macro Beer", distinguishing it from smaller production <a href="Microbrewery%23Craft%20brewing">craft beers</a>.

In 2016, Beer Park by Budweiser opened on the Las Vegas Strip.

Over the years, Budweiser has been distributed in many sizes and containers. Until the early 1950s Budweiser was primarily distributed in three packages: <a href="keg">keg</a>s, bottles and bottles. Cans were first introduced in 1936, which helped sales to climb. In 1955 August Busch Jr. made a strategic move to expand Budweiser's national brand and distributor presence. Along with this expansion came advances in bottling automation, new bottling materials and more efficient distribution methods. These advances brought to market many new containers and package designs. Budweiser is distributed in four large container volumes: half-barrel kegs (), quarter-barrel kegs (), 1/6 barrel kegs () and "beer balls". Budweiser produces a variety of cans and <a href="beer%20bottle">bottles</a> ranging from . On August 3, 2011, Anheuser-Busch announced its twelfth can design since 1936, one which emphasizes the <a href="bowtie">bowtie</a>.

Packages are sometimes tailored to local customs and traditions. In <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20County">St. Mary's County</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, ten ounce cans are the preferred package.

The Budweiser bottle has remained relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1876. A small label is affixed to the neck of the bottle with the Budweiser "bow-tie" logo. The main label is red with a white box in the center, overlaid with a Budweiser logo resembling a <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>, with the word "Budweiser" below it.

In attempt to re-stimulate interest in their beer after the repeal of Prohibition, Budweiser began canning their beer in 1936. This new packaging led to an increase in sales which lasted until the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in 1939.

Over the years, Budweiser cans have undergone various design changes in response to market conditions and consumer tastes. Since 1936, 12 major can design changes have occurred, not including the temporary special edition designs.

Budweiser cans have traditionally displayed patriotic American symbols, such a eagles and the colors red, white, and blue. In 2011, there was a branding redesign of that eliminated some of the traditional imagery. The new design was largely in response to the huge decline in sales threatening Budweiser's status as America's best-selling beer. In order to regain the domestic market share that Budweiser has lost, the company tried to update its appearance by giving the can a more contemporary look. The company hopes that the new design will offset the effects that unemployment had on its sales. Although the more modern design is intended for young male Americans, the new design was also part of an attempt to focus on the international market. Budweiser began selling its beer in Russia in 2010, and is currently expanding its operations in China.

Budweiser is brewed using <a href="barley">barley</a> malt, rice, water, <a href="hops">hops</a> and <a href="yeast">yeast</a>. It is lagered with <a href="beech">beech</a>wood chips in the aging vessel. While beechwood chips are used in the maturation tank, there is little to no flavor contribution from the wood, mainly because they are boiled in <a href="sodium%20bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a> [baking soda] for seven hours for the very purpose of removing any flavor from the wood. The maturation tanks that Anheuser-Busch uses are horizontal and, as such, <a href="flocculation">flocculation</a> of the yeast occurs much more quickly. Anheuser-Busch refers to this process as a secondary fermentation, with the idea being that the chips give the yeast more surface area to rest on. This is also combined with a <a href="Brewing%23Conditioning">krausening</a> procedure that re-introduces wort into the chip tank, therefore reactivating the fermentation process. By placing the beechwood chips at the bottom of the tank, the yeast remains in suspension longer, giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors, such as <a href="acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a> and <a href="diacetyl">diacetyl</a>, that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability.
Some drinkers prefer the lightness of beers like Budweiser and consume it as a refreshment or for its inebriating effects. Several beer writers consider it to be bland. The beer is light-bodied with faint sweet notes and negligible bitterness, leading to reviews characterizing it as a "...beer of underwhelming blandness." Even Adolphus Busch disliked the beer he marketed in the United States. But based upon sales alone, it became the second most popular American brewed <a href="pale%20lager">pale lager</a> among North American beer consumers.

Budweiser and "Bud Light" are sometimes advertised as <a href="vegan">vegan</a> beers, in that their ingredients and conditioning do not use animal by-products. Some may object to the inclusion of genetically engineered rice and animal products used in the brewing process. In July 2006, Anheuser-Busch brewed a version of Budweiser with organic rice, for sale in Mexico. It has yet to extend this practice to any other countries.

In addition to the regular Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch brews several different beers under the Budweiser brand, including Bud Light and Bud Ice.

In July 2010, <a href="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a> launched Budweiser 66 in the United Kingdom. Budweiser Brew No.66 has 4% alcohol by volume, and is brewed and distributed in the UK by <a href="Inbev">Inbev</a> UK Limited.

On May 10, 2016, "<a href="Advertising%20Age">Advertising Age</a>" reported that the <a href="Alcohol%20and%20Tobacco%20Tax%20and%20Trade%20Bureau">Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau</a> had approved new Budweiser labels to be used on 12-ounce cans and bottles from May 23 until the <a href="Election%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">November elections</a>. The name "Budweiser" was changed to "America" (even though the parent company is based in Belgium, a fact which resulted in objections on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>). Much of the text on the packaging was replaced with patriotic American slogans, such as <a href="E%20Pluribus%20Unum">E Pluribus Unum</a> and "Liberty & Justice For All".

Budweiser is licensed, produced and distributed in Canada by <a href="Labatt%20Breweries%20of%20Canada">Labatt Breweries of Canada</a>. Of the 15 Anheuser-Busch breweries outside of the United States, 14 of them are positioned in China. Budweiser is the fourth leading brand in the Chinese beer market.

Bermuda Triangle

The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a loosely-defined region in the western part of the North <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, where a number of <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a> and <a href="Surface%20ship">ships</a> are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery. The vicinity of the Bermuda Triangle is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas, <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, and the Caribbean islands. Cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region, and commercial and private aircraft routinely fly over it.

<a href="Popular%20culture">Popular culture</a> has attributed various disappearances to the <a href="paranormal">paranormal</a> or activity by <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial beings</a>. Documented evidence indicates that a significant percentage of the incidents were spurious, inaccurately reported, or embellished by later authors.

In 1964, <a href="Vincent%20Gaddis">Vincent Gaddis</a> wrote in the pulp magazine "<a href="Argosy%20%28magazine%29">Argosy</a>" of the boundaries of the Bermuda Triangle, giving its <a href="Vertex%20%28geometry%29">vertices</a> as <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">San Juan</a>, <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, and <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. Subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this definition. Some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle, with the total area varying from . Consequently, the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported them. The <a href="United%20States%20Board%20on%20Geographic%20Names">United States Board on Geographic Names</a> does not recognize the Bermuda Triangle.

The earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in a September 17, 1950, article published in "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>" (<a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>) by Edward Van Winkle Jones. Two years later, "<a href="Fate%20%28magazine%29">Fate</a>" magazine published "Sea Mystery at Our Back Door", a short article by George X. Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of <a href="Flight%2019">Flight 19</a>, a group of five <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> <a href="Grumman%20TBM%20Avenger">Grumman TBM Avenger</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s on a training mission. Sand's article was the first to lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place. Flight 19 alone would be covered again in the April 1962 issue of "American Legion" magazine. In it, author <a href="Allan%20W.%20Eckert">Allan W. Eckert</a> wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, "We are entering white water, nothing seems right. We don't know where we are, the water is green, no white." He also wrote that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes "flew off to Mars." Sand's article was the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident. In the February 1964 issue of "Argosy", Vincent Gaddis' article "The Deadly Bermuda Triangle" argued that Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region. The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, "Invisible Horizons".

Others would follow with their own works, elaborating on Gaddis' ideas: John Wallace Spencer ("Limbo of the Lost", 1969, repr. 1973); <a href="Charles%20Berlitz">Charles Berlitz</a> <a href="The%20Bermuda%20Triangle%20%28book%29">("The Bermuda Triangle", 1974)</a>; <a href="Richard%20Winer">Richard Winer</a> ("The Devil's Triangle", 1974), and many others, all keeping to some of the same supernatural elements outlined by Eckert.

<a href="Larry%20Kusche">Lawrence David Kusche</a>, author of "The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved" (1975) argued that many claims of Gaddis and subsequent writers were often exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman <a href="Donald%20Crowhurst">Donald Crowhurst</a>, which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an "Atlantic" port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the "Pacific" Ocean. Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories.

Kusche concluded that:

In a 2013 study, the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> identified the world's 10 most dangerous waters for shipping, but the Bermuda Triangle was not among them.

When the <a href="Channel%204">UK Channel 4</a> television program "The Bermuda Triangle" (1992) was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the "Equinox" series, the marine insurance market <a href="Lloyd%27s%20of%20London">Lloyd's of London</a> was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there. Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area. <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.

The Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle, noting that they collect and publish, through their inquiries, much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors. In one such incident involving the 1972 explosion and sinking of the tanker , the Coast Guard photographed the wreck and recovered several bodies, in contrast with one Triangle author's claim that all the bodies had vanished, with the exception of the captain, who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk, clutching a coffee cup. In addition, "V. A. Fogg" sank off the coast of <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, nowhere near the commonly accepted boundaries of the Triangle.

The <a href="NOVA%20%28TV%20series%29">NOVA</a>/<a href="Horizon%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Horizon</a> episode "The Case of the Bermuda Triangle", aired on June 27, 1976, was highly critical, stating that "When we've gone back to the original sources or the people involved, the mystery evaporates. Science does not have to answer questions about the Triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place ... Ships and planes behave in the Triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the world."

Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Taves and Barry Singer, have noted how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable. This has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle. They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint.

Persons accepting the Bermuda Triangle as a real phenomenon have offered a number of explanatory approaches.

Triangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events. One explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. Sometimes connected to the Atlantis story is the submerged rock formation known as the <a href="Bimini%20Road">Bimini Road</a> off the island of <a href="Bimini">Bimini</a> in the Bahamas, which is in the Triangle by some definitions. Followers of the purported psychic <a href="Edgar%20Cayce">Edgar Cayce</a> take his prediction that evidence of Atlantis would be found in 1968, as referring to the discovery of the Bimini Road. Believers describe the formation as a road, wall, or other structure, but the Bimini Road is of natural origin.

Other writers attribute the events to <a href="UFO">UFO</a>s. This idea was used by <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> for his <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> "<a href="Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>", which features the lost Flight 19 aircrews as <a href="Alien%20abduction">alien abductees</a>.

<a href="Charles%20Berlitz">Charles Berlitz</a>, author of various books on anomalous phenomena, lists several theories attributing the losses in the Triangle to anomalous or unexplained forces.

A paranormal explanation in the 2005 three-part US-British-German science fiction miniseries "<a href="The%20Triangle%20%28miniseries%29">The Triangle</a>", says the triangle is a wormhole.

<a href="Compass">Compass</a> problems are one of the cited phrases in many Triangle incidents. While some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the area, such anomalies have not been found. Compasses have natural <a href="magnetic%20variation">magnetic variation</a>s in relation to the <a href="Poles%20of%20astronomical%20bodies%23Magnetic%20poles">magnetic poles</a>, a fact which navigators have known for centuries. <a href="magnetic%20north%20pole">Magnetic (compass) north</a> and <a href="true%20north">geographic (true) north</a> are only exactly the same for a small number of places – for example, as of 2000, in the United States, only those places on a line running from <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. But the public may not be as informed, and think there is something mysterious about a compass "changing" across an area as large as the Triangle, which it naturally will.

The <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a> is a major surface current, primarily driven by <a href="thermohaline%20circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and then flows through the <a href="Straits%20of%20Florida">Straits of Florida</a> into the North Atlantic. In essence, it is a river within an ocean, and, like a river, it can and does carry floating objects. It has a maximum surface velocity of about . A small plane making a <a href="water%20landing">water landing</a> or a boat having engine trouble can be carried away from its reported position by the current.

One of the most cited explanations in official inquiries as to the loss of any aircraft or vessel is human error. Human stubbornness may have caused businessman Harvey Conover to lose his sailing yacht, "Revonoc", as he sailed into the teeth of a storm south of Florida on January 1, 1958.

Hurricanes are powerful storms that form in tropical waters and have historically cost thousands of lives and caused billions of dollars in damage. The sinking of <a href="Francisco%20de%20Bobadilla">Francisco de Bobadilla</a>'s Spanish fleet in 1502 was the first recorded instance of a destructive hurricane. These storms have in the past caused a number of incidents related to the Triangle.

A powerful <a href="microburst">downdraft of cold air</a> was suspected to be a cause in the sinking of "<a href="Pride%20of%20Baltimore">Pride of Baltimore</a>" on May 14, 1986. The crew of the sunken vessel noted the wind suddenly shifted and increased velocity from to . A National Hurricane Center satellite specialist, James Lushine, stated "during very unstable weather conditions the downburst of cold air from aloft can hit the surface like a bomb, exploding outward like a giant squall line of wind and water." A similar event occurred to "<a href="Concordia%20%28ship%29">Concordia</a>" in 2010, off the coast of <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>. Scientists are currently investigating whether "<a href="hexagon">hexagon</a>al" clouds may be the source of these up-to- "air bombs".

An explanation for some of the disappearances has focused on the presence of large fields of <a href="methane">methane</a> hydrates (a form of natural gas) on the <a href="continental%20shelves">continental shelves</a>. Laboratory experiments carried out in Australia have proven that bubbles can, indeed, sink a scale model ship by decreasing the density of the water; any wreckage consequently rising to the surface would be rapidly dispersed by the Gulf Stream. It has been hypothesized that periodic methane <a href="eruption">eruption</a>s (sometimes called "<a href="mud%20volcano">mud volcano</a>es") may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate <a href="buoyancy">buoyancy</a> for ships. If this were the case, such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning.

Publications by the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">USGS</a> describe large stores of undersea hydrates worldwide, including the <a href="Blake%20Ridge">Blake Ridge</a> area, off the coast of the southeastern United States. However, according to the USGS, no large releases of gas hydrates are believed to have occurred in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 15,000 years.

"Ellen Austin" supposedly came across a derelict ship, placed on board a <a href="prize%20crew">prize crew</a>, and attempted to sail with it to New York in 1881. According to the stories, the derelict disappeared; others elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew, then disappeared again with a second prize crew on board. A check from Lloyd's of London records proved the existence of "Meta", built in 1854, and that in 1880, "Meta" was renamed "Ellen Austin". There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest a large number of missing men were placed on board a derelict that later disappeared.

The incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy not related to combat occurred when the collier "Cyclops", carrying a full load of <a href="manganese%20ore">manganese ore</a> and with one engine out of action, went missing without a trace with a crew of 309 sometime after March 4, 1918, after departing the island of <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>. Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory, many independent theories exist, some blaming storms, some capsizing, and some suggesting that <a href="World%20War%20I">wartime enemy activity</a> was to blame for the loss. In addition, two of "Cyclops"s sister ships, and were subsequently lost in the North Atlantic during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on "Cyclops" during her fatal voyage. In all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking.

A five-masted schooner built in 1919, "Carroll A. Deering" was found hard aground and abandoned at <a href="Diamond%20Shoals">Diamond Shoals</a>, near <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, on January 31, 1921. Rumors and more at the time indicated "Deering" was a victim of piracy, possibly connected with the illegal <a href="rum-running">rum-running</a> trade during <a href="Prohibition">Prohibition</a>, and possibly involving another ship, , which disappeared at roughly the same time. Just hours later, an unknown steamer sailed near the lightship along the track of "Deering", and ignored all signals from the lightship. It is speculated that "Hewitt" may have been this mystery ship, and possibly involved in "Deering"s crew disappearance.

Flight 19 was a training flight of five <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">TBM Avenger</a> torpedo bombers that disappeared on December 5, 1945, while over the Atlantic. The squadron's flight plan was scheduled to take them due east from <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a> for , north for , and then back over a final leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returned to base. The disappearance is attributed by Navy investigators to navigational error leading to the aircraft running out of fuel.

One of the search and rescue aircraft deployed to look for them, a <a href="Martin%20PBM%20Mariner">PBM Mariner</a> with a 13-man crew, also disappeared. A tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an explosion and observing a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather was becoming stormy by the end of the incident. According to contemporaneous sources the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapour leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue operation.

<a href="BSAA%20Star%20Tiger%20disappearance">G-AHNP "Star Tiger"</a> disappeared on January 30, 1948, on a flight from the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> to Bermuda; <a href="BSAA%20Star%20Ariel%20disappearance">G-AGRE "Star Ariel"</a> disappeared on January 17, 1949, on a flight from Bermuda to <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston, Jamaica</a>. Both were <a href="Avro">Avro</a> <a href="Tudor%20IV">Tudor IV</a> passenger aircraft operated by <a href="British%20South%20American%20Airways">British South American Airways</a>. Both planes were operating at the very limits of their range and the slightest error or fault in the equipment could keep them from reaching the small island.

On December 28, 1948, a <a href="Douglas%20DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a> aircraft, number <a href="NC16002%20disappearance">NC16002</a>, disappeared while on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Miami. No trace of the aircraft, or the 32 people on board, was ever found. A Civil Aeronautics Board investigation found there was insufficient information available on which to determine probable cause of the disappearance.

A pleasure yacht was found adrift in the Atlantic south of Bermuda on September 26, 1955; it is usually stated in the stories (Berlitz, Winer) that the crew vanished while the yacht survived being at sea during three hurricanes. The <a href="1955%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1955 Atlantic hurricane season</a> shows <a href="Hurricane%20Ione">Hurricane Ione</a> passing nearby between 14 and 18 September, with Bermuda being affected by winds of almost gale force. In his second book on the Bermuda Triangle, Winer quoted from a letter he had received from Mr J.E. Challenor of Barbados:

On the morning of September 22, "Connemara IV" was lying to a heavy mooring in the open <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> of <a href="Carlisle%20Bay%2C%20Barbados">Carlisle Bay</a>. Because of the approaching hurricane, the owner strengthened the mooring ropes and put out two additional anchors. There was little else he could do, as the exposed mooring was the only available anchorage. ... In Carlisle Bay, the sea in the wake of <a href="Hurricane%20Janet">Hurricane Janet</a> was awe-inspiring and dangerous. The owner of "Connemara IV" observed that she had disappeared. An investigation revealed that she had dragged her moorings and gone to sea.

On August 28, 1963, a pair of <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> <a href="KC-135%20Stratotanker">KC-135 Stratotanker</a> aircraft collided and crashed into the Atlantic. The Triangle version (Winer, Berlitz, Gaddis) of this story states that while the two aircraft did collide and crash, there were two distinct crash sites, separated by over of water. However, Kusche's research showed that the unclassified version of the Air Force investigation report stated that the debris field defining the second "crash site" was examined by a search and rescue ship, and found to be a mass of <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> and <a href="driftwood">driftwood</a> tangled in an old <a href="buoy">buoy</a>.

Borough

A borough is an <a href="administrative%20division">administrative division</a> in various <a href="English%20language">English-speaking</a> countries. In principle, the term "borough" designates a self-governing walled town, although in practice, official use of the term varies widely.

The word "borough" derives from common <a href="Proto-Germanic%20language">Proto-Germanic</a> "*burgz", meaning "fort": compare with "bury", "burgh" and "brough" (England), "burgh" (Scotland), "Burg" (Germany), "borg" (Scandinavia), "burcht" (Dutch), "boarch" (West Frisian), and the Germanic borrowing present in neighbouring <a href="Indo-european%20languages">Indo-european languages</a> such as "borgo" (Italian), "bourg" (French), "burgo" (Spanish and Portuguese), "burg" (Romanian), "purg" (<a href="Kajkavian%20dialect">Kajkavian</a>) and "durg" (दर्ग) (Hindi) and "arg" (ارگ) (<a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>). The incidence of these words as suffixes to place names (for example, <a href="Aldeburgh">Aldeburgh</a>, <a href="Bamburgh">Bamburgh</a>, <a href="Tilbury">Tilbury</a>, <a href="Tilburg">Tilburg</a>, <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a> (<a href="Strossburi">Strossburi</a> in the local dialect), <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="Grundisburgh">Grundisburgh</a>, <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>) usually indicates that they were once fortified settlements.

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, boroughs were settlements in England that were granted some <a href="self-government">self-government</a>; burghs were the Scottish equivalent. In <a href="medieval%20England">medieval England</a>, boroughs were also entitled to elect members of <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">parliament</a>. The use of the word "borough" probably derives from the burghal system of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. Alfred set up a system of defensive strong points (<a href="Burh">Burh</a>s); in order to maintain these settlements, he granted them a degree of autonomy. After the <a href="Norman%20Conquest">Norman Conquest</a>, when certain towns were granted self-governance, the concept of the burh/borough seems to have been reused to mean a self-governing settlement.

The concept of the borough has been used repeatedly (and often differently) throughout the world. Often, a borough is a single town with its own local government. However, in some cities it is a subdivision of the city (for example, <a href="Borough%20%28New%20York%20City%29">New York City</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, and <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>). In such cases, the borough will normally have either limited powers delegated to it by the city's local government, or no powers at all. In other places, such as the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, "borough" designates a whole <a href="region">region</a>; Alaska's largest borough, the <a href="North%20Slope%20Borough%2C%20Alaska">North Slope Borough</a>, is comparable in area to the entire <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, although its population is less than that of <a href="Swanage">Swanage</a> on England's south coast with around 9,600 inhabitants. In <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, a "borough" was once a self-governing small town, but this designation has all but vanished, except for the only remaining borough in the country, which is the <a href="Borough%20of%20Queenscliffe">Borough of Queenscliffe</a>.

Boroughs as administrative units are to be found in <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> and the United Kingdom, more specifically in England and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Boroughs also exist in the <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">province</a> of <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> and formerly in <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, in some states of the United States, in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, formerly in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and only one left in Australia.

The word "borough" derives from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word "burh", meaning a <a href="fortress">fortified</a> settlement. Other English derivatives of "burh" include "bury", "brough" and "burgh". There are obvious <a href="cognates">cognates</a> in other <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European languages</a>. For example; "burgh" in <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> and <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a>; "burg" in <a href="German%20language">German</a> and <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a>, "borg" in Scandinavian languages; "parcus" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and "pyrgos" in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, "برج" (borj) in <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>.

A number of other European languages have cognate words that were borrowed from the Germanic languages during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, including "brog" in <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a>, "bwr" or "bwrc", meaning "wall, rampart" in <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>, "bourg" in <a href="French%20language">French</a>, "burg" in <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a> (in Catalonia there is a town named "Burg"), "<a href="wikt%3Aborgo">borgo</a>" in <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, and "burgo" in Spanish (hence the place-name <a href="Burgos">Burgos</a>).

The 'burg' element, which means "castle" or "fortress", is often confused with 'berg' meaning "hill" or "mountain" (c.f. <a href="iceberg">iceberg</a>, <a href="inselberg">inselberg</a>). Hence the 'berg' element in <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a> or <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> relates to a hill, rather than a fort. In some cases, the 'berg' element in place names has converged towards burg/borough; for instance Farnborough, from "fernaberga" (fern-hill).

In many parts of England, "borough" is pronounced as an independent word, and as when a suffix of a place-name. As a suffix, it is sometimes spelled "-brough".

In the United States, "borough" is pronounced or . When appearing as the suffix "-burg(h)" in place-names, it is pronounced .

In <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, the term "borough" is an occasionally used term for a local government area. Currently there is only one borough in Australia, the <a href="Borough%20of%20Queenscliffe">Borough of Queenscliffe</a> in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, although there have been more in the past. However, in some cases it can be integrated into the council's name instead of used as an official title, such as the <a href="Municipality%20of%20Kingborough">Municipality of Kingborough</a> in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>.

In <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, the term borough is generally used as the English translation of <a href="arrondissement">arrondissement</a>, referring to an administrative division of a municipality. Only eight municipalities in Quebec are divided into boroughs. See <a href="List%20of%20boroughs%20in%20Quebec">List of boroughs in Quebec</a>.

It was previously used in <a href="Metropolitan%20Toronto">Metropolitan Toronto</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, to denote suburban municipalities including Scarborough, York, North York, Etobicoke prior to their conversion into cities. The Borough of <a href="East%20York">East York</a> was the last Toronto municipality to hold this status, relinquishing it upon becoming part of the <a href="City%20of%20Toronto">City of Toronto</a> on January 1, 1998.

The <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Colombia">Colombian Municipalities</a> are subdivided into boroughs with a local executive and an administrative board for local government.
These Boroughs are divided in neighborhoods.

The <a href="Local%20Government%20Reform%20Act%202014">Local Government Reform Act 2014</a> replaced the urban-only second-tier local government units with new urban and rural units termed "<a href="municipal%20district%20%28Ireland%29">municipal district</a>s". The abolished units included five which were termed "boroughs", namely <a href="Clonmel">Clonmel</a>, <a href="Drogheda">Drogheda</a>, <a href="Kilkenny">Kilkenny</a>, <a href="Sligo">Sligo</a>, and <a href="Wexford">Wexford</a>. However, the municipal districts containing four of these are styled "borough districts"; the exception is Kilkenny, whose district is the "Municipal District of Kilkenny City", because of Kilkenny's <a href="City%20status%20in%20Ireland">city status</a>.

Earlier Irish boroughs include the 117 parliamentary boroughs of the <a href="Irish%20House%20of%20Commons">Irish House of Commons</a>, of which 80 were disfranchised by the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201800">Acts of Union 1800</a> and all but 11 abolished under the <a href="Municipal%20Corporations%20%28Ireland%29%20Act%201840">Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840</a>. The six largest of those eleven became <a href="county%20borough">county borough</a>s under the <a href="Local%20Government%20%28Ireland%29%20Act%201898">Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898</a>, of which those in the Republic were reclassed as "cities" under the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%202001">Local Government Act 2001</a>. <a href="Galway">Galway</a> was a borough from 1937 until promoted to county borough in 1985, and <a href="Corporation%20of%20D%C3%BAn%20Laoghaire">Dún Laoghaire was a borough</a> from 1930 until merged into <a href="D%C3%BAn%20Laoghaire%E2%80%93Rathdown">Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown</a> county in 1993.

Under Israeli law, inherited from <a href="Mandate%20for%20Palestine">British Mandate</a> municipal law, the possibility of creating a municipal borough exists. However, no borough was actually created under law until 2005–2006, when <a href="Neve%20Monosson">Neve Monosson</a> and <a href="Maccabim-Re%27ut">Maccabim-Re'ut</a>, both communal settlements (Heb: yishuv kehilati) founded in 1953 and 1984, respectively, were declared to be autonomous municipal boroughs (Heb: vaad rova ironi), within their mergers with the towns of <a href="Yehud">Yehud</a> and <a href="Modi%27in">Modi'in</a>. Similar structures have been created under different types of legal status over the years in Israel, notably <a href="Qiryat%20Chaim">Kiryat Haim</a> in <a href="Haifa">Haifa</a>, <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> in <a href="Tel%20Aviv-Yafo">Tel Aviv-Yafo</a> and <a href="Ramot">Ramot</a> and <a href="Gilo">Gilo</a> in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. However, Neve Monosson is the first example of a full municipal borough actually declared under law by the Minister of the Interior, under a model subsequently adopted in <a href="Maccabim-Re%27ut">Maccabim-Re'ut</a> as well.

It is the declared intention of the Interior Ministry to use the borough mechanism in order to facilitate municipal mergers in Israel, after a 2003 wide-reaching merger plan, which, in general, ignored the sensitivities of the communal settlements, and largely failed.

In <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> as translations from <a href="English%20language">English</a> to Spanish applied to <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, the word "borough" has resulted in a delegación (delegation), referring to the 16 administrative areas within the Mexican Federal District. Also the <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Mexico">municipalities</a> of some <a href="States%20of%20Mexico">states</a> are administratively subdivided into boroughs, as shown in <a href="Municipality%20of%20Mexicali%23Boroughs">Municipality of Mexicali#Boroughs</a>. (see: <a href="Boroughs%20of%20Mexico">Boroughs of Mexico</a> and <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Mexico%20City">Municipalities of Mexico City</a>)

In the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the municipalities of <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> and <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> are divided into administrative boroughs, or <a href="deelgemeente">deelgemeente</a>n, which have their own borough council and a borough mayor. Other large cities are usually divided into districts, or <a href="Stadsdeel">stadsdelen</a>, for census purposes.

<a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> formerly used the term borough to designate self-governing towns of more than 1,000 people, although 19th century census records show many boroughs with populations as low as 200. A borough of more than 20,000 people could become a city by proclamation. Boroughs and cities were collectively known as municipalities, and were <a href="enclave">enclave</a>s separate from their surrounding counties. Boroughs proliferated in the suburban areas of the larger cities: By the 1980s there were 19 boroughs and three cities in the area that is now the City of Auckland.

In the 1980s, some boroughs and cities began to be merged with their surrounding counties to form <a href="district">district</a>s with a mixed urban and rural population. A <a href="1989%20local%20government%20reforms">nationwide reform of local government in 1989</a> completed the process. Counties and boroughs were abolished and all boundaries were redrawn. Under the new system, most territorial authorities cover both urban and rural land. The more populated councils are classified as cities, and the more rural councils are classified as districts. Only <a href="Kawerau">Kawerau</a> District, an enclave within <a href="Whakatane">Whakatāne District</a>, continues to follow the tradition of a small town council that does not include surrounding rural area.

During the medieval period many towns were granted self-governance by the Crown, at which point they became referred to as boroughs. The formal status of borough came to be conferred by <a href="Royal%20Charter">Royal Charter</a>. These boroughs were generally governed by a self-selecting corporation (i.e., when a member died or resigned his replacement would be by <a href="co-option">co-option</a>). Sometimes boroughs were governed by <a href="bailiffs">bailiffs</a> or headboroughs.

Debates on the Reform Bill (eventually the <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Reform Act 1832</a>) had highlighted the variations in systems of governance of towns, and a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> was set up to investigate the issue. This resulted in a regularisation of municipal government (<a href="Municipal%20Corporations%20Act%201835">Municipal Corporations Act 1835</a>). 178 of the ancient boroughs were reformed as "municipal boroughs", with all municipal corporations to be elected according to a standard franchise based on property ownership. The unreformed boroughs either lapsed in borough status, or were reformed (or abolished) at a later time. Several new municipal boroughs were formed in the new industrial cities after the bill enacted, according to the provisions of the bill.

As part of a large-scale reform of local government in England and Wales <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">in 1974</a>, municipal boroughs were finally abolished (having become increasingly irrelevant). However, the civic traditions of many boroughs were continued by the grant of a <a href="Royal%20Charter">charter</a> to their successor district councils. In smaller boroughs, a <a href="Parish%20councils%20in%20England">town council</a> was formed for the area of the abolished borough, while <a href="charter%20trustees">charter trustees</a> were formed in other former boroughs. In each case, the new body was allowed to use the regalia of the old corporation, and appoint ceremonial office holders such as sword and mace bearers as provided in their original charters. The council or trustees may apply for an <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a> or <a href="Royal%20Licence">Royal Licence</a> to use the former borough <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>.

From 1265, two burgesses from each borough were summoned to the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a>, alongside two <a href="knight">knight</a>s from each <a href="county">county</a>. Thus parliamentary constituencies were derived from the ancient boroughs. Representation in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> was decided by the House itself, which resulted in boroughs being established in some small settlements for the purposes of parliamentary representation, despite their possessing no actual corporation.

After the Reform Act, which disenfranchised many of the <a href="rotten%20borough">rotten borough</a>s (boroughs that had declined in importance, had only a small population, and had only a handful of eligible voters), parliamentary constituencies began to diverge from the ancient boroughs. While many ancient boroughs remained as municipal boroughs, they were disenfranchised by the Reform Act.

The <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201888">Local Government Act 1888</a> established a new sort of borough – the county borough. These were designed to be 'counties-to-themselves'; administrative divisions to sit alongside the new administrative counties. They allowed urban areas to be administered separately from the more rural areas. They, therefore, often contained pre-existing municipal boroughs, which thereafter became part of the second tier of local government, below the administrative counties and county boroughs.

The county boroughs were, like the municipal boroughs, abolished in 1974, being reabsorbed into their parent counties for administrative purposes.

In 1899, as part of a reform of local government in the <a href="County%20of%20London">County of London</a>, the various parishes in London were reorganised as new entities, the 'metropolitan boroughs'. These were reorganised further when <a href="Greater%20London">Greater London</a> was formed out of Middlesex and the County of London in 1965.

When the new metropolitan counties (<a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, <a href="Merseyside">Merseyside</a>, <a href="South%20Yorkshire">South Yorkshire</a>, <a href="Tyne%20and%20Wear">Tyne and Wear</a>, <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28county%29">West Midlands</a>, and <a href="West%20Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>) were created in 1974, their sub-divisions also became metropolitan boroughs; in many cases these metropolitan boroughs recapitulated abolished county boroughs (for example, <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Stockport">Stockport</a>). The metropolitan boroughs possessed slightly more autonomy from the metropolitan county councils than the shire county districts did from their county councils.

With the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in 1986, these metropolitan boroughs became independent, and continue to be so at present.

Elsewhere in England a number of <a href="districts%20of%20England">districts</a> and <a href="unitary%20authority">unitary authority</a> areas are called "borough". Until 1974, this was a status that denoted towns with a certain type of local government (a <a href="municipal%20corporation">municipal corporation</a>). Since 1974, it has been a purely ceremonial style granted by royal charter to districts which may consist of a single town or may include a number of towns or rural areas. Borough status entitles the council chairman to bear the title of <a href="Mayors%20in%20England">mayor</a>. Districts may apply to the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Crown</a> for the grant of borough status upon advice of the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council of the United Kingdom</a>.

In <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, local government was reorganised in 1973. Under the legislation that created the 26 <a href="districts%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">districts of Northern Ireland</a>, a district council whose area included an existing <a href="municipal%20borough">municipal borough</a> could resolve to adopt the charter of the old municipality and thus continue to enjoy borough status. Districts that do not contain a former borough can apply for a charter in a similar manner to English districts.

In the United States, a borough is a unit of <a href="local%20government">local government</a> below the level of the <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a>. The term is currently used in seven states.

The following states use, or have used, the word with the following meanings:

Certain names of places, such as <a href="Hillsboro%2C%20Oregon">Hillsboro, Oregon</a>; <a href="Greensboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">Greensboro, North Carolina</a>; <a href="Tyngsborough%2C%20Massachusetts">Tyngsborough, Massachusetts</a>; and <a href="Berlin%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Maynesborough, New Hampshire</a> reflect the historical use of "borough" as a geographical unit in the United States.

Bodmin

Bodmin () is a <a href="civil%20parishes%20in%20England">civil parish</a> and historic town in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, England, United Kingdom. It is situated south-west of <a href="Bodmin%20Moor">Bodmin Moor</a>.

The extent of the civil parish corresponds fairly closely to that of the town so is mostly urban in character. It is bordered to the east by <a href="Cardinham">Cardinham</a> parish, to the southeast by <a href="Lanhydrock">Lanhydrock</a> parish, to the southwest and west by <a href="Lanivet">Lanivet</a> parish, and to the north by <a href="Helland">Helland</a> parish.

Bodmin had a population of 14,736 as of the 2011 Census. It was formerly the <a href="county%20town">county town</a> of Cornwall until the Crown Courts moved to <a href="Truro">Truro</a> which is also the administrative centre (before 1835 the county town was <a href="Launceston%2C%20Cornwall">Launceston</a>). Bodmin was in the administrative <a href="North%20Cornwall">North Cornwall</a> District until local government reorganisation in 2009 abolished the District ("see also <a href="Politics%20of%20Cornwall">Cornwall Council</a>"). The town is part of the <a href="North%20Cornwall%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North Cornwall</a> parliamentary constituency, which is represented by <a href="Scott%20Mann%20%28politician%29">Scott Mann</a> MP.

Bodmin Town Council is made up of sixteen councillors who are elected to serve a term of four years. Each year, the Council elects one of its number as Mayor to serve as the town's civic leader and to chair council meetings.

Bodmin lies in the east of Cornwall, south-west of <a href="Bodmin%20Moor">Bodmin Moor</a>. It has been suggested that the town's name comes from an archaic word in the <a href="Cornish%20language">Cornish language</a> "bod" (meaning a dwelling; the later word is "bos") and a contraction of "menegh" (monks). The "monks' dwelling" may refer to an early monastic settlement instituted by St. Guron, which <a href="Saint%20Petroc">St. Petroc</a> took as his site. Guron is said to have departed to <a href="St%20Goran">St Goran</a> on the arrival of Petroc.

The hamlets of Cooksland, <a href="Dunmere%2C%20Cornwall">Dunmere</a> and <a href="Turfdown">Turfdown</a> are in the parish.

<a href="Saint%20Petroc">St. Petroc</a> founded a monastery in Bodmin in the 6th century and gave the town its alternative name of "Petrockstow". The monastery was deprived of some of its lands at the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest</a> but at the time of <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday</a> still held eighteen manors, including Bodmin, Padstow and Rialton. Bodmin is one of the oldest towns in Cornwall, and the only large Cornish settlement recorded in the Domesday pageRank.Book in 1086. In the 15th century the Norman church of St Petroc was largely rebuilt and stands as one of the largest churches in Cornwall (the largest after the cathedral at Truro). Also built at that time was an abbey of canons regular, now mostly ruined. For most of Bodmin's history, the <a href="tin">tin</a> industry was a mainstay of the economy.

The name of the town probably derives from the Cornish "Bod-meneghy", meaning "dwelling of or by the sanctuary of monks". Variant spellings recorded include "Botmenei" in 1100, "Bodmen" in 1253, "Bodman" in 1377 and "Bodmyn" in 1522. The "Bodman" spelling also appears in sources and maps from the 16th and 17th centuries, most notably in the celebrated map of Cornwall produced by <a href="John%20Speed">John Speed</a> but actually engraved by the Dutch cartographer <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a> the Elder (1563–1612) in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> in 1610 (published in London by Sudbury and Humble in 1626). It is unclear whether the Bodman spelling signifies any historical or monastic connection with the equally ancient settlement of Bodman at the western end of the <a href="Lake%20Constance">Bodensee</a> in the German province of <a href="Baden">Baden</a>.

An inscription on a stone built into the wall of a summer house in Lancarffe furnishes proof of a settlement in Bodmin in the early <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. It is a memorial to one "Duno[.]atus son of Me[.]cagnus" and has been dated from the 6th to 8th centuries.
Arthur Langdon (1896) records three Cornish crosses at Bodmin; one was near the Berry Tower, one was outside Bodmin Gaol and another was in a field near Castle Street Hill. There is also <a href="Carminow%20Cross">Carminow Cross</a> at a road junction southeast of the town.
The <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> killed half of Bodmin's population in the mid 14th century (1,500 people).

Bodmin was the centre of three Cornish uprisings. The first was the <a href="Cornish%20Rebellion%20of%201497">Cornish Rebellion of 1497</a> when a Cornish army, led by <a href="Michael%20An%20Gof">Michael An Gof</a>, a <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a> from <a href="St.%20Keverne">St. Keverne</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Flamank">Thomas Flamank</a>, a <a href="lawyer">lawyer</a> from Bodmin, marched to <a href="Blackheath%2C%20London">Blackheath</a> in London where they were eventually defeated by 10,000 men of the King's army under Baron Daubeny. Then, in the autumn of 1497, <a href="Perkin%20Warbeck">Perkin Warbeck</a> tried to usurp the throne from <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>. Warbeck was proclaimed King Richard IV in Bodmin but Henry had little difficulty crushing the uprising. In 1549, Cornishmen, allied with other rebels in neighbouring <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, rose once again in rebellion when the staunchly Protestant <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a> tried to impose a new <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Prayer pageRank.Book</a>. The lower classes of Cornwall and Devon were still strongly attached to the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> religion and again a Cornish army was formed in Bodmin which marched across the border into Devon to lay siege to <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>. This became known as the <a href="Prayer%20Book%20Rebellion">Prayer pageRank.Book Rebellion</a>. Proposals to translate the Prayer pageRank.Book into Cornish were suppressed and in total 4,000 people were killed in the rebellion.

The Borough of Bodmin was one of the 178 municipal boroughs which under the auspices of the <a href="Municipal%20Corporations%20Act%201835">Municipal Corporations Act 1835</a> was mandated to create an electable council and a Police Watch Committee responsible for overseeing a police force in the town. The new system directly replaced the Parish Constables that had policed the borough since time immemorial and brought paid, uniformed and accountable law enforcement for the first time. Bodmin Borough Police was the municipal police force for the Borough of Bodmin from 1836 to 1866. The creation of the <a href="Cornwall%20Constabulary">Cornwall Constabulary</a> in 1857 put pressure on smaller municipal police forces to merge with the county. The two-man force of Bodmin came under threat almost immediately, but it would take until 1866 for the Mayor of Bodmin and the Chairman of the Police Watch Committee to agree on the terms of amalgamation. After a public enquiry, the force was disbanded in January 1866 and policing of the borough was deferred to the county from thereon.

The song "Bodmin Town" was collected from the Cornishman William Nichols at <a href="Whitchurch%2C%20Devon">Whitchurch</a>, <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, in 1891 by <a href="Sabine%20Baring-Gould">Sabine Baring-Gould</a> who published a version in his "A Garland of Country Song" (1924).

The existing church building is dated 1469–72 and was until the building of <a href="Truro%20Cathedral">Truro Cathedral</a> the largest church in Cornwall. The tower which remains from the original Norman church and stands on the north side of the church (the upper part is 15th century) was, until the loss of its spire in 1699, 150 ft high. The building underwent two Victorian restorations and another in 1930. It is now listed Grade I. There are a number of interesting monuments, most notably that of Prior Vivian which was formerly in the Priory Church (Thomas Vivian's effigy lying on a chest: black <a href="Catacleuse%20stone">Catacleuse stone</a> and grey marble). The font of a type common in Cornwall is of the 12th century: large and finely carved.

The Chapel of St Thomas Becket is a ruin of a 14th-century building in Bodmin churchyard. The holy well of St Guron is a small stone building at the churchyard gate. The Berry Tower is all that remains of the former church of the Holy Rood and there are even fewer remains from the substantial Franciscan Friary established ca. 1240: a gateway in Fore Street and two pillars elsewhere in the town. The Roman Catholic <a href="Abbey%20of%20St%20Mary%20and%20St%20Petroc">Abbey of St Mary and St Petroc</a>, formerly belonging to the <a href="Canons%20Regular">Canons Regular</a> of the Lateran was built in 1965 next to the already existing seminary. The Roman Catholic parish of Bodmin includes a large area of North Cornwall and there are churches also at Wadebridge, Padstow and Tintagel. In 1881 the Roman Catholic mass was celebrated in Bodmin for the first time since 1539. A church was planned in the 1930s but delayed by the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>: the Church of St Mary and St Petroc was eventually consecrated in 1965: it was built next to the already existing seminary. There are also five other churches in Bodmin, including a Methodist church.

<a href="Bodmin%20Jail">Bodmin Jail</a>, operational for over 150 years but now a semi-ruin, was built in the late 18th century, and was the first British prison to hold prisoners in separate cells (though often up to ten at a time) rather than communally. Over fifty prisoners condemned at the Bodmin <a href="Assize%20Court">Assize Court</a> were hanged at the prison. It was also used for temporarily holding prisoners sentenced to transportation, awaiting transfer to the prison hulks lying in the highest navigable reaches of the <a href="River%20Fowey">River Fowey</a>. Also, during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> the prison held some of Britain's priceless national treasures including the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday pageRank.Book</a>, the ring and the <a href="Crown%20Jewels%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom</a>.

Other buildings of interest include the former <a href="County%20Hall">Shire Hall</a>, now a tourist information centre, and <a href="Victoria%20Barracks%2C%20Bodmin">Victoria Barracks</a>, formerly depot of the now defunct <a href="Duke%20of%20Cornwall%27s%20Light%20Infantry">Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry</a> and now the site of the regimental museum. It includes the history of the regiment from 1702, plus a military library. The original barracks house the regimental museum which was founded in 1925. There is a fine collection of small arms and machine guns, plus maps, uniforms and paintings on display. The <a href="Honey%20Street%20drill%20hall%2C%20Bodmin">Honey Street drill hall</a> was the mobilisation point for reservists being deployed to serve on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>.

Bodmin County Lunatic Asylum was designed by <a href="John%20Foulston">John Foulston</a> and afterwards <a href="George%20Wightwick">George Wightwick</a>. <a href="William%20Robert%20Hicks">William Robert Hicks</a> the humorist was domestic superintendent in the mid-19th century.

There is a sizable single storey Masonic Hall in St Nicholas Street, which is home to no less than seven Masonic bodies.

Bodmin Beacon Local Nature Reserve is the hill overlooking the town. The reserve has 83 acres (33.6 ha) of public land and at its highest point it reaches 162 metres with the distinctive landmark at the summit. The 44-metre tall monument to Sir <a href="Walter%20Raleigh%20Gilbert">Walter Raleigh Gilbert</a> was built in 1857 by the townspeople of Bodmin to honour the soldier's life and work in India.

In 1966, the ""Finn VC Estate"" was named in honour of <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> winner <a href="James%20Henry%20Fynn">James Henry Finn</a> who once lived in the town. An ornate granite drinking bowl which serves the needs of thirsty dogs at the entrance to Bodmin’s Priory car park was donated by Prince <a href="Chula%20Chakrabongse">Chula Chakrabongse</a> of <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> who lived at Tredethy.

There are no <a href="independent%20schools">independent schools</a> in the area.

Bodmin Moor

Bodmin Moor () is a <a href="granite">granite</a> <a href="moorland">moorland</a> in northeastern <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, England. It is in size, and dates from the <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> period of <a href="geology">geological</a> history. It includes <a href="Brown%20Willy">Brown Willy</a>, the highest point in Cornwall, and <a href="Rough%20Tor">Rough Tor</a>, a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated.

The name Bodmin Moor is relatively recent, an <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> invention of 1813. The upland area was formerly known as Fowey Moor after the <a href="River%20Fowey">River Fowey</a>, which rises within it.

Bodmin Moor is one of five <a href="granite">granite</a> <a href="pluton">pluton</a>s in Cornwall that make up part of the <a href="Cornubian%20batholith">Cornubian batholith</a> (see also <a href="Geology%20of%20Cornwall">Geology of Cornwall</a>).

Dramatic granite <a href="tor%20%28rock%20formation%29">tor</a>s rise from the rolling moorland: the best known are <a href="Brown%20Willy">Brown Willy</a>, the highest point in Cornwall at , and <a href="Rough%20Tor">Rough Tor</a> at . To the south-east <a href="Kilmar%20Tor">Kilmar Tor</a> and <a href="Caradon%20Hill">Caradon Hill</a> are the most prominent hills. Considerable areas of the moor are poorly drained and form marshes (in hot summers these can dry out). The rest of the moor is mostly rough pasture or overgrown with heather and other low vegetation.

The moor contains about 500 holdings with around 10,000 beef cows, 55,000 breeding ewes and 1,000 horses and ponies. Most of the moor is a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI), "Bodmin Moor, North", and has been officially designated an <a href="Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB), as part of <a href="Cornwall%20AONB">Cornwall AONB</a>. Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. The moor has been identified by <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> as an <a href="Important%20Bird%20Area">Important Bird Area</a> (IBA) because it supports about 260 breeding pairs of <a href="European%20stonechat">European stonechat</a>s as well as a wintering population of 10,000 <a href="Eurasian%20golden%20plover">Eurasian golden plover</a>s. The moor has also been recognised as a separate <a href="natural%20region">natural region</a> and designated as <a href="national%20character%20area">national character area</a> 153 by <a href="Natural%20England">Natural England</a>.

Bodmin Moor is the source of several of Cornwall's rivers: they are mentioned here anti-clockwise from the south.

The <a href="River%20Fowey">River Fowey</a> rises at a height of and flows through <a href="Lostwithiel">Lostwithiel</a> and into the <a href="Fowey">Fowey</a> estuary.

The <a href="River%20Tiddy">River Tiddy</a> rises near Pensilva and flows southeast to its confluence with the <a href="River%20Lynher">River Lynher</a> (the Lynher flows generally south-east until it joins the <a href="Hamoaze">Hamoaze</a> near Plymouth). The <a href="River%20Inny%2C%20Cornwall">River Inny</a> rises near <a href="Davidstow">Davidstow</a> and flows southeast to its confluence with the River Tamar.

The <a href="River%20Camel">River Camel</a> rises on Hendraburnick Down and flows for approximately before joining the sea at <a href="Padstow">Padstow</a>. The River Camel and its tributary the <a href="De%20Lank%20River">De Lank River</a> are an important habitat for the otter and both have been proposed as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) The De Lank River rises near <a href="Roughtor">Roughtor</a> and flows along an irregular course before joining the Camel south of Wenford.

The River Warleggan rises near <a href="Temple%2C%20Cornwall">Temple</a> and flows south to join the Fowey.

On the southern slopes of the moor lies <a href="Dozmary%20Pool">Dozmary Pool</a>. It is Cornwall's only natural inland lake and is glacial in origin. In the 20th century three reservoirs have been constructed on the moor; these are <a href="Colliford%20Lake">Colliford Lake</a>, <a href="Siblyback%20Lake">Siblyback Lake</a> and <a href="Crowdy%20Reservoir">Crowdy reservoir</a>s which supply water for a large part of the county's population. Various species of waterfowl are resident around these waters.

The parishes on the moor are as follows:

10,000 years ago, in the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> period, <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a>s wandered the area when it was wooded. There are several documented cases of flint scatters being discovered by <a href="archaeology">archaeologists</a>, indicating that these hunter gatherers practised <a href="Knapping">flint knapping</a> in the region.

During the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> era, from about 4,500 to 2,300 BC, people began clearing trees and farming the land. It was also in this era that the production of various <a href="megalith">megalith</a>ic monuments began, predominantly long <a href="cairn">cairn</a>s (three of which have currently been identified, at Louden, Catshole and Bearah) and <a href="stone%20circle">stone circle</a>s (sixteen of which have been identified). It was also likely that the naturally forming <a href="tor%20%28rock%20formation%29">tor</a>s were also viewed in a similar manner to the manmade ceremonial sites.

In the following <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, the creation of monuments increased dramatically, with the production of over 300 further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. More than 200 <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> settlements with <a href="Enclosure%20%28archaeology%29">enclosures</a> and field patterns have been recorded. and many prehistoric stone <a href="tumulus">barrows</a> and <a href="stone%20circle">circles</a> lie scattered across the moor. In a programme shown in 2007 <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>'s "<a href="Time%20Team">Time Team</a> "investigated a 500-metre cairn and the site of a Bronze Age village on the slopes of <a href="Rough%20Tor">Rough Tor</a>.

<a href="King%20Arthur%27s%20Hall">King Arthur's Hall</a> thought to be a late <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> or early <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> ceremonial site can be found to the east of <a href="St%20Breward">St Breward</a> on the moor.

Where practicable areas of the moor were used for pasture by herdsmen from the parishes surrounding the moor. Granite boulders were also taken from the moor and used for stone posts and to a certain extent for building (such material is known as moorstone). Granite quarrying only became reasonably productive when gunpowder became available.

The moor gave its name (Foweymore) to one of the medieval districts called <a href="Stannary">stannaries</a> which administered tin mining: the boundaries of these were never defined precisely. Until the establishment of a turnpike road through the moor (the present <a href="A30%20road">A30</a>) in the 1770s the size of the moorland area made travel within Cornwall very difficult.

Its Cornish name, Goen Bren, is first recorded in the 12th century.

Roughtor was the site of a medieval chapel of St Michael and is now designated as a memorial to the <a href="43rd%20%28Wessex%29%20Infantry%20Division">43rd Wessex Division</a> of the British Army. In 1844 on Bodmin Moor the body of 18-year-old Charlotte Dymond was discovered. Local labourer Matthew Weeks was accused of the murder and at noon on 12 August 1844 he was led from <a href="Bodmin%20Gaol">Bodmin Gaol</a> and hanged. The murder site now has a monument erected from public money and the grave is at <a href="Davidstow">Davidstow</a> churchyard.

<a href="Dozmary%20Pool">Dozmary Pool</a> is identified by some people with the lake in which, according to <a href="King%20Arthur">Arthurian</a> legend, <a href="Bedivere">Sir Bedivere</a> threw <a href="Excalibur">Excalibur</a> to <a href="The%20Lady%20of%20the%20Lake">The Lady of the Lake</a>. Another legend relating to the pool concerns <a href="Jan%20Tregeagle">Jan Tregeagle</a>.

The <a href="Beast%20of%20Bodmin">Beast of Bodmin</a> has been reported many times but never identified with certainty.

"<a href="Cornish%20Cowboy">Cornish Cowboy</a>", a 2014 short documentary film screened at the <a href="2015%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2015 Cannes Film Festival</a>, was shot on Bodmin Moor. The film features the work of St Neot horse trainer, Dan Wilson.

Berkeley, California

Berkeley ( ) is a city on the east shore of <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> in northern <a href="Alameda%20County%2C%20California">Alameda County</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. It is named after the 18th-century <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> bishop and philosopher <a href="George%20Berkeley">George Berkeley</a>. It borders the cities of <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a> and <a href="Emeryville%2C%20California">Emeryville</a> to the south and the city of <a href="Albany%2C%20California">Albany</a> and the <a href="Unincorporated%20area">unincorporated community</a> of <a href="Kensington%2C%20California">Kensington</a> to the north. Its eastern border with <a href="Contra%20Costa%20County%2C%20California">Contra Costa County</a> generally follows the ridge of the <a href="Berkeley%20Hills">Berkeley Hills</a>. The 2010 census recorded a population of 112,580.

Berkeley is home to the oldest campus in the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> system, the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, and to the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, which is managed and operated by the University. It also has the <a href="Graduate%20Theological%20Union">Graduate Theological Union</a>, one of the largest religious studies institutions in the world. It is one of the most <a href="Modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">politically liberal</a> cities in the United States.

The site of today's City of Berkeley was the territory of the Chochenyo/Huchiun band of the <a href="Ohlone">Ohlone</a> people when the first Europeans arrived. Evidence of their existence in the area include pits in rock formations, which they used to grind acorns, and a <a href="shellmound">shellmound</a>, now mostly leveled and covered up, along the shoreline of <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> at the mouth of <a href="Strawberry%20Creek">Strawberry Creek</a>. Other artifacts were discovered in the 1950s in the <a href="Downtown%20Berkeley">downtown area</a> during remodeling of a commercial building, near the upper course of the creek.
The first people of European descent (most of whom were born in America, and many of whom were of mixed ancestry) arrived with the <a href="De%20Anza%20Expedition">De Anza Expedition</a> in 1776. Today, this is noted by signage on <a href="Interstate%2080%20%28California%29">Interstate 80</a>, which runs along the San Francisco Bay shoreline of Berkeley. The De Anza Expedition led to establishment of the Spanish <a href="Presidio%20of%20San%20Francisco">Presidio of San Francisco</a> at the entrance to San Francisco Bay (the "<a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a>)," which is due west of Berkeley. <a href="Luis%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Peralta">Luis Peralta</a> was among the soldiers at the Presidio. For his services to the <a href="King%20of%20Spain">King of Spain</a>, he was granted a vast stretch of land on the east shore of San Francisco Bay (the "contra costa", "opposite shore") for a ranch, including that portion that now comprises the City of Berkeley.

Luis Peralta named his holding "<a href="Rancho%20San%20Antonio%20%28Peralta%29">Rancho San Antonio</a>". The primary activity of the ranch was raising cattle for meat and hides, but hunting and farming were also pursued. Eventually, Peralta gave portions of the ranch to each of his four sons. What is now Berkeley lies mostly in the portion that went to Peralta's son <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Domingo%20Peralta">Domingo</a>, with a little in the portion that went to another son, Vicente. No artifact survives of the Domingo or Vicente ranches, but their names survive in Berkeley street names (Vicente, Domingo, and Peralta). However, legal title to all land in the City of Berkeley remains based on the original Peralta land grant.

The Peraltas' Rancho San Antonio continued after <a href="Alta%20California">Alta California</a> passed from Spanish to Mexican sovereignty after the <a href="Mexican%20War%20of%20Independence">Mexican War of Independence</a>. However, the advent of U.S. sovereignty after the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>, and especially, the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">Gold Rush</a>, saw the Peraltas' lands quickly encroached on by <a href="squatter">squatter</a>s and diminished by dubious legal proceedings. The lands of the brothers Domingo and Vicente were quickly reduced to reservations close to their respective ranch homes. The rest of the land was surveyed and parceled out to various American claimants ("See" <a href="Kellersberger%27s%20Map">Kellersberger's Map</a>).

Politically, the area that became Berkeley was initially part of a vast <a href="Contra%20Costa%20County">Contra Costa County</a>. On March 25, 1853, Alameda County was created from a division of Contra Costa County, as well as from a small portion of <a href="Santa%20Clara%20County">Santa Clara County</a>. What became Berkeley was then the northern part of the "Oakland Township" subdivision of Alameda County. During this period, "Berkeley" was mostly a mix of open land, farms, and ranches, with a small, though busy, wharf by the bay.

In 1866, Oakland's private <a href="College%20of%20California">College of California</a> looked for a new site. It settled on a location north of Oakland along the foot of the <a href="Berkeley%20Hills">Contra Costa Range</a> (later called the Berkeley Hills) astride <a href="Strawberry%20Creek">Strawberry Creek</a>, at an elevation about above the bay, commanding a view of the Bay Area and the Pacific Ocean through the <a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a>.

According to the "Centennial Record of the University of California", "In 1866…at <a href="Founders%27%20Rock">Founders' Rock</a>, a group of College of California men watched two ships standing out to sea through the <a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a>. One of them, <a href="Frederick%20Billings">Frederick Billings</a>, thought of the lines of the Anglo-Irish Anglican Bishop <a href="George%20Berkeley">George Berkeley</a>, 'westward the course of empire takes its way,' and suggested that the town and college site be named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Irish philosopher." Although the philosopher's name is pronounced "bark-lee", the pronunciation of the city's name has evolved to suit <a href="American%20English">American English</a> as "burk-lee".

The College of California's "College Homestead Association" planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off adjacent parcels of land. To this end, they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of Berkeley's modern street plan. Their plans fell far short of their desires, and they began a collaboration with the State of California that culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a>.

As construction began on the new site, more residences were constructed in the vicinity of the new campus. At the same time, a settlement of residences, saloons, and various industries grew around the wharf area called "<a href="Ocean%20View%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Ocean View</a>". A <a href="horsecar">horsecar</a> ran from <a href="Temescal%2C%20Oakland%2C%20California">Temescal</a> in Oakland to the university campus along what is now <a href="Telegraph%20Avenue">Telegraph Avenue</a>. The first post office opened in 1872.

By the 1870s, the <a href="Transcontinental%20Railroad">Transcontinental Railroad</a> reached its terminus in Oakland. In 1876, a branch line of the <a href="Central%20Pacific%20Railroad">Central Pacific Railroad</a>, the <a href="Berkeley%20Branch%20Railroad">Berkeley Branch Railroad</a>, was laid from a junction with the mainline called Shellmound (now a part of Emeryville) into what is now <a href="Downtown%20Berkeley%2C%20California">downtown Berkeley</a>. That same year, the mainline of the transcontinental railroad into Oakland was re-routed, putting the right-of-way along the bay shore through Ocean View.

There was a strong prohibition movement in Berkeley at this time. In 1876, the state enacted the "mile limit law", which forbade sale or public consumption of alcohol within one mile (1.6 km) of the new University of California. Then, in 1899 Berkeley residents voted to make their city an alcohol-free zone. Scientists, scholars and religious leaders spoke vehemently of the dangers of alcohol.

In 1878, the people of Ocean View and the area around the university campus, together with local farmers, <a href="municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> as the Town of Berkeley. The first elected trustees of the town were the slate of <a href="Denis%20Kearney">Denis Kearney</a>'s <a href="Workingman%27s%20Party">Workingman's Party</a>, who were particularly favored in the working class area of the former Ocean View, now called "West Berkeley". The area near the university became known for a time as "East Berkeley".

The modern age came quickly to Berkeley, no doubt due to the influence of the university. <a href="Electric%20light">Electric light</a>s were in use by 1888. The telephone had already come to town. Electric <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a>s soon replaced the <a href="horsecar">horsecar</a>. A silent film of one of these early streetcars in Berkeley can be seen at the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> website: "A Trip To Berkeley, California"

Berkeley's slow growth ended abruptly with the <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">Great San Francisco earthquake of 1906</a>. The town and other parts of the <a href="East%20Bay%20%28San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area%29">East Bay</a> escaped serious damage, and thousands of refugees flowed across the Bay. Among them were most of San Francisco's painters and sculptors, who created between 1907 and 1911 one of the largest art colonies west of Chicago. Artist and critic, <a href="Jennie%20V.%20Cannon">Jennie V. Cannon</a>, described the founding of the Berkeley Art Association and the rivalries of competing studios and art clubs.

In 1904, the first hospitals in Berkeley were created: the Alta Bates Sanatorium for women and children, founded by nurse <a href="Alta%20Bates">Alta Bates</a> on Walnut Street, and the <a href="Herrick%20Hospital">Roosevelt (later, Herrick) Hospital</a>, by Dr. LeRoy Francis Herrick, on the corner of Dwight Way and Milvia Street.

In 1908, a statewide referendum that proposed moving the California state capital to Berkeley was defeated by a margin of about 33,000 votes. The city named streets around the proposed capitol grounds for California counties. They bear those names today, a legacy of the failed referendum.

In 1909, the citizens of Berkeley adopted a new charter, and the Town of Berkeley became the City of Berkeley. Rapid growth continued up to the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Crash of 1929</a>. The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> hit Berkeley hard, but not as hard as many other places in the U.S., thanks in part to the university.

On September 17, 1923, <a href="1923%20Berkeley%20Fire">a major fire</a> swept down the hills toward the university campus and the downtown section. Around 640 structures burned before a late afternoon sea breeze stopped its progress, allowing firefighters to put it out.

The next big growth occurred with the advent of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, when large numbers of people moved to the Bay Area to work in the many war industries, such as the immense <a href="Kaiser%20Shipyards">Kaiser Shipyards</a> in nearby <a href="Richmond%2C%20California">Richmond</a>. One who moved out, but played a big role in the outcome of the War was U.C. Professor and Berkeley resident <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>. During the war, an Army base, <a href="Camp%20Ashby">Camp Ashby</a>, was temporarily sited in Berkeley.

The element <a href="berkelium">berkelium</a> was synthesized utilizing the 60-inch cyclotron at UC Berkeley, and named in 1949, recognizing the university, thus also placing the city's name in the list of elements.

During the 1940s, many African Americans migrated to Berkeley. In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Berkeley's population as 11.7% black and 84.6% white.

The postwar years brought moderate growth to the city, as events on the U.C. campus began to build up to the recognizable activism of the sixties. In the 1950s, <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> induced the university to demand a loyalty oath from its professors, many of whom refused to sign the oath on the principle of freedom of thought. In 1960, a U.S. House committee (<a href="HUAC">HUAC</a>) came to San Francisco to investigate the influence of communists in the Bay Area. Their presence was met by protesters, including many from the university. Meanwhile, a number of U.C. students became active in the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. Finally, in 1964, the university provoked a massive student protest by banning distribution of political literature on campus. This protest became the <a href="Free%20Speech%20Movement">Free Speech Movement</a>. As the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> rapidly escalated in the ensuing years, so did student activism at the university, particularly that organized by the <a href="Vietnam%20Day%20Committee">Vietnam Day Committee</a>.

Berkeley is strongly identified with the rapid social changes, civic unrest, and political upheaval that characterized the late 1960s. In that period, Berkeley—especially <a href="Telegraph%20Avenue">Telegraph Avenue</a>—became a focal point for the <a href="hippie">hippie</a> movement, which spilled over the Bay from San Francisco. Many hippies were apolitical drop-outs, rather than students, but in the heady atmosphere of Berkeley in 1967–1969 there was considerable overlap between the hippie movement and the radical left. An iconic event in the Berkeley Sixties scene was a conflict over a parcel of university property south of the contiguous campus site that came to be called "<a href="People%27s%20Park%2C%20Berkeley">People's Park</a>."

The battle over the disposition of People's Park resulted in a month-long occupation of Berkeley by the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> on orders of then-Governor <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. In the end, the park remained undeveloped, and remains so today. A spin-off, "People's Park Annex", was established at the same time by activist citizens of Berkeley on a strip of land above the <a href="Bay%20Area%20Rapid%20Transit">Bay Area Rapid Transit</a> subway construction along Hearst Avenue northwest of the U.C. campus. The land had also been intended for development, but was turned over to the city by BART and is now <a href="Ohlone%20Park">Ohlone Park</a>.

The era of large public protest in Berkeley waned considerably with the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. While the 1960s were the heyday of liberal activism in Berkeley, it remains one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic cities in the United States.

The Berkeley population declined in the 1970s, partly due to an exodus to the suburbs. Some moved because of the rising cost of living throughout the Bay Area, and others because of the decline and disappearance of many industries in West Berkeley.

Increasing enrollment at the University led to replacement of older buildings by large apartment buildings, especially in older parts of the city near the University and downtown. <a href="Preservationists">Preservationists</a> passed the Neighborhood Protection Ordinance in 1973 by ballot measure and the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance in 1974 by City Council. Together, these ordinances brought most new construction to a halt. Facing rising housing costs, residents voted to enact <a href="rent%20control">rent control</a> with <a href="vacancy%20decontrol">vacancy decontrol</a> in 1980.

During the 1970s and 1980s, activists increased their power in local government. This era also saw major developments in Berkeley's environmental and food culture. Berkeley's last Republican mayor, <a href="Wallace%20J.S.%20Johnson">Wallace J.S. Johnson</a> left office in 1971. <a href="Alice%20Waters">Alice Waters</a> opened <a href="Chez%20Panisse">Chez Panisse</a> in 1971. The first curbside recycling program in the U.S. was started by the <a href="Ecology%20Center%20%28Berkeley%29">Ecology Center</a> in 1973. Styrofoam was banned in 1988.

As the city leaned more and more Democratic, local politics became divided between "Progressives" and "Moderates". 1984 saw the Progressives take the majority for the first time. <a href="Nancy%20Skinner%20%28California%20politician%29">Nancy Skinner</a> became the first UC Berkeley student elected to City Council. In 1986, in reaction to the 1984 election, a ballot measure switched Berkeley from at-large to district-based elections for city council.

In 1983, Berkeley's <a href="Domestic%20Partner%20Task%20Force">Domestic Partner Task Force</a> was established, which in 1984 made policy recommendation to the school board, which passed <a href="domestic%20partner">domestic partner</a> legislation. The legislation became a model for similar measures nationwide.

In 1995, California's <a href="Costa-Hawkins%20Rental%20Housing%20Act">Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act</a> ended vacancy control, allowing rents to increase when a tenant moved out. Despite a slow down in 2005–2007, median home prices and rents remain dramatically higher than the rest of the nation, fueled by spillover from the <a href="San%20Francisco%20housing%20shortage">San Francisco housing shortage</a> and population growth.

South and West Berkeley underwent <a href="gentrification">gentrification</a>, with some historically Black neighborhoods such as the Adeline Corridor seeing a 50% decline in Black / African American population from 1990 to 2010. In the 1990s, Public Television's Frontline documentary series featured race relations at Berkeley's only public high school, Berkeley High School.

With an economy dominated by the University of California and a high-demand housing market, Berkeley was relatively unaffected by the <a href="Great%20Recession">Great Recession</a>. State budget cuts caused the University to increase the number of out-of-state and international students, with international enrollment, mostly from Asia, rising from 2,785 in 2007 to 5,951 in 2016. Since then, more international restaurants have opened downtown and on <a href="Telegraph%20Avenue">Telegraph Avenue</a>, including East Asian chains such as <a href="85C%20Bakery%20Cafe">85C Bakery Cafe</a> and <a href="Daiso">Daiso</a>.
The current wave of downtown apartment construction began in 1998, with the construction of a 56 unit mixed use building at 1910 Oxford Street. The developer, <a href="Panoramic%20Interests">Panoramic Interests</a>, followed up with a total of 368 apartments in 7 buildings between 1998 and 2004. Soon afterwards, other developers also began building in Berkeley. One of the buildings from this era was the site of the <a href="Berkeley%20balcony%20collapse">2015 Berkeley balcony collapse disaster</a>.

In 2006, the <a href="Berkeley%20Oak%20Grove%20Protest">Berkeley Oak Grove Protest</a> began protesting construction of a new sports center annex to Memorial Stadium at the expense of a grove of oak trees on the UC campus. The protest ended in September 2008 after a lengthy court process.

In 2007–2008, Berkeley received media attention due to demonstrations against a Marine Corps recruiting office in downtown Berkeley and a series of controversial motions by Berkeley's city council regarding opposition to Marine recruiting. ("See" <a href="Berkeley%20Marine%20Corps%20Recruiting%20Center%20controversy">Berkeley Marine Corps Recruiting Center controversy</a>.)

During the fall of 2010, the <a href="Berkeley%20Student%20Food%20Collective">Berkeley Student Food Collective</a> opened after many protests on the <a href="UC%20Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> campus due to the proposed opening of the fast food chain <a href="Panda%20Express">Panda Express</a>. Students and community members worked together to open a collectively run grocery store right off of the UC Berkeley campus, where the community can buy local, seasonal, humane, and organic foods. The <a href="Berkeley%20Student%20Food%20Collective">Berkeley Student Food Collective</a> still operates at 2440 Bancroft Way.

On September 18, 2012, Berkeley became what may be the first city in the U.S. to officially proclaim a day recognizing bisexuals September 23, which is known as <a href="Celebrate%20Bisexuality%20Day">Celebrate Bisexuality Day</a>.

On September 2, 2014, the city council approved a measure to provide free <a href="medical%20marijuana">medical marijuana</a> to low-income patients.

The Measure D <a href="soda%20tax">soda tax</a> was approved by Berkeley voters on November 4, 2014, the first such tax in the United States.

In the Fall of 2011, the nationwide <a href="Occupy%20Wall%20Street">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement came to two Berkeley locations: on the campus of the University of California and as an encampment in Civic Center Park.

During a <a href="Black%20Lives%20Matter">Black Lives Matter</a> protest on December 6, 2014, police use of tear gas and batons to clear protestors from Telegraph Avenue led to a riot and five consecutive days and nights of protests, marches, and freeway occupations in Berkeley and Oakland. Afterwards, changes were implemented by the Police Department to avoid escalation of violence and to protect bystanders during protests.

Berkeley is located at (37.871775, −122.274603).
According to the <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> the city's area includes of land and (40.83%) water, most of it part of <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>.

Berkeley borders the cities of Albany, Oakland, and Emeryville and Contra Costa County, including unincorporated Kensington, as well as San Francisco Bay.

Berkeley lies within telephone <a href="area%20code">area code</a> 510 (until September 2, 1991, Berkeley was part of the 415 telephone code that now covers only San Francisco and Marin counties), and the postal <a href="ZIP%20code">ZIP code</a>s are 94701 through 94710, 94712, and 94720 for the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> campus.

Most of Berkeley lies on a rolling sedimentary plain that rises gently from sea level to the base of the <a href="Berkeley%20Hills">Berkeley Hills</a>. East of the <a href="Hayward%20Fault">Hayward Fault</a> along the base of the hills, elevation increases more rapidly. The highest peak along the ridge line above Berkeley is <a href="Grizzly%20Peak%20%28Berkeley%20Hills%29">Grizzly Peak</a>, elevation . A number of small creeks run from the hills to the Bay through Berkeley: <a href="Cerrito%20Creek">Cerrito</a>, <a href="Codornices%20Creek">Codornices</a>, <a href="Schoolhouse%20Creek">Schoolhouse</a> and <a href="Strawberry%20Creek">Strawberry</a> Creeks are the principal streams. Most of these are largely <a href="culvert">culvert</a>ed once they reach the plain west of the hills.

The Berkeley Hills are part of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Ranges">Pacific Coast Ranges</a>, and run in a northwest–southeast alignment. Exposed in the Berkeley Hills are cherts and shales of the Claremont Formation (equivalent to the <a href="Monterey%20Formation">Monterey Formation</a>), conglomerate and sandstone of the Orinda Formation and lava flows of the Moraga Volcanics. Of similar age to the Moraga Volcanics (extinct), within the Northbrae neighborhood of Berkeley, are outcroppings of erosion resistant rhyolite. These <a href="rhyolite">rhyolite</a> formations can be seen in several city parks and in the yards of a number of private residences. <a href="Indian%20Rock%20Park">Indian Rock Park</a> in the northeastern part of Berkeley near the Arlington/Marin Circle features a large example.

Berkeley is traversed by the <a href="Hayward%20Fault%20Zone">Hayward Fault Zone</a>, a major branch of the <a href="San%20Andreas%20Fault">San Andreas Fault</a> to the west. No large earthquake has occurred on the Hayward Fault near Berkeley in historic times (except possibly in 1836), but seismologists warn about the geologic record of large tremblors several times in the deeper past. The current assessment is that a Bay Area earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater within the next 30 years is likely, with the Hayward Fault having the highest likelihood among faults in the Bay Area of being the epicenter. Moreover, like much of the Bay Area, Berkeley has many areas of some risk to <a href="soil%20liquefaction">soil liquefaction</a>, with the flat areas closer to the shore at low to high susceptibility.

The <a href="1868%20Hayward%20earthquake">1868 Hayward earthquake</a> did occur on the southern segment of the Hayward Fault in the vicinity of today's city of <a href="Hayward%2C%20California">Hayward</a> (hence, how the fault got its name). This quake destroyed the county seat of Alameda County then located in <a href="San%20Leandro%2C%20California">San Leandro</a> and it subsequently moved to Oakland. It was strongly felt in San Francisco, causing major damage, and experienced by Samuel Clemens (<a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>). It was regarded as the "Great San Francisco earthquake" prior to 1906. It produced a furrow in the ground along the fault line in Berkeley, across the grounds of the new <a href="State%20Asylum%20for%20the%20Deaf%2C%20Dumb%20and%20Blind">State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind</a> then under construction, which was noted by one early University of California professor. Though no significant damage was reported to most of the few Berkeley buildings of the time, the 1868 quake did destroy the vulnerable adobe home of Domingo Peralta in north Berkeley.

Today, evidence of the Hayward Fault's "creeping" is visible at various locations in Berkeley. Cracked roadways, sharp jogs in streams, and springs mark the fault's path. However, since it cuts across the base of the hills, the creep is often concealed by or confused with slide activity. Some of the slide activity itself, however, results from movement on the Hayward Fault.

A notorious segment of the Hayward Fault runs lengthwise down the middle of <a href="California%20Memorial%20Stadium">Memorial Stadium</a> at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon on the University of California campus. Photos and measurements show the movement of the fault through the stadium.

Berkeley has a cool summer <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> (type <a href="Mediterranean%20climate%23Warm-summer%20Mediterranean%20climate">Csb</a> in the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>), with dry summers and wet winters. Berkeley's location directly opposite the <a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a> ensures that typical eastward fog flow blankets the city more often than its neighbors. The summers are cooler than a typical Mediterranean climate thanks to <a href="upwelling">upwelling</a> ocean currents along the California coast. These help produce cool and <a href="San%20Francisco%20fog">fog</a>gy nights and mornings.

Winter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration, but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights. It does not normally snow, though occasionally the hilltops get a dusting. Spring and fall are transitional and intermediate, with some rainfall and variable temperature. Summer typically brings night and morning low clouds or fog, followed by sunny, warm days. The warmest and driest months are typically June through September, with the highest temperatures occurring in September. Mid-summer (July–August) is often a bit cooler due to the sea breezes and fog common then.

Average January temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . Average September (the warmest month) temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . In a year, there are an average of 2.9 days with highs of or higher, and an average of 0.8 days with lows of or lower. The highest recorded temperature was on June 15, 2000 and July 16, 1993, and the lowest recorded temperature was on December 22, 1990.

January is normally the wettest month, averaging of precipitation. Average annual precipitation is , falling on an average of 63.7 days each year. The most rainfall in one month was in February 1998. The most rainfall in 24 hours was on January 4, 1982. As in most of California, the heaviest rainfall years are usually associated with warm water <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a> episodes in the Pacific (e.g., 1982–83; 1997–98), which bring in drenching "<a href="pineapple%20express">pineapple express</a>" storms. In contrast, dry years are often associated with cold Pacific <a href="La%20Ni%C3%B1a">La Niña</a> episodes. Light snow has fallen on rare occasions. Snow has generally fallen every several years on the higher peaks of the <a href="Berkeley%20Hills">Berkeley Hills</a>.

In the late spring and early fall, strong <a href="Diablo%20wind">offshore winds</a> of sinking air typically develop, bringing heat and dryness to the area. In the spring, this is not usually a problem as vegetation is still moist from winter rains, but extreme dryness prevails by the fall, creating a danger of wildfires. In September 1923 a major fire swept through the neighborhoods north of the university campus, stopping just short of downtown. ("See" <a href="1923%20Berkeley%20fire">1923 Berkeley fire</a>). On October 20, 1991, gusty, hot winds fanned a conflagration along the Berkeley–Oakland border, killing 25 people and injuring 150, as well as destroying 2,449 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units. ("See" <a href="1991%20Oakland%20firestorm">1991 Oakland firestorm</a>)

The <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a> reported that Berkeley had a population of 112,580. The population density was 10,752 people per square mile of land area (4,104/km²). The racial makeup of Berkeley was 66,996 (59.5%) <a href="White%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">White</a>, 11,241 (10.0%) <a href="African%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Black or African American</a>, 479 (0.4%) <a href="Native%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Native American</a>, 21,690 (19.3%) <a href="Asian%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Asian</a> (8.4% <a href="Chinese%20American">Chinese</a>, 2.4% <a href="Indian%20American">Indian</a>, 2.1% <a href="Korean%20American">Korean</a>, 1.6% <a href="Japanese%20American">Japanese</a>, 1.5% <a href="Filipino%20American">Filipino</a>, 1.0% <a href="Vietnamese%20American">Vietnamese</a>), 186 (0.2%) <a href="Pacific%20Islander%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Pacific Islander</a>, 4,994 (4.4%) from <a href="Race%20%28United%20States%20Census%29">other races</a>, and 6,994 (6.2%) from two or more races. <a href="Hispanic%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Hispanic</a> or <a href="Latino%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Latino</a> of any race were 12,209 persons (10.8%). 6.8% of the city's population was of <a href="Mexican%20American">Mexican</a> ancestry.

The Census reported that 99,731 people (88.6% of the population) lived in households, 12,430 (11.0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 419 (0.4%) were institutionalized.

There were 46,029 households, out of which 8,467 (18.4%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 13,569 (29.5%) were <a href="marriage">opposite-sex married couples</a> living together, 3,855 (8.4%) had a female householder with no husband present, 1,368 (3.0%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 2,931 (6.4%) <a href="POSSLQ">unmarried opposite-sex partnerships</a>, and 961 (2.1%) <a href="same-sex%20partnerships">same-sex married couples or partnerships</a>. 16,904 households (36.7%) were made up of individuals and 4,578 (9.9%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17. There were 18,792 <a href="family%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">families</a> (40.8% of all households); the average family size was 2.81. There were 49,454 housing units at an average density of 2,794.6 per square mile (1,079.0/km²), of which 18,846 (40.9%) were owner-occupied, and 27,183 (59.1%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 1.0%; the rental vacancy rate was 4.5%. 45,096 people (40.1% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 54,635 people (48.5%) lived in rental housing units.

The population was spread out with 13,872 people (12.3%) under the age of 18, 30,295 people (26.9%) aged 18 to 24, 30,231 people (26.9%) aged 25 to 44, 25,006 people (22.2%) aged 45 to 64, and 13,176 people (11.7%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31.0 years. For every 100 females there were 95.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.2 males.

According to the 2011 American Community Survey 5-Year estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $60,908, and the median income for a family was $102,976. Males had a median income of $67,476 versus $57,319 for females. The per capita income for the city was $38,896. About 7.2% of families and 18.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.2% of those under age 18 and 9.2% of those age 65 or over.

Berkeley has a higher-than-average crime rate, particularly property crime, though the crime rate has fallen significantly since 2000.

In 2015, an estimated 834-1200 people were homeless in Berkeley.

Berkeley is served by <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> (<a href="Capitol%20Corridor">Capitol Corridor</a>), <a href="AC%20Transit">AC Transit</a>, <a href="Bay%20Area%20Rapid%20Transit">BART</a> (<a href="Ashby%20%28BART%20station%29">Ashby</a>, <a href="Downtown%20Berkeley%20Station">Downtown Berkeley Station</a> and <a href="North%20Berkeley%20%28BART%29">North Berkeley</a>) and bus shuttles operated by major employers including <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> and <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. The <a href="Eastshore%20Freeway">Eastshore Freeway</a> (<a href="Interstate%2080%20%28California%29">Interstate 80</a> and <a href="Interstate%20580%20%28California%29">Interstate 580</a>) runs along the bay shoreline. Each day there is an influx of thousands of cars into the city by commuting UC faculty, staff and students, making parking for more than a few hours an expensive proposition.

Berkeley has one of the highest rates of bicycle and pedestrian commuting in the nation. Berkeley is the safest city of its size in California for pedestrians and cyclists, considering the number of injuries per pedestrian and cyclist, rather than per capita.
Berkeley has modified its original grid roadway structure through use of diverters and barriers, moving most traffic out of neighborhoods and onto arterial streets (visitors often find this confusing, because the diverters are not shown on all maps). Berkeley maintains a separate grid of arterial streets for bicycles, called <a href="Bicycle%20Boulevards">Bicycle Boulevards</a>, with bike lanes and lower amounts of car traffic than the major streets they often parallel.

Berkeley hosts <a href="car%20sharing">car sharing</a> networks including <a href="Uhaul%20Car%20Share">Uhaul Car Share</a>, and <a href="Zipcar">Zipcar</a>. Rather than owning (and parking) their own cars, members share a group of cars parked nearby. Web- and telephone-based reservation systems keep track of hours and charges. Several "pods" (points of departure where cars are kept) exist throughout the city, in several downtown locations, at the Ashby and North Berkeley BART stations, and at various other locations in Berkeley (and other cities in the region). Using alternative transportation is encouraged.

Berkeley has had recurring problems with <a href="parking%20meter">parking meter</a> vandalism. In 1999, over 2,400 Berkeley meters were jammed, smashed, or sawed apart. Starting in 2005 and continuing into 2006, Berkeley began to phase out mechanical meters in favor of more centralized electronic meters.

The first commuter service to San Francisco was provided by the <a href="Central%20Pacific%20Railroad">Central Pacific</a>'s <a href="Berkeley%20Branch%20Railroad">Berkeley Branch Railroad</a>, a <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a> <a href="steam%20railroad">steam railroad</a>, which terminated in downtown Berkeley, and connected in Emeryville (at a locale then known as "Shellmound") with trains to the <a href="Oakland%20Long%20Wharf">Oakland ferry pier</a> as well as with the Central Pacific main line starting in 1876. The Berkeley Branch line was extended from Shattuck and University to Vine Street ("Berryman's Station") in 1878. Starting in 1882, Berkeley trains ran directly to the Oakland Pier. In the 1880s, <a href="Southern%20Pacific%20Railroad">Southern Pacific</a> assumed operations of the Berkeley Branch. In 1911, Southern Pacific electrified this line and the several others it constructed in Berkeley, creating its <a href="East%20Bay%20Electric%20Lines">East Bay Electric Lines</a> division. The huge and heavy cars specially built for these lines were called the "Red Trains" or the "Big Red Cars." The Shattuck line was extended and connected with two other Berkeley lines (the Ninth Street Line and the California Street line) at Solano and Colusa (the "Colusa <a href="Wye%20%28rail%29">Wye</a>"). At this time, the <a href="Northbrae%20Tunnel">Northbrae Tunnel</a> and Rose Street Undercrossing were constructed, both of which still exist. (The Rose Street Undercrossing is not accessible to the public, being situated between what is now two backyards.) The fourth Berkeley line was the Ellsworth St. line to the university campus. The last Red Trains ran in July 1941.

The first electric rail service in Berkeley was provided by several small <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> companies starting in 1891. Most of these were eventually bought up by the <a href="Key%20System">Key System</a> of <a href="Francis%20%26quot%3BBorax%26quot%3B%20Smith">Francis "Borax" Smith</a> who added lines and improved equipment. The Key System's streetcars were operated by its East Bay Street Railways division. Principal lines in Berkeley ran on Euclid, The Arlington, College, Telegraph, Shattuck, San Pablo, University, and Grove (today's Martin Luther King Jr. Way). The last streetcars ran in 1948, replaced by buses.

The first electric commuter interurban-type trains to San Francisco from Berkeley were put in operation by the Key System in 1903, several years before the Southern Pacific electrified its steam commuter lines. Like the SP, Key trains ran to a pier serviced by the Key's own fleet of <a href="Ferries%20of%20San%20Francisco%20Bay">ferryboats</a>, which also docked at the Ferry Building in San Francisco. After the <a href="San%20Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland%20Bay%20Bridge">Bay Bridge</a> was built, the Key trains ran to the <a href="Transbay%20Terminal">Transbay Terminal</a> in San Francisco, sharing tracks on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge with the SP's red trains and the <a href="Sacramento%20Northern">Sacramento Northern</a> Railroad. It was at this time that the Key trains acquired their letter designations, which were later preserved by Key's public successor, AC Transit. Today's F bus is the successor of the F train. Likewise, the E, G and the H. Before the Bridge, these lines were simply the Shattuck Avenue Line, the Claremont Line, the Westbrae Line, and the Sacramento Street Line, respectively.

After the Southern Pacific abandoned transbay service in 1941, the Key System acquired the rights to use its tracks and <a href="overhead%20lines">catenary</a> on Shattuck north of Dwight Way and through the Northbrae Tunnel to The Alameda for the F-train. The SP tracks along Monterey Avenue as far as Colusa had been acquired by the Key System in 1933 for the H-train, but were abandoned in 1941. The Key System trains stopped running in April 1958. In 1963, the Northbrae Tunnel was opened to auto traffic.

According to the city's 2016 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

Berkeley is the location of a number of nationally prominent businesses, many of which have been pioneers in their areas of operation. Notable businesses include <a href="Chez%20Panisse">Chez Panisse</a>, birthplace of <a href="California%20cuisine">California cuisine</a>, <a href="Peet%27s">Peet's</a> Coffee's original store, the <a href="Claremont%20Resort">Claremont Resort</a>, punk rock haven <a href="924%20Gilman">924 Gilman</a>, and <a href="Saul%20Zaentz">Saul Zaentz</a>'s <a href="Fantasy%20Studios">Fantasy Studios</a>. Notable former businesses include pioneer bookseller <a href="Cody%27s%20Books">Cody's Books</a>, <a href="The%20Nature%20Company">The Nature Company</a>, and the <a href="Consumers%27%20Cooperative%20of%20Berkeley">Berkeley Co-op</a>.

Berkeley has relatively few <a href="chain%20stores">chain stores</a> for a city of its size, due to policies and zoning that promote small businesses and limits to the size of certain types of stores.




Berkeley has a number of distinct neighborhoods.
Surrounding the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley%20Campus%20Architecture">University of California campus</a> are the most densely populated parts of the city. West of the campus is <a href="Downtown%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Downtown Berkeley</a>, the city's traditional commercial core; home of the <a href="civic%20center">civic center</a>, the city's only public <a href="Berkeley%20High%20School%20%28California%29">high school</a>, the busiest <a href="Downtown%20Berkeley%20Station">BART station</a> in Berkeley, as well as a major transfer point for <a href="AC%20Transit">AC Transit</a> buses. South of the campus is the <a href="Southside%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Southside</a> neighborhood, mainly a <a href="student%20ghetto">student ghetto</a>, where much of the university's <a href="UC%20Berkeley%20student%20housing">student housing</a> is located. The busiest stretch of <a href="Telegraph%20Avenue">Telegraph Avenue</a> is in this neighborhood. North of the campus is the quieter <a href="Northside%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Northside</a> neighborhood, the location of the <a href="Graduate%20Theological%20Union">Graduate Theological Union</a>.

Farther from the university campus, the influence of the university quickly becomes less visible. Most of Berkeley's neighborhoods are primarily made up of detached houses, often with separate in-law units in the rear, although larger apartment buildings are also common in many neighborhoods. Commercial activities are concentrated along the major avenues and at important intersections.

In the southeastern corner of the city is the <a href="Claremont%2C%20Oakland/Berkeley%2C%20California">Claremont District</a>, home to the <a href="Claremont%20Resort">Claremont Hotel</a>; and the <a href="Elmwood%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Elmwood District</a>, with a small shopping area on College Avenue. West of Elmwood is <a href="South%20Berkeley%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">South Berkeley</a>, known for its weekend <a href="flea%20market">flea market</a> at the <a href="Ashby%20%28BART%20station%29">Ashby Station</a>.

West of (and including) San Pablo Avenue, a major commercial corridor, is <a href="West%20Berkeley%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">West Berkeley</a>, the historic commercial center of the city, and the former unincorporated town of <a href="Ocean%20View%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Ocean View</a>. West Berkeley contains the remnants of Berkeley's industrial area, much of which has been replaced by retail and office uses, as well as residential live/work loft space, with the decline of manufacturing in the United States. The areas of South and West Berkeley are in the midst of redevelopment. Some residents have opposed redevelopment in this area. Along the shoreline of San Francisco Bay at the foot of University Avenue is the <a href="Berkeley%20Marina">Berkeley Marina</a>. Nearby is Berkeley's <a href="Aquatic%20Park%20%28Berkeley%29">Aquatic Park</a>, featuring an artificial linear lagoon of San Francisco Bay.

North of Downtown is the <a href="North%20Berkeley%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">North Berkeley</a> neighborhood, which has been nicknamed the "<a href="Gourmet%20Ghetto">Gourmet Ghetto</a>" because of the concentration of well-known restaurants and other food-related businesses. West of North Berkeley is <a href="Westbrae%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Westbrae</a>, a small neighborhood through which part of the <a href="Ohlone%20Greenway">Ohlone Greenway</a> runs. Meanwhile, further north of North Berkeley are <a href="Northbrae%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Northbrae</a>, a master-planned subdivision from the early 20th century, and <a href="Thousand%20Oaks%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Thousand Oaks</a>. Above these last three neighborhoods, on the western slopes of the <a href="Berkeley%20Hills">Berkeley Hills</a> are the neighborhoods of <a href="Cragmont%2C%20Berkeley">Cragmont</a> and <a href="La%20Loma%20Park">La Loma Park</a>, notable for their dramatic views, winding streets, and numerous public stairways and paths.


The city has many parks, and promotes greenery and the environment. The city has planted trees for years and is a leader in the nationwide effort to re-tree urban areas. <a href="Tilden%20Regional%20Park">Tilden Regional Park</a>, lies east of the city, occupying the upper extent of <a href="Wildcat%20Canyon">Wildcat Canyon</a> between the Berkeley Hills and the San Pablo Ridge. The city is also heavily involved in creek restoration and wetlands restoration, including a planned "daylighting" of Strawberry Creek along Center Street. The <a href="Berkeley%20Marina">Berkeley Marina</a> and <a href="East%20Shore%20State%20Park">East Shore State Park</a> flank its shoreline at <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> and organizations like the <a href="Urban%20Creeks%20Council">Urban Creeks Council</a> and <a href="Friends%20of%20the%20Five%20Creeks">Friends of the Five Creeks</a> the former of which is headquartered in Berkeley support the riparian areas in the town and coastlines as well. <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Ch%C3%A1vez%20Park">César Chávez Park</a>, near the Berkeley Marina, was built at the former site of the city dump.

165 buildings in Berkeley are designated as local landmarks or local structures of merit. Of these, 49 are listed in the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, including:

Historic Districts listed in the National Register of Historic Places:

Berkeley is home to the <a href="Chilean-American">Chilean-American</a> community's <a href="La%20Pe%C3%B1a%20Cultural%20Center">La Peña Cultural Center</a>, the largest cultural center for this community in the United States. <a href="The%20Freight%20and%20Salvage">The Freight and Salvage</a> is the oldest established full-time folk and traditional music venue west of the Mississippi River.

Additionally, Berkeley is home to the off-broadway theater Berkeley Repertory Theater, commonly known as "Berkeley Rep". The Berkeley Repertory Theater consists of two stages, a school, and has received a Tony Award for Outstanding Regional Theatre. The historic Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA) is operated by UC Berkeley, and was moved to downtown Berkeley in January of 2016. It offers many exhibitions and screenings of historic films, as well as outreach programs within the community.


<a href="University%20of%20California%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>'s main campus is in the city limits.

<a href="Graduate%20Theological%20Union">The Graduate Theological Union</a>, a consortium of nine independent theological schools, is located a block north of the University of California Berkeley's main campus. The Graduate Theological Union has the largest number of students and faculty of any religious studies doctoral program in the United States. In addition to more theological schools, <a href="Zaytuna%20College">Zaytuna College</a>, a newly established Muslim liberal arts college, has taken 'Holy Hill' as its new home. <a href="Wright%20Institute">Wright Institute</a>, a psychology graduate school, is located in Berkeley. <a href="Berkeley%20City%20College">Berkeley City College</a> is a <a href="Junior%20college">community college</a> in the <a href="Peralta%20Community%20College%20District">Peralta Community College District</a>.

The <a href="Berkeley%20Unified%20School%20District">Berkeley Unified School District</a> operates public schools.

The first public school in Berkeley was the <a href="Ocean%20View%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20California">Ocean View</a> School, now the site of the Berkeley Adult School located at Virginia Street and San Pablo Avenue. The public schools today are administered by the <a href="Berkeley%20Unified%20School%20District">Berkeley Unified School District</a>.

The hamlet has been said to take its name from the "Bold Venture" that it must have appeared to build a farm in this moorland, but this is probably <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a>, as "Bol-" is a common prefix in Cornish placenames. It is much more likely that the name derives from the 'Bold Adventure' tin-working area which was in operation near Jamaica Inn during the 1840s-1850s 

Bolventor is the location of the famous <a href="Jamaica%20Inn">Jamaica Inn</a> <a href="coaching%20inn">coaching inn</a>. It is bypassed by a <a href="dual%20carriageway">dual carriageway</a> section of the <a href="A30%20road">A30</a> trunk road; before the bypass was built the hamlet straddled the A30 road.

The inn that inspired the novel, Jamaica Inn, has stood beside the main road through the village since 1547. It is now a tourist attraction in its own right and dominates the hamlet.

Politically, Bengal is divided between the sovereign Republic of <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, which covers two-thirds of the region, and <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a> which is now part of <a href="India">India</a>. In 2011, the population of Bengal was estimated to be 250 million, making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world. An estimated 160 million people live in Bangladesh, while 91.3 million people live in West Bengal. The predominant ethno-linguistic group is the <a href="Bengalis">Bengali people</a>, who speak the <a href="Indo-Aryan%20languages">Indo-Aryan</a> <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali language</a>. <a href="Bengali%20Muslims">Bengali Muslims</a> are the majority in Bangladesh. <a href="Bengali%20Hindus">Bengali Hindus</a> are the majority in West Bengal.

Later writers noted merchant shipping links between Bengal and <a href="Roman%20Egypt">Roman Egypt</a>.

The Bengali <a href="Pala%20Empire">Pala Empire</a> was the last major <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> imperial power in the subcontinent, founded in 750 and becoming the dominant power in the northern Indian subcontinent by the 9th century, before being replaced by the Hindu <a href="Sena%20dynasty">Sena dynasty</a> in the 12th century. <a href="Islam">Islam</a> was introduced during the Pala Empire, through trade with the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>. The Islamic <a href="Bengal%20Sultanate">Bengal Sultanate</a>, founded in 1352, was absorbed into the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a> in 1576. The Mughal <a href="Bengal%20Subah">Bengal Subah</a> province became a major global exporter, a center of worldwide industries such as <a href="Muslin%20trade%20in%20Bengal">muslin</a>, <a href="silk">silk</a>, <a href="pearl">pearl</a>, <a href="cotton">cotton</a> <a href="textile">textile</a>s, and <a href="shipbuilding">shipbuilding</a>.

From 600 BCE, the second wave of <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a> engulfed the north Indian subcontinent, as part of the <a href="Northern%20Black%20Polished%20Ware">Northern Black Polished Ware</a> culture.

Ancient Bengal was divided between the regions of <a href="Varendra">Varendra</a>, <a href="Suhma">Suhma</a>, <a href="Anga">Anga</a>, <a href="Vanga">Vanga</a>, <a href="Samatata">Samatata</a> and <a href="Harikela">Harikela</a>. Early Indian literature described the region as a <a href="thalassocracy">thalassocracy</a>, with colonies in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. For example, the first recorded king of Sri Lanka was a Bengali prince called <a href="Prince%20Vijaya">Vijaya</a>. The region was known to the ancient <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greeks</a> and <a href="Roman%20world">Romans</a> as <a href="Gangaridai">Gangaridai</a>. The Greek ambassador <a href="Megasthenes">Megasthenes</a> chronicled its military strength and dominance of the <a href="Ganges%20delta">Ganges delta</a>. The invasion army of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> was deterred by the accounts of Gangaridai's power in 325 BCE. Later Roman accounts noted maritime trade routes with Bengal.Another prominent kingdom in Ancient Bengal was <a href="Pundravardhana">Pundravardhana</a> which was located in Northern Bengal with its capital being located in modern-day <a href="Bogra">Bogra</a>, the kingdom was prominently buddhist leaving behind historic <a href="Viharas">Viharas</a> such as <a href="Mahasthangarh">Mahasthangarh</a>. In vedic mythology the royal families of Magadha, Anga, Vanga, Suhma and Kalinga were all related and descended from one King.

Ancient Bengal was considered a part of <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a> region, which was the cradle of Indian arts and sciences. Currently the Maghada region is divided into several states that are <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a>, <a href="Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a>, <a href="Tripura">Tripura</a>, Southern and Northwestern <a href="Assam">Assam</a> and Bengal (<a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a> and <a href="Bangladesh">East Bengal</a>) The legacy of Magadha includes the concept of <a href="0">zero</a>, the invention of <a href="Chess">Chess</a> and the theory of solar and lunar eclipses and the Earth orbiting the Sun. Secular Sanskrit, or standard Old <a href="Indo-Aryan%20languages">Indo-Aryan</a>, was spoken across Bengal. The <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali language</a> evolved from Old Indo-Aryan Sanskrit dialects. The region was ruled by <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>, <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> and <a href="Jain">Jain</a> dynasties, including the <a href="Mauryan">Mauryan</a>s, <a href="Gupta%20Empire">Guptas</a>, <a href="Varman%20dynasty">Varmans</a>, <a href="Khadga%20dynasty">Khadgas</a>, <a href="Pala%20Empire">Palas</a>, <a href="Candra%20dynasty">Chandras</a> and <a href="Sena%20dynasty">Senas</a> among others. In the 9th century, <a href="Arab%20Muslim">Arab Muslim</a> traders frequented Bengali seaports and found the region to be a thriving <a href="seafaring">seafaring</a> kingdom with well-developed coinage and banking.

The <a href="Pala%20Empire">Pala Empire</a> was an imperial power in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, which originated in the region of Bengal. They were followers of the <a href="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> and <a href="Tantras">Tantric</a> schools of <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. The empire was founded with the election of <a href="Gopala">Gopala</a> as the emperor of <a href="Gaur%2C%20West%20Bengal">Gauda</a> in 750. At its height in the early 9th century, the Pala Empire was the dominant power in the northern subcontinent, with its territory stretching across parts of modern-day eastern <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, northern and northeastern <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> and <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. The empire enjoyed relations with the <a href="Srivijaya%20Empire">Srivijaya Empire</a>, the <a href="Tibetan%20Empire">Tibetan Empire</a>, and the <a href="Arab">Arab</a> <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>. <a href="Islam">Islam</a> first appeared in Bengal during Pala rule, as a result of increased trade between Bengal and the Middle East. The resurgent <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="Sena%20dynasty">Sena dynasty</a> dethroned the Pala Empire in the 12th century, ending the reign of the last major Buddhist imperial power in the subcontinent.

<a href="Muslim%20conquests%20of%20the%20Indian%20subcontinent">Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent</a> absorbed Bengal in 1204. The region was annexed by the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>. Muslim rule introduced <a href="agrarian%20reform">agrarian reform</a>, a <a href="Bengali%20calendar">new calendar</a> and <a href="Sufism">Sufism</a>. The region saw the rise of important <a href="city%20state">city state</a>s in <a href="Sonargaon">Sonargaon</a>, <a href="Satgaon">Satgaon</a> and <a href="Gau%E1%B8%8Da%20%28city%29">Lakhnauti</a>. By 1352, <a href="Shamsuddin%20Ilyas%20Shah">Ilyas Shah</a> achieved the unification of an independent Bengal. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the <a href="Bengal%20Sultanate">Bengal Sultanate</a> was a major diplomatic, economic and military power in the subcontinent. It developed the subcontinent's relations with China, Egypt, the Timurid Empire and East Africa. In 1540, <a href="Sher%20Shah%20Suri">Sher Shah Suri</a> was crowned Emperor of the northern subcontinent in the Bengali capital <a href="Gaur%2C%20West%20Bengal">Gaur</a>.

The <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a> conquered Bengal in the 16th century. The <a href="Bengal%20Subah">Bengal Subah</a> province in the Mughal Empire was the wealthiest state in the subcontinent. Bengal's trade and wealth impressed the Mughals so much that it was described as the "Paradise of the Nations" by the <a href="Mughal%20Emperor">Mughal Emperor</a>s. The region was also notable for its powerful semi-independent <a href="Zamindars%20of%20Bengal">aristocracy</a>, including the <a href="Baro-Bhuyan">Twelve Bhuiyans</a> and the <a href="Nawabs%20of%20Bengal">Nawabs of Bengal</a>. It was visited by several world explorers, including <a href="Ibn%20Battuta">Ibn Battuta</a>, <a href="Niccolo%20De%20Conti">Niccolo De Conti</a> and <a href="Admiral%20Zheng%20He">Admiral Zheng He</a>.

Under <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal rule</a>, Bengal was a center of the worldwide <a href="muslin">muslin</a>, <a href="silk">silk</a> and <a href="pearl">pearl</a> trades. During the Mughal era, the most important center of cotton production was Bengal, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka, leading to muslin being called "daka" in distant markets such as <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>. Domestically, much of India depended on Bengali products such as <a href="rice">rice</a>, silks and cotton textiles. Overseas, Europeans depended on Bengali products such as cotton textiles, silks and opium; Bengal accounted for 40% of <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch</a> imports from <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, for example, including more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks. From Bengal, saltpeter was also shipped to Europe, opium was sold in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, raw silk was exported to Japan and the Netherlands, cotton and silk textiles were exported to Europe, Indonesia, and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, cotton cloth was exported to the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> and the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. Bengal also had a large <a href="shipbuilding">shipbuilding</a> industry. In terms of shipbuilding tonnage during the 16th–18th centuries, the annual output of Bengal alone totaled around 2,232,500 tons, larger than the combined output of the Dutch (450,000–550,000 tons), the British (340,000 tons), and North America (23,061 tons).

Since the 16th century, European traders traversed the sea routes to Bengal, following the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese</a> conquests of Malacca and Goa. The Portuguese established a <a href="Portuguese%20Chittagong">settlement in Chittagong</a> with permission from the Bengal Sultanate in 1528, but were later expelled by the Mughals in 1666. In the 18th-century, the Mughal Court rapidly disintegrated due to <a href="Nader%20Shah%27s%20invasion%20of%20India">Nader Shah's invasion</a> and internal rebellions, allowing European colonial powers to set up trading posts across the territory. The <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a> eventually emerged as the foremost military power in the region; and defeated the last independent Nawab of Bengal at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Plassey">Battle of Plassey</a> in 1757.

In Bengal effective political and military power was transferred from the old regime to the British East India Company around 1757–65.
<a href="Company%20rule%20in%20India">Company rule in India</a> began under the <a href="Bengal%20Presidency">Bengal Presidency</a>. <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> was named the capital of <a href="British%20India">British India</a> in 1772. The presidency was run by a military-civil administration, including the <a href="Bengal%20Army">Bengal Army</a>, and had the world's sixth earliest railway network. Great <a href="Famines%20in%20India">Bengal famines</a> struck several times during colonial rule (notably the <a href="Great%20Bengal%20famine%20of%201770">Great Bengal famine of 1770</a> and <a href="Bengal%20famine%20of%201943">Bengal famine of 1943</a>). The <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a> was initiated on the outskirts of Calcutta, and spread to Dhaka, Chittagong, Jalpaiguri, Sylhet and Agartala, in solidarity with revolts in North India. The failure of the rebellion led to the abolishment of the Mughal Court and direct rule by the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a>. The late 19th and early 20th century <a href="Bengal%20Renaissance">Bengal Renaissance</a> had a great impact on the cultural and economic life of Bengal. Between 1905 and 1912, an <a href="Partition%20of%20Bengal%20%281905%29">abortive attempt</a> was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones, that included the short-lived province of <a href="Eastern%20Bengal%20and%20Assam">Eastern Bengal and Assam</a> based in Dacca and Shillong. Under British rule, Bengal experienced <a href="deindustrialization">deindustrialization</a>.

In 1876, 200,000 people were killed in Bengal by the <a href="1876%20Bangladesh%20cyclone">Great Bangladesh cyclone</a>.

Bengal played a major role in the <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">Indian independence movement</a>, in which <a href="Revolutionary%20movement%20for%20Indian%20independence">revolutionary groups</a> were dominant. Armed attempts to overthrow the British Raj began with the rebellion of <a href="Titumir">Titumir</a>, and reached a climax when <a href="Subhas%20Chandra%20Bose">Subhas Chandra Bose</a> led the <a href="Indian%20National%20Army">Indian National Army</a> against the British. Bengal was also central in the rising political awareness of the Muslim population—the <a href="All-India%20Muslim%20League">All-India Muslim League</a> was established in Dhaka in 1906. The Muslim homeland movement pushed for a sovereign state in eastern British India with the <a href="Lahore%20Resolution">Lahore Resolution</a> in 1943. <a href="Hindu%20nationalism">Hindu nationalism</a> was also strong in Bengal, which was home to groups like the <a href="Hindu%20Mahasabha">Hindu Mahasabha</a>. In spite of a last-ditch effort to form a <a href="United%20Bengal">United Bengal</a>, when India <a href="History%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20India">gained independence</a> in 1947, Bengal was <a href="Partition%20of%20Bengal%20%281947%29">partitioned</a> along religious lines. The western part went to India (and was named West Bengal) while the eastern part joined <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> as a province called <a href="East%20Bengal">East Bengal</a> (later renamed <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a>, giving rise to Bangladesh in 1971). The circumstances of partition were bloody, with widespread religious riots in Bengal.

The <a href="1970%20Bhola%20cyclone">1970 Bhola cyclone</a> which took the lives of 500,000 people in Bengal, made it one of the most deadliest recorded cyclones.

West Bengal became one of India's most populous states. Calcutta, the former capital of the British Raj, became the state capital of West Bengal and continued to be India's largest city until the late 20th century, when severe power shortages, strikes and a violent <a href="Naxalite">Marxist-Naxalite</a> movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure in the 1960s and 70s, leading to a period of economic stagnation. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the <a href="Left%20Front%20%28West%20Bengal%29">Left Front</a> won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a>. The Left Front, led by the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29">Communist Party of India (Marxist)</a> (CPI(M)) governed the state for over three decades, which was the world's longest elected <a href="Communist">Communist</a> administration in history. Since the 2000s, West Bengal has experienced an economic rejuvenation, particularly in its <a href="IT">IT</a> industry.


The princely state of <a href="Hill%20Tippera">Hill Tippera</a>, that was under the <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> of <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, was ruled by a Bengali-speaking monarchy. Following the death of <a href="Maharaja">Maharaja</a> <a href="Bir%20Bikram%20Kishore%20Debbarman">Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman</a>, the princely state acceded to the <a href="Union%20of%20India">Union of India</a> on 15 October 1949 under the <a href="Tripura%20Merger%20Agreement">Tripura Merger Agreement</a> signed by <a href="Maharani">Maharani</a> <a href="Regent">Regent</a> <a href="Kanchan%20Prava%20Devi">Kanchan Prava Devi</a>. By the 1950s, the region had a Bengali majority population due to the influx of Hindus from East Pakistan after partition. It became a <a href="Union%20Territory">Union Territory</a> of India in November 1953. It was granted full statehood with an elected legislature in July 1963. An <a href="Insurgency%20in%20Northeast%20India">insurgency</a> by indigenous people affected the state for several years. The <a href="Left%20Front%20%28Tripura%29">Left Front</a> ruled the state between 1978 and 1988, followed by a stint of Indian National Congress rule until 1993, and then a return to the Communists.

The <a href="Barak%20Valley">Barak Valley</a> joined the <a href="union%20of%20India">union of India</a> after its partition from <a href="Sylhet%20Division">Sylhet</a> in 1947 and has been a part of the state of <a href="Assam">Assam</a>. One of the most significant events in the region's history was the <a href="Bengali%20Language%20Movement%20%28Barak%20Valley%29">language movement</a> in 1961, in which the killing of agitators by state police led to Bengali being recognized as one of the official languages of Assam. The issue of Bengali settlement in the state has been a contentious part of the <a href="Assam%20conflict">Assam conflict</a>.


<a href="East%20Bengal">East Bengal</a>, which was later renamed to <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a> in 1955, was home to Pakistan's demographic majority and played an instrumental role in the founding of the new state. Strategically, Pakistan joined the <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a> under the Bengali prime minister <a href="Mohammad%20Ali%20of%20Bogra">Mohammad Ali of Bogra</a> as a bulwark against communism. However, tensions between East and <a href="West%20Pakistan">West Pakistan</a> grew rapidly over political exclusion, economic neglect and ethnic and linguistic discrimination. The State of Pakistan was subjected to years of <a href="military%20occupation">military rule</a> due to fears of Bengali political supremacy under democracy. Elected Bengali-led governments at the federal and provincial levels, which were led by statesmen such as <a href="A.%20K.%20Fazlul%20Huq">A. K. Fazlul Huq</a> and <a href="H.%20S.%20Suhrawardy">H. S. Suhrawardy</a>, were deposed.

East Pakistan witnessed the rise of Bengali <a href="self%20determination">self determination</a> calls led by <a href="Sheikh%20Mujibur%20Rahman">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> and <a href="Maulana%20Bhashani">Maulana Bhashani</a> in the 1960s. Rahman launched the <a href="Six%20point%20movement">Six point movement</a> for autonomy in 1966. After the 1970 national election, Rahman's party, the <a href="Awami%20League">Awami League</a>, had emerged as the largest party in Pakistan's parliament. The erstwhile Pakistani <a href="military%20junta">military junta</a> refused to accept election results which triggered <a href="civil%20disobedience">civil disobedience</a> across East Pakistan. The Pakistani military responded by launching a <a href="1971%20Bangladesh%20genocide">genocide</a> that caused the <a href="Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> in 1971. The <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20Bangladesh">first Government of Bangladesh</a> and the <a href="Mukti%20Bahini">Mukti Bahini</a> waged a <a href="guerrilla">guerrilla</a> campaign with support from neighboring India, which hosted millions of war refugees. Global support for the independence of East Pakistan increased due to the conflict's humanitarian crisis, with the <a href="Indian%20Armed%20Forces">Indian Armed Forces</a> intervening in support of the <a href="Bangladesh%20Forces">Bangladesh Forces</a> in the final two weeks of the war and ensuring Pakistan's surrender.


After independence, Bangladesh adopted a <a href="secular%20democracy">secular democracy</a> under its new <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bangladesh">constitution</a> in 1972. Awami League premier Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became the country's strongman and implemented many <a href="socialist">socialist</a> policies. A <a href="BAKSAL">one party state</a> was enacted in 1975. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was <a href="Assassination%20of%20Sheikh%20Mujibur%20Rahman">assassinated</a> later that year during a <a href="Military%20coups%20in%20Bangladesh">military coup</a> that ushered in sixteen years of <a href="military%20dictatorships">military dictatorships</a> and <a href="presidential%20government">presidential government</a>s. The liberation war commander <a href="Ziaur%20Rahman">Ziaur Rahman</a> emerged as Bangladesh's leader in the late 1970s. He reoriented the country's <a href="foreign%20policy">foreign policy</a> towards the West and restored <a href="free%20market">free market</a>s and the <a href="multiparty">multiparty</a> polity. President Zia was <a href="Assassination%20of%20Ziaur%20Rahman">assassinated</a> in 1981 during a failed military coup. He was eventually succeeded by his army chief <a href="Hussain%20Muhammad%20Ershad">Hussain Muhammad Ershad</a>. Lasting for nine years, Ershad's rule witnessed continued pro-free market reforms and the <a href="devolution">devolution</a> of some authority to local government. The <a href="South%20Asian%20Association%20for%20Regional%20Cooperation">South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation</a> (SAARC) was founded in <a href="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> in 1985. The <a href="Jatiya%20Party%20%28Ershad%29">Jatiya Party</a> government made <a href="Islam">Islam</a> the <a href="state%20religion">state religion</a> in 1988.

A popular uprising restored <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">parliamentary democracy</a> in 1991. Since then, Bangladesh has largely alternated between the premierships of <a href="Sheikh%20Hasina">Sheikh Hasina</a> of the Awami League and <a href="Khaleda%20Zia">Khaleda Zia</a> of the <a href="Bangladesh%20Nationalist%20Party">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a>, as well as technocratic <a href="Caretaker%20government%20of%20Bangladesh">caretaker governments</a>. <a href="State%20of%20emergency">Emergency rule</a> was imposed by the military in 2007 and 2008 after widespread street violence between the League and BNP. The restoration of democratic government in 2009 was followed by the initiation of the <a href="International%20Crimes%20Tribunal%20%28Bangladesh%29">International Crimes Tribunal</a> to prosecute surviving colloborators of the 1971 genocide. Today, the country is an <a href="emerging%20economy">emerging economy</a>, listed as one of the <a href="Next%20Eleven">Next Eleven</a> and experiencing growing industrial development, but continues to face political, economic and social challenges.

Bengal has been an independent territory during several periods in history, while at other times, it has been part of larger empires. Bengal has also been a regional empire, ruling over neighboring regions like <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a>, <a href="Orissa%2C%20India">Orissa</a>, <a href="Rakhine%20State">Arakan</a>, and parts of North India, <a href="Assam">Assam</a> and <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>.
Politically, the region is divided between the <a href="Bangladesh">People's Republic of Bangladesh</a>, an independent <a href="Sovereign%20state">state</a>, and the eastern provinces of the <a href="India">Republic of India</a>, including <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a>, <a href="Assam">Assam</a> and <a href="Tripura">Tripura</a>. Politically both Bangladesh and Indian Bengal are socialist, with left wing parties dominating the region's politics.

The state of Bangladesh is a <a href="parliamentary%20republic">parliamentary republic</a> based on the <a href="Westminster%20system">Westminster system</a>, with a <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bangladesh">written constitution</a> and a <a href="President%20of%20Bangladesh">President</a> elected by parliament for mostly ceremonial purposes.

Under the constitution, <a href="Islam">Islam</a> is recognized as the <a href="state%20religion">state religion</a>; while Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and people of all other denomiations are stated to enjoy equal rights.

Between 1975 and 1990, Bangladesh had a <a href="presidential%20system">presidential system</a> of government. Since the 1990s, it was administered by non-political technocratic <a href="Caretaker%20government%20of%20Bangladesh">caretaker governments</a> on four occasions, the last being under military-backed emergency rule in 2007 and 2008. The <a href="Awami%20League">Awami League</a> and the <a href="Bangladesh%20Nationalist%20Party">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> (BNP) are the two largest political parties in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh is a prominent member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, being the largest contributor of <a href="peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a> forces in the world and a key promoter of <a href="multilateral%20diplomacy">multilateral diplomacy</a>.

A <a href="developing%20country">developing country</a> with high levels of poverty, Bangladesh has achieved significant strides in <a href="human%20development%20%28humanity%29">human development</a> compared to its neighbors.

<a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a>, <a href="Tripura">Tripura</a> and <a href="Assam">Assam</a> (home to the <a href="Barak%20Valley">Barak Valley</a>) are provincial states of the <a href="India">Republic of India</a>, with local <a href="State%20governments%20of%20India">executives</a> and <a href="Vidhan%20Sabha">assemblies</a>- features shared with other states in the Indian federal system. The <a href="President%20of%20India">President of India</a> appoints a <a href="Governor">Governor</a> as the ceremonial representative of the <a href="Government%20of%20India">union government</a>. The Governor appoints the <a href="Chief%20Minister">Chief Minister</a> on the nomination of the <a href="legislative%20assembly">legislative assembly</a>.

Each state has popularly elected members in the Indian lower house of parliament, the <a href="Lok%20Sabha">Lok Sabha</a>. Each state nominates members to the Indian upper house of parliament, the <a href="Rajya%20Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a>.

The state legislative assemblies also play a key role in electing the ceremonial President of India. The former President of India, <a href="Pranab%20Mukherjee">Pranab Mukherjee</a>, was a native of West Bengal and a leader of the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a>.

The two major political forces in the Bengali-speaking zone of India are the <a href="Left%20Front%20%28West%20Bengal%29">Left Front</a> and the <a href="Trinamool%20Congress">Trinamool Congress</a>, with the <a href="Bharatiya%20Janata%20Party">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> (BJP) and the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a> being minor players.

India and Bangladesh are the world's second and eighth most populous countries respectively. <a href="Bangladesh-India%20relations">Bangladesh-India relations</a> began on a high note in 1971 when India played a major role in the <a href="liberation%20of%20Bangladesh">liberation of Bangladesh</a>, with the Indian Bengali populace and media providing overwhelming support to the independence movement in the former East Pakistan. The two countries had a twenty five year friendship treaty between 1972 and 1996. However, differences over river sharing, border security and access to trade have long plagued the relationship. In more recent years, a consensus has evolved in both countries on the importance of developing good relations, as well as a strategic partnership in South Asia and beyond. Commercial, cultural and defense cooperation have expanded since 2010, when Prime Ministers <a href="Sheikh%20Hasina">Sheikh Hasina</a> and <a href="Manmohan%20Singh">Manmohan Singh</a> pledged to reinvigorate ties.

The Bangladesh High Commission in <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a> operates a Deputy High Commission in <a href="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> and a consular office in <a href="Agartala">Agartala</a>. India has a High Commission in <a href="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> with consulates in <a href="Chittagong">Chittagong</a> and <a href="Rajshahi">Rajshahi</a>. Frequent international air, bus and rail services connect major cities in Bangladesh and Indian Bengal, particularly the three largest cities- Dhaka, Kolkata and Chittagong. Undocumented immigration of Bangladeshi workers is a controversial issue championed by right-wing nationalist parties in India but finds little sympathy in West Bengal. India has since fenced the border which has been criticized by Bangladesh.

The Bengal region is also one of <a href="Population%20density">most densely populated areas</a> in the world. With a population of 300 million, <a href="Bengalis">Bengalis</a> are the third largest ethnic group in the world after the <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a> and <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>.
According to provisional results of 2011 Bangladesh census, the population of Bangladesh was 142,319,000; however, CIA's "<a href="The%20World%20Factbook">The World Factbook</a>" gives 163,654,860 as its population in a July 2013 estimate. According to the provisional results of the 2011 Indian national census, West Bengal has a population of 91,347,736. So, the Bengal region, as of 2011, has at least 233 million people. This figures give a population density of 1003.9/km; making it among the most densely populated areas in the world.

<a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali</a> is the main language spoken in Bengal. Many phonological, lexical, and structural differences from the standard variety occur in peripheral varieties of Bengali; these include <a href="Sylheti%20language">Sylheti</a>, <a href="Chittagonian%20language">Chittagonian</a>, <a href="Chakma%20language">Chakma</a>, <a href="Rangpuri%20language">Rangpuri/Rajbangshi</a>, <a href="Hajong%20language">Hajong</a>, <a href="Rohingya%20language">Rohingya</a>, and <a href="Tangchangya%20language">Tangchangya</a>.

In addition, there are several minority ethnolinguistic groups native to the region. These include speakers of other Indo-Aryan languages (e.g. <a href="Bishnupriya%20Manipuri%20language">Bishnupriya Manipuri</a>, <a href="Sadri%20language">Oraon Sadri</a>, various <a href="Bihari%20languages">Bihari languages</a>), <a href="Tibeto-Burman%20languages">Tibeto-Burman languages</a> (e.g. <a href="A%27Tong%20language">A'Tong</a>, <a href="Chak%20language">Chak</a>, <a href="Koch%20language">Koch</a>, <a href="Garo%20language">Garo</a>, <a href="Megam%20language">Megam</a>, <a href="Meitei%20language">Meitei Manipuri</a>, <a href="Mizo%20language">Mizo</a>, <a href="Mru%20language">Mru</a>, <a href="Pangkhua%20language">Pangkhua</a>, <a href="Rakhine%20language">Rakhine</a>/<a href="Marma%20Language">Marma</a>, <a href="Kok%20Borok%20language">Kok Borok</a>, <a href="Reang%20language">Riang</a>, <a href="Tippera%20language">Tippera</a>, <a href="Usoi%20language">Usoi</a>, various <a href="Chin%20languages">Chin languages</a>), <a href="Austroasiatic%20languages">Austroasiatic languages</a> (e.g. <a href="Khasi%20language">Khasi</a>, <a href="Koda%20language">Koda</a>, <a href="Mundari%20language">Mundari</a>, <a href="Pnar%20language">Pnar</a>, <a href="Santali%20language">Santali</a>, <a href="War%20language">War</a>), and <a href="Dravidian%20languages">Dravidian languages</a> (e.g. <a href="Kurukh%20language">Kurukh</a>, <a href="Sauria%20Paharia%20language">Sauria Paharia</a>).

Life expectancy is around 70.36 years for Bangladesh and 70.2 for West Bengal.

In terms of literacy, West Bengal leads with 77% literacy rate, in Bangladesh the rate is approximately 71%. The level of poverty in West Bengal is at 19.98%, while in Bangladesh it stands at 12.9%

West Bengal's has one of the lowest total fertility rates in India. West Bengal's TFR of 1.6 roughly equals that of Canada.

About 20,000 people live on "chars". Chars are temporary islands formed by the deposition of sediments eroded off the banks of the Ganges in West Bengal which often disappear in the monsoon season. They are made of very fertile soil. The inhabitants of the chars are not recognised by the Government of West Bengal on the grounds that it is not known whether they are Bengalis or Bangladeshi refugees. Consequently, no identification documents are issued to char-dwellers who cannot benefit from health care, barely survive because of very poor sanitation and are prevented from emigrating to the mainland to find jobs when they have turned 14. On a particular char it was reported that 13% of women died at childbirth.

Historically, Bengal has been the industrial leader of the subcontinent.

The region is one of the largest rice producing areas in the world, with West Bengal being India's largest rice producer and Bangladesh being the world's fourth largest rice producer. Other key crops include <a href="jute">jute</a>, tea, sugarcane and wheat. There are significant reserves of limestone, natural gas and coal. Major industries include <a href="textile">textile</a>s, leather goods, pharmaceuticals, shipbuilding, banking and information and communication technology.

Below is a comparison of economies in the region of Bengal
Bangladesh and India are the largest trading partners in South Asia, with two-way trade valued at an estimated US$6.9 billion. Much of this trade relationship is centered on some of the world's busiest <a href="land%20port">land port</a>s on the <a href="Bangladesh-India%20border">Bangladesh-India border</a>, particularly the West Bengal section.

The partition of India severed the once strong economic links which integrated the region. Decades later, frequent air, rail and bus services are increasingly connecting cities in Bangladesh and West Bengal, as well as the wider region, including <a href="Northeast%20India">Northeast India</a>, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> and Bhutan. However the overall economic relationship remains well-below potential.

The following are the largest cities in Bengal (in terms of population):

Both India and Bangladesh plan to expand onshore and offshore <a href="oil%20and%20gas">oil and gas</a> operations. Bangladesh is Asia's seventh-largest <a href="Natural%20gas%20in%20Bangladesh">natural gas</a> producer. Its maritime exclusive economic zone potentially holds many of the largest gas reserves in the Asia-Pacific.

The Bay of Bengal is strategically important for its vital shipping lanes and its central location between the Middle East and the Pacific. The <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal%20Initiative">Bay of Bengal Initiative</a>, based in <a href="Dhaka">Dhaka</a>, brings together Bangladesh, India, <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, Nepal, Bhutan and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> to promote <a href="economic%20integration">economic integration</a> in the subregion. Other regional groupings include the <a href="Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar%20Forum%20for%20Regional%20Cooperation">Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Forum for Regional Cooperation</a> (<a href="BCIM">BCIM</a>) and the <a href="Bangladesh%20Bhutan%20India%20Nepal">Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal</a> (<a href="BBIN">BBIN</a>) Initiative.

In both Bangladesh and West Bengal, currency is commonly denominated as taka. The <a href="Bangladesh%20taka">Bangladesh taka</a> is an official standard bearer of this tradition, while the <a href="Indian%20rupee">Indian rupee</a> is also written as taka in Bengali script on all of its banknotes. The <a href="history%20of%20the%20taka">history of the taka</a> dates back centuries. Bengal was home one of the world's earliest coin currencies in the first millennium BCE. Under the Delhi Sultanate, the taka was introduced by <a href="Muhammad%20bin%20Tughluq">Muhammad bin Tughluq</a> in 1329. Bengal became the stronghold of the taka. The silver currency was the most important symbol of sovereignty of the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Bengal">Sultanate of Bengal</a>. It was traded on the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> and replicated in <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> and China's <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>an protectorate.

Bucket argument

<a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s rotating bucket argument (also known as Newton's bucket) was designed to demonstrate that true <a href="rotational%20motion">rotational motion</a> cannot be defined as the relative rotation of the body with respect to the immediately surrounding bodies. It is one of five <a href="argument">argument</a>s from the "properties, causes, and effects" of true motion and rest that support his contention that, in general, true motion and rest cannot be defined as special instances of motion or rest relative to other bodies, but instead can be defined only by reference to <a href="absolute%20space">absolute space</a>. Alternatively, these experiments provide an <a href="operational%20definition">operational definition</a> of what is meant by "<a href="absolute%20rotation">absolute rotation</a>", and do not pretend to address the question of "rotation relative to "what"?" <a href="General%20relativity">General relativity</a> dispenses with absolute space and with physics whose cause is external to the system, with the concept of <a href="Geodesics%20in%20general%20relativity">geodesics</a> of <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>.

These arguments, and a discussion of the distinctions between absolute and relative time, space, place and motion, appear in a <a href="General%20Scholium">General Scholium</a> at the very beginning of Newton's work, "<a href="The%20Mathematical%20Principles%20of%20Natural%20Philosophy">The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</a>" (1687), which established the foundations of <a href="classical%20mechanics">classical mechanics</a> and introduced his <a href="law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">law of universal gravitation</a>, which yielded the first quantitatively adequate dynamical explanation of <a href="planetary%20motion">planetary motion</a>.

Despite their embrace of the principle of rectilinear <a href="inertia">inertia</a> and the recognition of the kinematical relativity of apparent motion (which underlies whether the <a href="Geocentric%20model">Ptolemaic</a> or the <a href="Heliocentrism">Copernican</a> system is correct), natural philosophers of the seventeenth century continued to consider true motion and rest as physically separate descriptors of an individual body. The dominant view Newton opposed was devised by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a>, and was supported (in part) by <a href="Gottfried%20Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a>. It held that empty space is a metaphysical impossibility because space is nothing other than the extension of matter, or, in other words, that when one speaks of the space between things one is actually making reference to the relationship that exists between those things and not to some entity that stands between them. Concordant with the above understanding, any assertion about the motion of a body boils down to a description over time in which the body under consideration is at t found in the vicinity of one group of "landmark" bodies and at some t is found in the vicinity of some other "landmark" body or bodies.
Descartes recognized that there would be a real difference, however, between a situation in which a body with movable parts and originally at rest with respect to a surrounding ring was itself accelerated to a certain angular velocity with respect to the ring, and another situation in which the surrounding ring were given a contrary acceleration with respect to the central object. With sole regard to the central object and the surrounding ring, the motions would be indistinguishable from each other assuming that both the central object and the surrounding ring were absolutely rigid objects. However, if neither the central object nor the surrounding ring were absolutely rigid then the parts of one or both of them would tend to fly out from the axis of rotation.

Here is an everyday experience of the basic nature of the Descartes experiment: Consider sitting in your train and noticing a train originally at rest beside you in the railway station pulling away. Initially you think it is your own train accelerating, but then notice with surprise that you feel no force. Thus, it is not your own train moving, but the neighboring train. On the other hand, you would confirm your own train is accelerating if you sensed "g"-forces from the acceleration of your own train.

For contingent reasons having to do with the <a href="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>, Descartes spoke of motion as both absolute and relative. However, his real position was that motion is absolute.

A contrasting position was taken by <a href="Ernst%20Mach">Ernst Mach</a>, who contended that all motion was "relative".
Newton discusses a <a href="bucket">bucket</a> () filled with <a href="water">water</a> hung by a cord. If the cord is twisted up tightly on itself and then the bucket is released, it begins to spin rapidly, not only with respect to the experimenter, but also in relation to the water it contains. (This situation would correspond to diagram B above.)

Although the relative motion at this stage is the greatest, the surface of the water remains flat, indicating that the parts of the water have no tendency to recede from the axis of relative motion, despite proximity to the pail. Eventually, as the cord continues to unwind, the surface of the water assumes a concave shape as it acquires the motion of the bucket spinning relative to the experimenter. This concave shape shows that the water is rotating, despite the fact that the water is at rest relative to the pail. In other words, it is not the relative motion of the pail and water that causes concavity of the water, contrary to the idea that motions can only be relative, and that there is no absolute motion. (This situation would correspond to diagram D.) Possibly the concavity of the water shows rotation relative to "something else": say absolute space? Newton says: "One can find out and measure the true and absolute circular motion of the water".

In the 1846 Andrew Motte translation of Newton's words:
The argument that the motion is absolute, not relative, is incomplete, as it limits the participants relevant to the experiment to only the pail and the water, a limitation that has not been established. In fact, the concavity of the water clearly involves gravitational attraction, and by implication the Earth also is a participant. Here is a critique due to Mach arguing that only relative motion is established:

The degree in which Mach's hypothesis is integrated in general relativity is discussed in the article <a href="Mach%27s%20principle">Mach's principle</a>; it is generally held that general relativity is not entirely Machian.

All observers agree that the surface of rotating water is curved. However, the explanation of this curvature involves centrifugal force for all observers with the exception of a truly stationary observer, who finds the curvature is consistent with the rate of rotation of the water as they observe it, with no need for an additional centrifugal force. Thus, a stationary frame can be identified, and it is not necessary to ask "Stationary with respect to what?":
A supplementary <a href="thought%20experiment">thought experiment</a> with the same objective of determining the occurrence of absolute rotation also was proposed by Newton: the example of observing two identical spheres in rotation about their center of gravity and tied together by a string. Occurrence of tension in the string is indicative of absolute rotation; see <a href="Rotating%20spheres">Rotating spheres</a>.

The historic interest of the rotating bucket experiment is its usefulness in suggesting one can detect absolute rotation by observation of the shape of the surface of the water. However, one might question just how rotation brings about this change. Below are two approaches to understanding the concavity of the surface of rotating water in a bucket.
The shape of the surface of a rotating liquid in a bucket can be determined using Newton's laws for the various forces on an element of the surface. For example, see Knudsen and Hjorth. The analysis begins with the free body diagram in the co-rotating frame where the water appears stationary. The height of the water "h" = "h"("r") is a function of the radial distance "r" from the axis of rotation Ω, and the aim is to determine this function. An element of water volume on the surface is shown to be subject to three forces: the vertical force due to gravity F, the horizontal, radially outward centrifugal force F, and the force normal to the surface of the water F due to the rest of the water surrounding the selected element of surface. The force due to surrounding water is known to be normal to the surface of the water because a liquid in equilibrium cannot support <a href="shear%20stress">shear stress</a>es. To quote Anthony and Brackett: Moreover, because the element of water does not move, the sum of all three forces must be zero. To sum to zero, the force of the water must point oppositely to the sum of the centrifugal and gravity forces, which means the surface of the water must adjust so its normal points in this direction. (A very similar problem is the design of a , where the slope of the turn is set so a car will not slide off the road. The analogy in the case of rotating bucket is that the element of water surface will "slide" up or down the surface unless the normal to the surface aligns with the vector resultant formed by the <a href="vector%20addition">vector addition</a> F + F.)

As "r" increases, the centrifugal force increases according to the relation (the equations are written per unit mass):
where "Ω" is the constant rate of rotation of the water. The gravitational force is unchanged at
where "g" is the <a href="Gravitational%20acceleration">acceleration due to gravity</a>. These two forces add to make a resultant at an angle "φ" from the vertical given by
which clearly becomes larger as "r" increases. To ensure that this resultant is normal to the surface of the water, and therefore can be effectively nulled by the force of the water beneath, the normal to the surface must have the same angle, that is,
leading to the ordinary differential equation for the shape of the surface:
or, integrating:
where "h"(0) is the height of the water at "r" = 0. In words, the surface of the water is parabolic in its dependence upon the radius.

The shape of the water's surface can be found in a different, very intuitive way using the interesting idea of the <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a> associated with the centrifugal force in the co-rotating frame.
In a reference frame uniformly rotating at angular rate Ω, the fictitious centrifugal force is <a href="conservative%20force">conservative</a> and has a potential energy of the form:

where "r" is the radius from the axis of rotation. This result can be verified by taking the gradient of the potential to obtain the radially outward force:

The meaning of the potential energy is that movement of a test body from a larger radius to a smaller radius involves doing <a href="Mechanical%20work">work</a> against the centrifugal force.

The potential energy is useful, for example, in understanding the concavity of the water surface in a rotating bucket. Notice that at <a href="Mechanical%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a> the surface adopts a shape such that an element of volume at any location on its surface has the same potential energy as at any other. That being so, no element of water on the surface has any incentive to move position, because all positions are equivalent in energy. That is, equilibrium is attained. On the other hand, were surface regions with lower energy available, the water occupying surface locations of higher potential energy would move to occupy these positions of lower energy, inasmuch as there is no barrier to lateral movement in an ideal liquid.

We might imagine deliberately upsetting this equilibrium situation by somehow momentarily altering the surface shape of the water to make it different from an equal-energy surface. This change in shape would not be stable, and the water would not stay in our artificially contrived shape, but engage in a transient exploration of many shapes until non-ideal frictional forces introduced by sloshing, either against the sides of the bucket or by the non-ideal nature of the liquid, killed the oscillations and the water settled down to the equilibrium shape.

To see the principle of an equal-energy surface at work, imagine gradually increasing the rate of rotation of the bucket from zero. The water surface is flat at first, and clearly a surface of equal potential energy because all points on the surface are at the same height in the gravitational field acting upon the water. At some small angular rate of rotation, however, an element of surface water can achieve lower potential energy by moving outward under the influence of the centrifugal force. Because water is incompressible and must remain within the confines of the bucket, this outward movement increases the depth of water at the larger radius, increasing the height of the surface at larger radius, and lowering it at smaller radius. The surface of the water becomes slightly concave, with the consequence that the potential energy of the water at the greater radius is increased by the work done against gravity to achieve the greater height. As the height of water increases, movement toward the periphery becomes no longer advantageous, because the reduction in potential energy from working with the centrifugal force is balanced against the increase in energy working against gravity. Thus, at a given angular rate of rotation, a concave surface represents the stable situation, and the more rapid the rotation, the more concave this surface. If rotation is arrested, the energy stored in fashioning the concave surface must be dissipated, for example through friction, before an equilibrium flat surface is restored.

To implement a surface of constant potential energy quantitatively, let the height of the water be formula_10: then the potential energy per unit mass contributed by gravity is formula_11 and the total potential energy per unit mass on the surface is

with formula_13 the background energy level independent of "r". In a static situation (no motion of the fluid in the rotating frame), this energy is constant independent of position "r". Requiring the energy to be constant, we obtain the <a href="Parabola">parabolic</a> form:

where "h(0)" is the height at "r" = 0 (the axis). See Figures 1 and 2.

The principle of operation of the <a href="centrifuge">centrifuge</a> also can be simply understood in terms of this expression for the potential energy, which shows that it is favorable energetically when the volume far from the axis of rotation is occupied by the heavier substance.

Roman Breviary

The Roman Breviary (<a href="Ecclesiastical%20Latin">Latin</a>: "Breviarium Romanum") is the <a href="liturgical%20book">liturgical book</a> of the <a href="Latin%20liturgical%20rites">Latin liturgical rites</a> of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> containing the public or canonical <a href="prayer">prayer</a>s, <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s, the <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a>, readings, and notations for everyday use, especially by bishops, priests, and deacons in the Divine Office (i.e., at the <a href="canonical%20hours">canonical hours</a> or <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Liturgy of the Hours</a>, the Christians' daily prayer). The word <a href="breviary">breviary</a>, in general, refers to a collection of Christian orders of prayers and readings, such as contained in <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> or <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> resources. It may also be used to refer to an abridged version of any text or a brief account or summary of some subject, but is primarily used to refer to a Christian liturgical book. The volume containing the daily hours of Roman Catholic prayer was published as the "Breviarium Romanum" (Roman Breviary) until the reforms of Paul VI, when it became known as the <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Liturgy of the Hours</a>. However, these terms are used interchangeably to refer to the Office in all its forms. This entry deals with the Roman Breviary prior to the changes introduced by <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Pope Paul VI</a> in 1974.

This word breviary (Lat. Breviarium), signifies in its primary acceptation an abridgment, or a compendium. It is often employed in this sense by Christian authors, e.g. Breviarium fidei, Breviarium in psalmos, Breviarium canonum, Breviarium regularum. In liturgical language Breviary has a special meaning, indicating a book furnishing the regulations for the celebration of Mass or the canonical Office, and may be met with under the titles Breviarium Ecclesiastici Ordinis, or Breviarium Ecclesiæ Rominsæ (Romanæ). In the ninth century Alcuin uses the word to designate an office abridged or simplified for the use of the laity. <a href="Prudentius%20of%20Troyes">Prudentius of Troyes</a>, about the same period, composed a Breviarium Psalterii (v. inf. V. HISTORY). In an ancient inventory occurs Breviarium Antiphonarii, meaning "Extracts from the Antiphonary". In the "Vita Aldrici" occurs "sicut in plenariis et breviariis Ecclesiæ ejusdem continentur". Again, in the inventories in the catalogues, such notes as these may be met with: "Sunt et duo cursinarii et tres benedictionales Libri; ex his unus habet obsequium mortuorum et unus Breviarius", or, "Præter Breviarium quoddam quod usque ad festivitatem S. Joannis Baptistæ retinebunt", etc. Monte Cassino about A.D. 1100 obtained a book titled "Incipit Breviarium sive Ordo Officiorum per totam anni decursionem".

From such references, and from others of a like nature, Quesnel gathers that by the word Breviarium was at first designated a book furnishing the rubrics, a sort of <a href="Directorium">Ordo</a>. The title Breviary, as we employ it—that is, a book containing the entire canonical office—appears to date from the eleventh century.

<a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">St. Gregory VII</a> having, indeed, abridged the order of prayers, and having simplified the Liturgy as performed at the Roman Court, this abridgment received the name of Breviary, which was suitable, since, according to the etymology of the word, it was an abridgment. The name has been extended to books which contain in one volume, or at least in one work, liturgical books of different kinds, such as the Psalter, the Antiphonary, the Responsoriary, the Lectionary, etc. In this connection it may be pointed out that in this sense the word, as it is used nowadays, is illogical; it should be named a Plenarium rather than a Breviarium, since, liturgically speaking, the word Plenarium exactly designates such books as contain several different compilations united under one cover. This is pointed out, however, simply to make still clearer the meaning and origin of the word; and section V will furnish a more detailed explanation of the formation of the Breviary.

The canonical hours of the Breviary owe their remote origin to the <a href="Old%20Covenant">Old Covenant</a> when God commanded the Aaronic priests to offer morning and evening sacrifices. Other inspiration may have come from David's words in the Psalms "Seven times a day I praise you" (Ps. 119:164), as well as, "the just man meditates on the law day and night" (Ps. 1:2). Regarding Daniel "Three times daily he was kneeling and offering prayers and thanks to his God" (Dan. 6:10).

In the early days of Christian worship the <a href="Bible">Sacred Scriptures</a> furnished all that was thought necessary, containing as it did the books from which the lessons were read and the psalms that were recited. The first step in the evolution of the Breviary was the separation of the Psalter into a choir-book. At first the president of the local church (bishop) or the leader of the choir chose a particular psalm as he thought appropriate. From about the 4th century certain psalms began to be grouped together, a process that was furthered by the monastic practice of daily reciting the 150 psalms. This took so much time that the monks began to spread it over a week, dividing each day into hours, and allotting to each hour its portion of the Psalter. St Benedict in the 6th century drew up such an arrangement, probably, though not certainly, on the basis of an older Roman division which, though not so skilful, is the one in general use. Gradually there were added to these psalter choir-books additions in the form of antiphons, responses, collects or short prayers, for the use of those not skilful at improvisation and metrical compositions. <a href="Jean%20Beleth">Jean Beleth</a>, a 12th-century liturgical author, gives the following list of books necessary for the right conduct of the canonical office: the Antiphonarium, the Old and New Testaments, the "Passionarius (liber)" and the "Legendarius" (dealing respectively with martyrs and saints), the "Homiliarius" (homilies on the Gospels), the "Sermologus" (collection of sermons) and the works of the Fathers, besides, of course, the "Psalterium" and the "Collectarium". To overcome the inconvenience of using such a library the Breviary came into existence and use. Already in the 8th century <a href="Prudentius%2C%20bishop%20of%20Troyes">Prudentius, bishop of Troyes</a>, had in a "Breviarium Psalterii" made an abridgment of the Psalter for the laity, giving a few psalms for each day, and Alcuin had rendered a similar service by including a prayer for each day and some other prayers, but no lessons or homilies. The Breviary rightly so called, however, only dates from the 11th century; the earliest MS. containing the whole canonical office is of the year 1099 and is in the Mazarin library. Gregory VII (pope 1073–1085), too, simplified the liturgy as performed at the Roman court, and gave his abridgment the name of Breviary, which thus came to denote a work which from another point of view might be called a Plenary, involving as it did the collection of several works into one. There are several extant specimens of 12th-century Breviaries, all Benedictine, but under Innocent III (pope 1198–1216) their use was extended, especially by the newly founded and active Franciscan order. These preaching friars, with the authorization of Gregory IX, adopted (with some modifications, e.g. the substitution of the "Gallican" for the "Roman" version of the Psalter) the Breviary hitherto used exclusively by the Roman court, and with it gradually swept out of Europe all the earlier partial books (Legendaries, Responsories), &c., and to some extent the local Breviaries, like that of Sarum. Finally, <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20III">Nicholas III</a> (pope 1277–1280) adopted this version both for the curia and for the basilicas of Rome, and thus made its position secure.

The Benedictines and Dominicans have Breviaries of their own. The only other types that merit notice are:

Until the council of Trent every bishop had full power to regulate the Breviary of his own diocese; and this was acted upon almost everywhere. Each monastic community, also, had one of its own. Pius V (pope 1566–1572), however, while sanctioning those which could show at least 200 years of existence, made the Roman obligatory in all other places. But the influence of the <a href="Roman%20rite">Roman rite</a> has gradually gone much beyond this, and has superseded almost all the local uses. The Roman has thus become nearly universal, with the allowance only of additional offices for saints specially venerated in each particular diocese. The Roman Breviary has undergone several revisions: The most remarkable of these is that by <a href="Francisco%20de%20Qui%C3%B1ones">Francis Quignonez</a>, cardinal of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (1536), which, though not accepted by Rome (it was approved by Clement VII and Paul III, and permitted as a substitute for the unrevised Breviary, until Pius V in 1568 excluded it as too short and too modern, and issued a reformed edition ("Breviarium Pianum", Pian Breviary) of the old Breviary), formed the model for the still more thorough reform made in 1549 by the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, whose daily morning and evening services are but a condensation and simplification of the Breviary offices. Some parts of the prefaces at the beginning of the English Prayer-pageRank.Book are free translations of those of Quignonez. The Pian Breviary was again altered by <a href="Sixtus%20V">Sixtus V</a> in 1588, who introduced the revised <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, in 1602 by Clement VIII (through <a href="Baronius">Baronius</a> and Bellarmine), especially as concerns the rubrics; and by Urban VIII (1623–1644), a purist who altered the text of certain hymns.

In the 17th and 18th centuries a movement of revision took place in France, and succeeded in modifying about half the Breviaries of that country. Historically, this proceeded from the labours of <a href="Jean%20de%20Launoy">Jean de Launoy</a> (1603–1678), "le dénicheur des saints", and <a href="Louis%20S%C3%A9bastien%20le%20Nain%20de%20Tillemont">Louis Sébastien le Nain de Tillemont</a>, who had shown the falsity of numerous lives of the saints; while theologically it was produced by the Port Royal school, which led men to dwell more on communion with God as contrasted with the invocation of the saints. This was mainly carried out by the adoption of a rule that all antiphons and responses should be in the exact words of Scripture, which, of course, cut out the whole class of appeals to created beings. The services were at the same time simplified and shortened, and the use of the whole Psalter every week (which had become a mere theory in the Roman Breviary, owing to its frequent supersession by saints' day services) was made a reality. These reformed French Breviaries—e.g. the Paris Breviary of 1680 by Archbishop <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Harlay">François de Harlay</a> (1625–1695) and that of 1736 by Archbishop <a href="Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume%20de%20Vintimille%20du%20Luc">Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc</a> (1655–1746)—show a deep knowledge of Holy Scripture, and much careful adaptation of different texts.

During the pontificate of <a href="Pius%20IX">Pius IX</a> a strong Ultramontane movement arose against the French Breviaries of 1680 and 1736. This was inaugurated by <a href="Charles%20Forbes%20Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Montalembert">Montalembert</a>, but its literary advocates were chiefly <a href="Prosper%20Gu%C3%A9ranger">Dom Gueranger</a>, a learned Benedictine monk, abbot of <a href="Solesmes%2C%20Sarthe">Solesmes</a>, and <a href="Louis%20Veuillot">Louis Veuillot</a> (1813–1883) of the Univers; and it succeeded in suppressing them everywhere, the last diocese to surrender being Orleans in 1875. The Jansenist and Gallican influence was also strongly felt in Italy and in Germany, where Breviaries based on the French models were published at Cologne, Münster, Mainz and other towns. Meanwhile, under the direction of Benedict XIV (pope 1740–1758), a special congregation collected much material for an official revision, but nothing was published. In 1902, under Leo XIII, a commission under the presidency of Monsignor <a href="Louis%20Duchesne">Louis Duchesne</a> was appointed to consider the Breviary, the Missal, the Pontifical and the Ritual.

Significant changes came in 1910 with the <a href="reform%20of%20the%20Roman%20Breviary%20by%20Pope%20Pius%20X">reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X</a>. This revision modified the traditional psalm scheme so that, while all 150 psalms were used in the course of the week, these were said without repetition. Those assigned to the Sunday office underwent the least revision, although noticeably fewer psalms are recited at Matins, and both Lauds and Compline are slightly shorter due to psalms (or in the case of Compline the first few verses of a psalm) being removed. Pius X was probably influenced by earlier attempts to eliminate repetition in the psalter, most notably the liturgy of the Benedictine congregation of St. Maur. However, since Cardinal Quignonez's attempt to reform the Breviary employed this principle—albeit with no regard to the traditional scheme—such notions had floated around in the western Church, and can particularly be seen in the Paris Breviary.

<a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a> introduced optional use of a new translation of the Psalms from the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> to a more classical <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. Most breviaries published in the late 1950s and early 1960s used this "Pian Psalter".

<a href="Pope%20John%20XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a> also revised the Breviary in 1960, introducing changes drawn up by his predecessor Pope Pius XII. The most notable alteration is the shortening of most feasts from nine to three lessons at Matins, keeping only the Scripture readings (the former lesson i, then lessons ii and iii together), followed by either the first part of the patristic reading (lesson vii) or, for most feasts, a condensed version of the former second Nocturn, which was formerly used when a feast was reduced in rank and commemorated.

Before the rise of the <a href="Mendicant%20Orders">mendicant orders</a> (wandering <a href="friar">friar</a>s) in the thirteenth century, the daily services were usually contained in a number of large volumes. The first occurrence of a single manuscript of the <a href="Canonical%20hours">daily office</a> was written by the <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> order at <a href="Monte%20Cassino">Monte Cassino</a> in <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in 1099. By a strange twist, the <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a>s were not a <a href="Mendicant%20Orders">mendicant order</a>, but a stable, <a href="monastery">monastery</a>-based order, and single-volume breviaries are rare from this early period.

The arrangement of the <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a> in the <a href="Rule%20of%20St.%20Benedict">Rule of St. Benedict</a> had a profound impact upon the breviaries used by secular and monastic clergy alike, up until 1911 when Pope St. <a href="Pius%20X">Pius X</a> introduced his reform of the Roman Breviary. In many places, every diocese, order or ecclesiastical province maintained its own edition of the breviary.

However, mendicant friars travelled around a lot and needed a shortened, or abbreviated, daily office contained in one portable book, and single-volume breviaries flourished from the thirteenth century onwards.

These abbreviated volumes soon became very popular and eventually supplanted the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>'s <a href="Curia">Curia</a> office, previously said by non-monastic <a href="clergy">clergy</a>.

Before the advent of <a href="printing">printing</a>, breviaries were written by hand and were often richly decorated with initials and miniature illustrations telling stories in the lives of <a href="Christ">Christ</a> or the <a href="saint">saint</a>s, or stories from the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>.

Later printed breviaries usually have <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> illustrations, interesting in their own right but the poor relation of the beautifully <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated</a> breviaries.

The beauty and value of many of the Latin Breviaries were brought to the notice of English churchmen by one of the numbers of the Oxford "<a href="Tracts%20for%20the%20Times">Tracts for the Times</a>", since which time they have been much more studied, both for their own sake and for the light they throw upon the English Prayer-pageRank.Book.

From a bibliographical point of view some of the early printed Breviaries are among the rarest of literary curiosities, being merely local. The copies were not spread far, and were soon worn out by the daily use made of them. Doubtless many editions have perished without leaving a trace of their existence, while others are known by unique copies. In Scotland the only one which has survived the convulsions of the 16th century is "<a href="Aberdeen%20Breviary">Aberdeen Breviary</a>", a Scottish form of the Sarum Office (the Sarum Rite was much favoured in Scotland as a kind of protest against the jurisdiction claimed by the diocese of York), revised by <a href="William%20Elphinstone">William Elphinstone</a> (bishop 1483–1514), and printed at Edinburgh by Walter Chapman and Andrew Myllar in 1509–1510. Four copies have been preserved of it, of which only one is complete; but it was reprinted in facsimile in 1854 for the Bannatyne Club by the munificence of the <a href="Walter%20Montagu%20Douglas%20Scott%2C%205th%20Duke%20of%20Buccleuch">Duke of Buccleuch</a>. It is particularly valuable for the trustworthy notices of the early history of Scotland which are embedded in the lives of the national saints. Though enjoined by royal mandate in 1501 for general use within the realm of Scotland, it was probably never widely adopted. The new Scottish "Proprium" sanctioned for the Roman Catholic province of St Andrews in 1903 contains many of the old Aberdeen collects and antiphons.

The <a href="Sarum%20use">Sarum</a> or Salisbury Breviary itself was very widely used. The first edition was printed at Venice in 1483 by Raynald de Novimagio in folio; the latest at Paris, 1556, 1557. While modern Breviaries are nearly always printed in four volumes, one for each season of the year, the editions of the Sarum never exceeded two parts.

At the beginning stands the usual introductory matter, such as the tables for determining the date of Easter, the calendar, and the general rubrics. The Breviary itself is divided into four seasonal parts—winter, spring, summer, autumn—and comprises under each part:

These parts are often published separately.

This psalm book is the very backbone of the Breviary, the groundwork of the Catholic prayer-book; out of it have grown the antiphons, responsories and versicles. Until the 1911 reform, the psalms were arranged according to a disposition dating from the 8th century, as follows: Psalms i.–cviii., with some omissions, were recited at Matins, twelve each day from Monday to Saturday, and eighteen on Sunday. The omissions were said at Lauds, Prime and Compline. Psalms cix–cxlvii (except cxvii, cxviii and cxlii) were said at Vespers, five each day. Psalms cxlviii–cl were always used at Lauds, and give that hour its name. The text of this Psalter is that commonly known as the Gallican. The name is misleading, for it is simply the second revision (A.D. 392) made by Jerome of the old "Itala" version originally used in Rome. Jerome's first revision of the "Itala" (A.D. 383), known as the Roman, is still used at St Peter's in Rome, but the "Gallican", thanks especially to St Gregory of Tours, who introduced it into Gaul in the 6th century, has ousted it everywhere else. The Antiphonary of Bangor proves that Ireland accepted the Gallican version in the 7th century, and the English Church did so in the 10th.

Following the 1911 reform, Matins was reduced to nine Psalms every day, with the other psalms redistributed throughout Prime, Terce, Sext, and Compline. For Sundays and special feasts Lauds and Vespers largely remained the same, Psalm 118 remained distributed at the Little Hours and Psalms 4, 90, and 130 were kept at Compline.

This contains the office of the seasons of the Christian year (Advent to Trinity), a conception that only gradually grew up. There is here given the whole service for every Sunday and week-day, the proper antiphons, responsories, hymns, and especially the course of daily Scripture-reading, averaging about twenty verses a day, and (roughly) arranged thus: for Advent, Isaiah; Epiphany to Septuagesima, Pauline Epistles; Lent, patristic homilies (Genesis on Sundays); Passion-tide, Jeremiah; Easter to Whitsun, Acts, Catholic epistles and Apocalypse; Whitsun to August, Samuel and Kings; August to Advent, Wisdom books, Maccabees, Prophets.

This contains the lessons, psalms and liturgical formularies for saints' festivals, and depends on the days of the secular month. The readings of the second Nocturn are mainly hagiological biography, with homilies or papal documents for certain major feasts, particularly those of Jesus and Mary. Some of this material has been revised by <a href="Leo%20XIII">Leo XIII</a>, in view of archaeological and other discoveries. The third Nocturn consists of a homily on the Gospel which is read at that day's Mass. Covering a great stretch of time and space, they do for the worshipper in the field of church history what the Scripture readings do in that of biblical history.

This comprises psalms, antiphons, lessons, &c., for feasts of various groups or classes (twelve in all); e.g. apostles, martyrs, confessors, virgins, and the Blessed Virgin Mary. These offices are of very ancient date, and many of them were probably in origin proper to individual saints. They contain passages of great literary beauty. The lessons read at the third nocturn are patristic homilies on the Gospels, and together form a rough summary of theological instruction.

Here are found the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead (obligatory on All Souls' Day), and offices peculiar to each diocese.

It has already been indicated, by reference to Matins, Lauds, &c., that not only each day, but each part of the day, has its own office, the day being divided into liturgical "hours." A detailed account of these will be found in the article <a href="Canonical%20Hours">Canonical Hours</a>. Each of the hours of the office is composed of the same elements, and something must be said now of th

e nature of these constituent parts, of which mention has here and there been already made. They are: psalms (including canticles), antiphons, responsories, hymns, lessons, little chapters, versicles and collects.

Before the 1911 reform, the multiplication of saints' festivals, with practically the same festal psalms, tended to repeat the about one-third of the Psalter, with a correspondingly rare recital of the remaining two-thirds. Following this reform, the entire Psalter is again generally recited each week, with the festal psalms restricted to only the highest-ranking feasts. As in the Greek usage and in the Benedictine, certain canticles like the Song of Moses (Exodus xv.), the <a href="Song%20of%20Hannah">Song of Hannah</a> (1 Sam. ii.), the prayer of Habakkuk (iii.), the prayer of Hezekiah (Isaiah xxxviii.) and other similar Old Testament passages, and, from the New Testament, the <a href="Magnificat">Magnificat</a>, the <a href="Benedictus%20%28Song%20of%20Zechariah%29">Benedictus</a> and the <a href="Nunc%20dimittis">Nunc dimittis</a>, are admitted as psalms.

The antiphons are short liturgical forms, sometimes of biblical, sometimes of patristic origin, used to introduce a psalm. The term originally signified a chant by alternate choirs, but has quite lost this meaning in the Breviary.

The responsories are similar in form to the antiphons, but come at the end of the psalm, being originally the reply of the choir or congregation to the precentor who recited the psalm.

The hymns are short poems going back in part to the days of <a href="Prudentius">Prudentius</a>, <a href="Synesius">Synesius</a>, <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nazianzus">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> and <a href="Ambrose%20of%20Milan">Ambrose</a> (4th and 5th centuries), but mainly the work of medieval authors.

The lessons, as has been seen, are drawn variously from the Bible, the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Saints">Acts of the Saints</a> and the <a href="Fathers%20of%20the%20Church">Fathers of the Church</a>. In the primitive church, books afterwards excluded from the canon were often read, e.g. the letters of <a href="Clement%20of%20Rome">Clement of Rome</a> and the <a href="Shepherd%20of%20Hermas">Shepherd of Hermas</a>. In later days the churches of Africa, having rich memorials of martyrdom, used them to supplement the reading of Scripture. Monastic influence accounts for the practice of adding to the reading of a biblical passage some patristic commentary or exposition. Books of homilies were compiled from the writings of SS. <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a>, <a href="Hilary%20of%20Poitiers">Hilary</a>, <a href="Athanasius">Athanasius</a>, <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore</a>, <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Gregory the Great</a> and others, and formed part of the library of which the Breviary was the ultimate compendium. In the lessons, as in the psalms, the order for special days breaks in upon the normal order of ferial offices and dislocates the scheme for consecutive reading. The lessons are read at Matins (which is subdivided into three nocturns).

The little chapters are very short lessons read at the other "hours."

The versicles are short responsories used after the little chapters in the minor hours. They appear after the hymns in Lauds and Vespers.

The collects come at the close of the office and are short prayers summing up the supplications of the congregation. They arise out of a primitive practice on the part of the bishop (local president), examples of which are found in the <a href="Didache">Didachē</a> (Teaching of the Apostles) and in the letters of Clement of Rome and Cyprian. With the crystallization of church order improvisation in prayer largely gave place to set forms, and collections of prayers were made which later developed into <a href="Sacramentary">Sacramentaries</a> and <a href="Orational">Orational</a>s. The collects of the Breviary are largely drawn from the Gelasian and other Sacramentaries, and they are used to sum up the dominant idea of the festival in connection with which they happen to be used.

Before 1910 the difficulty of harmonizing the "Proprium de Tempore" and the "Proprium Sanctorum", to which reference has been made, was only partly met in the thirty-seven chapters of general rubrics. Additional help was given by a kind of Catholic Churchman's Almanack, called the "Ordo Recitandi Divini Officii", published in different countries and dioceses, and giving, under every day, minute directions for proper reading. In 1960 John XXIII simplified the rubrics governing the Breviary in order to make it easier to use.

Every cleric in Holy Orders and many other members of religious orders must publicly join in or privately read aloud (i.e. using the lips as well as the eyes—it takes about two hours in this way) the whole of the Breviary services allotted for each day. In large churches where they were celebrated the services were usually grouped; e.g. Matins and Lauds (about 7.30 A.M.); Prime, Terce (High Mass), Sext, and None (about 10 A.M.); Vespers and Compline (4 P.M.); and from four to eight hours (depending on the amount of music and the number of high masses) are thus spent in choir. Lay use of the Breviary has varied throughout the Church's history. In some periods laymen did not use the Breviary as a manual of devotion to any great extent. The late Medieval period saw the recitation of certain hours of the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin, which was based on the Breviary in form and content, becoming popular among those who could read, and Bishop Challoner did much to popularise the hours of Sunday Vespers and Compline (albeit in English translation) in his 'Garden of the Soul' in the eighteenth century. The Liturgical Movement in the twentieth century saw renewed interest in the Offices of the Breviary and several popular editions were produced containing the vernacular as well as the Latin.

The complete pre-Pius X Roman Breviary was translated into English (by the <a href="John%20Crichton-Stuart%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Bute">Marquess of Bute</a> in 1879; new ed. with a trans, of the Martyrology, 1908), French and German. Bute's version is noteworthy for its inclusion of the skilful renderings of the ancient hymns by J.H. Newman, J.M. Neale and others. Several editions of the Pius X Breviary were produced during the twentieth century, including a notable edition prepared with the assistance of the sisters of <a href="Stanbrook%20Abbey">Stanbrook Abbey</a> in the 1950s. Two editions in English and Latin were produced in the following decade, which conformed to the rubrics of 1960, published by Liturgical Press and Benziger in the United States. These used the Pius XII psalter. <a href="Baronius%20Press">Baronius Press</a>'s revised edition of the Liturgical Press edition uses the older Gallican psalter of St. Jerome. This edition was published and released in 2012 for pre-orders only. In 2013, the publication has resumed printing and is available on Baronius' website.

Under Pope <a href="Benedict%20XVI">Benedict XVI</a>'s <a href="motu%20proprio">motu proprio</a> <a href="Summorum%20Pontificum">Summorum Pontificum</a>, Roman Catholic bishops, priests, and deacons are again permitted to use the 1962 edition of the Roman Breviary, promulgated by <a href="Pope%20John%20XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a> to satisfy their obligation to recite the <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Divine Office</a> every day.

In 2008, an "i-breviary" was launched, which combines the ancient breviaries with the latest computer technology.

B. F. Skinner

Burrhus Frederic Skinner (March 20, 1904 – August 18, 1990), commonly known as B. F. Skinner, was an American <a href="psychologist">psychologist</a>, <a href="behaviorist">behaviorist</a>, author, inventor, and <a href="Social%20philosophy">social philosopher</a>. He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> from 1958 until his retirement in 1974.

Skinner considered <a href="free%20will">free will</a> an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the consequences are bad, there is a high chance the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, the actions that led to it being repeated become more probable. Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement.

To strengthen behavior, Skinner used <a href="operant%20conditioning">operant conditioning</a>, and he considered the rate of response to be the most effective measure of response strength. To study operant conditioning he invented the <a href="operant%20conditioning%20chamber">operant conditioning chamber</a>, also known as the Skinner Box, and to measure rate he invented the "<a href="cumulative%20recorder">cumulative recorder</a>". Using these tools, he and <a href="C.%20B.%20Ferster">C. B. Ferster</a> produced his most influential experimental work, which appeared in the book <a href="Schedules%20of%20Reinforcement">Schedules of Reinforcement</a>.

Skinner developed a philosophy of science that he called <a href="radical%20behaviorism">radical behaviorism</a>, and founded a school of experimental research psychology—the <a href="experimental%20analysis%20of%20behavior">experimental analysis of behavior</a>. He imagined the application of his ideas to the design of a human community in his utopian novel, "<a href="Walden%20Two">Walden Two</a>", and his analysis of human behavior culminated in his work, "<a href="Verbal%20Behavior">Verbal Behavior</a>".
Skinner was a prolific author who published 21 books and 180 articles. Contemporary academia considers Skinner a pioneer of modern behaviorism, along with <a href="John%20B.%20Watson">John B. Watson</a> and <a href="Ivan%20Pavlov">Ivan Pavlov</a>. A June 2002 survey listed Skinner as the most influential psychologist of the 20th century.

Skinner was born in <a href="Susquehanna%2C%20Pennsylvania">Susquehanna, Pennsylvania</a>, to Grace and William Skinner. His father was a lawyer. He became an <a href="atheism">atheist</a> after a Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the hell that his grandmother described. His brother Edward, two and a half years younger, died at age sixteen of a <a href="cerebral%20hemorrhage">cerebral hemorrhage</a>. He attended <a href="Hamilton%20College%20%28New%20York%29">Hamilton College</a> in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He found himself at a social disadvantage at Hamilton College because of his intellectual attitude. While attending, he joined <a href="Lambda%20Chi%20Alpha">Lambda Chi Alpha</a> fraternity. He wrote for the school paper, but, as an atheist, he was critical of the religious school he attended. After receiving his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> in English literature in 1926, he attended Harvard University, where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While he was at Harvard, a fellow student, Fred Keller, convinced Skinner that he could make an <a href="experimental%20science">experimental science</a> from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to invent his prototype for the <a href="Skinner%20Box">Skinner Box</a> and to join Keller in the creation of other tools for small experiments. After graduation, he unsuccessfully tried to write a great novel while he lived with his parents, a period that he later called the Dark Years. He became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from the renowned poet <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a>, concluding that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with <a href="John%20B.%20Watson">John B. Watson</a>'s "Behaviorism" led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own version of behaviorism.

Skinner received a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">PhD</a> from Harvard in 1931, and remained there as a researcher until 1936. He then taught at the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a> at Minneapolis and later at <a href="Indiana%20University%20%28Bloomington%29">Indiana University</a>, where he was chair of the psychology department from 1946–1947, before returning to Harvard as a tenured professor in 1948. He remained at Harvard for the rest of his life. In 1973, Skinner was one of the signers of the <a href="Humanist%20Manifesto%20II">Humanist Manifesto II</a>.

In 1936, Skinner married Yvonne (Eve) Blue. The couple had two daughters, <a href="Julie%20Vargas">Julie</a> (m. Vargas) and Deborah (m. <a href="Barry%20Buzan">Buzan</a>). Yvonne Skinner died in 1997, and is buried in <a href="Mount%20Auburn%20Cemetery">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a>, <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>.

Skinner continued to write and work until just before his death. Just a few days before his death, he was given a lifetime achievement award by the <a href="American%20Psychological%20Association">American Psychological Association</a>, and delivered a 15-minute address concerning his work.

A controversial figure, Skinner has been depicted in many different ways. He has been widely revered for bringing a much-needed scientific approach to the study of human behavior; he has also been vilified for attempting to apply findings based largely on animal experiments to human behavior in real-life settings.

Skinner called his approach to the study of behavior <a href="radical%20behaviorism">radical behaviorism</a>. This philosophy of behavioral science assumes that behavior is a consequence of environmental histories of reinforcement (see <a href="Applied%20behavior%20analysis">Applied behavior analysis</a>). In contrast to the approach of <a href="cognitive%20science">cognitive science</a>, behaviorism does not accept private events such as thinking, perceptions, and unobservable emotions as causes of an organism's behavior. However, in contrast to methodological behaviorism, Skinner's radical behaviorism did accept thoughts, emotions, and other "private events" as responses subject to the same rules as overt behavior. In his words: 

In this way we repair the major damage wrought by <a href="mentalism%20%28psychology%29">mentalism</a>. When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him, investigation is brought to an end. Why explain the explanation? For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis of the role of the environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.

Skinner's behavioral theory was largely set forth in his first book, "Behavior of Organisms". Here he gave a systematic description of the manner in which environmental variables control behavior. He distinguished two sorts of behavior—respondent and operant—which are controlled in different ways. "Respondent" behaviors are elicited by stimuli, and may be modified through respondent conditioning, which is often called "Pavlovian conditioning" or "<a href="classical%20conditioning">classical conditioning</a>", in which a neutral stimulus is paired with an eliciting stimulus. "Operant" behaviors, in contrast, are "emitted", meaning that initially they are not induced by any particular stimulus. They are strengthened through operant conditioning, sometimes called "instrumental conditioning", in which the occurrence of a response yields a reinforcer. Respondent behaviors might be measured by their latency or strength, operant behaviors by their rate. Both of these sorts of behavior had already been studied experimentally, for example, respondents by Pavlov, and operants by Thorndike. Skinner's account differed in some ways from earlier ones, and was one of the first accounts to bring them under one roof.

The idea that behavior is strengthened or weakened by its consequences raises several questions. Among the most important are these: (1) Operant responses are strengthened by reinforcement, but where do they come from in the first place? (2) Once it is in the organism's repertoire, how is a response directed or controlled? (3) How can very complex and seemingly novel behaviors be explained?

Skinner's answer to the first question was very much like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a "new" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment; a variation that is followed by reinforcement is strengthened and becomes prominent in that individual's behavioral repertoire. "Shaping" was Skinner's term for the gradual modification of behavior by the reinforcement of desired variations. As discussed later in this article, Skinner believed that "superstitious" behavior can arise when a response happens to be followed by reinforcement to which it is actually unrelated.

The second question, "how is operant behavior controlled?" arises because, to begin with, the behavior is "emitted" without reference to any particular stimulus. Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not. For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, will learn to press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This "three-term contingency" (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.

Most behavior of humans cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one, and Skinner devoted a great deal of effort to the problem of behavioral complexity. Some complex behavior can be seen as a sequence of relatively simple responses, and here Skinner invoked the idea of "chaining." Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a "conditioned reinforcer." For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may also be used to reinforce "turning around" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence "noise - turn-around - light - press lever - food." Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.

However, Skinner recognized that a great deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences. Complex behavior often appears suddenly in its final form, as when a person first finds his way to the elevator by following instructions given at the front desk. To account for such behavior, Skinner introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior. First, relatively simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to "jump", "open the book", and so on. After a large number of responses come under such verbal control, a sequence of verbal stimuli can evoke an almost unlimited variety of complex responses.

Reinforcement, a key concept of <a href="behaviorism">behaviorism</a>, is the primary process that shapes and controls behavior, and occurs in two ways, "positive" and "negative." In "The Behavior of Organisms" (1938), Skinner defined "negative reinforcement" to be synonymous with <a href="punishment">punishment</a>, that is, the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently, in "Science and Human Behavior" (1953), Skinner redefined negative reinforcement. In what has now become the standard set of definitions, positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the occurrence of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), whereas negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella over your head on a rainy day is reinforced by the cessation of rain falling on you).

Both types of reinforcement strengthen behavior, or increase the probability of a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied (<a href="positive%20reinforcement">positive reinforcement</a>) or something removed or avoided (<a href="negative%20reinforcement">negative reinforcement</a>). Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus (<a href="negative%20punishment">negative punishment</a> or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences. Extinction is the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which weakens behavior.

Writing in 1981, Skinner pointed out that Darwinian natural selection is, like reinforced behavior, "selection by consequences." Though, as he said, natural selection has now "made its case", he regretted that essentially the same process, "reinforcement", was less widely accepted as underlying human behavior.

Skinner recognized that behavior is typically reinforced more than once, and, together with C. B. Ferster, he did an extensive analysis of the various ways in which reinforcements could be arranged over time, which he called "<a href="schedules%20of%20reinforcement">schedules of reinforcement</a>."

The most notable schedules of reinforcement studied by Skinner were continuous, interval (fixed or variable), and ratio (fixed or variable). All are methods used in <a href="operant%20conditioning">operant conditioning</a>.


An <a href="operant%20conditioning%20chamber">operant conditioning chamber</a> (also known as a "Skinner Box") is a laboratory apparatus used in the experimental analysis of animal behavior. It was invented by Skinner while he was a graduate student at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. As used by Skinner, the box had a lever (for rats), or a disk in one wall (for pigeons). A press on this "manipulandum" could deliver food to the animal through an opening in the wall, and responses reinforced in this way increased in frequency. By controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response ("memory"), punishment, and so on. By channeling research in these directions, the operant conditioning chamber has had a huge influence on course of research in animal learning and its applications. It enabled great progress on problems that could be studied by measuring the rate, probability, or force of a simple, repeatable response. However, it discouraged the study of behavioral processes not easily conceptualized in such terms—spatial learning, in particular, which is now studied in quite different ways, for example, by the use of the <a href="water%20maze">water maze</a>.

The cumulative recorder makes a pen-and-ink record of simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it for use with the <a href="Operant%20chamber">Operant chamber</a> as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck. In this device, a sheet of paper gradually unrolls over a cylinder. Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting ink line graphically displays the rate of the response; for example, rapid responses yield a steeply sloping line on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use with the advent of the laboratory computer. Skinner's major experimental exploration of response rates, presented in his book with C. B. Ferster, "Schedules of Reinforcement", is full of cumulative records produced by this device.

The air crib is an easily cleaned, temperature- and humidity-controlled enclosure intended to replace the standard infant <a href="Infant%20bed">crib</a>. 
Skinner invented the device to help his wife cope with the day-to-day tasks of child rearing. It was designed to make early childcare simpler (by reducing laundry, diaper rash, cradle cap, etc.), while allowing the baby to be more mobile and comfortable, and less prone to cry. Reportedly it had some success in these goals.

The air crib was a controversial invention. It was popularly mischaracterized as a cruel pen, and it was often compared to Skinner's <a href="operant%20conditioning%20chamber">operant conditioning chamber</a>, commonly called the "Skinner Box." This association with laboratory animal experimentation discouraged its commercial success, though several companies attempted production.

A 2004 book by <a href="Lauren%20Slater">Lauren Slater</a>, entitled "" caused a stir by mentioning the rumors that Skinner had used his baby daughter, Deborah, in some of his experiments, and that she had subsequently committed suicide. Although Slater's book stated that the rumors were false, a reviewer in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" in March 2004 misquoted Slater's book as supporting the rumors. This review was read by Deborah Skinner (now Deborah Buzan, an artist and writer living in London) who wrote a vehement riposte in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>".

The <a href="teaching%20machine">teaching machine</a> was a <a href="mechanical%20device">mechanical device</a> whose purpose was to administer a curriculum of <a href="programmed%20learning">programmed learning</a>. The machine embodies key elements of Skinner’s theory of learning and had important implications for education in general and classroom instruction in particular.

In one incarnation, the machine was a box that housed a list of questions that could be viewed one at a time through a small window. (See picture). There was also a mechanism through which the learner could respond to each question. Upon delivering a correct answer, the learner would be rewarded.

Skinner advocated the use of teaching machines for a broad range of students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). For example, one machine that he envisioned could teach rhythm. He wrote:A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. "Unison" is specified very loosely at first (the student can be a little early or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score.The instructional potential of the teaching machine stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, "learning by doing."

Teaching machines, though perhaps rudimentary, were not rigid instruments of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved based upon the students' performance. For example, if a student made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions—the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.

Not only useful in teaching explicit skills, machines could also promote the development of a repertoire of behaviors that Skinner called self-management. Effective self-management means attending to stimuli appropriate to a task, avoiding distractions, reducing the opportunity of reward for competing behaviors, and so on. For example, machines encourage students to pay attention before receiving a reward. Skinner contrasted this with the common classroom practice of initially capturing students’ attention (e.g., with a lively video) and delivering a reward (e.g., entertainment) before the students have actually performed any relevant behavior. This practice fails to reinforce correct behavior and actually counters the development of self-management.

Skinner pioneered the use of teaching machines in the classroom, especially at the primary level. Today computers run software that performs similar teaching tasks, and there has been a resurgence of interest in the topic related to the development of adaptive learning systems.

During World War II, the <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> required a weapon effective against surface ships, such as the German <a href="German%20battleship%20Bismarck">"Bismarck" class</a> battleships. Although <a href="missile">missile</a> and <a href="Television%20guidance">TV</a> technology existed, the size of the primitive guidance systems available rendered automatic guidance impractical. To solve this problem, Skinner initiated <a href="Project%20Pigeon">Project Pigeon</a>, which was intended to provide a simple and effective guidance system. This system divided the nose cone of a missile into three compartments, with a pigeon placed in each. Lenses projected an image of distant objects onto a screen in front of each bird. Thus, when the missile was launched from an aircraft within sight of an enemy ship, an image of the ship would appear on the screen. The screen was hinged, such that pecks at the image of the ship would guide the missile toward the ship.

Despite an effective demonstration, the project was abandoned, and eventually more conventional solutions, such as those based on radar, became available. Skinner complained that "our problem was no one would take us seriously." It seemed that few people would trust pigeons to guide a missile, no matter how reliable the system appeared to be.

Early in his career Skinner became interested in "latent speech" and experimented with a device he called the "verbal summator." This device can be thought of as an auditory version of the Rorschach inkblots. When using the device, human participants listened to incomprehensible auditory "garbage" but often read meaning into what they heard. Thus, as with the Rorschach blots, the device was intended to yield overt behavior that projected subconscious thoughts. Skinner's interest in projective testing was brief, but he later used observations with the summator in creating his theory of verbal behavior. The device also led other researchers to invent new tests such as the tautophone test, the auditory apperception test, and the Azzageddi test.

Challenged by <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a> during a casual discussion while at Harvard to provide an account of a randomly provided piece of verbal behavior, Skinner set about attempting to extend his then-new functional, inductive approach to the complexity of human verbal behavior. Developed over two decades, his work appeared in the book "<a href="Verbal%20Behavior">Verbal Behavior</a>". Although Noam Chomsky was highly critical of "Verbal Behavior", he conceded that Skinner's "S-R psychology" was worth a review. (Behavior analysts reject the "S-R" characterization: operant conditioning involves the emission of a response which then becomes more or less likely depending upon its consequence–see above.).

"Verbal Behavior" had an uncharacteristically cool reception, partly as a result of Chomsky's review, partly because of Skinner's failure to address or rebut any of Chomsky's criticisms. Skinner's peers may have been slow to adopt the ideas presented in "Verbal Behavior" because of the absence of experimental evidence—unlike the empirical density that marked Skinner's experimental work. However, in applied settings there has been a resurgence of interest in Skinner's functional analysis of verbal behavior.

Skinner's views influenced <a href="education">education</a> as well as psychology. Skinner argued that education has two major purposes: (1) to teach repertoires of both verbal and nonverbal behavior; and (2) to interest students in learning. He recommended bringing students’ behavior under appropriate control by providing reinforcement only in the presence of stimuli relevant to the learning task. Because he believed that human behavior can be affected by small consequences, something as simple as "the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity" can be an effective reinforcer (Skinner, 1961, p. 380). Skinner was convinced that, to learn, a student must engage in behavior, and not just passively receive information. (Skinner, 1961, p. 389).

Skinner believed that effective teaching must be based on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of <a href="rote%20learning">rote learning</a> and <a href="school%20discipline">punitive discipline</a> in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.

Because teachers are primarily responsible for modifying student behavior, Skinner argued that teachers must learn effective ways of teaching. In "The Technology of Teaching", Skinner has a chapter on why teachers fail (pages 93–113): He says that teachers have not been given an in-depth understanding of <a href="teaching">teaching</a> and <a href="learning">learning</a>. Without knowing the science underpinning teaching, teachers fall back on procedures that work poorly or not at all, such as:

Skinner suggests that any age-appropriate skill can be taught. The steps are
Skinner's views on education are extensively presented in his book "The Technology of Teaching". They are also reflected in <a href="Fred%20S.%20Keller">Fred S. Keller</a>'s "Personalized System of Instruction" and <a href="Ogden%20Lindsley">Ogden R. Lindsley</a>'s "<a href="Precision%20teaching">Precision Teaching</a>".

Skinner is popularly known mainly for his books "<a href="Walden%20Two">Walden Two</a>" and "<a href="Beyond%20Freedom%20and%20Dignity">Beyond Freedom and Dignity</a>," (for which he made the cover of "<a href="TIME">TIME</a>" Magazine). The former describes a fictional "experimental community" in 1940s United States. The productivity and happiness of citizens in this community is far greater than in the outside world because the residents practice scientific social planning and use operant conditioning in raising their children.

"Walden Two", like <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Thoreau</a>'s "<a href="Walden">Walden</a>", champions a lifestyle that does not support war, or foster competition and social strife. It encourages a lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work, and leisure. In 1967, <a href="Kat%20Kinkade">Kat Kinkade</a> and others founded the <a href="Twin%20Oaks%20Community">Twin Oaks Community</a>, using Walden Two as a blueprint. The community still exists and continues to use the Planner-Manager system and other aspects of the community described in Skinner's book, though behavior modification is not a community practice.

In "Beyond Freedom and Dignity", Skinner suggests that a technology of behavior could help to make a better society. We would, however, have to accept that an <a href="autonomous%20agent">autonomous agent</a> is not the driving force of our actions. Skinner offers alternatives to punishment, and challenges his readers to use science and modern technology to construct a better society.

Skinner's political writings emphasized his hopes that an effective and human science of behavioral control – a technology of human behavior – could help with problems as yet unsolved and often aggravated by advances in technology such as the <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. Indeed, one of Skinner's goals was to prevent humanity from destroying itself. He saw political activity as the use of aversive or non-aversive means to control a population. Skinner favored the use of <a href="positive%20reinforcement">positive reinforcement</a> as a means of control, citing <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s novel "" as an example of literature that "did not fear the power of positive reinforcement."

Skinner's book, "Walden Two", presents a vision of a decentralized, localized society, which applies a practical, scientific approach and behavioral expertise to deal peacefully with social problems. (For example, his views led him to oppose corporal punishment in schools, and he wrote a letter to the California Senate that helped lead it to a ban on spanking.) Skinner's <a href="utopia">utopia</a> is both a thought experiment and a <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>al piece. In "Walden Two", Skinner answers the problem that exists in many utopian novels – "What is the Good Life?" The book's answer is a life of friendship, health, art, a healthy balance between work and leisure, a minimum of unpleasantness, and a feeling that one has made worthwhile contributions to a society in which resources are ensured, in part, by minimizing consumption. 

Skinner described his novel as "my New Atlantis", in reference to <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28philosopher%29">Bacon</a>'s <a href="New%20Atlantis">utopia</a>. 

One of Skinner's experiments examined the formation of <a href="superstition">superstition</a> in one of his favorite experimental animals, the <a href="pigeon">pigeon</a>. Skinner placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon "at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird's behavior." He discovered that the pigeons associated the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been performing as it was delivered, and that they subsequently continued to perform these same actions.

Skinner suggested that the pigeons behaved as if they were influencing the automatic mechanism with their "rituals", and that this experiment shed light on human behavior:

Modern behavioral psychologists have disputed Skinner's "superstition" explanation for the behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's "adventitious reinforcement" explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the "terminal response", which occurred in anticipation of food, and "interim responses", that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food. Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (as opposed to operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their "autoshaping" procedures. The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced <a href="polydipsia">polydipsia</a> seen in a similar situation with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).

As understood by Skinner, ascribing "dignity" to individuals involves giving them credit for their actions. To say "Skinner is brilliant" means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's <a href="determinism">determinist</a> theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force and he had no choice in saying the things he said or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. <a href="J.%20E.%20R.%20Staddon">J. E. R. Staddon</a> ("The New Behaviorism, 2nd Edition", 2014) has argued the <a href="Compatibilism">compatibilist position</a>; Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.

<a href="Noam%20Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, a prominent critic of Skinner, published a <a href="Verbal%20Behavior%23Chomsky%27s%20review">review</a> of Skinner's "<a href="Verbal%20Behavior%20%28book%29">Verbal Behavior</a>" two years after it was published. Chomsky argued that Skinner's attempt to use behaviorism to explain human language amounted to little more than word games. Conditioned responses could not account for a child's ability to create or understand an infinite variety of novel sentences. Chomsky's review has been credited with launching the <a href="cognitive%20revolution">cognitive revolution</a> in psychology and other disciplines. Skinner, who rarely responded directly to critics, never formally replied to Chomsky's critique. Many years later, <a href="Kenneth%20MacCorquodale">Kenneth MacCorquodale</a>'s reply was endorsed by Skinner.

Chomsky also reviewed Skinner's "Beyond Freedom and Dignity", using the same basic motives as his "Verbal Behavior" review. Among Chomsky's criticisms were that Skinner's laboratory work could not be extended to humans, that when it was extended to humans it represented '<a href="Scientism">scientistic</a>' behavior attempting to emulate science but which was not scientific, that Skinner was not a scientist because he rejected the <a href="hypothetico-deductive%20model">hypothetico-deductive model</a> of theory testing, and that Skinner had no science of behavior.

Skinner has been repeatedly criticized for his supposed animosity towards <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, and <a href="psychodynamic%20psychology">psychodynamic psychology</a>. Some have argued, however, that Skinner shared several of Freud's assumptions, and that he was influenced by Freudian points of view in more than one field, among them the analysis of <a href="defense%20mechanisms">defense mechanisms</a>, such as <a href="Psychological%20repression">repression</a>. To study such phenomena, Skinner even designed his own <a href="projective%20test">projective test</a>, the "verbal summator" described above.

Bob Knight

Robert Montgomery Knight (born October 25, 1940) is a retired American <a href="basketball">basketball</a> <a href="coach%20%28sport%29">coach</a>. Nicknamed "The General", Knight won 902 <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29">Division I</a> men's college basketball games, the most all-time at the time of his retirement and currently second all-time, behind his former player and assistant coach <a href="Mike%20Krzyzewski">Mike Krzyzewski</a> of <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>. Knight is best known as the head coach of the <a href="Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball">Indiana Hoosiers</a> from 1971 to 2000. He also coached at <a href="Texas%20Tech%20Red%20Raiders%20basketball">Texas Tech</a> (2001–2008) and at <a href="Army%20Black%20Knights%20men%27s%20basketball">Army</a> (1965–1971).

While at Indiana, Knight led his teams to three <a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship">NCAA championships</a>, one <a href="National%20Invitation%20Tournament">National Invitation Tournament</a> (NIT) championship, and 11 <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten Conference</a> championships. His <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1975–76</a> team went the entire season and <a href="1976%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1976 NCAA tournament</a> without a single loss and remains the only team to accomplished such a feat since then. Knight received National Coach of the Year honors four times and Big Ten Coach of the Year honors eight times. In 1984, he coached the <a href="USA%20men%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">USA men's Olympic team</a> to a gold medal, becoming one of only three basketball coaches to win an NCAA title, NIT title, and an Olympic gold medal.

Knight was one of college basketball's most successful and innovative coaches, having perfected and popularized the <a href="motion%20offense">motion offense</a>. He has also been praised for running clean programs (none of his teams was ever sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations) and graduating most of his players. However, Knight has also attracted controversy; he famously threw a chair across the court during a game, was once arrested for <a href="assault">assault</a>, and regularly displayed a combative nature during encounters with members of the press. Knight remains "the object of near fanatical devotion" from many of his former players and Indiana fans.

In 2008, Knight joined <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> as a men's college basketball studio analyst during Championship Week and for coverage of the NCAA Tournament. He continued covering college basketball for ESPN through the 2014-15 season.

Knight was born in <a href="Massillon%2C%20Ohio">Massillon, Ohio</a>, and grew up in <a href="Orrville%2C%20Ohio">Orrville, Ohio</a>. Knight began his career as a player at <a href="Orrville%20High%20School">Orrville High School</a>. He continued under <a href="Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Basketball Hall of Fame</a> coach <a href="Fred%20R.%20Taylor">Fred Taylor</a> at <a href="Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20men%27s%20basketball">Ohio State</a> in 1958. Despite being a star player in high school, he played a reserve role as a forward on the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1960 Ohio State Buckeyes team</a> that won the NCAA Championship and featured future Hall of Fame players <a href="John%20Havlicek">John Havlicek</a> and <a href="Jerry%20Lucas">Jerry Lucas</a>. The Buckeyes lost to the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Cincinnati Bearcats</a> in each of the next two NCAA Championship games, of which Knight was also a part.

Due in part to the star power of those Ohio State teams, playing time was usually scarce for Knight, but that did not prevent him from making an impact. In the 1961 NCAA Championship game, Knight came off the bench with 1:41 on the clock and Cincinnati leading Ohio State, 61-59. In the words of then-Ohio State assistant coach <a href="Frank%20Truitt">Frank Truitt</a>,
Knight got the ball in the left front court and faked a drive into the middle. Then [he] crossed over like he worked on it all his life and drove right in and laid it up. That tied the game for us, and Knight ran clear across the floor like a 100-yard dash sprinter and ran right at me and said, 'See there, coach, I should have been in that game a long time ago!'
To which Truitt replied, "Sit down, you hot dog. You're lucky you're even on the floor."

In addition to lettering in basketball at Ohio State, it has been claimed that Knight also lettered in football and baseball; however, the official list of Ohio State football letter earners does not include Knight. Knight graduated with a degree in history and government in 1962.

After graduation in 1962, Knight coached junior varsity basketball at <a href="Cuyahoga%20Falls%20High%20School">Cuyahoga Falls High School</a> in Ohio for one year. Knight then enlisted in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> and accepted an assistant coaching position with the <a href="Army%20Black%20Knights%20men%27s%20basketball">Army Black Knights</a> in 1963, where, two years later, he was named head coach at the relatively young age of 24. In six seasons at West Point, Knight won 102 games, with his first as a head coach coming against <a href="Worcester%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>. One of his players was <a href="Mike%20Krzyzewski">Mike Krzyzewski</a>, who later served as his assistant before becoming a Hall of Fame head coach at <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball">Duke</a>. <a href="Mike%20Silliman">Mike Silliman</a> was another of Knight's players at Army, and Knight was quoted as saying, "Mike Silliman is the best player I have ever coached."

During his tenure at Army, Knight gained a reputation for having an explosive temper. For example, after Army's 66-60 loss to BYU and Hall of Fame coach <a href="Stan%20Watts">Stan Watts</a> in the semifinals of the <a href="1966%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament">1966 NIT</a>, Knight completely lost control, kicking lockers and verbally blasting the officials. Embarrassed, he later went to Watts' hotel room and apologized. Watts forgave him, and is quoted as saying, "I want you to know that you're going to be one of the bright young coaches in the country, and it's just a matter of time before you win a national championship."

In 1971, <a href="Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball">Indiana University</a> hired Knight as head coach. During his 29 years as head coach at Indiana, the Hoosiers won 662 games, including 22 seasons of 20 or more wins, while losing 239, a .735 winning percentage. In 24 NCAA tournament appearances at Indiana, Hoosier teams under Knight won 42 of 63 games (.667), winning titles in <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1976</a>, <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1981</a>, and <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1987</a>, while losing in the semi-finals in 1973 and 1992.

In <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1972–73</a>, Knight's second year as coach, Indiana won the Big Ten championship and reached the Final Four, but lost to <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20UCLA%20Bruins%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">UCLA</a>. The following season, 1973–74, Indiana once again captured a Big Ten title. In the two following seasons, <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1974–75</a> and <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1975–76</a>, the Hoosiers were undefeated in the regular season and won 37-consecutive Big Ten games, including two more Big Ten championships. The <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1974–75</a> Hoosiers swept the entire Big Ten by an average of 22.8 points per game. However, in an 83–82 win against <a href="Purdue%20Boilermakers%20men%27s%20basketball">Purdue</a> they lost consensus All-American forward <a href="Scott%20May">Scott May</a> to a broken left arm. With May's injury keeping him to 7 minutes of play, the No. 1 Hoosiers lost to <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Kentucky</a> 92–90 in the <a href="1975%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">Mideast Regional</a>. The Hoosiers were so dominant that four starters – <a href="Scott%20May">Scott May</a>, <a href="Steve%20Green%20%28basketball%29">Steve Green</a>, <a href="Kent%20Benson">Kent Benson</a> and <a href="Quinn%20Buckner">Quinn Buckner</a> – would make the five-man All-Big Ten team. The following season, <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1975–76</a>, the Hoosiers went the entire season and <a href="1976%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1976 NCAA tournament</a> without a single loss, beating <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Michigan</a> 86–68 in the title game. Immediately after the game, Knight lamented that "it should have been two." The 1976 Hoosiers remains the last undefeated NCAA Division I men's basketball team. Through these two seasons, Knight's teams were undefeated in the regular season, including a perfect 37–0 record in Big Ten games on their way to their third and fourth conference titles in a row. Behind the play of <a href="Mike%20Woodson">Mike Woodson</a> Indiana won the <a href="1979%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament">1979 NIT</a> championship.

The 1979–80 Hoosiers, led by <a href="Mike%20Woodson">Mike Woodson</a> and <a href="Isiah%20Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a>, won the Big Ten championship and advanced to the <a href="1980%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1980 Sweet Sixteen</a>. The following season, in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1980–81</a>, Thomas and the Hoosiers once again won a conference title and won the <a href="1981%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1981 NCAA tournament</a>, Knight's second national title. In 1982–1983, with the strong play of <a href="Uwe%20Blab">Uwe Blab</a> and All-Americans <a href="Ted%20Kitchel">Ted Kitchel</a> and <a href="Randy%20Wittman">Randy Wittman</a>, the No. 1 ranked Hoosiers were favorites to win another national championship. However, with an injury to All-American <a href="Ted%20Kitchel">Ted Kitchel</a> mid-season, the Hoosiers' prospects were grim. Knight asked for fan support to rally around the team and, when the team ultimately won the Big Ten title, he ordered that a banner be hung for the team in <a href="Assembly%20Hall%20%28Bloomington%29">Assembly Hall</a> as a tribute to the fans, who he credited with inspiring the team to win its final three home games. Nevertheless, in the tournament Kitchel's absence was felt and the team lost to Kentucky in the <a href="1983%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1983 Sweet Sixteen</a>.
The <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1985–86</a> Hoosiers were profiled in a best-selling book "<a href="A%20Season%20on%20the%20Brink">A Season on the Brink</a>". To write it Knight granted author <a href="John%20Feinstein">John Feinstein</a> almost unprecedented access to the Indiana basketball program, as well as insights into Knight's private life. The following season, in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1986–87</a>, the Hoosiers were led by All-American <a href="Steve%20Alford">Steve Alford</a> and captured a share of the Big Ten title. The team won Knight's third national championship (the school's fifth) against <a href="Syracuse%20Orange%20men%27s%20basketball">Syracuse</a> in the <a href="1987%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1987 NCAA tournament</a> with a game-winning jump shot by <a href="Keith%20Smart">Keith Smart</a> with five seconds of play remaining in the championship game. In the 1988–1989 season the Hoosiers were led by All-American <a href="Jay%20Edwards%20%28basketball%29">Jay Edwards</a> and won a Big Ten championship.

From 1990–91 through <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1992–93</a>, the Hoosiers posted 87 victories, the most by any Big Ten team in a three-year span, breaking the mark of 86 set by Knight's Indiana teams of 1974–76. Teams from these three seasons spent all but two of the 53 poll weeks in the top 10, and 38 of them in the top 5. They captured two Big Ten crowns in 1990–91 and <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1992–93</a>, and during the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1991–92</a> season reached the <a href="1992%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">Final Four</a>. During the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1992–93</a> season, the 31–4 Hoosiers finished the season at the top of the <a href="AP%20Poll">AP Poll</a>, but were defeated by <a href="Kansas%20Jayhawks%20men%27s%20basketball">Kansas</a> in the <a href="1993%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">Elite Eight</a>. Teams from this era included <a href="Greg%20Graham">Greg Graham</a>, <a href="Pat%20Knight">Pat Knight</a>, All-Americans <a href="Damon%20Bailey">Damon Bailey</a> and <a href="Alan%20Henderson">Alan Henderson</a>, and National Player of the Year <a href="Calbert%20Cheaney">Calbert Cheaney</a>.

Throughout the mid and late 1990s Knight continued to experience success with continual NCAA tournament appearances and a minimum of 19 wins each season. However, 1993 would be Knight's last conference championship and 1994 would be his last trip to the Sweet Sixteen.

On March 14, 2000, just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament, the <a href="CNN%20Sports%20Illustrated">CNN Sports Illustrated</a> network ran a piece on Knight in which former player <a href="Neil%20Reed">Neil Reed</a> claimed he had been choked by Knight in a 1997 practice. Knight denied the claims in the story. However, less than a month later, the network aired a tape of an Indiana practice from 1997 that appeared to show Knight placing his hand on the neck of Reed.
In response, Indiana University president <a href="Myles%20Brand">Myles Brand</a> announced that he had adopted a "zero tolerance" policy with regard to Knight's behavior. Later in the year, in September 2000, Indiana freshman Kent Harvey reportedly said, "Hey, Knight, what's up?" to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him by the arm and lectured him for not showing him respect, insisting that Harvey address him as either "Mr. Knight" or "Coach Knight" instead of simply "Knight." Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been put into place. Brand asked Knight to resign on September 10, and when Knight refused, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning Brand in <a href="effigy">effigy</a>.

Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he had intentionally set up Knight. Kent Harvey's stepfather, Mark Shaw, was a former Bloomington-area radio talk show host and Knight critic. On September 13, Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters in Dunn Meadow at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they continue to support the basketball team. Knight's firing made national headlines, including the cover of "Sports Illustrated" and around the clock coverage on ESPN.

In 1979 Knight guided the United States Pan American team to a gold medal in Puerto Rico. In 1984 Knight led the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">U.S. national team</a> to a gold medal in the <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> as coach of the <a href="Basketball%20at%20the%201984%20Summer%20Olympics">1984 basketball team</a> (coaches do not receive medals in the Olympics). Players on the team included <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> and Knight's Indiana player and protege <a href="Steve%20Alford">Steve Alford</a>.

After taking a season off following his dismissal from Indiana, all the while on the lookout for vacancies, Knight accepted the head coaching job at <a href="Texas%20Tech%20Red%20Raiders%20basketball">Texas Tech</a>, though his hiring was opposed by a group of faculty led by Walter Schaller. At the press conference introducing him, Knight quipped, "This is without question the most comfortable red sweater I've had on in six years."

Knight quickly improved the program, which had not been to an NCAA tournament since 1996. He led the team to postseason appearances in each of his first four years at the school (three NCAA Championship tournaments and one NIT). After a rough 2006 season, the team improved in 2007, finishing 21–13 and again making it to the NCAA Championship tournament, where it lost to <a href="Boston%20College%20Eagles%20men%27s%20basketball">Boston College</a> in the first round. The best performance by the Red Raiders under Knight came in 2005 when they advanced as far as the <a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship">Sweet Sixteen</a>. In both 2006 and 2007 under Knight, Texas Tech defeated two Top 10-ranked teams in consecutive weeks. During Knight's first six years at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders won 126 games, an average of 21 wins per season.

On February 4, 2008, Knight retired as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders. His son <a href="Pat%20Knight">Pat Knight</a>, the head coach designate since 2005, was immediately named as his successor. The younger Knight stated that after many years of coaching, his father was exhausted and ready to retire. Just after achieving his 900th win, Knight handed the job over to Pat in the mid-season in part to allow him to get acquainted with coaching the team earlier, instead of having him wait until October, the start of the next season. Knight continued to live in Lubbock after retiring.

In 2008, Knight was hired as a studio analyst and occasional color commentator by ESPN. In November 2012, he called an Indiana men's basketball game for the first time, something he had previously refused to do. Former Indiana men's basketball coach <a href="Tom%20Crean%20%28basketball%29">Tom Crean</a> reached out to Knight in an attempt to get him to visit the school again. Knight has thus far rebuffed all attempts to bring him back to Indiana University.
On April 2, 2015, ESPN announced that it will not renew its contract with Knight.

Knight was an innovator of the <a href="motion%20offense">motion offense</a>, which he perfected and popularized. The system emphasizes post players setting screens and perimeter players passing the ball until a teammate becomes open for an uncontested <a href="Jump%20shot%20%28basketball%29">jump shot</a> or <a href="lay-up">lay-up</a>. This required players to be unselfish, disciplined, and effective in setting and using <a href="screen%20%28basketball%29">screens</a> to get open.

Knight's motion offense didn't take shape until his time at Indiana. Prior to that, at Army, he ran a "reverse action" that involved reversing the ball from one side of the floor to the other and screening along with it. According to Knight, it was a "West Coast offense" that <a href="Pete%20Newell">Pete Newell</a> used exclusively during his coaching career. After being exposed to the <a href="Princeton%20offense">Princeton offense</a>, Knight instilled more cutting with the offense he employed, which evolved into the motion offense that he ran for most of his career. Knight continued to develop the offense, instituting different cuts over the years and putting his players in different scenarios.

Knight was well known for the extreme preparation he put into each game and practice. He was often quoted as saying, "Most people have the will to win, few have the will to prepare to win." Often during practice, Knight would instruct his players to a certain spot on the floor and give them options of what to do based on how the defense might react. In contrast to set plays, Knight's offense was designed to react according to the defense.

The <a href="Three-point%20field%20goal">3-point shot</a> was adopted nationally in the NCAA in 1986, midway through Knight's coaching career. Although he opposed the rule change throughout his life, it did complement his offense well by improving the spacing on the floor. He sardonically said at the time that he supported institution of the three point shot because if a team's offense was functioning efficiently enough to get a layup the team should be rewarded with three points for that basket. Knight's offense also emphasized a two-count. Players in the post are expected to try to post in the paint for two seconds and if they don't receive the ball they go set a screen. Players with the ball are expected to hold the ball for two seconds to see where they are going to take it. Screens are supposed to be held for two seconds, as well.

On defense Knight was known for emphasizing tenacious "man-to-man" defense where defenders contest every pass and every shot, and to help teammates when needed. However, Knight has also incorporated a zone defense periodically after eschewing that defense for the first two decades of his coaching career.

Knight's coaching also included a firm emphasis on academics. All but four of his four-year players completed degrees, a ratio of nearly 98 percent. Nearly 80 percent of his players graduated compared to the national average of 42 percent for Division I schools.

Knight's all time coaching record is 902–371. His 902 wins in <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29">Division I</a> men's college basketball games is second all-time to Knight's former player Mike Krzyzewski. Knight achieved his 880th career win on January 1, 2007 and passed retired North Carolina coach <a href="Dean%20Smith">Dean Smith</a> for most career victories, a title he held until his win total was surpassed by Krzyzewski on November 15, 2011. Knight is the youngest coach to reach 200 (age 35), 300 (age 40) and 400 (age 44) wins. He was also among the youngest to reach other milestones of 500 (age 48) and 600 (age 52) wins.

Texas Tech's participation in the <a href="2007%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">2007 NCAA Tournament</a> gave Knight more NCAA tournament appearances than any other coach. He is the only coach to win the NCAA, the NIT, an <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic</a> Gold medal, and a <a href="Pan%20American%20Games">Pan American Games</a> Gold medal. Knight is also one of only three people, along with <a href="Dean%20Smith">Dean Smith</a> and <a href="Joe%20B.%20Hall">Joe B. Hall</a>, who had both played on and coached a winning NCAA championship basketball team.

Knight received a number of personal honors during and after his coaching career. He was named the National Coach of the Year four times (1975, 1976, 1987, 1989) and Big Ten Coach of the Year eight times (1973, 1975, 1976, 1980, 1981, 1989, 1992, 1993). In 1975 he was a unanimous selection as National Coach of the Year, an honor he was accorded again in 1976 by the Associated Press, United Press International, and "Basketball Weekly". In 1987 he was the first person to be honored with the <a href="Naismith%20College%20Coach%20of%20the%20Year">Naismith Coach of the Year Award</a>. In 1989 he garnered National Coach of the Year honors by the AP, UPI, and the United States Basketball Writers Association. Knight was inducted into the <a href="Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Basketball Hall of Fame</a> in 1991.
On November 17, 2006, Knight was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame</a>. The following year, he was the recipient of the <a href="Naismith%20Outstanding%20Contribution%20to%20Basketball">Naismith Award for Men's Outstanding Contribution to Basketball</a>. Knight was also inducted into the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">Army</a> Sports Hall of Fame (Class of 2008) and the <a href="Indiana%20Hoosiers">Indiana Hoosiers</a> athletics Hall of Fame (Class of 2009). In August 2003, he was honored as the first inductee in The Vince Lombardi Titletown Legends.

A number of assistant coaches, players, and managers of Knight have gone on to be coaches. Among them are Hall of Fame Duke coach <a href="Mike%20Krzyzewski">Mike Krzyzewski</a>, UCLA coach <a href="Steve%20Alford">Steve Alford</a>, <a href="Murry%20Bartow">Murry Bartow</a> and NBA coaches <a href="Randy%20Wittman">Randy Wittman</a>, <a href="Mike%20Woodson">Mike Woodson</a>, <a href="Keith%20Smart">Keith Smart</a>, <a href="Isiah%20Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a>, Evansville Coach <a href="Marty%20Simmons">Marty Simmons</a>, St. Louis Coach <a href="Jim%20Crews">Jim Crews</a>, <a href="Lawrence%20Frank">Lawrence Frank</a> and <a href="Texas%20Tech">Texas Tech</a> coach <a href="Chris%20Beard%20%28basketball%29">Chris Beard</a>.

In 1986 author <a href="John%20Feinstein">John Feinstein</a> published "<a href="A%20Season%20on%20the%20Brink">A Season on the Brink</a>", which detailed the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1985–86 season</a> of the <a href="Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball">Indiana Hoosiers</a>. Granted almost unprecedented access to the Indiana basketball program, as well as insights into Knight's private life, the book quickly became a major best-seller and spawned a new genre, as a legion of imitators wrote works covering a single year of a sports franchise. In the book Feinstein depicts a coach who is quick with a violent temper, but also one who never cheats and strictly follows all of the NCAA's rules.

Two years later author Joan Mellen penned the book "Bob Knight: His Own Man" (), in part to rebut Feinstein's "A Season on the Brink". Mellen deals with seemingly all the causes celebres in Knight's career and presents the view that he is more sinned against than sinning.

A number of close associates and friends of Knight have also written books about him. Former player and current <a href="UCLA%20Bruins%20men%27s%20basketball">UCLA</a> head basketball coach <a href="Steve%20Alford">Steve Alford</a> wrote "Playing for Knight: My Six Seasons with Bobby Knight", published in 1990.

Knight's autobiography, written with longtime friend and sports journalist Bob Hammel, was titled "Knight: My Story" and published in 2003. Three years later Steve Delsohn and Mark Heisler wrote "Bob Knight: An Unauthorized Biography".

Knight has appeared or been featured in numerous films and television productions. In 1994 a feature film titled "<a href="Blue%20Chips">Blue Chips</a>" featured a character named Pete Bell, a volatile but honest college basketball coach under pressure to win who decides to blatantly violate NCAA rules to field a competitive team after a sub-par season. It starred <a href="Nick%20Nolte">Nick Nolte</a> as Bell and NBA star <a href="Shaquille%20O%27Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a> as Neon Bodeaux, a once-in-a-lifetime player Bell woos to his school with gifts and other perks. The coach's temper and wardrobe were modeled after Knight's, though at no time had Knight been known to illegally recruit. Knight himself appears in the movie and coaches against Nolte in the film's climactic game.

<a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>'s first feature-length film was "<a href="A%20Season%20on%20the%20Brink">A Season on the Brink</a>", a 2002 TV adaptation from John Feinstein's book. In the movie Knight is played by veteran character actor <a href="Brian%20Dennehy">Brian Dennehy</a>. ESPN also featured Knight in a <a href="reality%20television">reality show</a> titled "<a href="Knight%20School%20%28TV%20series%29">Knight School</a>", which followed a handful of Texas Tech students as they competed for the right to join the basketball team as a non-scholarship player.

Knight made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2003 film "<a href="Anger%20Management%20%28film%29">Anger Management</a>". In 2008, Knight appeared in a commercial as part of <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>'s Das Auto series where Max, a 1964 black <a href="Volkswagen%20Beetle">Beetle</a> interviews famous people. When Knight talked about Volkswagen winning the best resale value award in 2008, Max replied, "At least one of us is winning a title this year." This prompted Knight to throw his chair off the stage and walk out saying, "I may not be retired."

Knight also made an appearance in a TV commercial for with fellow coaches <a href="Mike%20Krzyzewski">Mike Krzyzewski</a>, <a href="Rick%20Pitino">Rick Pitino</a>, and <a href="Roy%20Williams%20%28coach%29">Roy Williams</a>, in a parody of <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> in "<a href="Risky%20Business">Risky Business</a>".

In 2009, Knight produced three instructional coaching DVD libraries—on motion offense, man-to-man defense, and instilling mental toughness—with Championship Productions.

Knight married Nancy Falk on April 17, 1963 and the two divorced in 1985. Together they had two sons, Tim and <a href="Pat%20Knight">Pat</a>. Pat played at Indiana from 1991 to 1995 and served as head coach at <a href="Lamar%20Cardinals%20basketball">Lamar</a> from the time of his father's retirement until his dismissal in 2014. Pat Knight coached Texas Tech after his father's retirement before moving to Lamar. In 1988 Knight married Karen Vieth Edgar, a former Oklahoma high school basketball coach.

Knight has a high regard for education and has made generous donations to the schools he has been a part of, particularly libraries. At <a href="Indiana%20University%20Bloomington">Indiana University</a> Knight endowed two chairs, one in history and one in law. He also raised nearly $5 million for the Indiana University library system by championing a library fund to support the library's activities. The fund was ultimately named in his honor.

When Knight came to Texas Tech in 2001, he gave $10,000 to the library, the first gift to the Coach Knight Library Fund which has now collected over $300,000. On November 29, 2007, the Texas Tech library honored this with "A Legacy of Giving: The Bob Knight Exhibit".

Black metal

Black metal is an <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme</a> subgenre of <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal music</a>. Common traits include <a href="Tempo%23Beats%20per%20minute">fast tempos</a>, a <a href="Screaming%20%28music%29%23Black%20metal">shrieking</a> vocal style, heavily distorted <a href="Electric%20guitar">guitars</a> played with <a href="tremolo%20picking">tremolo picking</a>, raw (<a href="Lo-fi%20music">lo-fi</a>) recording, unconventional <a href="song%20structure">song structure</a>s, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in <a href="corpse%20paint">corpse paint</a> and adopt pseudonyms.

During the 1980s, several <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash</a> and <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a> bands formed a prototype for black metal. This so-called first wave included bands such as <a href="Venom%20%28band%29">Venom</a>, <a href="Bathory%20%28band%29">Bathory</a>, <a href="Mercyful%20Fate">Mercyful Fate</a>, <a href="Hellhammer">Hellhammer</a> and <a href="Celtic%20Frost">Celtic Frost</a>. A second wave arose in the early-1990s, spearheaded by <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> bands such as <a href="Mayhem%20%28band%29">Mayhem</a>, <a href="Darkthrone">Darkthrone</a>, <a href="Burzum">Burzum</a>, <a href="Immortal%20%28band%29">Immortal</a>, <a href="Emperor%20%28band%29">Emperor</a>, <a href="Satyricon%20%28band%29">Satyricon</a> and <a href="Gorgoroth">Gorgoroth</a>. The <a href="early%20Norwegian%20black%20metal%20scene">early Norwegian black metal scene</a> developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently. Some prominent <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> bands spawned during this second wave, such as <a href="Marduk%20%28band%29">Marduk</a>, <a href="Nifelheim">Nifelheim</a> and <a href="Dark%20Funeral%20%28band%29">Dark Funeral</a>.

Initially a synonym for "Satanic metal," black metal is often met with hostility from mainstream culture, due to the actions and <a href="Black%20metal%23Ideology">ideologies</a> associated with it. Many artists express extreme <a href="Anti-Christian%20sentiment">anti-Christian</a> and <a href="Misanthropy">misanthropic</a> views, advocating various forms of <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a> or <a href="Polytheistic%20reconstructionism">ethnic paganism</a>. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of <a href="Black%20metal%23Church%20burnings">church burnings</a> and murders. There is also a small <a href="Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazi</a> <a href="National%20Socialist%20black%20metal">movement</a> within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists. Generally, black metal strives to remain <a href="Underground%20music">underground</a>, inaccessible to the mainstream.

Although "contemporary black metal" typically refers to the Norwegian style with shrieking vocals and raw production, the term has also been applied to bands with widely differing sounds.

Norwegian-inspired black metal guitarists usually favor high-pitched or <a href="Treble%20%28sound%29">trebly</a> guitar tones and heavy <a href="distortion%20%28guitar%29">distortion</a>. The guitar is usually played with fast, un-<a href="Palm%20mute">muted</a> <a href="tremolo%20picking">tremolo picking</a>. Guitarists often use <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a>—along with specific <a href="Musical%20scale">scales</a>, <a href="Interval%20%28music%29">intervals</a> and chord progressions—to create a sense of dread. The <a href="tritone">tritone</a>, or flat-fifth, is often used. <a href="Guitar%20solo">Guitar solo</a>s and low <a href="guitar%20tunings">guitar tunings</a> are rare in black metal. The <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a> is seldom used to play stand-alone melodies. It is not uncommon for the bass to be muted against the guitar, or for it to <a href="Homophony">homophonically</a> follow the low-pitched riffs of the guitar. While electronic keyboards were initially "not heard in [this] type of music", <a href="Dimmu%20Borgir">Dimmu Borgir</a> say they started using keyboards "in the background" and then started using them as a "proper instrument" for creating "atmosphere". Some newer black metal bands began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s and even <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>s.

The <a href="Drum%20kit">drumming</a> is usually fast and relies on <a href="Heel-toe%20technique">double-bass</a> and <a href="blast%20beat">blast beat</a>s to maintain tempos that can sometimes approach 300 beats per minute. These fast tempos require great skill and physical stamina, typified by black metal drummers Frost (<a href="Kjetil-Vidar%20Haraldstad">Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad</a>) and Hellhammer (<a href="Jan%20Axel%20Blomberg">Jan Axel Blomberg</a>). Even still, <a href="authenticity%20%28philosophy%29">authenticity</a> is still prioritized over technique. "This professionalism has to go," insists well-respected drummer and metal historian <a href="Fenriz">Fenriz</a> (Gylve Fenris Nagell) of <a href="Darkthrone">Darkthrone</a>. "I want to "de-learn" playing drums, I want to play primitive and simple, I don't want to play like a drum solo all the time and make these complicated riffs".

Black metal songs often stray from <a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29">conventional song structure</a> and often lack clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections. The Greek style—established by <a href="Rotting%20Christ">Rotting Christ</a>, <a href="Necromantia">Necromantia</a> and Varathron—has more <a href="traditional%20metal">traditional heavy metal</a> and <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a> traits than Norwegian black metal.

Traditional black metal bands tend to favor raspy, high-pitched vocals which include techniques such as shrieking, screaming, and snarling, a vocal style influenced by <a href="Quorthon">Quorthon</a> of <a href="Bathory%20%28band%29">Bathory</a>. <a href="Death%20growl">Death growl</a>s, common in the <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a> genre, are sometimes used, but less frequently than the characteristic black metal shriek.

Black metal lyrics typically attack Christianity and the other institutional religions, often using apocalyptic language. <a href="Satanism">Satanic</a> lyrics are common, and many see them as essential to black metal. For Satanist black metal artists, "Black metal songs are meant to be like Calvinist sermons; deadly serious attempts to unite the true believers". <a href="Misanthropy">Misanthropy</a>, <a href="global%20catastrophe">global catastrophe</a>, war, death, destruction and rebirth are also common themes. Another topic often found in black metal lyrics is that of the wild and extreme aspects and phenomena of the natural world, particularly the wilderness, forests, mountains, winter, storms, and blizzards. Black metal also has a fascination with the distant past. Many bands write about the mythology and folklore of their homelands and promote a revival of pre-Christian, pagan traditions. A significant number of bands write lyrics only in their native language and a few (e.g. <a href="Arckanum">Arckanum</a>) have lyrics in archaic languages. For more information about black metal lyrics, see the <a href="%23Ideology">ideology section</a> below.

Many bands choose not to play live. Many of those who do play live maintain that their performances "are not for entertainment or spectacle. Sincerity, <a href="Authenticity%20%28philosophy%29%23In%20music">authenticity</a> and extremity are valued above all else". Some bands consider their concerts to be rituals and often make use of stage props and theatrics. Bands such as <a href="Mayhem%20%28band%29">Mayhem</a> and <a href="Gorgoroth">Gorgoroth</a> are noted for their controversial shows, which have featured impaled animal heads, mock crucifixions, medieval weaponry and band members doused in animal blood. A few vocalists, such as <a href="Per%20%26quot%3BDead%26quot%3B%20Ohlin">Dead</a>, <a href="Sven%20Erik%20Kristiansen">Maniac</a> and <a href="Niklas%20Kvarforth">Kvarforth</a>, are known for <a href="Self-harm">cutting themselves</a> while singing onstage.

Black metal artists often appear dressed in black with combat boots, bullet belts, spiked wristbands and <a href="Cross%20of%20St.%20Peter">inverted crosses</a> and <a href="pentagram">pentagram</a>s to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance. However, the most stand-out trait is their use of corpse paint – black and white face paint sometimes mixed with real or fake blood, which is used to create a corpse-like or demonic appearance.

The imagery of black metal reflects its lyrics and ideology. In the early-1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring <a href="Xerox%20art">xeroxed</a> black-and-white pictures and/or writing. This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork. Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example <a href="Burzum">Burzum</a>'s "<a href="Filosofem">Filosofem</a>" and Emperor's "<a href="In%20the%20Nightside%20Eclipse">In the Nightside Eclipse</a>") while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example <a href="Marduk%20%28band%29">Marduk</a>'s "<a href="Fuck%20Me%20Jesus">Fuck Me Jesus</a>" and <a href="Dimmu%20Borgir">Dimmu Borgir</a>'s "<a href="In%20Sorte%20Diaboli">In Sorte Diaboli</a>").

The earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings would often be done in homes or basements, giving their recordings a distinctive "<a href="lo-fi">lo-fi</a>" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings. Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more "raw" or "cold." A well-known example of this approach is on the album "<a href="Transilvanian%20Hunger">Transilvanian Hunger</a>" by <a href="Darkthrone">Darkthrone</a>, a band who Johnathan Selzer of "<a href="Terrorizer%20%28magazine%29">Terrorizer</a>" magazine says "represent the <a href="DIY">DIY</a> aspect of black metal." In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are <a href="Poseur">not committed</a>. Many have claimed that black metal was originally intended only for those who were part of the scene and not for a wider audience. Vocalist <a href="Gaahl">Gaahl</a> said that during its early years, "Black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction".

The conventional history of black metal is that pioneers like <a href="Venom%20%28band%29">Venom</a>, <a href="Bathory%20%28band%29">Bathory</a> and <a href="Hellhammer">Hellhammer</a> were part of a "first wave", and that a "second wave" was begun by the early Norwegian scene; especially by Mayhem vocalist, Dead's suicide, Mayhem's leader, Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide, and Darkthrone's album "<a href="A%20Blaze%20in%20the%20Northern%20Sky">A Blaze in the Northern Sky</a>". There are also some who argue that albums like <a href="Sarc%C3%B3fago">Sarcófago</a>'s "<a href="I.N.R.I.%20%28Sarc%C3%B3fago%20album%29">I.N.R.I.</a>" or <a href="Samael%20%28band%29">Samael</a>'s "<a href="Worship%20Him">Worship Him</a>" began the second wave.

Occult and Satanic lyrical themes were present in the music of heavy rock bands of the late-1960s and early-1970s such as <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> and <a href="Coven%20%28band%29">Coven</a>. 

In the late-1970s, the form of rough and aggressive rock played by the British band <a href="Mot%C3%B6rhead">Motörhead</a> gained popularity. Many first wave black metal bands would cite Motörhead as an influence. Also popular in the late-1970s, <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> came to influence the birth of black metal. <a href="Tom%20G.%20Warrior">Tom G. Warrior</a> of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost credited English <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> band <a href="Discharge%20%28band%29">Discharge</a> as "a revolution, much like Venom", saying, "When I heard the first two Discharge records, I was blown away. I was just starting to play an instrument and I had no idea you could go so far."

The use of corpse paint in the black metal imagery was mainly influenced by the American 1970s <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> band <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">Kiss</a>.

The first wave of black metal refers to those bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. They were often <a href="speed%20metal">speed metal</a> or <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> bands.

The term "black metal" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album "<a href="Black%20Metal%20%28album%29">Black Metal</a>" (1982). Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards, the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.

Another major influence on black metal was the Swedish band <a href="Bathory%20%28band%29">Bathory</a>. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. <a href="Quorthon">Quorthon</a>), created "the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal". Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that came to define black metal. The band played in this style on their first four albums: "<a href="Bathory%20%28album%29">Bathory</a>" (1984), "<a href="The%20Return%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6">The Return……</a>" (1985), "<a href="Under%20the%20Sign%20of%20the%20Black%20Mark">Under the Sign of the Black Mark</a>" (1987) and "<a href="Blood%20Fire%20Death">Blood Fire Death</a>" (1988). With "Blood Fire Death" and the two following albums, Bathory pioneered the style that would become known as <a href="Viking%20metal">Viking metal</a>.

Hellhammer, from Switzerland, "made truly raw and brutal music" with Satanic lyrics, and became an important influence on later black metal; "Their simple yet effective riffs and fast guitar sound were groundbreaking, anticipating the later trademark sound of early Swedish death metal". In 1984, members of Hellhammer formed Celtic Frost, whose music "explored more orchestral and experimental territories. The lyrics also became more personal, with topics about inner feelings and majestic stories. But for a couple of years, Celtic Frost was one of the world's most extreme and original metal bands, with a huge impact on the mid-90's black metal scene". 

The Danish band <a href="Mercyful%20Fate">Mercyful Fate</a> influenced the Norwegian scene with their imagery and lyrics. Frontman <a href="King%20Diamond">King Diamond</a>, who wore ghoulish black-and-white facepaint on stage, may be one of the inspirators of what became known as 'corpse paint'. Other acts which adopted a similar appearance on stage were <a href="Misfits%20%28band%29">Misfits</a>, Celtic Frost and the Brazilian extreme metal band Sarcófago. Other artists usually considered part of this movement include <a href="Kreator">Kreator</a>, <a href="Sodom%20%28band%29">Sodom</a> and <a href="Destruction%20%28band%29">Destruction</a> (from Germany), <a href="Bulldozer%20%28band%29">Bulldozer</a> and <a href="Death%20SS">Death SS</a> (from Italy), whose vocalist Steve Sylvester was a member of the <a href="Ordo%20Templi%20Orientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a>.

In 1987, in the fifth issue of his "Slayer" fanzine, Metalion wrote that "the latest fad of black/Satanic bands seems to be over", the tradition being continued by a few bands like Incubus and <a href="Morbid%20Angel">Morbid Angel</a> (from the United States), <a href="Sabbat%20%28English%20band%29">Sabbat</a> (from Great Britain), <a href="Tormentor">Tormentor</a> (from Hungary), Sarcófago (from Brazil), <a href="Grotesque%20%28band%29">Grotesque</a>, early <a href="Tiamat%20%28band%29">Tiamat</a> and <a href="Treblinka%20%28band%29">Treblinka</a> (from Sweden). Other early black metal bands include <a href="Sabbat%20%28Japanese%20band%29">Sabbat</a> (formed 1983 in Japan), <a href="Parabellum%20%28band%29">Parabellum</a> (formed 1983 in Colombia), <a href="Salem%20%28Israeli%20band%29">Salem</a> (formed 1985 in Israel) and <a href="Mortuary%20Drape">Mortuary Drape</a> (formed 1986 in Italy). Japanese band <a href="Sigh%20%28band%29">Sigh</a> formed in 1990 and was in regular contact with key members of the Norwegian scene. Their debut album, "<a href="Scorn%20Defeat">Scorn Defeat</a>", became "a cult classic in the black metal world". In the years before the Norwegian black metal scene arose, important recordings were released by <a href="Root%20%28band%29">Root</a> and <a href="Master%27s%20Hammer">Master's Hammer</a> (from Czechoslovakia), <a href="Von%20%28band%29">Von</a> (from the United States), <a href="Rotting%20Christ">Rotting Christ</a> (from Greece), Samael (from Switzerland) and <a href="Blasphemy%20%28band%29">Blasphemy</a> (from Canada), whose debut album "<a href="Fallen%20Angel%20of%20Doom">Fallen Angel of Doom</a>" (1990) is considered one of the most influential records for the war metal style. <a href="Fenriz">Fenriz</a> of the Norwegian band Darkthrone called Master's Hammer's debut album "<a href="Ritual%20%28Master%27s%20Hammer%20album%29">Ritual</a>" "the first Norwegian black metal album, even though they are from Czechoslovakia".

In 1990 and 1991, Northern European metal acts began to release music influenced by these bands or the older ones from the first wave. In Sweden, this included Marduk, <a href="Dissection%20%28band%29">Dissection</a>, <a href="Nifelheim">Nifelheim</a> and <a href="Abruptum">Abruptum</a>. In Finland, there emerged a scene that mixed the first wave black metal style with elements of death metal and <a href="grindcore">grindcore</a>; this included <a href="Beherit%20%28band%29">Beherit</a>, <a href="Archgoat">Archgoat</a> and <a href="Impaled%20Nazarene">Impaled Nazarene</a>, whose debut album "Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz" "Rock Hard" journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann considers a part of war metal's roots. Bands such as <a href="Demoncy">Demoncy</a> and <a href="Profanatica">Profanatica</a> emerged during this time in the United States, when death metal was more popular among extreme metal fans. The Norwegian band Mayhem's concert in Leipzig with <a href="Eminenz">Eminenz</a> and <a href="Manos%20%28band%29">Manos</a> in 1990, later released as "<a href="Live%20in%20Leipzig">Live in Leipzig</a>", was said to have had a strong influence on the East German scene and is even called the unofficial beginning of German black metal.

The second wave of black metal began in the early-1990s and was spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene. During , a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music; this included <a href="Mayhem%20%28band%29">Mayhem</a>, <a href="Darkthrone">Darkthrone</a>, <a href="Burzum">Burzum</a>, <a href="Immortal%20%28band%29">Immortal</a>, <a href="Emperor%20%28band%29">Emperor</a>, <a href="Satyricon%20%28band%29">Satyricon</a>, <a href="Enslaved%20%28band%29">Enslaved</a>, <a href="Thorns%20%28band%29">Thorns</a>, <a href="Carpathian%20Forest">Carpathian Forest</a> and <a href="Gorgoroth%20%28band%29">Gorgoroth</a>. They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch of Stigma Diabolicum/Thorns and <a href="Euronymous">Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth</a> of Mayhem. Fenriz of Darkthrone described it as being "derived from Bathory" and noted that "those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s".

The wearing of <a href="corpse%20paint">corpse paint</a> became standard, and was a way for many black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the era. The scene also had an ideology and ethos. Artists were bitterly opposed to Christianity and presented themselves as misanthropic Devil worshippers who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil. They professed to be serious in their views and vowed to act on them. <a href="Ihsahn">Ihsahn</a> of Emperor said that they sought to "create fear among people" and "be in opposition to society". The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those who were "true" and attempting to expel all "<a href="poseur">poseur</a>s". Some members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murder, which eventually drew attention to it and led to a number of artists being imprisoned.

During May–June 1991, Euronymous of Mayhem opened an independent record shop named "Helvete" (<a href="Norwegian%20language">Norwegian</a> for "hell") in Oslo. It quickly became the focal point of Norway's emerging black metal scene and a meeting place for many of its musicians; especially the members of Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns. Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen, writer of the fanzine "Slayer", said that the opening of Helvete was "the creation of the whole Norwegian black metal scene". In its basement, Euronymous founded an <a href="independent%20record%20label">independent record label</a> named "<a href="Deathlike%20Silence%20Productions">Deathlike Silence Productions</a>". With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Euronymous's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels, who had previously shunned black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.

On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist <a href="Per%20%26quot%3BDead%26quot%3B%20Ohlin">Per Yngve Ohlin</a> (who called himself "Dead") committed suicide while alone in a house shared by the band. Fellow musicians described Dead as odd, introverted and depressed. Before going onstage he went to great lengths to make himself look like a corpse and would cut his arms while singing. Mayhem's drummer, <a href="Jan%20Axel%20Blomberg">Hellhammer</a>, said that Dead was the first to wear the distinctive corpse paint that became widespread in the scene. He was found with slit wrists and a <a href="shotgun">shotgun</a> wound to the head. Dead's suicide note apologized for firing the weapon indoors and ended: "Excuse all the blood". Before calling the police, Euronymous got a disposable camera and photographed the body, after re-arranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album, "<a href="Dawn%20of%20the%20Black%20Hearts">Dawn of the Black Hearts</a>".

Euronymous made necklaces with bits of Dead's skull and gave some to musicians he deemed worthy. Rumors also spread that he had made a stew with bits of his brain. Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's evil image and claimed Dead had killed himself because extreme metal had become trendy and commercialized. Mayhem bassist <a href="Necrobutcher">Jørn 'Necrobutcher' Stubberud</a> noted that "people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene".

Two other members of the early Norwegian scene would later commit suicide: <a href="Erik%20Br%C3%B8dreskift">Erik 'Grim' Brødreskift</a> (of Immortal, <a href="Borknagar">Borknagar</a>, Gorgoroth) in 1999 and Espen 'Storm' Andersen (of <a href="Strid%20%28band%29">Strid</a>) in 2001.

In 1992, members of the Norwegian black metal scene began a wave of arson attacks on Christian churches. By 1996, there had been at least 50 such attacks in Norway. Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. The first to be burnt down was Norway's <a href="Fantoft%20stave%20church">Fantoft stave church</a>. Police believe <a href="Varg%20Vikernes">Varg Vikernes</a> of Burzum was responsible. The cover of Burzum's EP "<a href="Aske%20%28album%29">Aske</a>" ("ashes") is a photograph of the destroyed church. In May 1994, Vikernes was found guilty for burning down <a href="Holmenkollen%20Chapel">Holmenkollen Chapel</a>, Skjold Church and <a href="Old%20%C3%85sane%20Church">Åsane Church</a>. To coincide with the release of Mayhem's "<a href="De%20Mysteriis%20Dom%20Sathanas">De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</a>", Vikernes and Euronymous had also allegedly plotted to bomb <a href="Nidaros%20Cathedral">Nidaros Cathedral</a>, which appears on the album cover. The musicians <a href="Faust%20%28musician%29">Faust</a>, <a href="Samoth">Samoth</a>, (both of Emperor) and <a href="J%C3%B8rn%20Inge%20Tunsberg">Jørn Inge Tunsberg</a> (of <a href="Hades%20Almighty">Hades Almighty</a>) were also convicted for church arsons. Members of the Swedish scene started to burn churches in 1993.

Those convicted for church burnings showed no remorse and described their actions as a symbolic "retaliation" against Christianity in Norway. Mayhem drummer Hellhammer said he had called for attacks on mosques and Hindu temples, on the basis that they were more foreign. Today, opinions on the church burnings differ within the black metal community. Many, such as Infernus and Gaahl of Gorgoroth, continue to praise the church burnings, with the latter saying "there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them". Others, such as Necrobutcher and Kjetil Manheim of Mayhem and <a href="Abbath">Abbath</a> of Immortal, see the church burnings as having been futile. Manheim claimed that many arsons were "just people trying to gain acceptance" within the black metal scene. <a href="Watain">Watain</a> vocalist Erik Danielsson respected the attacks, but said of those responsible: "the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course".

In early-1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes. On the night of 10 August 1993, Varg Vikernes (of Burzum) and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch (of Thorns) drove from Bergen to Euronymous's apartment in Oslo. When they arrived a confrontation began and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of either a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records or an attempt at outdoing a stabbing in Lillehammer the year before by Faust. Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an <a href="electroshock%20weapon">electroshock weapon</a>, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event. He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract that night and "tell him to fuck off", but that Euronymous panicked and attacked him first. He also claims that most of the cuts were from broken glass Euronymous had fallen on during the struggle. The self-defense story is doubted by Faust and other members of the scene.

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993, in Bergen. Many other members of the scene were taken in for questioning around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and for possession of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support". Vikernes smiled when his verdict was read and the picture was widely reprinted in the news media. Blackthorn was sentenced to eight years in prison for being an accomplice to the murder. That month saw the release of Mayhem's album "De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas", which featured Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar. Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes, but Hellhammer said: "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record". In 2003, Vikernes failed to return to Tønsberg prison after being given a short leave. He was re-arrested shortly after while driving a stolen car with various weapons. Vikernes was released on <a href="parole">parole</a> in 2009.

Black metal scenes also emerged on the European mainland during the early-1990s, inspired by the Norwegian scene or the older bands, or both. In <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, a scene was spearheaded by <a href="Graveland">Graveland</a> and <a href="Behemoth%20%28band%29">Behemoth</a>. In <a href="France">France</a>, a close-knit group of musicians known as <a href="Les%20L%C3%A9gions%20Noires">Les Légions Noires</a> emerged; this included artists such as <a href="M%C3%BCtiilation">Mütiilation</a>, <a href="Vlad%20Tepes%20%28band%29">Vlad Tepes</a>, Belketre and Torgeist. In <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, there were acts such as <a href="Ancient%20Rites">Ancient Rites</a> and <a href="Enthroned">Enthroned</a>. Bands such as <a href="Black%20Funeral">Black Funeral</a>, <a href="Grand%20Belial%27s%20Key">Grand Belial's Key</a> and <a href="Judas%20Iscariot%20%28band%29">Judas Iscariot</a> emerged during this time in the United States. <a href="Black%20Funeral">Black Funeral</a>, from <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, formed in 1993, was associated with <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a> and <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a>.

A notable black metal group in <a href="England">England</a> was <a href="Cradle%20of%20Filth">Cradle of Filth</a>, who released three demos in a black/death metal style with symphonic flourishes, followed by <a href="The%20Principle%20of%20Evil%20Made%20Flesh">a studio album</a>, which featured a then-unusual hybrid style of black and <a href="gothic%20metal">gothic metal</a>. The band then abandoned black metal for gothic metal, becoming one of the most successful <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a> bands to date. John Serba of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> commented that their first album "made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads' tongues, whether in praise of the band's brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its 'commercialization' of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage". Some black metal fans did not consider Cradle of Filth to be black metal. When asked if he considers Cradle of Filth a black metal band, vocalist <a href="Dani%20Filth">Dani Filth</a> said he considers them black metal in terms of philosophy and atmosphere, but not in other ways. Another English band called Necropolis never released any music, but "began a desecratory assault against churches and cemeteries in their area" and "almost caused Black Metal to be banned in Britain as a result". Dayal Patterson says successful acts like Cradle of Filth "provoked an even greater extremity [of negative opinion] from the underground" scene due to concerns about "<a href="selling%20out">selling out</a>".

The controversy surrounding <a href="Absurd%20%28band%29">Absurd</a> drew attention to the <a href="Germany">German</a> black metal scene. In 1993, the members murdered a boy from their school, Sandro Beyer. A photo of Beyer's gravestone is on the cover of one of their demos, "Thuringian Pagan Madness", along with pro-Nazi statements. It was recorded in prison and released in Poland by Graveland drummer Capricornus. The band's early music was influenced by <a href="Oi%21">Oi!</a> and <a href="Rock%20Against%20Communism">Rock Against Communism</a> (RAC), and described as being "more akin to '60s <a href="garage%20punk">garage punk</a> than some of the […] Black Metal of their contemporaries". <a href="Alexander%20von%20Meilenwald">Alexander von Meilenwald</a> from German band <a href="Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> considers <a href="Ungod%20%28band%29">Ungod</a>'s 1993 debut "Circle of the Seven Infernal Pacts", <a href="Desaster">Desaster</a>'s 1994 demo "Lost in the Ages", <a href="Tha-Norr">Tha-Norr</a>'s 1995 album "Wolfenzeitalter", <a href="Lunar%20Aurora">Lunar Aurora</a>'s 1996 debut "Weltengänger" and <a href="Katharsis%20%28band%29">Katharsis</a>'s 2000 debut "666" to be the most important recordings for the German scene. He said they were "not necessarily the best German releases, but they all kicked off something".

In the beginning of the second wave, the different scenes developed their own styles; as <a href="Alan%20Averill">Alan 'Nemtheanga' Averill</a> says, "you had the Greek sound and the Finnish sound, and the Norwegian sound". By the mid-1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands worldwide, and in 1998, "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" journalist <a href="Malcolm%20Dome">Malcolm Dome</a> said that "black metal as we know it in 1998 owes more to Norway and to Scandinavia than any other particular country". Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s and even full-symphony <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>s. By the late-1990s, the underground concluded that several of the Norwegian pioneers—like Emperor, Immortal, <a href="Dimmu%20Borgir">Dimmu Borgir</a>, <a href="Ancient%20%28band%29">Ancient</a>, <a href="The%20Kovenant">Covenant/The Kovenant</a>, and Satyricon—had commercialized or <a href="Selling%20out">sold out</a> to the mainstream and "big bastard labels". Dayal Patterson states that successful acts like Dimmu Borgir "provoked and even greater extremity [of negative opinion] from the underground" regarding the view that that these bands had "<a href="selling%20out">sold out</a>".

After Euronymous's death, "some bands went more towards the Viking metal and epic style, while some bands went deeper into the abyss". Since 1993, the Swedish scene had carried out church burnings, grave desecration and other violent acts. In 1995, <a href="Jon%20N%C3%B6dtveidt">Jon Nödtveidt</a> of <a href="Dissection%20%28band%29">Dissection</a> joined the <a href="Temple%20of%20the%20Black%20Light">Misanthropic Luciferian Order</a> (MLO). In 1997, he and another MLO member were arrested and charged with <a href="Keillers%20Park%20murder">shooting dead a 37-year-old man</a>. It was said he was killed "out of anger" because he had "harassed" the two men. Nödtveidt received a 10-year sentence. As the victim was a homosexual immigrant, Dissection was accused of being a Nazi band, but Nödtveidt denied this and dismissed racism and nationalism.

The Swedish band <a href="Shining%20%28Swedish%20band%29">Shining</a>, founded in 1996, began writing music almost exclusively about depression and suicide, musically inspired by Strid and by Burzum's albums "<a href="Hvis%20lyset%20tar%20oss">Hvis lyset tar oss</a>" and "<a href="Filosofem">Filosofem</a>". Vocalist Niklas Kvarforth wanted to "force feed" his listeners "with self-destructive and suicidal imagery and lyrics". In the beginning he used the term "suicidal black metal" for his music. However, he stopped using the term in 2001 because it had begun to be used by a slew of other bands, who he felt had misinterpreted his vision and were using the music as a kind of therapy rather than a weapon against the listener as Kvarforth intended. He said that he "wouldn't call Shining a black metal band" and called the "suicidal black metal" term a "foolish idea".
According to Erik Danielsson, when his band Watain formed in 1998 there were very few bands who took black metal as seriously as the early Norwegian scene had. A newer generation of Swedish Satanic bands like Watain and <a href="Ondskapt">Ondskapt</a>, supposedly inspired by <a href="Ofermod">Ofermod</a>, the new band of Nefandus member Belfagor, put this scene "into a new light". Kvarforth said, "It seems like people actually [got] afraid again". "The current Swedish black metal scene has a particularly ambitious and articulate understanding of <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a> and its validity to black metal. Many Swedish black metal bands, most notably Watain and Dissection, are [or were] affiliated with the Temple of the Black Light, or Misanthropic Luciferian Order […] a <a href="Theism">Theistic</a>, <a href="Gnosticism">Gnostic</a>, Satanic organization based in Sweden". Upon his release in 2004, Jon Nödtveidt restarted Dissection with new members who he felt were able to "stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's Satanic concept". He started calling Dissection "the sonic propaganda unit of the MLO" and released a third full-length album, "<a href="Reinkaos">Reinkaos</a>". The lyrics contain <a href="magical%20formula">magical formula</a>e from the "Liber Azerate" and are based on the organization's teachings. After the album's release and a few concerts, Nödtveidt said that he had "reached the limitations of music as a tool for expressing what I want to express, for myself and the handful of others that I care about" and disbanded Dissection before committing suicide.

A part of the underground scene adopted a <a href="Carl%20Jung">Jungian</a> interpretation of the church burnings and other acts of the early scene as the re-emergence of ancient archetypes, which Kadmon of <a href="Allerseelen">Allerseelen</a> and the authors of "<a href="Lords%20of%20Chaos%20%28book%29">Lords of Chaos</a>" had implied in their writings. They mixed this interpretation with Paganism and Nationalism. Varg Vikernes was seen as "an ideological messiah" by some, although Vikernes had disassociated himself from black metal and his neo-Nazism had nothing to do with that subculture. This led to the rise of <a href="National%20Socialist%20black%20metal">National Socialist black metal</a> (NSBM), which Hendrik Möbus of <a href="Absurd%20%28band%29">Absurd</a> calls "the logical conclusion" of the Norwegian black metal "movement". Other parts of the scene oppose NSBM as it is "indelibly linked with Asá Trŭ and opposed to Satanism", or look upon Nazism "with vague skepticism and indifference". Members of the NSBM scene, among others, see the Norwegian bands as <a href="poseur">poseur</a>s whose "ideology is cheap", although they still respect Vikernes and Burzum, whom Grand Belial's Key vocalist Richard Mills called "the only Norwegian band that remains unapologetic and literally convicted of his beliefs".

In France, besides Les Légions Noires (The Black Legions), a NSBM scene arose. Members of French band Funeral desecrated a grave in <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> in June 1996, and a 19-year-old black metal fan stabbed a priest to death in <a href="Mulhouse">Mulhouse</a> on Christmas Eve 1996. According to MkM of <a href="Antaeus%20%28band%29">Antaeus</a>, the early French scene "was quite easy to divide: either you were NSBM and you had the support from zine and the audience, or you were part of the black legions and you had that 'cult' aura". Many French bands, like <a href="Deathspell%20Omega">Deathspell Omega</a> and Aosoth, have an avantgarde approach and a disharmonic sound that is representative of that scene.

The early American black metal bands remained underground. Some of them—like <a href="Grand%20Belial%27s%20Key">Grand Belial's Key</a> and <a href="Judas%20Iscariot%20%28band%29">Judas Iscariot</a>—joined an international NSBM organization called the Pagan Front, although Judas Iscariot sole member <a href="Andrew%20Harris%20%28musician%29">Akhenaten</a> left the organization. Other bands like <a href="Averse%20Sefira">Averse Sefira</a> never had any link with Nazism. The US bands have no common style. Many were musically inspired by Burzum but did not necessarily adopt Vikernes's ideas. Profanatica's music is close to death metal, while Demoncy were accused of ripping off Gorgoroth riffs. There also emerged bands like <a href="Xasthur">Xasthur</a> and <a href="Leviathan%20%28band%29">Leviathan</a> (whose music is inspired by Burzum and whose lyrics focus on topics such as depression and suicide), <a href="Nachtmystium">Nachtmystium</a>, <a href="Krallice">Krallice</a>, <a href="Wolves%20in%20the%20Throne%20Room">Wolves in the Throne Room</a> (a band linked to the <a href="crust%20punk">crust punk</a> scene and the <a href="environmental%20movement">environmental movement</a>), and <a href="Liturgy%20%28band%29">Liturgy</a> (whose frontman Hunter Hunt-Hendrix wants to replace traditional black metal's "death and atrophy" with "life and hypertrophy"). These bands eschew black metal's traditional lyrical content for "something more <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Whitman</a>-esque" and have been rejected by some traditional black-metallers for their ideologies and the <a href="post-rock">post-rock</a> and <a href="shoegazing">shoegazing</a> influences some of them have adopted.

In Australia, a scene led by bands like <a href="Destr%C3%B6yer%20666">Deströyer 666</a>, <a href="Vomitor">Vomitor</a>, <a href="Hobbs%27%20Angel%20of%20Death">Hobbs' Angel of Death</a>, <a href="Nocturnal%20Graves">Nocturnal Graves</a> and <a href="Gospel%20of%20the%20Horns">Gospel of the Horns</a> arose. This scene's typical style is a mixture of old school black metal and raw thrash metal influenced by old Celtic Frost, Bathory, Venom and Sodom but also with its own elements.

<a href="Melechesh">Melechesh</a> was formed in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in 1993, "the first overtly anti-Christian band to exist in one of the holiest cities in the world". Melechesh began as a straightforward black metal act with their first foray into <a href="folk%20metal">folk metal</a> occurring on their 1996 EP "<a href="The%20Siege%20of%20Lachish">The Siege of Lachish</a>". Their subsequent albums straddled black, death, and thrash metal. Another band, <a href="Arallu">Arallu</a>, was formed in the late-1990s and has relationships with Melechesh and Salem. Melechesh and Arallu perform a style they call "Mesopotamian Black Metal", a blend of black metal and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>n folk music.

Since the 2000s, a number of <a href="Criticism%20of%20Islam">anti-Islamic</a> and <a href="Antireligion">anti-religious</a> black metal bands—whose members come from Muslim backgrounds—have emerged in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. Janaza, believed to be <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>'s first female black metal artist, released the demo "Burning Quran Ceremony" in 2010. Its frontwoman, Anahita, claimed her parents and brother were killed by a <a href="suicide%20bomb">suicide bomb</a> during the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>. Another Iraqi band, Seeds of Iblis, released their debut EP "Jihad Against Islam" in 2011 through French label Legion of Death. These bands, along with Tadnees (from <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>), False Allah (from <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>) and Mosque of Satan (from <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>), style themselves as the "Arabic Anti-Islamic Legion". Photos purported to be band members of Janaza and Seeds of Iblis were found to be of people from other bands, leading metal news website Metalluminati to suggest the bands may be a hoax. Another Lebanese band, <a href="Ayat%20%28band%29">Ayat</a>, drew much attention with their debut album "Six Years of Dormant Hatred", released through North American label Moribund Records in 2008. Some European bands have also begun expressing anti-Islamic views, most notably the Norwegian band <a href="Taake">Taake</a>.

Regarding the sound of black metal, there are two conflicting groups within the genre: "those that stay true to the genre's roots, and those that introduce progressive elements". The former believe that the music should always be <a href="Minimalism">minimalist</a> – performed only with the standard guitar-bass-drums setup and recorded in a <a href="low%20fidelity">low fidelity</a> style. One supporter of this train of thought is <a href="Blake%20Judd">Blake Judd</a> of <a href="Nachtmystium">Nachtmystium</a>, who has rejected labeling his band black metal for its departure from the genre's typical sound. Snorre Ruch of <a href="Thorns%20%28band%29">Thorns</a>, on the other hand, has said that modern black metal is "too narrow" and believes that this was "not the idea at the beginning".

Since the 1990s, different styles of black metal have emerged and some have melded Norwegian-style black metal with other genres.


Unlike other kinds of metal, black metal is associated with an ideology and ethos. It is fiercely <a href="anti-Christian%20sentiment">opposed to Christianity</a> and the other main <a href="Organized%20religion">institutional religions</a>, <a href="Criticism%20of%20Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="Criticism%20of%20Judaism">Judaism</a>. Many black metal bands are <a href="Satanism">Satanists</a> and see Satanism as a key part of black metal. Others advocate ethnic Paganism, "often coupled with nationalism", although the early Pagan bands did not call themselves 'black metal'.

Black metal tends to be <a href="Misanthropy">misanthropic</a> and hostile to modern society. It is "a reaction against the mundanity, insincerity and emotional emptiness that participants feel is intrinsic to modern secular culture". The black metal scene tends to oppose <a href="political%20correctness">political correctness</a>, <a href="humanitarianism">humanitarianism</a>, <a href="consumerism">consumerism</a>, <a href="globalization">globalization</a> and homogeneity. Aaron Weaver from <a href="Wolves%20in%20the%20Throne%20Room">Wolves in the Throne Room</a> said: "black metal is an artistic movement that is critiquing modernity on a fundamental level, saying that the modern world view is missing something". As part of this, black metal glorifies nature and has a fascination with the distant past. It has been likened to <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> and there is an undercurrent of <a href="romantic%20nationalism">romantic nationalism</a> in the genre. <a href="Sam%20Dunn">Sam Dunn</a> noted that "unlike any other heavy metal scene, the culture and the place is incorporated into the music and imagery". <a href="Individualism">Individualism</a> is also an important part of black metal, with <a href="Fenriz">Fenriz</a> of Darkthrone describing black metal as "individualism above all". Unlike other kinds of metal, black metal has numerous one-man bands. However, followers of Euronymous tended to be anti-individualistic, and it has been noted that "Black Metal is characterized by a conflict between radical individualism and group identity and by an attempt to accept both polarities simultaneously".

In his master's thesis, Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that some artists can be seen as <a href="Transcendentalism">transcendentalists</a>. Dissatisfied with a "world that they feel is devoid of spiritual and cultural significance", they try to leave or "transcend" their "mundane physical forms" and become one with the divine. This is done through their concerts, which he describes as "musical rituals" that involve self-mortification and taking on an alternative, "spiritual persona" (for example by the wearing of costume and face paint).

Black metal was originally a term for extreme metal bands with Satanic lyrics and imagery. However, most of the 'first wave' bands (including Venom, who coined the term 'black metal') were not Satanists and rather used Satanic themes or artwork to provoke controversy or gain attention. One of the few exceptions was <a href="Mercyful%20Fate">Mercyful Fate</a> singer and <a href="Church%20of%20Satan">Church of Satan</a> member <a href="King%20Diamond">King Diamond</a>, whom <a href="Michael%20Moynihan%20%28journalist%29">Michael Moynihan</a> calls "one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a <a href="poseur">poseur</a> using a devilish image for <a href="shock%20value">shock value</a>".

In the early-1990s, many Norwegian black-metallers presented themselves as genuine Devil worshippers. Mayhem's Euronymous was the key figure behind this. They attacked the Church of Satan for its "freedom and life-loving" views; the <a href="theistic%20Satanism">theistic Satanism</a> they espoused was an inversion of Christianity. Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that they "transform[ed] Venom's quasi-Satanic stage theatrics into a form of cultural expression unique from other forms of metal or Satanism" and "abandoned the mundane identities and ambitions of other forms of metal in favor of religious and ideological fanaticism". Some prominent scene members—such as Euronymous and Faust—stated that only bands who are Satanists can be called 'black metal'. Bands with a Norwegian style, but without Satanic lyrics, tended to use other names for their music. This view is still held by many artists – such as <a href="Infernus">Infernus</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Rost%C3%A9n">Arioch</a>, <a href="Nornagest">Nornagest</a> and Erik Danielsson. Some bands, like the reformed Dissection and Watain, insist that all members must be of the same Satanic belief, whereas Michael Ford of <a href="Black%20Funeral">Black Funeral</a> and MkM of <a href="Antaeus%20%28band%29">Antaeus</a> believe black metal must be Satanic but not all band members need to be Satanists. Others—such as <a href="Jan%20Axel%20Blomberg">Jan Axel Blomberg</a>, <a href="Sigurd%20Wongraven">Sigurd Wongraven</a> and Eric Horner—believe that black metal does not need to be Satanic. An article in Metalion's "Slayer" fanzine attacked musicians that "care more about their guitars than the actual essence onto which the whole concept was and is based upon", and insisted that "the music itself doesn't come as the first priority". Bands with a similar style but with Pagan lyrics tend to be referred to as 'Pagan Metal' by many 'purist' black-metallers.

Others shun Satanism, seeing it as "Judeo-Christian" in origin, and regard Satanists as perpetuating the "Judeo-Christian" worldview. <a href="Quorthon">Quorthon</a> of Bathory said he used 'Satan' to provoke and attack Christianity. However, with his <a href="Under%20the%20Sign%20of%20the%20Black%20Mark">third</a> and <a href="Blood%20Fire%20Death">fourth</a> albums he began "attacking Christianity from a different angle", realizing that Satanism is a "Christian product". Nevertheless, some artists use Satan as a symbol or metaphor for their beliefs. This includes <a href="LaVeyan%20Satanism">LaVeyan Satanists</a> (who are atheist) and others. Vocalist Gaahl, who considers himself a Norse Shaman, said: "We use the word 'Satanist' because it is Christian world and we have to speak their language ... When I use the word 'Satan', it means the natural order, the will of a man, the will to grow, the will to become the superman". Varg Vikernes called himself a Satanist in early interviews but "now downplays his former interest in Satanism", saying he was using Satan as a symbol for Odin as the 'adversary' of the Christian God. He saw Satanism as "an introduction to more indigenous heathen beliefs". Despite the high amount of Satanism in black metal, some black metal bands such as <a href="Carach%20Angren">Carach Angren</a>, <a href="Immortal%20%28band%29">Immortal</a> and <a href="Enslaved%20%28band%29">Enslaved</a> do not have Satanic lyrics.

National Socialist black metal (NSBM) is a name for black metal by artists who promote <a href="neo-Nazism">neo-Nazi</a> or similar beliefs through their lyrics and imagery. They typically meld neo-Nazi ideology with ethnic European paganism, but a few meld these beliefs with Satanism or occultism. Some commentators see this ideology as a natural development of the black metal worldview. Members of the early Norwegian scene flirted with neo-Nazism, but this was partly an attempt to provoke. Varg Vikernes—who now refers to his ideology as '<a href="Odalism">Odalism</a>'—is credited with popularizing such views within the scene. NSBM emerged in the mid-1990s and was spearheaded by artists such as <a href="Absurd%20%28band%29">Absurd</a> (from Germany), <a href="Graveland">Graveland</a>, <a href="Infernum">Infernum</a> and Veles (from Poland), <a href="Nokturnal%20Mortum">Nokturnal Mortum</a> and <a href="Hate%20Forest">Hate Forest</a> (from Ukraine), Branikald (from Russia) and <a href="Grand%20Belial%27s%20Key">Grand Belial's Key</a> (from the US). It is particularly strong in the former <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. There are dozens of NSBM bands, several independent record labels and zines devoted to NSBM, and festivals associated with it. Some black metal bands have been wrongly labeled as NSBM for exploring Nazi Germany in their lyrics or referencing it for shock value.

Although there is an undercurrent of 'right-wing' nationalism in black metal, NSBM artists are a small minority within the genre. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians. NSBM has been criticized by some prominent and influential black metal artists – including <a href="Jon%20N%C3%B6dtveidt">Jon Nödtveidt</a>, <a href="Tormentor%20%28musician%29">Tormentor</a>, <a href="King%20ov%20Hell">King ov Hell</a>, <a href="Infernus">Infernus</a>, <a href="Dark%20Funeral">Dark Funeral</a>, <a href="Richard%20Lederer%20%28musician%29">Richard Lederer</a>, Michael Ford, and <a href="Arkhon%20Infaustus">Arkhon Infaustus</a>. Some liken Nazism to Christianity in that it is <a href="Authoritarianism">authoritarian</a>, <a href="Collectivism">collectivist</a>, and a "<a href="herd%20mentality">herd mentality</a>". Olson writes that the shunning of Nazism by some black-metallers "has nothing to do with notions of a 'universal humanity' or a rejection of hate" but that Nazism is shunned "because its hatred is too specific and exclusive".

A few artists have adopted the typical black metal sound and aesthetic, but promote Christianity through their lyrics and imagery. These artists have been labelled either "unblack metal" or "Christian black metal". The first unblack metal record, "<a href="Hellig%20Usvart">Hellig Usvart</a>" (1994) by Australian artist <a href="Horde%20%28band%29">Horde</a>, was a provocative parody of Norwegian black metal. It sparked controversy, and death threats were issued against Horde. Norwegian Christian band <a href="Antestor">Antestor</a> adopted a black metal style in the late-1990s.

Many in the black metal scene see "Christian black metal" as an oxymoron and believe that black metal cannot be Christian. In fact, the early unblack metal groups Horde and Antestor refused to call their music "black metal" because they did not share its ethos. Horde called its music "holy unblack metal" and Antestor preferred the term "sorrow metal". Horde member <a href="Jayson%20Sherlock">Jayson Sherlock</a> later said "I will never understand why Christians think they can play Black Metal. I really don't think they understand what true Black Metal is". However, many current unblack metal bands, such as <a href="Crimson%20Moonlight">Crimson Moonlight</a>, feel that black metal has changed from an ideological movement to a purely musical genre, and thus call their music 'black metal'.

As a reaction to NSBM, a small number of "Red and Anarchist black metal" (RABM) artists emerged. They espouse <a href="Left-wing%20politics">left-wing</a> ideologies such as <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> or <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>/<a href="green%20anarchism">green anarchism</a>, and tend to mix <a href="crust%20punk">crust punk</a> with black metal. Artists labelled RABM include <a href="Iskra%20%28band%29">Iskra</a>, Panopticon, Skagos, Storm of Sedition, Not A Cost, Black Kronstadt, and Vidargangr. Also, bands like Burzum, <a href="Shining%20%28Swedish%20band%29">Shining</a>, <a href="Xasthur">Xasthur</a>, <a href="Silencer%20%28band%29">Silencer</a>, <a href="Make%20a%20Change...%20Kill%20Yourself">Make a Change... Kill Yourself</a> and <a href="I%20Shalt%20Become">I Shalt Become</a> started creating lyrics about, sometimes even supporting, suicide and self-harm, with their music being labelled as Depressive suicidal black metal or suicidal black metal, often referred to by the acronyms DSBM or SBM.

In 1994 the company became Chaos Studios, then Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. after being acquired by distributor <a href="Davidson%20%26amp%3B%20Associates">Davidson & Associates</a>.

Shortly thereafter, Blizzard released "". Blizzard created several other video games, including "<a href="Warcraft">Warcraft</a>" sequels, the "<a href="Diablo%20%28series%29">Diablo</a>" series, the "<a href="StarCraft">StarCraft</a>" series, and in 2004 the <a href="massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a> "<a href="World%20of%20Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>".

On July 9, 2008, <a href="Activision">Activision</a> merged with <a href="Vivendi%20Games">Vivendi Games</a>, culminating in the inclusion of the Blizzard brand name in the title of the resulting holding company. On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from majority owner Vivendi. As a result, Activision Blizzard became a completely independent company.

Blizzard Entertainment hosts conventions for fans to meet and to promote their games: the <a href="BlizzCon">BlizzCon</a> in California, United States, and the <a href="Blizzard%20Worldwide%20Invitational">Blizzard Worldwide Invitational</a> in other countries, including <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> and <a href="France">France</a>. 

Blizzard Entertainment was founded by <a href="Michael%20Morhaime">Michael Morhaime</a>, Allen Adham, and Frank Pearce as Silicon & Synapse on February 8, 1991, a year after all three had received their <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a>s from UCLA. To found the company, each of them contributed about $10,000, which in the case of Morhaime, he got as part of a interest-free loan from his grandmother. During the first two years, the company focused on creating game <a href="porting">ports</a> for other studios. Ports include titles such as "<a href="J.R.R.%20Tolkien%27s%20The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%2C%20Vol.%20I%20%281990%20video%20game%29">J.R.R.

In 1993, the company developed games such as "<a href="Rock%20n%27%20Roll%20Racing">Rock n' Roll Racing</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lost%20Vikings">The Lost Vikings</a>" (published by <a href="Interplay%20Entertainment">Interplay Productions</a>).

In early 1994, they were acquired by distributor <a href="Davidson%20%26amp%3B%20Associates">Davidson & Associates</a> for $6.75 million ($ million today). That same year the company briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios, before finally settling on Blizzard Entertainment (after it was discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed). Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit "".

Blizzard has changed hands several times since then. Davidson was acquired along with <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra On-Line</a> by a company called <a href="CUC%20International">CUC International</a> in 1996. CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called <a href="HFS%20Corporation">HFS Corporation</a> to form <a href="Cendant">Cendant</a> in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger. Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, Sierra On-line (which included Blizzard) to French publisher <a href="Havas">Havas</a> in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by <a href="Vivendi">Vivendi</a>. Blizzard was part of the <a href="Vivendi%20Games">Vivendi Games</a> group of Vivendi. In July 2008 Vivendi Games merged with <a href="Activision">Activision</a>, using Blizzard's name in the resulting company, <a href="Activision%20Blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>.

In 1996, Blizzard acquired Condor Games, which had been working on the game "<a href="Diablo%20%28video%20game%29">Diablo</a>" for Blizzard at the time. Condor was renamed <a href="Blizzard%20North">Blizzard North</a>, and has since developed the games "<a href="Diablo%20%28video%20game%29">Diablo</a>", "<a href="Diablo%20II">Diablo II</a>", and its expansion pack "". Blizzard North was located in <a href="San%20Mateo%2C%20California">San Mateo, California</a>. The company originated in <a href="Redwood%20City%2C%20California">Redwood City, California</a>.

Blizzard launched their online gaming service <a href="Battle.net">Battle.net</a> in January 1997 with the release of their <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing game</a> "Diablo". In 2002, Blizzard was able to reacquire rights for three of its earlier Silicon & Synapse titles, "<a href="The%20Lost%20Vikings">The Lost Vikings</a>", "<a href="Rock%20n%27%20Roll%20Racing">Rock n' Roll Racing</a>" and "<a href="Blackthorne">Blackthorne</a>", from <a href="Interplay%20Entertainment">Interplay Entertainment</a> and re-release them for <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, a handheld console. In 2004, Blizzard opened European offices in the Paris suburb of <a href="V%C3%A9lizy-Villacoublay">Vélizy</a>, Yvelines, France. On May 16, 2005, Blizzard announced the <a href="Takeover">acquisition</a> of <a href="Swingin%27%20Ape%20Studios">Swingin' Ape Studios</a>, a <a href="video%20game%20developer">video game developer</a> which had been developing "". The company was then merged into Blizzard's other teams after "StarCraft: Ghost" was "postponed indefinitely". On August 1, 2005, Blizzard announced the <a href="Consolidation%20%28business%29">consolidation</a> of Blizzard North into the headquarters at 131 Theory in <a href="UC%20Irvine">UC Irvine</a>'s University Research Park in <a href="Irvine%2C%20California">Irvine, California</a>. In 2007, Blizzard moved their headquarters to 16215 Alton Parkway in Irvine, California.

On November 23, 2004, Blizzard released "<a href="World%20of%20Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>", a <a href="massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a>. "World of Warcraft" is the fourth released game set in the fantasy <a href="Warcraft">"Warcraft" universe</a>, which was first introduced by "" in 1994. Blizzard announced "World of Warcraft" on September 2, 2001. The game was released on November 23, 2004, on the 10th anniversary of the "Warcraft" <a href="media%20franchise">franchise</a>.

The first expansion set of the game, "", was released on January 16, 2007. The second expansion set, "", was released on November 13, 2008. The third expansion set, "" was released on December 7, 2010. "" and "", were released respectively on September 25, 2012 and November 13, 2014. The most recent expansion, , was released on August 30, 2016.

Having peaked at 12 million monthly subscriptions in 2010, "World of Warcraft" subscriptions sunk to 6.8 million in 2014, the lowest number since the end of 2006, prior to "" expansion. However, "World of Warcraft" is still the world's most-subscribed MMORPG, and holds the <a href="Guinness%20World%20Record">Guinness World Record</a> for the most popular MMORPG by subscribers. In April 2008, "World of Warcraft" was estimated to hold 62 percent of the MMORPG subscription market. In 2008, Blizzard was honored at the 59th Annual <a href="Technology%20%26amp%3B%20Engineering%20Emmy%20Award">Technology & Engineering Emmy Award</a>s for the creation of "World of Warcraft". <a href="Mike%20Morhaime">Mike Morhaime</a> accepted the award.

In 2012 Blizzard had 4,700 employees, with offices across 11 cities including <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, and countries around the globe. As of June 2015, the company's headquarters in Irvine, California had 2,622 employees.

Blizzard announced in September 2017 that it had acquired a studio at <a href="The%20Burbank%20Studios">The Burbank Studios</a> in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>, that will convert into the Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, featuring multiple sound stages, control rooms, practice facilities, a merchandise store, and seating for up to 450 spectators. Blizzard will use the venue to support its various eSports, starting with the Overwatch Contenders Season One in October 2017. Blizzard presently plans to use this only for their events but may allow other eSports leagues to use it in the future.



These games were ported while the company was known as Silicon & Synapse.
Currently, Blizzard has four main franchises: "<a href="Warcraft">Warcraft</a>", "<a href="Diablo%20%28series%29">Diablo</a>", "<a href="StarCraft">StarCraft</a>", and "<a href="Overwatch%20%28video%20game%29">Overwatch</a>". Each franchise is supported by other media based around its intellectual property such as novels, collectible card games, comics and video shorts. Blizzard Entertainment announced in 2006 that they would be producing a <a href="Warcraft%20%28film%29">"Warcraft" live-action movie</a>. The movie was directed by <a href="Duncan%20Jones">Duncan Jones</a>, financed and produced by <a href="Legendary%20Pictures">Legendary Pictures</a>, <a href="Atlas%20Entertainment">Atlas Entertainment</a> and <a href="Film4%20Productions">Film4</a>, and distributed by <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>. It was released in June 2016.

Notable unreleased titles include "", which was cancelled on May 22, 1998, "Shattered Nations", and "", which was "Postponed indefinitely" on March 24, 2006 after being in <a href="development%20hell">development hell</a> for much of its lifespan. After seven years of development, Blizzard revealed the cancellation of an unannounced MMO codenamed "<a href="Titan%20%28Blizzard%20Entertainment%20project%29">"Titan"</a>" on September 23, 2014. The company also has a history of declining to set release dates, choosing to instead take as much time as needed, generally saying a given product is "done when it's done."

"Pax Imperia II" was originally announced as a title to be published by Blizzard. Blizzard eventually dropped "Pax Imperia II", though, when it decided it might be in conflict with their other space strategy project, which became known as "<a href="StarCraft">StarCraft</a>". THQ eventually contracted with Heliotrope and released the game in 1997 as "".

Blizzard has made use of a special form of software known as the 'Warden Client'. The Warden client is known to be used with Blizzard's online games such as "Diablo" and "World of Warcraft", and the Terms of Service contain a clause consenting to the Warden software's RAM scans while a Blizzard game is running.

The Warden client scans a small portion of the <a href="code%20segment">code segment</a> of running processes in order to determine whether any third-party programs are running. The goal of this is to detect and address players who may be attempting to run unsigned code or third party programs in the game. This determination of third party programs is made by <a href="Hash%20function">hashing</a> the scanned <a href="String%20%28computer%20science%29">strings</a> and comparing the hashed value to a list of hashes assumed to correspond to banned third party programs. The Warden's reliability in correctly discerning legitimate versus illegitimate actions was called into question when a large scale incident happened. This incident banned many Linux users after an update to Warden caused it to incorrectly detect <a href="Cedega%20%28software%29">Cedega</a> as a cheat program. Blizzard issued a statement claiming they had correctly identified and restored all accounts and credited them with 20 days play. Warden scans all processes running on a computer, not just the game, and could possibly run across what would be considered private information and other <a href="personally%20identifiable%20information">personally identifiable information</a>. It is because of these peripheral scans that Warden has been accused of being <a href="spyware">spyware</a> and has run afoul of controversy among <a href="privacy">privacy</a> advocates.

Blizzard released its revamped Battle.net service in 2009. This service allows people who have purchased Blizzard products ("<a href="StarCraft%20%28video%20game%29">StarCraft</a>", "", "<a href="Diablo%20II">Diablo II</a>", and "", as well as their expansions) to download digital copies of games they have purchased, without needing any physical media.

On November 11, 2009, Blizzard required all "World of Warcraft" accounts to switch over to Battle.net accounts. This transition means that all current Blizzard titles can be accessed, downloaded, and played with a singular Battle.net login.

Battle.net 2.0 is the platform for matchmaking service for Blizzard games, which offers players a host of additional features. Players are able to track their friend's achievements, view match history, avatars, etc. Players are able to unlock a wide range of achievements (rewards for completing game content) for Blizzard games.

The service allows players to chat simultaneously with players from other Blizzard games. For example, players no longer need to create multiple user names or accounts for most Blizzard products. To enable cross game communication, players need to become either Battletag or Real ID friends.

On July 6, 2010, Blizzard announced that they were changing the way their forums worked to require that users identify themselves with their real name. The reaction from the community was overwhelmingly negative with multiple game magazines calling the change "foolhardy" and an "epic fail". It resulted in a significant user response on the Blizzard forums, including one thread on the issue reaching over 11,000 replies. This included personal details of a Blizzard employee who gave his real name "to show it wasn't a big deal". Shortly after revealing his real name, forum users posted personal information including his phone number, picture, age, and home address.

Some technology media outlets suggested that displaying real names through Real ID is a good idea and would benefit both Battle.net and the Blizzard community. But others were worried that Blizzard were opening their fans up to real-life dangers such as stalking, harassment, and employment issues, since a simple Internet search by someone's employer can reveal their online activities.

Blizzard initially responded to some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts, that parents could set up the system so that minors cannot post, and that posting to the forums is optional. However, due to the huge negative response, Blizzard President <a href="Michael%20Morhaime">Michael Morhaime</a> issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on Blizzard's forums for the time being.

Apart from the negative side effects of Real ID relating to privacy, the addition boasts features for current Blizzard titles. For instance, real names for friends, cross-realm and cross-game chat, rich presence and broadcasts are included with the Real ID system.

In 1998, Donald P. Driscoll, an <a href="Albany%2C%20California">Albany</a>, California attorney filed a suit on behalf of Intervention, Inc., a California consumer group against Blizzard Entertainment for "unlawful business practices" for the action of collecting data from a user's computer without their permission.

On June 20, 2003, Blizzard issued a <a href="cease%20and%20desist">cease and desist</a> letter to the developers of an <a href="open%20source">open source</a> clone of the Warcraft engine called "FreeCraft", claiming <a href="trademark%20infringement">trademark infringement</a>. This hobby project had the same gameplay and characters as "Warcraft II", but came with different graphics and music.

As well as a similar name, "FreeCraft" enabled gamers to use "Warcraft II" graphics, provided they had the "Warcraft II" CD. The programmers of the clone shut down their site without challenge. Soon after that the developers regrouped to continue the work by the name of "<a href="Stratagus">Stratagus</a>".

On December 5, 2008, Blizzard issued a <a href="cease%20and%20desist">cease and desist</a> letter to many administrators of high population "<a href="World%20of%20Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>" private servers (essentially slightly altered hosting servers of the actual "World of Warcraft" game, that players do not have to pay for). Blizzard used the <a href="Digital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> to influence many private servers to fully shut down and cease to exist.

On August 14, 2007, <a href="Beijing%20University">Beijing University</a> <a href="Founder%20Electronics">Founder Electronics</a> Co., Ltd. sued Blizzard Entertainment Limited for copyright infringement claiming 100 million <a href="Chinese%20yuan">yuan</a> in damages. The lawsuit alleged the Chinese edition of "World of Warcraft" reproduced a number of Chinese typefaces made by Founder Electronics without permission.

On July 14, 2008, the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Arizona">United States District Court for the District of Arizona</a> ruled on the case "<a href="MDY%20Industries%2C%20LLC%20v.%20Blizzard%20Entertainment%2C%20Inc.">MDY Industries, LLC v. Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.</a>". The Court found that MDY was liable for <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a> since users of its <a href="glider%20%28bot%29">Glider</a> bot program were breaking the End User License Agreement and Terms of Use for "<a href="World%20of%20Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>". MDY Industries appealed the judgment of the district court, and a judgment was delivered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 14, 2010, in which the summary judgment against MDY for contributory copyright infringement was reversed. Nevertheless, they ruled that the bot violated the <a href="Digital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act">DMCA</a> and the case was sent back to the district court for review in light of this decision.

Shortly after <a href="Valve%20Corporation">Valve Corporation</a> filed its trademark for "Dota" to secure the franchising rights for "<a href="Dota%202">Dota 2</a>", DotA-Allstars, LLC, run by former contributors to the games's predecessor, "<a href="Defense%20of%20the%20Ancients">Defense of the Ancients</a>", filed an opposing trademark in August 2010. DotA All-Stars, LLC was sold to Blizzard Entertainment in 2011. After the opposition was overruled in Valve's favor, Blizzard filed an opposition against Valve in November 2011, citing their license agreement with developers, as well as their ownership of DotA-Allstars, LLC. Blizzard conceded their case in May 2012, however, giving Valve undisputed commercial rights to "Dota", while Blizzard would rename their "StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm" mod ""Blizzard All-Stars"", which would become the stand-alone game, "<a href="Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm">Heroes of the Storm</a>".

Over the years, some former Blizzard employees have moved on and established gaming companies of their own:

Robert Bellarmine

<a href="Saint">Saint</a> Robert Bellarmine, <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">S.J.</a> (; 4 October 1542 – 17 September 1621) was an <a href="Italy">Italian</a> <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> and a <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">Cardinal</a> of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. He was one of the most important figures in the <a href="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a>.

He was a professor of theology and later rector of the <a href="Roman%20College">Roman College</a>, and in 1602 became archbishop of Capua. Bellarmine supported the reform decrees of the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a>.

He was <a href="canonization">canonized</a> in 1930 and named a <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctor of the Church</a>. Bellarmine is also widely remembered for his role in the <a href="Giordano%20Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a> affair and the <a href="Galileo%20affair">Galileo affair</a>.

Bellarmine was born at <a href="Montepulciano">Montepulciano</a>, the son of noble, albeit impoverished, parents, Vincenzo Bellarmino and his wife Cinzia Cervini, who was the sister of <a href="Pope%20Marcellus%20II">Pope Marcellus II</a>. As a boy he knew <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> by heart and composed a number of poems in <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. One of his hymns, on <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a>, is included in the <a href="Roman%20Breviary">Roman Breviary</a>.

He entered the Roman Jesuit novitiate in 1560, remaining in Rome three years. He then went to a Jesuit house at <a href="Mondov%C3%AC">Mondovì</a>, in <a href="Piedmont%20%28Italy%29">Piedmont</a>, where he learned <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>. While at Mondovì, he came to the attention of <a href="Francis%20Adorno">Francesco Adorno</a>, the local Jesuit <a href="Provincial%20Superior">Provincial Superior</a>, who sent him to the <a href="University%20of%20Padua">University of Padua</a>.

Bellarmine's systematic studies of <a href="theology">theology</a> began at Padua in 1567 and 1568, where his teachers were adherents of <a href="Thomism">Thomism</a>. In 1569 he was sent to finish his studies at the <a href="Old%20University%20of%20Leuven">University of Leuven</a> in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>. There he was ordained, and obtained a reputation both as a professor and a preacher. He was the first Jesuit to teach at the university, where the subject of his course was the "<a href="Summa%20Theologica">Summa Theologica</a>" of <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>. His residency in Leuven lasted seven years. In poor health, in 1576 he made a journey to Italy. Here he remained, commissioned by <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XIII">Pope Gregory XIII</a> to lecture on <a href="polemical%20theology">polemical theology</a> in the new <a href="Roman%20College">Roman College</a>, now known as the <a href="Pontifical%20Gregorian%20University">Pontifical Gregorian University</a>. Later, he would promote the cause of the beatification of <a href="Aloysius%20Gonzaga">Aloysius Gonzaga</a>, who had been a student at the college during Bellarmine's tenure.

Until 1589, Bellarmine was occupied as professor of theology. After the murder in that year of <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20France">Henry III of France</a>, <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20V">Pope Sixtus V</a> sent <a href="Enrico%20Caetani">Enrico Caetani</a> as <a href="Papal%20legate">legate</a> to Paris to negotiate with the <a href="Catholic%20League%20%28French%29">Catholic League of France</a>, and chose Bellarmine to accompany him as theologian. He was in the city during its siege by <a href="Henry%20of%20Navarre">Henry of Navarre</a>.

The next pope, <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VIII">Clement VIII</a>, said of him, "the Church of God had not his equal in learning". Bellarmine was made rector of the <a href="Roman%20College">Roman College</a> in 1592, examiner of <a href="bishop">bishop</a>s in 1598, and cardinal in 1599. Immediately after his appointment as Cardinal, Pope Clement made him a <a href="Inquisition">Cardinal Inquisitor</a>, in which capacity he served as one of the judges at the trial of <a href="Giordano%20Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a>, and concurred in the decision which condemned Bruno to be <a href="burned%20at%20the%20stake">burned at the stake</a> as a <a href="heretic">heretic</a>.

Upon the death of Pope Sixtus V in 1590, the Count of Olivares wrote to King Philip III of Spain, "Bellarmine ... would not do for a Pope, for he is mindful only of the interests of the Church and is unresponsive to the reasons of princes." In 1602 he was made <a href="archbishop%20of%20Capua">archbishop of Capua</a>. He had written against pluralism and non-residence of bishops within their <a href="diocese">diocese</a>s. As bishop he put into effect the reforming decrees of the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a>. He received some votes in the 1605 <a href="papal%20election">conclaves</a> which elected <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XI">Pope Leo XI</a>, <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a>, and in 1621 when <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XV">Pope Gregory XV</a> was elected. but his being a Jesuit stood against him in the judgment of many of the cardinals.

<a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> saw Bellarmine in Rome at a service on All Saints Day (1 November) 1614 and, exempting him alone from a general castigation of cardinals, described him as "a little lean old man" who lived "more retired".

In 1616, on the orders of Paul V, Bellarmine summoned <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo</a>, notified him of a forthcoming <a href="decree">decree</a> of the <a href="Congregation%20of%20the%20Index">Congregation of the Index</a> condemning the <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Copernican</a> doctrine of the mobility of the Earth and the immobility of the Sun, and ordered him to abandon it. Galileo agreed to do so.

When Galileo later complained of rumors to the effect that he had been forced to abjure and do penance, Bellarmine wrote out a certificate denying the rumors, stating that Galileo had merely been notified of the decree and informed that, as a consequence of it, the Copernican doctrine could not be "defended or held". Cardinal Bellarmine believed such a demonstration could not be found because it would contradict the unanimous consent of the <a href="Fathers%20of%20the%20Church">Fathers</a>' <a href="scriptural%20exegesis">scriptural exegesis</a>, to which the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a>, in 1546, <a href="Dogmatic%20definition">defined</a> all Catholics must adhere.

Bellarmine wrote to <a href="heliocentrism">heliocentrist</a> <a href="Paolo%20Antonio%20Foscarini">Paolo Antonio Foscarini</a> in 1615:

The Council [of Trent] prohibits interpreting Scripture against the common consensus of the Holy Fathers; and if Your Paternity wants to read not only the Holy Fathers, but also the modern commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and Joshua, you will find all agreeing in the literal interpretation that the sun is in heaven and turns around the earth with great speed, and that the earth is very far from heaven and sits motionless at the center of the world.andI say that if there were a true demonstration that the sun is at the center of the world and the earth in the third heaven, and that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun, then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary, and say rather that we do not understand them, than that what is demonstrated is false. But I will not believe that there is such a demonstration, until it is shown me. Nor is it the same to demonstrate that by supposing the sun to be at the center and the earth in heaven one can <a href="Saving%20the%20phenomena">save the appearances</a>, and to demonstrate that in truth the sun is at the center and the earth in heaven; for I believe the first demonstration may be available, but I have very great doubts about the second, and in case of doubt one must not abandon the Holy Scripture as interpreted by the Holy Fathers.

In 1633, nearly twelve years after Bellarmine's death, Galileo was again called before the Inquisition in this matter.

In his article on Bellarmine in the "<a href="Complete%20Dictionary%20of%20Scientific%20Biography">Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography</a>", <a href="Ernan%20McMullin">Ernan McMullin</a> cites <a href="Pierre%20Duhem">Pierre Duhem</a> and <a href="Karl%20Popper">Karl Popper</a> as prominent adherents to an "often repeated" view that "in one respect, at least, Bellarmine had shown himself a better scientist than Galileo", insofar as he supposedly denied that a "strict proof" of the Earth's motion could be possible. McMullin himself emphatically rejects that view as untenable.

In his old age Bellarmine was <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Montepulciano-Chiusi-Pienza">bishop of Montepulciano</a> for four years, after which he retired to the Jesuit college of St. Andrew in Rome, where he died on 17 September 1621, aged 78.

Bellarmine's books bear the stamp of their period; the effort for literary elegance (so-called ""maraviglia"") had given place to a desire to pile up as much material as possible, to embrace the whole field of human knowledge, and incorporate it into theology. His controversial works provoked many replies, and were studied for some decades after his death. At Leuven he made extensive studies in the <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a> and <a href="scholastic%20theologian">scholastic theologian</a>s, which gave him the material for his book "De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis" (Rome, 1613). It was later revised and enlarged by <a href="Sirmond">Sirmond</a>, <a href="Labbeus">Labbeus</a>, and <a href="Casimir%20Oudin">Casimir Oudin</a>. Bellarmine wrote the preface to the new <a href="Sixto-Clementine%20Vulgate">Sixto-Clementine Vulgate</a>.

From his research grew "<a href="Disputationes">Disputationes</a> de controversiis christianae fidei" (also called "Controversiae"), first published at <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a> in 1581–1593. This major work was the earliest attempt to systematize the various religious disputes between Catholics and Protestants. Bellarmine calmly and fairly reviewed the issues and devoted eleven years to it while at the Roman College. In August 1590 <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20V">Pope Sixtus V</a> decided to place the first volume of the "Disputationes" on the <a href="Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum">Index</a> because Bellarmine argued in it that the Pope is not the temporal ruler of the whole world and that temporal rulers do not derive their authority to rule from God but from the consent of the governed. However Sixtus died before the revised Index was published, and the next Pope, <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VII">Urban VII</a>, removed the book from the Index during his brief twelve-day reign.

In 1597 he wrote the "<a href="Catechism">Catechism</a>" ("Dottrina cristiana") in two versions (short and full) which has been translated to 50 <a href="language">language</a>s, becoming one of the greatest <a href="bestseller">bestseller</a>s and the official teaching of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Church</a> in 17th-19th centuries.

Under <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a> (reigned 1605–1621), a major conflict arose between <a href="Venice">Venice</a> and the <a href="Papacy">Papacy</a>. <a href="Paolo%20Sarpi">Paolo Sarpi</a>, as spokesman for the Republic of Venice, protested against the papal <a href="interdict">interdict</a>, and reasserted the principles of the <a href="Council%20of%20Constance">Council of Constance</a> and of the <a href="Council%20of%20Basel">Council of Basel</a>, denying the pope's authority in secular matters. Bellarmine wrote three rejoinders to the Venetian theologians, and may have warned Sarpi of an impending murderous attack, when in September 1607, an unfrocked friar and brigand by the name of Rotilio Orlandini planned to kill Sarpi for the sum of 8,000 crowns. Orlandini's plot was discovered, and when he and his accomplices crossed from Papal into Venetian territory they were arrested.

Bellarmine also became involved in controversy with King <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I of England</a>. From a point of principle for <a href="English%20Catholics">English Catholics</a>, this debate drew in figures from much of Western Europe. It raised the profile of both protagonists, King James as a champion of his own restricted <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> Protestantism, and Bellarmine for <a href="Counter-Reformation">Tridentine Catholicism</a>.

During his retirement, he wrote several short books intended to help ordinary people in their spiritual life: "De ascensione mentis in Deum per scalas rerum creatorum opusculum" ("The Mind's Ascent to God –" 1614) which was translated into English as "Jacob's Ladder" (1638) without acknowledgement by <a href="Henry%20Isaacson%20%28theologian%29">Henry Isaacson</a>, "The Art of Dying Well" (1619) (in Latin, English translation under this title by <a href="Edward%20Coffin">Edward Coffin</a>), and "The Seven Words on the Cross".

Bellarmine was <a href="canonized">canonized</a> by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XI">Pope Pius XI</a> in 1930; the following year he was declared a <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctor of the Church</a>. His remains, in a cardinal's red robes, are displayed behind glass under a side altar in the <a href="Sant%27Ignazio">Church of Saint Ignatius</a>, the chapel of the Roman College, next to the body of his student, <a href="St.%20Aloysius%20Gonzaga">St. Aloysius Gonzaga</a>, as he himself had wished. In the <a href="General%20Roman%20Calendar">General Roman Calendar</a> Saint Robert Bellarmine's <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> is on 17 September, the day of his death; but some continue to use pre-1969 calendars, in which for 37 years his feast day was on 13 May. The <a href="ranking%20of%20liturgical%20days%20in%20the%20Roman%20Rite">rank</a> assigned to his feast has been "double" (1932–1959), "third-class feast" (1960–1968), and since the <a href="Mysterii%20Paschalis">1969 revision</a> "<a href="memorial%20%28liturgy%29">memorial</a>".

Bildungsroman

In <a href="literary%20criticism">literary criticism</a>, a Bildungsroman (; <a href="English%20language">English</a>: "novel of formation, education, culture"; "coming-of-age story") is a literary genre that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> from youth to adulthood (<a href="coming%20of%20age">coming of age</a>), in which character change is extremely important.

The term was coined in 1819 by <a href="Philology">philologist</a> <a href="Karl%20Morgenstern">Karl Morgenstern</a> in his university lectures, and later famously reprised by <a href="Wilhelm%20Dilthey">Wilhelm Dilthey</a>, who legitimated it in 1870 and popularized it in 1905. The genre is further characterized by a number of formal, topical, and thematic features. The term "coming-of-age novel" is sometimes used interchangeably with "Bildungsroman", but its use is usually wider and less technical.

The birth of the Bildungsroman is normally dated to the publication of "<a href="Wilhelm%20Meister%27s%20Apprenticeship">Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship</a>" by <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang Goethe</a> in 1795–96, or, sometimes, to <a href="Christoph%20Martin%20Wieland">Christoph Martin Wieland</a>'s "Geschichte des Agathon" of 1767. Although the "Bildungsroman" arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a> translated Goethe’s novel into English, and after its publication in 1824, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it. In the 20th century, it spread to Germany, Britain, France, and several other countries around the globe.

The genre translates fairly directly into cinematic form, the <a href="coming-of-age%20film">coming-of-age film</a>.

A "Bildungsroman" relates the growing up or "coming of age" of a sensitive person who goes in search of answers to life's questions with the expectation that these will result from gaining experience of the world. The genre evolved from folklore tales of a <a href="dunce">dunce</a> or youngest son/daughter going out in the world to seek his/her fortune. Usually in the beginning of the story there is an emotional loss which makes the protagonist leave on his/her journey. In a "Bildungsroman", the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he/she is ultimately accepted into society — the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.

There are many variations and subgenres of "Bildungsroman" that focus on the growth of an individual. An "Entwicklungsroman" ("development novel") is a story of general growth rather than self-cultivation. An "Erziehungsroman" ("education novel") focuses on training and formal schooling, while a "<a href="K%C3%BCnstlerroman">Künstlerroman</a>" ("artist novel") is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self. Furthermore, some memoirs and published journals can be regarded as "Bildungsroman" although being predominantly factual (an example being "<a href="The%20Motorcycle%20Diaries%20%28book%29">The Motorcycle Diaries</a>" by <a href="Che%20Guevara">Ernesto "Che" Guevara</a>). The term is also more loosely used to describe <a href="coming-of-age%20film">coming-of-age film</a>s and related works in other genres.

Bachelor

A bachelor is a <a href="man">man</a> who is socially regarded as able to <a href="marry">marry</a>, but has not yet.

It is also the title of anyone of any gender or marital status who holds a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a>.

From the 14th century, the term was also used for a junior member of a <a href="guild">guild</a> (otherwise known as "yeomen") or <a href="university">university</a> and then for low-level ecclesiastics, as young <a href="monk">monk</a>s and recently appointed <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a>s. As an inferior grade of scholarship, it came to refer to one holding a "<a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a>". This sense of ' or ' is first attested at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a> in the 13th century in the system of degrees established under the auspices of <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20IX">Pope Gregory IX</a> as applied to scholars still '. There were two classes of ': the ', theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course, and the ', who had completed the course and were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.

In the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>, the term <a href="eligible%20bachelor">eligible bachelor</a> was used in the context of <a href="upper%20class">upper class</a> <a href="arranged%20marriage">matchmaking</a>, denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered "eligible" in financial and social terms for the prospective bride under discussion. Also in the Victorian era, the term "<a href="confirmed%20bachelor">confirmed bachelor</a>" denoted a man who was resolute to remain unmarried.

By the later 19th century, the term "bachelor" had acquired the general sense of "unmarried man". The expression <a href="bachelor%20party">bachelor party</a> is recorded 1882. In 1895, a feminine equivalent "bachelor-girl" was coined, replaced in US English by "<a href="bachelorette">bachelorette</a>" by the mid-1930s. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, this terminology came to be seen as antiquated and has been mostly replaced by the gender-neutral term "<a href="single%20person">single</a>" (first recorded 1964). In England and Wales, the term "bachelor" remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until 2005, when it was abolished in favor of "single."

In certain <a href="Cooperation%20Council%20for%20the%20Arab%20States%20of%20the%20Gulf">Gulf Arab</a> countries, "bachelor" can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin (due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite), and a colloquial term "executive bachelor" is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to <a href="white-collar%20worker">white-collar</a> bachelors in particular.

Bachelors have been subject to <a href="penal%20law">penal law</a>s in many countries, most notably in <a href="Ancient%20history">Ancient</a> <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>. At Sparta, men unmarried after a certain age were subject to various penalties (, "atimía"): they were forbidden to watch women's gymnastics; during the winter, they were made to march naked through the <a href="agora">agora</a> singing a song about their dishonor; and they were not provided with the traditional respect due to the elderly. Some <a href="Ancient%20Athens">Athenian</a> laws were similar. Bachelors in Rome fell under the <a href="Lex%20Julia">Lex Julia</a> of 18  and the <a href="Lex%20Papia%20et%20Poppaea">Lex Papia et Poppaea</a> of  9: these lay heavy fines on unmarried or childless people while providing certain privileges to those with several children. In <a href="UK">Britain</a>, taxes occasionally fell heavier on bachelors than other persons: examples include 6 & 7 Will. III, the 1785 Tax on Servants, and the 1798 Income Tax. Over time, some punishments developed into no more than a teasing game. In some parts of <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, for instance, men who were still unmarried by their 30th birthday were made to sweep the stairs of the <a href="town%20hall">town hall</a> until kissed by a "virgin".

<doc id="4882" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4882" title="Background radiation">
Background radiation

Background radiation is the ionizing radiation present in the environment. Background radiation originates from a variety of sources, both natural and artificial. Sources include <a href="cosmic%20radiation">cosmic radiation</a>, and <a href="environmental%20radioactivity">environmental radioactivity</a> from such as 
naturally occurring radioactive materials including <a href="radon">radon</a> and <a href="radium">radium</a>, and <a href="fallout">fallout</a> from <a href="nuclear%20weapons%20testing">nuclear weapons testing</a> and <a href="nuclear%20accident">nuclear accident</a>s.

The term background radiation can have different meanings, depending whether we are considering an ambient radiation dose, or we wish to differentiate between an incidental background and a particular source of radiation of concern.

For example, in considering <a href="radiation%20safety">radiation safety</a> , background radiation is defined by the <a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> as "Dose or dose rate (or an observed measure related to the dose or dose rate) attributable to all sources other than the one(s) specified. So a distinction is made between sources of dose which are incidentally in a location, which are defined here as being "background", and the dose due to a specified source. This is important where radiation measurements are taken of a specified radiation source, and the incidental background may affect this measurement. An example would be detection of radioactive contamination in a gamma ray background, which could increase the total reading above that expected from the contamination alone.

However, if no specific radiation source is of concern, then the total radiation dose measurement taken at a location is generally called the background radiation , and this is usually the case where an ambient dose rate is measured for environmental purposes.

Background radiation varies with location and time, and the following table gives examples:

Radioactive material is found throughout nature. Detectable amounts occur naturally in <a href="soil">soil</a>, rocks, water, air, and vegetation, from which it is inhaled and ingested into the body. In addition to this "internal exposure", humans also receive "external exposure" from radioactive materials that remain outside the body and from cosmic radiation from space. The worldwide average natural <a href="effective%20radiation%20dose">dose</a> to humans is about 2.4 <a href="millisievert">millisievert</a> (mSv) per year. This is four times the worldwide average artificial radiation exposure, which in 2008 amounted to about 0.6 mSv per year. In some rich countries, like the US and Japan, artificial exposure is, on average, greater than the natural exposure, due to greater access to <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a>. In Europe, average natural background exposure by country ranges from under 2 mSv annually in the United Kingdom to more than 7 mSv annually for some groups of people in Finland.

The <a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> states:

The biggest source of natural background radiation is airborne <a href="radon">radon</a>, a radioactive gas that emanates from the ground. Radon and its <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s, parent <a href="radionuclide">radionuclide</a>s, and <a href="decay%20product">decay product</a>s all contribute to an average inhaled dose of 1.26 <a href="Sievert%23Common%20SI%20usage">mSv/a</a> (millisievert <a href="wikt%3Aper%20annum">per year</a>). Radon is unevenly distributed and varies with weather, such that much higher doses apply to many areas of the world, where it represents a <a href="Health%20effects%20of%20radon">significant health hazard</a>. Concentrations over 500 times the world average have been found inside buildings in Scandinavia, the United States, Iran, and the Czech Republic. Radon is a decay product of uranium, which is relatively common in the Earth's crust, but more concentrated in ore-bearing rocks scattered around the world. Radon seeps out of these <a href="ores">ores</a> into the atmosphere or into ground water or infiltrates into buildings. It can be inhaled into the lungs, along with its <a href="decay%20product">decay product</a>s, where they will reside for a period of time after exposure.

Although radon is naturally occurring, exposure can be enhanced or diminished by human activity, notably house construction. A poorly sealed basement in an otherwise well insulated house can result in the accumulation of radon within the dwelling, exposing its residents to high concentrations. The widespread construction of well insulated and sealed homes in the northern industrialized world has led to radon becoming the primary source of background radiation in some localities in northern North America and Europe. Basement sealing and suction ventilation reduce exposure. Some building materials, for example <a href="lightweight%20concrete">lightweight concrete</a> with <a href="alum%20shale">alum shale</a>, <a href="phosphogypsum">phosphogypsum</a> and Italian <a href="tuff">tuff</a>, may emanate radon if they contain <a href="radium">radium</a> and are porous to gas.

Radiation exposure from radon is indirect. Radon has a short half-life (4 days) and decays into other solid particulate <a href="Decay%20chain%23Radium%20series">radium-series</a> radioactive nuclides. These radioactive particles are inhaled and remain lodged in the lungs, causing continued exposure. Radon is thus assumed to be the second leading cause of <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> after <a href="tobacco%20smoking">smoking</a>, and accounts for 15,000 to 22,000 cancer deaths per year in the US alone.. However, the discussion about the opposite experimental results is still going on.

About 100,000 Bq/m of radon was found in <a href="Health%20effects%20of%20radon%23Accumulation%20in%20dwellings">Stanley Watras's</a> basement in 1984. He and his neighbours in <a href="Boyertown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Boyertown, Pennsylvania</a>, United States may hold the record for the most radioactive dwellings in the world. International radiation protection organizations estimate that a <a href="committed%20dose">committed dose</a> may be calculated by multiplying the <a href="equilibrium%20equivalent%20concentration">equilibrium equivalent concentration</a> (EEC) of radon by a factor of 8 to 9 and the EEC of <a href="thoron">thoron</a> by a factor of 40 .

Most of the atmospheric background is caused by radon and its decay products. The <a href="gamma%20spectroscopy">gamma spectrum</a> shows prominent peaks at 609, 1120, and 1764 <a href="keV">keV</a>, belonging to <a href="bismuth-214">bismuth-214</a>, a radon decay product. The atmospheric background varies greatly with wind direction and meteorological conditions. Radon also can be released from the ground in bursts and then form "radon clouds" capable of traveling tens of kilometers.

The Earth and all living things on it are constantly bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from <a href="proton">proton</a>s to <a href="iron">iron</a> and larger <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> derived sources outside our <a href="solar%20system">solar system</a>. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an <a href="air%20shower%20%28physics%29">air shower</a> of secondary radiation, including <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s, <a href="muon">muon</a>s, <a href="proton">proton</a>s, <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s, <a href="pion">pion</a>s, <a href="electron">electron</a>s, and <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies in different parts of the world based largely on the <a href="geomagnetic%20field">geomagnetic field</a> and altitude. For example, the city of <a href="Denver">Denver</a> in the United States (at 1650 meters elevation) receives a cosmic ray dose roughly twice that of a location at sea level. This radiation is much more intense in the upper <a href="troposphere">troposphere</a>, around 10 km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for <a href="airline">airline</a> crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment. During their flights airline crews typically get an extra dose on the order of 2.2 mSv (220 mrem) per year.

Similarly, cosmic rays cause higher background exposure in <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>s than in humans on the surface of Earth. Astronauts in low <a href="orbit">orbit</a>s, such as in the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> or the <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a>, are partially shielded by the <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> of the Earth, but also suffer from the <a href="Van%20Allen%20radiation%20belt">Van Allen radiation belt</a> which accumulates cosmic rays and results from the Earth's magnetic field. Outside low Earth orbit, as experienced by the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo</a> astronauts who traveled to the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, this background radiation is much more intense, and represents a considerable obstacle to potential future long term human exploration of the <a href="moon%20landing">moon</a> or <a href="Human%20mission%20to%20Mars">Mars</a>.

Cosmic rays also cause <a href="Nuclear%20transmutation">elemental transmutation</a> in the atmosphere, in which secondary radiation generated by the cosmic rays combines with <a href="atomic%20nuclei">atomic nuclei</a> in the atmosphere to generate different <a href="nuclide">nuclide</a>s. Many so-called <a href="cosmogenic%20nuclide">cosmogenic nuclide</a>s can be produced, but probably the most notable is <a href="carbon-14">carbon-14</a>, which is produced by interactions with <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> atoms. These cosmogenic nuclides eventually reach the Earth's surface and can be incorporated into living organisms. The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years. The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of carbon-14 are the principles used in <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a> of ancient biological materials, such as wooden artifacts or human remains.

The cosmic radiation at sea level usually manifests as 511 keV gamma rays from annihilation of <a href="positron">positron</a>s created by nuclear reactions of high energy particles and gamma rays. At higher altitudes there is also the contribution of continuous <a href="bremsstrahlung">bremsstrahlung</a> spectrum.

Terrestrial radiation, for the purpose of the table above, only includes sources that remain external to the body. The major <a href="radionuclide">radionuclide</a>s of concern are <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="thorium">thorium</a> and their decay products, some of which, like <a href="radium">radium</a> and <a href="radon">radon</a> are intensely radioactive but occur in low concentrations. Most of these sources have been decreasing, due to <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a> since the formation of the Earth, because there is no significant amount currently transported to the Earth. Thus, the present activity on earth from <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> is only half as much as it originally was because of its 4.5 <a href="1000000000%20%28number%29">billion</a> year half-life, and <a href="potassium-40">potassium-40</a> (half-life 1.25 billion years) is only at about 8% of original activity. The effects on humans of the actual diminishment (due to decay) of these isotopes is, however, minimal. This is because humans evolved too recently for the difference in activity over a fraction of a half-life to be significant. Put another way, human history is so short in comparison to a half-life of a billion years, that the activity of these long-lived isotopes has been effectively constant throughout our time on this planet.

In addition, many shorter half-life (and thus more intensely radioactive) isotopes have not decayed out of the terrestrial environment because of their on-going natural production. Examples of these are <a href="radium">radium</a>-226 (decay product of thorium-230 in decay chain of uranium-238) and radon-222 (a decay product of <a href="radium">radium</a>-226 in said chain).

Thorium and uranium (and their daughters) primarily undergo <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha</a> and <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, and aren't easily detectable. However, many of their <a href="daughter%20product">daughter product</a>s are strong gamma emitters. Thorium-232 is detectable via a 239 keV peak from <a href="lead-212">lead-212</a>, 511, 583 and 2614 keV from <a href="thallium-208">thallium-208</a>, and 911 and 969 keV from <a href="actinium-228">actinium-228</a>. Uranium-238 manifests as 609, 1120, and 1764 keV peaks of bismuth-214 ("cf." the same peak for atmospheric radon). Potassium-40 is detectable directly via its 1461 keV gamma peak.

The level over the sea and other large bodies of water tends to be about a tenth of the terrestrial background. Conversely, coastal areas (and areas by the side of fresh water) may have an additional contribution from dispersed sediment.

Some of the essential elements that make up the human body, mainly potassium and carbon, have radioactive isotopes that add significantly to our background radiation dose. An average human contains about 30 milligrams of <a href="potassium-40">potassium-40</a> (K) and about 10 nanograms (10 g) of <a href="carbon-14">carbon-14</a> (C), which has a decay half-life of 5,730 years. Excluding internal contamination by external radioactive material, the largest component of internal radiation exposure from biologically functional components of the human body is from potassium-40. The decay of about 4,000 nuclei of K per second makes potassium the largest source of radiation in terms of number of decaying atoms. The energy of <a href="beta%20particle">beta particle</a>s produced by K is also about 10 times that from the beta particles from C decay.
C is present in the human body at a level of 3700 Bq with a <a href="biological%20half-life">biological half-life</a> of 40 days. There are about 1,200 beta particles per second produced by the decay of C. However, a C atom is in the genetic information of about half the cells, while potassium is not a component of <a href="DNA">DNA</a>. The decay of a C atom inside DNA in one person happens about 50 times per second, changing a carbon atom to one of <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. The global average internal dose from radionuclides other than radon and its decay products is 0.29 mSv/a, of which 0.17 mSv/a comes from K, 0.12 mSv/a comes from the uranium and thorium series, and 12 μSv/a comes from C.

Some areas have greater dosage than the country-wide averages. In the world in general, exceptionally high natural background locales include <a href="Ramsar%2C%20Mazandaran">Ramsar</a> in Iran, <a href="Guarapari">Guarapari</a> in Brazil, <a href="Karunagappalli">Karunagappalli</a> in India, <a href="Arkaroola">Arkaroola</a> in Australia and <a href="Yangjiang">Yangjiang</a> in China.

The highest level of purely natural radiation ever recorded on the Earth's surface was 90 µGy/h on a Brazilian black beach ("areia preta" in Portuguese) composed of <a href="monazite">monazite</a>. This rate would convert to 0.8 Gy/a for year-round continuous exposure, but in fact the levels vary seasonally and are much lower in the nearest residences. The record measurement has not been duplicated and is omitted from UNSCEAR's latest reports. Nearby tourist beaches in <a href="Guarapari">Guarapari</a> and <a href="Cumuruxatiba">Cumuruxatiba</a> were later evaluated at 14 and 15 µGy/h.

The highest background radiation in an inhabited area is found in <a href="Ramsar%2C%20Mazandaran">Ramsar</a>, primarily due to the use of local naturally radioactive limestone as a building material. The 1000 most exposed residents receive an average external <a href="effective%20radiation%20dose">effective radiation dose</a> of 6 mSv per year, (0.6 rem/yr,) six times the <a href="ICRP">ICRP</a> recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources. They additionally receive a substantial internal dose from radon. Record radiation levels were found in a house where the effective dose due to ambient radiation fields was 131 mSv/a, (13.1 rem/yr) and the internal <a href="committed%20dose">committed dose</a> from <a href="radon">radon</a> was 72 mSv/a (7.2 rem/yr). This unique case is over 80 times higher than the world average natural human exposure to radiation.

Epidemiological studies are underway to identify health effects associated with the high radiation levels in Ramsar. It is much too early to draw unambiguous statistically significant conclusions. While so far support for beneficial effects of chronic radiation (like longer lifespan) has been observed in few places only, a protective and adaptive effect is suggested by at least one study whose authors nonetheless caution that data from Ramsar are not yet sufficiently strong to relax existing regulatory dose limits. However, the recent statistical analyses discussed that there is no correlation between the risk of negative health effects and elevated level of natural background radiation.

Background radiation doses in the immediate vicinity of particles of high atomic number materials, within the human body, have a small enhancement due to the <a href="photoelectric%20effect">photoelectric effect</a>.

Most of the natural neutron background is a product of cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere. The neutron energy peaks at around 1 MeV and rapidly drops above. At sea level, the production of neutrons is about 20 neutrons per second per kilogram of material interacting with the cosmic rays (or, about 100–300 neutrons per square meter per second). The flux is dependent on geomagnetic latitude, with a maximum near the magnetic poles. At solar minimums, due to lower solar magnetic field shielding, the flux is about twice as high vs the solar maximum. It also dramatically increases during solar flares. In the vicinity of larger heavier objects, e.g. buildings or ships, the neutron flux measures higher; this is known as "cosmic ray induced neutron signature", or "ship effect" as it was first detected with ships at sea.

The global average human exposure to artificial radiation is 0.6 mSv/a, primarily from <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a>. This medical component can range much higher, with an average of 3 mSv per year across the USA population. Other human contributors include smoking, air travel, radioactive building materials, historical nuclear weapons testing, nuclear power accidents and nuclear industry operation.

A typical chest x-ray delivers 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) of effective dose. A dental x-ray delivers a dose of 5 to 10 µSv. A <a href="CT%20scan%23Scan%20dose">CT scan</a> delivers an effective dose to the whole body ranging from 1 to 20 mSv (100 to 2000 mrem). The average American receives about 3 mSv of diagnostic medical dose per year; countries with the lowest levels of health care receive almost none. Radiation treatment for various diseases also accounts for some dose, both in individuals and in those around them.

Cigarettes contain polonium-210, originating from the decay products of radon, which stick to tobacco leaves. Heavy smoking results in a radiation dose of 160 mSv/year to localized spots at the bifurcations of segmental bronchi in the lungs from the decay of polonium-210. This dose is not readily comparable to the radiation protection limits, since the latter deal with whole body doses, while the dose from smoking is delivered to a very small portion of the body.

Air travel causes increased exposure to cosmic radiation. The average extra dose to flight personnel is 2.19 mSv/year.

Frequent above-ground nuclear explosions between the 1940s and 1960s scattered a substantial amount of <a href="radioactive%20contamination">radioactive contamination</a>. Some of this contamination is local, rendering the immediate surroundings highly radioactive, while some of it is carried longer distances as <a href="nuclear%20fallout">nuclear fallout</a>; some of this material is dispersed worldwide. The increase in background radiation due to these tests peaked in 1963 at about 0.15 mSv per year worldwide, or about 7% of average background dose from all sources. The <a href="Limited%20Test%20Ban%20Treaty">Limited Test Ban Treaty</a> of 1963 prohibited above-ground tests, thus by the year 2000 the worldwide dose from these tests has decreased to only 0.005 mSv per year.

The <a href="ICRP">International Commission on Radiological Protection</a> recommends limiting <a href="occupational%20radiation%20exposure">occupational radiation exposure</a> to 50 mSv (5 rem) per year, and 100 mSv (10 rem) in 5 years.

However, background radiation for occupational doses includes radiation that is not measured by radiation dose instruments in potential occupational exposure conditions. This includes both offsite "natural background radiation" and any medical radiation doses. This value is not typically measured or known from surveys, such that variations in the total dose to individual workers is not known. This can be a significant confounding factor in assessing radiation exposure effects in a population of workers who may have significantly different natural background and medical radiation doses. This is most significant when the occupational doses are very low.

At an <a href="IAEA">IAEA</a> conference in 2002, it was recommended that occupational doses below 1–2 mSv per year do not warrant regulatory scrutiny.

Under normal circumstances, nuclear reactors release small amounts of radioactive gases, which cause small radiation exposures to the public. Events classified on the <a href="International%20Nuclear%20Event%20Scale">International Nuclear Event Scale</a> as incidents typically do not release any additional radioactive substances into the environment. Large releases of radioactivity from nuclear reactors are extremely rare. To the present day, there were two major "civilian" accidents – the <a href="Chernobyl%20accident">Chernobyl accident</a> and the <a href="Fukushima%20I%20nuclear%20accidents">Fukushima I nuclear accidents</a> – which caused substantial contamination. The Chernobyl accident was the only one to cause immediate deaths.

Total doses from the Chernobyl accident ranged from 10 to 50 mSv over 20 years for the inhabitants of the affected areas, with most of the dose received in the first years after the disaster, and over 100 mSv for <a href="Liquidator%20%28Chernobyl%29">liquidators</a>. There were 28 deaths from <a href="acute%20radiation%20syndrome">acute radiation syndrome</a>.

Total doses from the Fukushima I accidents were between 1 and 15 mSv for the inhabitants of the affected areas. Thyroid doses for children were below 50 mSv. 167 cleanup workers received doses above 100 mSv, with 6 of them receiving more than 250 mSv (the Japanese exposure limit for emergency response workers).

The average dose from the <a href="Three%20Mile%20Island%20accident">Three Mile Island accident</a> was 0.01 mSv.

Non-civilian: In addition to the civilian accidents described above, several accidents at early nuclear weapons facilities – such as the <a href="Windscale%20fire">Windscale fire</a>, the contamination of the <a href="Techa%20River">Techa River</a> by the nuclear waste from the <a href="Mayak">Mayak</a> compound, and the <a href="Kyshtym%20disaster">Kyshtym disaster</a> at the same compound – released substantial radioactivity into the environment. The Windscale fire resulted in thyroid doses of 5–20 mSv for adults and 10–60 mSv for children. The doses from the accidents at Mayak are unknown.

The <a href="Nuclear%20Regulatory%20Commission">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>, and other U.S. and international agencies, require that licensees limit radiation exposure to individual members of the public to 1 <a href="sievert">mSv</a> (100 m<a href="roentgen%20equivalent%20man">rem</a>) per year.

Coal plants emit radiation in the form of radioactive <a href="fly%20ash">fly ash</a> which is inhaled and ingested by neighbours, and incorporated into crops. A 1978 paper from <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> estimated that coal-fired power plants of that time may contribute a whole-body committed dose of 19 µSv/a to their immediate neighbours in a radius of 500 m. The <a href="United%20Nations%20Scientific%20Committee%20on%20the%20Effects%20of%20Atomic%20Radiation">United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation</a>'s 1988 report estimated the committed dose 1 km away to be 20 µSv/a for older plants or 1 µSv/a for newer plants with improved fly ash capture, but was unable to confirm these numbers by test. When coal is burned, uranium, thorium and all the uranium daughters accumulated by disintegration — radium, radon, polonium — are released. Radioactive materials previously buried underground in coal deposits are released as fly ash or, if fly ash is captured, may be incorporated into concrete manufactured with fly ash.

In a radiation metrology laboratory, background radiation refers to the measured value from any incidental sources that affect an instrument when a specific radiation source sample is being measured. This background contribution, which is established as a stable value by multiple measurements, usually before and after sample measurement, is subtracted from the rate measured when the sample is being measured.

This is in accordance with the <a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> definition of background as being "Dose or dose rate (or an observed measure related to the dose or dose rate) attributable to all sources other than the one(s) specified.

The same issue occurs with radiation protection instruments, where a reading from an instrument may be affected by the background radiation. An example of this is a <a href="scintillation%20detector">scintillation detector</a> used for surface contamination monitoring. In an elevated gamma background the scintillator material will be affected by the background gamma, which will add to the reading obtained from any contamination which is being monitored. In extreme cases it will make the instrument unusable as the background swamps the lower level of radiation from the contamination. In such instruments the background can be continually monitored in the "Ready" state, and subtracted from any reading obtained when being used in "Measuring" mode.

Regular Radiation measurement is carried out at multiple levels. Government agencies compile radiation readings as part of environmental monitoring mandates, often making the readings available to the public and sometimes in near-real-time. Collaborative groups and private individuals may also make real-time readings available to the public. Instruments used for radiation measurement include the <a href="Geiger%E2%80%93M%C3%BCller%20tube">Geiger–Müller tube</a> and the <a href="Scintillation%20detector">Scintillation detector</a>. The former is usually more compact and affordable and reacts to several radiation types, while the latter is more complex and can detect specific radiation energies and types. Readings indicate radiation levels from all sources including background, and real-time readings are in general unvalidated, but correlation between independent detectors increases confidence in measured levels.

Banquo

Lord Banquo , the <a href="Thane%20%28Scotland%29">Thane</a> of <a href="Lochaber">Lochaber</a>, is a character in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s 1606 play "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>". In the play, he is at first an ally to <a href="Macbeth%20%28character%29">Macbeth</a> (both are generals in the King's army) and they are together when they meet the <a href="Three%20Witches">Three Witches</a>. After prophesying that Macbeth will become king, the witches tell Banquo that he will not be king himself, but that his descendants will be. Later, Macbeth in his lust for power sees Banquo as a threat and has him murdered; Banquo's son, <a href="Fleance">Fleance</a>, escapes. Banquo's ghost returns in a later scene, causing Macbeth to react with alarm during a public feast.

Shakespeare borrowed the character of Banquo from "Holinshed's Chronicles", a history of Britain published by <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a> in 1587. In "Chronicles" Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth in the murder of the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James</a>, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a <a href="Foil%20%28literature%29">foil</a> to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.

Shakespeare often used <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a>'s "Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland"—commonly known as "<a href="Holinshed%27s%20Chronicles">Holinshed's Chronicles</a>"—as a source for his plays, and in "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>" he borrows from several of the tales in that work. Holinshed portrays Banquo as a historical figure: he is an accomplice in <a href="Macbeth%20of%20Scotland">Mac Bethad mac Findlaích's</a> (Macbeth's) murder of <a href="Duncan%20I%20of%20Scotland">Donnchad mac Crínáin</a> (King Duncan) and plays an important part in ensuring that Macbeth, not <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Máel Coluim mac Donnchada</a> (Malcolm), takes the throne in the coup that follows. Holinshed in turn used an earlier work, the "Scotorum Historiae" (1526–7) by <a href="Hector%20Boece">Hector Boece</a>, as his source. Boece's work is the first known record of Banquo and his son <a href="Fleance">Fleance</a>; and scholars such as <a href="David%20Bevington">David Bevington</a> generally consider them fictional characters invented by Boece. In Shakespeare's day, however, they were considered historical figures of great repute, and the king, <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a>, based his claim to the throne in part on a descent from Banquo. The <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">House of Stuart</a> was descended from <a href="Walter%20fitz%20Alan">Walter fitz Alan</a>, the first <a href="High%20Steward%20of%20Scotland">High Steward of Scotland</a>, and he was believed to have been the grandson of Fleance and <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Llywelyn">Gruffydd ap Llywelyn</a>'s daughter, <a href="Nesta%20ferch%20Gruffydd">Nesta ferch Gruffydd</a>. In reality Walter fitz Alan was the son of <a href="Alan%20fitz%20Flaad">Alan fitz Flaad</a>, a Breton knight.

Unlike his sources, Shakespeare gives Banquo no role in the King's murder, making it a deed committed solely by Macbeth and his wife. Why Shakespeare's Banquo is so different from the character described by Holinshed and Boece is not known, though critics have proposed several possible explanations. First among them is the risk associated with portraying the king's ancestor as a murderer and conspirator in the plot to overthrow a rightful king, as well as the author's desire to flatter a powerful patron. But Shakespeare may also simply have altered Banquo's character because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder. There was, however, a need to provide a dramatic contrast to Macbeth; a role that many scholars argue is filled by Banquo. Similarly, when <a href="Jean%20de%20Schelandre">Jean de Schelandre</a> wrote about Banquo in his "<a href="Stuartide">Stuartide</a>" in 1611, he also changed the character by portraying him as a noble and honourable man—the critic D. W. Maskell describes him as "...Schelandre's paragon of valour and virtue"—probably for reasons similar to Shakespeare's.

Banquo's role in the coup that follows the murder is harder to explain. Banquo's loyalty to Macbeth, rather than <a href="Malcolm%20%28Macbeth%29">Malcolm</a>, after Duncan's death makes him a passive accomplice in the coup: Malcolm, as Prince of Cumberland, is the rightful heir to the throne and Macbeth a usurper. Daniel Amneus, however, argues that when Ross and Angus bring King Duncan's praise, and the news that Macbeth has been granted the title of Thane of Cawdor, the "greater honor" he ascribes to Macbeth is actually his title as Prince of Cumberland. If Macbeth, rather than Malcolm, is Prince of Cumberland then Macbeth would be next in line to the throne and no coup would be needed, effectively removing this ambiguity from Banquo's character.

Banquo is in a third of the play's scenes, as both a human and a ghost. As significant as he is to the plot, he has fewer lines than the relatively insignificant Ross, a Scottish nobleman who survives the play. In the second scene of the play, King Duncan describes the manner in which Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, and Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, bravely led his army against invaders, fighting side by side. In the next scene, Banquo and Macbeth, returning from the battle together, encounter the <a href="Three%20Witches">Three Witches</a>, who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and then king. Banquo, sceptical of the witches, challenges them to predict his own future, and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne, but will beget a line of kings. Banquo remains sceptical after the encounter, wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth. He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small, hopeful truth only to catch them in a deadly trap.

When Macbeth kills the king and takes the throne, Banquo—the only one aware of this encounter with the witches—reserves judgment for God. He is unsure whether Macbeth committed regicide to gain the throne, but muses in a <a href="soliloquy">soliloquy</a> that "I fear / Thou play'dst most foully for 't". He offers his respects to the new King Macbeth and pledges loyalty. Later, worried that Banquo's descendants and not his own will rule <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, Macbeth sends two men, and then a <a href="Third%20Murderer">Third Murderer</a>, to kill Banquo and his son <a href="Fleance">Fleance</a>. During the melee, Banquo holds off the assailants so that Fleance can escape, but is himself killed. The <a href="Ghosts%20in%20European%20culture">ghost</a> of Banquo later returns to haunt Macbeth at the banquet in Act Three, Scene Four. A terrified Macbeth sees him, while the apparition is invisible to his guests. He appears again to Macbeth in a vision granted by the Three Witches, wherein Macbeth sees a long line of kings descended from Banquo.

Many scholars see Banquo as a <a href="foil%20%28literature%29">foil</a> and a contrast to Macbeth. Macbeth, for example, eagerly accepts the Three Witches' prophecy as true and seeks to help it along. Banquo, on the other hand, doubts the prophecies and the intentions of these seemingly evil creatures. Whereas Macbeth places his hope in the prediction that he will be king, Banquo argues that evil only offers gifts that lead to destruction. Banquo steadily resists the temptations of evil within the play, praying to heaven for help, while Macbeth seeks darkness, and prays that evil powers will aid him. This is visible in act two; after Banquo sees Duncan to bed, he says: "There's husbandry in heaven, / Their candles are all out". This premonition of the coming darkness in association with Macbeth's murders is repeated just before Banquo is killed: "it will be rain to-night", Banquo tells his son Fleance.

Banquo's status as a contrast to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play. In act two, scene one, Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger ("Hold, take my sword ... Take thee that too"). He also explains that he has been having trouble sleeping due to "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" On Macbeth's approach, he demands the sword returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king as Macbeth's accomplice to take the throne for his own family, as the Three Witches prophesied to him. In this reading, his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure they do not come true, but is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands them back. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams have less to do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night. Then, when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had dreams about Macbeth's deeds, takes back his sword as a precaution in this case.

Macbeth eventually sees that Banquo can no longer be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne. Thus he has him murdered. Banquo's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.

When Macbeth returns to the witches later in the play, they show him an apparition of the murdered Banquo, along with eight of his descendants. The scene carries deep significance: King James, on the throne when "Macbeth" was written, was believed to be separated from Banquo by nine generations. What Shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, a very real fulfilment of the witches' prophecy to Banquo that his sons would take the throne. This apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.

Banquo's other appearance as a ghost during the banquet scene serves as an indicator of Macbeth's conscience returning to plague his thoughts. Banquo's triumph over death appears symbolically, insofar as he literally takes Macbeth's seat during the feast. Shocked, Macbeth uses words appropriate to the metaphor of usurpation, describing Banquo as "crowned" with wounds. The spirit drains Macbeth's manhood along with the blood from his cheeks; as soon as Banquo's form vanishes, Macbeth announces: "Why, so; being gone, / I am a man again."

Like the vision of Banquo's lineage, the banquet scene has also been the subject of criticism. Critics have questioned whether not one, but perhaps two ghosts appear in this scene: Banquo and Duncan. Scholars arguing that Duncan attends the banquet state that Macbeth's lines to the Ghost could apply equally well to the slain king. "Thou canst not say I did it", for example, can mean that Macbeth is not the man who actually killed Banquo, or it can mean that Duncan, who was asleep when Macbeth killed him, cannot claim to have seen his killer. To add to the confusion, some lines Macbeth directs to the ghost, such as "Thy bones are marrowless", cannot rightly be said of Banquo, who has only recently died.

Scholars debate whether Macbeth's vision of Banquo is real or a hallucination. Macbeth had already seen a hallucination before murdering Duncan: a knife hovering in the air. Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all, heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad, since the audience cannot see what he claims to see. Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual, ghosts of murdered victims are more believable, having a basis in the audience's superstitions. Spirits in other Shakespeare plays—notably "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" and "<a href="Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">Midsummer Night's Dream</a>"—exist in ambiguous forms, occasionally even calling into question their own presence.

The concept of a character being confronted at a triumphant feast with a reminder of their downfall is not unique to Shakespeare and may originate from the <a href="Belshazzar%27s%20feast">Belshazzar's feast</a> episode of the Bible. The term 'ghost at the feast' has entered popular culture, and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering, or (considering the general plot of "Macbeth") a reminder of a person's unpleasant past or likely future.

Banquo's role, especially in the banquet ghost scene, has been subject to a variety of interpretations and mediums. Shakespeare's text states: "Enter Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeth's place." Several television versions have altered this slightly, having Banquo appear suddenly in the chair, rather than walking onstage and into it. Special effects and camera tricks also allow producers to make the ghost disappear and reappear, highlighting the fact that "only" Macbeth can see it.

Stage directors, unaided by post-production effects and camera tricks, have used other methods to depict the ghost. In the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a> employed a wide variety of approaches for this task. In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear in the middle of the scene, and then again from the midst of the audience. In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through <a href="palmistry">palmistry</a>); he used Macbeth's shadow as the ghost. In 1936 <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> directed the <a href="Federal%20Theatre%20Project">Federal Theatre Project</a> <a href="Voodoo%20Macbeth">production of the play</a>, with an African-American cast that included <a href="Canada%20Lee">Canada Lee</a> in the role of Banquo.

Film adaptations have approached Banquo's character in a variety of ways. <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>'s 1957 adaptation "<a href="Throne%20of%20Blood">Throne of Blood</a>" makes the character into Capitan Miki (played by <a href="Minoru%20Chiaki">Minoru Chiaki</a>), slain by Macbeth's equivalent (Captain Washizu) when his wife explains that she is with child. News of Miki's death does not reach Washizu until after he has seen the ghost in the banquet scene. In <a href="Roman%20Polanski">Roman Polanski</a>'s 1971 <a href="Macbeth%20%281971%20film%29">adaptation</a>, Banquo is played by acclaimed stage actor <a href="Martin%20Shaw">Martin Shaw</a>, in a style reminiscent of earlier stage performances. Polanski's version also emphasises Banquo's objection to Macbeth's ascendency by showing him remaining silent as the other thanes around him hail Macbeth as king. in the 1990 telling of Macbeth in a New York Mafia crime family setting, "<a href="Men%20of%20Respect">Men of Respect</a>", the character of Banquo is named "Bankie Como" and played by American actor <a href="Dennis%20Farina">Dennis Farina</a>.

British Army

The British Army is the principal <a href="Army">land warfare force</a> of the United Kingdom. As of 2017, the British Army comprises just over 80,000 trained regular (full-time) personnel and just over 26,500 trained reserve (part-time) personnel.

The modern British Army traces back to 1660, when it was known as the English Army; the term "British Army" was adopted in 1707 after the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">Acts of Union</a> between England and Scotland. Although all members of the British Army are expected to swear (or affirm) allegiance to <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> as their commander-in-chief, the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights of 1689</a> requires parliamentary consent for <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a> to maintain a peacetime <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a>. Therefore, <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> approves the Army by passing an <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Act">Armed Forces Act</a> at least once every five years. The Army is administered by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> and commanded by the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>.

The British Army has seen action in major wars between the world's <a href="great%20power">great power</a>s, including the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> and the <a href="World%20War%20I">First</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World Wars</a>. Britain's victories in these decisive wars allowed it to influence world events and establish itself as one of the world's leading military and economic powers. Since the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> the British Army has deployed to a number of conflict zones, often as part of an <a href="Expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary force</a>, a <a href="coalition">coalition</a> force or part of a <a href="United%20Nations%20peacekeeping">United Nations peacekeeping</a> operation.

England never had a <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a> with professional officers and careerist corporals and sergeants. It relied on militia organized by local officials, or private forces mobilized by the nobility, or on hired mercenaries from Europe. Cromwell changed all that with his New Model Army of 50,000 men, that proved vastly more effective than untrained militia, and enable him to exert a powerful control at the local level overall of England. At the <a href="Restoration%20%281660%29">Restoration</a> of the king in 1660, Parliament paid off Cromwell's army and disbanded it. For many decades the Cromwellian model was a horror story and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army. The militia acts of 1661 and 1662 prevented local authorities from calling up militia and oppressing their own local opponents. Calling up the militia was possible only if the king and local elites agreed to do so.

Charles and his Tory supporters favoured a new army under royal control; he immediately began working on its establishment by August 1660. The first <a href="English%20Army%23Restoration">English Army</a> regiments, including elements of the disbanded <a href="New%20Model%20Army">New Model Army</a>, were formed between November 1660 and January 1661 and became a standing military force for Britain (financed by <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a>). The <a href="Royal%20Scots%20Army">Royal Scots</a> and <a href="Irish%20Army%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Ireland%29">Irish Armies</a> were financed by the parliaments of <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>. Parliamentary control was established by the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights 1689</a> and <a href="Claim%20of%20Right%20Act%201689">Claim of Right Act 1689</a>, although the monarch continued to influence aspects of army administration until at least the end of the nineteenth century. By the time of the 1707 <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">Acts of Union</a>, many regiments of the English and Scottish armies were combined under one operational command and stationed in the Netherlands for the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. Although all the regiments were now part of the new British military establishment, they remained under the old operational-command structure and retained much of the institutional ethos, customs and traditions of the standing armies created shortly after the <a href="restoration%20%28England%29">restoration of the monarchy</a> 47 years earlier. The order of seniority of the most-senior British Army line regiments is based on that of the English army. Although technically the Scots <a href="Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">Royal Regiment of Foot</a> was raised in 1633 and is the oldest Regiment of the Line, Scottish and Irish regiments were only allowed to take a rank in the English army on the date of their arrival in England (or the date when they were first placed on the English establishment). In 1694, a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment which became known as the <a href="Scots%20Greys">Scots Greys</a> were designated the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688, when the Scots Greys were first placed in the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of several regiments, the seniority of the Scots Greys was reassessed and based on their June 1685 entry into England. At that time there was only one English regiment of dragoons, and the Scots Greys eventually received the British Army rank of 2nd Dragoons.

King Charles quickly pulled together four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of £122,000 from his general budget. This became the foundation of the permanent British army, By 1685 it had grown to 7500 soldiers in marching regiments, and 1400 men permanently stationed in garrisons. A rebellion in 1685 allowed James II to raise the forces to 20,000 men. There were 37,000 in 1678, when England played a role in the closing stage of the Franco-Dutch War. After William and Mary's accession to the throne England involved itself in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Grand%20Alliance">War of the Grand Alliance</a>, primarily to prevent a French invasion restoring <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> (Mary's father). In 1689, William III expanded the army to 74,000, and then to 94,000 in 1694. Parliament was very nervous, and reduced the cadre to 7000 in 1697. Scotland and Ireland had theoretically separate military establishments, but they were unofficially merged with the English force. 

After 1700 British continental policy was to contain expansion by competing powers such as France and Spain. Although Spain was the dominant global power during the previous two centuries and the chief threat to England's early transatlantic ambitions, its influence was now waning. The territorial ambitions of the French, however, led to the War of the Spanish Succession and the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>.

Although the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> is widely regarded as vital to the rise of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, the British Army played an important role in the formation of colonies, <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a>s and <a href="dominion">dominion</a>s in the Americas, Africa, Asia, India and <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>. British soldiers captured strategically-important territories, and the army was involved in wars to secure the empire's borders and support friendly governments. Among these actions were the Seven Years' War, the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the <a href="First%20Opium%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Opium%20War">Second Opium War</a>s, the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>, the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Wars">New Zealand Wars</a>, the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Sepoy Rebellion of 1857</a>, the <a href="First%20Boer%20War">first</a> and <a href="second%20Boer%20War">second Boer War</a>s, the <a href="Fenian%20raids">Fenian raids</a>, the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>, interventions in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> (intended to maintain a <a href="buffer%20state">buffer state</a> between British India and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>) and the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> (to keep the Russian Empire at a safe distance by aiding Turkey). Like the <a href="English%20Army">English Army</a>, the British Army fought the kingdoms of Spain, France (including the Empire of France) and the Netherlands for supremacy in North America and the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. With native and provincial assistance, the army conquered <a href="New%20France">New France</a> in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">North American theatre</a> of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> and suppressed a <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> uprising in <a href="Pontiac%27s%20War">Pontiac's War</a>. The British Army was defeated in the American Revolutionary War, losing the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> but retaining <a href="The%20Canadas">The Canadas</a> and <a href="The%20Maritimes">The Maritimes</a> as <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a>.
The British Army was heavily involved in the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, participating in a number of campaigns in Europe (including continuous deployment in the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>), the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, North Africa and <a href="War%20of%201812">North America</a>. The war between the British and the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a> of <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> stretched around the world; at its peak in 1813, the regular army contained over 250,000 men. A coalition of Anglo-Dutch and Prussian armies under the <a href="Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> and <a href="Field%20Marshal%20von%20Bl%C3%BCcher">Field Marshal von Blücher</a> finally defeated Napoleon at <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a> in 1815.

The English were involved politically and militarily in Ireland since receiving the <a href="Lordship%20of%20Ireland">Lordship of Ireland</a> from the pope in 1171. The campaign of English republican Protector <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> involved uncompromising treatment of the Irish towns (most notably <a href="Drogheda">Drogheda</a> and <a href="Wexford">Wexford</a>) which supported the Royalists during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. The English Army (and the subsequent British Army) remained in Ireland primarily to suppress Irish revolts and campaigns for independence. In addition to its conflict with Irish nationalists, it was faced with the prospect of battling Anglo-Irish and <a href="Ulster-Scots">Ulster Scots</a> in Ireland who were angered by unfavourable taxation of Irish produce imported into Britain. With other Irish groups, they raised a volunteer army and threatened to emulate the American colonists if their conditions were not met. Learning from their experience in America, the British government sought a political solution. The British Army fought Irish rebels—Protestant and Catholic—primarily in <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a> and <a href="Leinster">Leinster</a> (<a href="Theobald%20Wolfe%20Tone">Wolfe Tone's</a> <a href="United%20Irishmen">United Irishmen</a>) in the <a href="Irish%20Rebellion%20of%201798">1798 rebellion</a>.
In addition to battling the armies of other European empires (and its former colonies, the United States, in the War of 1812), the British Army fought the Chinese in the first and second Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellion, <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> tribes in the first of the New Zealand Wars, Nawab Shiraj-ud-Daula's forces and <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a> mutineers in the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, the Boers in the first and second Boer Wars, Irish <a href="Fenian">Fenian</a>s in Canada during the <a href="Fenian%20raids">Fenian raids</a> and <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army">Irish separatists</a> in the <a href="Anglo-Irish%20War">Anglo-Irish War</a>. The increasing demands of imperial expansion and the inadequacy and inefficiency of the underfunded British Army, <a href="Militia%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Militia</a>, <a href="Yeomanry">Yeomanry</a> and <a href="Volunteer%20Force%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Volunteer Force</a> after the Napoleonic Wars led to the late-19th-century <a href="Cardwell%20Reforms">Cardwell</a> and <a href="Childers%20Reforms">Childers Reforms</a>, which gave the army its modern shape and redefined its <a href="regimental%20system">regimental system</a>. The 1907 <a href="Haldane%20Reforms">Haldane Reforms</a> created the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> as the army's volunteer reserve component, merging and reorganising the Volunteer Force, Militia and Yeomanry.

Great Britain has been challenged by other powers, primarily the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> and the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> during the 20th century. A century earlier it vied with Napoleonic France for global pre-eminence, and <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">Hannoverian</a> Britain's natural allies were the kingdoms and principalities of <a href="northern%20Germany">northern Germany</a>. By the middle of the 19th century, Britain and France were allies in preventing Russia's appropriation of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> (although the fear of French invasion led shortly afterwards to the creation of the Volunteer Force. By the first decade of the 20th century, the United Kingdom was allied with France (by the <a href="Entente%20Cordiale">Entente Cordiale</a>) and Russia (which had a secret agreement with France for mutual support in a war against the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n-led German Empire and the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>).

When the First World War broke out in August 1914 the British Army sent the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF), consisting mainly of <a href="Standing%20army">regular army</a> troops, to <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">France and Belgium</a>. The fighting bogged down into static <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a> for the remainder of the war. In 1915 the army created the <a href="Mediterranean%20Expeditionary%20Force">Mediterranean Expeditionary Force</a> to invade the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> via <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a>, an unsuccessful attempt to capture <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and secure a sea route to <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>.

World War I was the most devastating in <a href="Military%20history%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British military history</a>, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over two million wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed and was replaced first by <a href="Kitchener%27s%20Army">volunteers</a> and then a <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">conscript</a> force. Major battles included those at <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">the Somme</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Passchendaele</a>. Advances in technology saw the advent of the <a href="tank">tank</a> (and the creation of the <a href="Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">Royal Tank Regiment</a>) and advances in aircraft design (including the creation of the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>) which would be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use of <a href="Chemical%20weapons%20in%20World%20War%20I">chemical weapons</a> (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.

The <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> broke out in September 1939 with the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a>'s <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a>. British assurances to the Poles led the British Empire to declare war on <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a>. As in the First World War, a relatively-small <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">BEF</a> was sent to France and hastily evacuated from <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">Dunkirk</a> as the German forces <a href="Battle%20of%20France">swept through the Low Countries and across France</a> in May 1940.

After the US entered the war and the British Army recovered from its earlier defeats, it defeated the Germans and Italians at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a> in <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a> in 1942–1943 and helped drive them from Africa. It then fought through <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Italy</a> and, with the help of American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and Free French forces, took part in the <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day invasion of Normandy</a> on 6 June 1944; nearly half the Allied soldiers were British. In the <a href="South-East%20Asian%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Far East</a>, the British Army rallied against the Japanese in the <a href="Burma%20Campaign">Burma Campaign</a> and regained the British Far Eastern colonial possessions.

After the Second World War the British Army was significantly reduced in size, although <a href="National%20Service">National Service</a> continued until 1960. This period saw <a href="decolonisation">decolonisation</a> begin with the <a href="partition%20of%20India">partition</a> and <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">independence</a> of India and Pakistan, followed by the independence of British colonies in Africa and Asia. Although the British Army was a major participant in <a href="1st%20Commonwealth%20Division">Korea</a> in the early 1950s and <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez</a> in 1956, during this period Britain's role in world events was reduced and the army was downsized. The <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a>, consisting of <a href="I%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">I (BR) Corps</a>, remained in Germany as a bulwark against Soviet invasion. The <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> continued, with significant technological advances in warfare, and the army saw the introduction of new weapons systems. Despite the decline of the British Empire, the army was engaged in <a href="Aden%20Emergency">Aden</a>, <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia</a>, <a href="EOKA">Cyprus</a>, <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Kenya</a> and <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malaya</a>. In 1982, the British Army and the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> helped liberate the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a> during the <a href="Falklands%20War">conflict with Argentina</a> after that country's invasion of the British territory.

In the three decades following 1969, the army was heavily deployed in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>'s <a href="Operation%20Banner">Operation Banner</a> to support the <a href="Royal%20Ulster%20Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> (later the <a href="Police%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">Police Service of Northern Ireland</a>) in their conflict with republican paramilitary groups. The locally recruited <a href="Ulster%20Defence%20Regiment">Ulster Defence Regiment</a> was formed, becoming home-service battalions of the <a href="The%20Royal%20Irish%20Regiment%20%2827th%20%28Inniskilling%29%2083rd%20and%2087th%20and%20Ulster%20Defence%20Regiment%29">Royal Irish Regiment</a> in 1992 before it was disbanded in 2006. Over 700 soldiers were killed during <a href="the%20Troubles">the Troubles</a>. Following the 1994–1996 <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">IRA</a> ceasefires and since 1997, demilitarisation has been part of the peace process and the military presence has been reduced. On 25 June 2007 the 2nd Battalion of the <a href="Princess%20of%20Wales%27s%20Royal%20Regiment">Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment</a> left the army complex in <a href="The%20Troubles%20in%20Bessbrook">Bessbrook</a>, <a href="County%20Armagh">County Armagh</a>, ending the longest operation in British Army history.

The British Army contributed 50,000 troops to the coalition which fought <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20War">Persian Gulf War</a>, and British forces controlled <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> after its liberation. Forty-seven British military personnel died during the war.

The army was deployed to <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> in 1992. Initially part of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Protection%20Force">United Nations Protection Force</a>, in 1995 its command was transferred to the <a href="Implementation%20Force">Implementation Force</a> (IFOR) and then to the <a href="Stabilisation%20Force%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> (SFOR); the commitment rose to over 10,000 troops. In 1999, British forces under SFOR command were sent to <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and the contingent increased to 19,000 troops. Between early 1993 and June 2010, 72 British military personnel died during operations in the former Yugoslavian countries of Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia.

Although there have been permanent garrisons in Northern Ireland throughout its history, the British Army was deployed as a peacekeeping force from 1969 to 2007 in <a href="Operation%20Banner">Operation Banner</a>. Initially, this was (in the wake of <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland">unionist</a> attacks on nationalist communities in <a href="Derry">Derry</a> and <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>) to prevent further loyalist attacks on Catholic communities; it developed into support of the <a href="Royal%20Ulster%20Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> (RUC) and its successor, the <a href="Police%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">Police Service of Northern Ireland</a> (PSNI) against the <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> (PIRA). Under the 1998 <a href="Good%20Friday%20Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a>, there was a gradual reduction in the number of soldiers deployed. In 2005, after the PIRA declared a ceasefire, the British Army dismantled posts, withdrew many troops and restored troop levels to those of a peace-time garrison.

Operation Banner ended at midnight on 31 July 2007 after about 38 years of continuous deployment, the longest in British Army history. According to an internal document released in 2007, the British Army had failed to defeat the IRA but made it impossible for them to win by violence. Operation Helvetic replaced Operation Banner in 2007, maintaining fewer service personnel in a more-benign environment. From 1971 to 1997, a total of 763 British military personnel were killed during the Troubles. About 300 deaths during the conflict were attributed to the British Army, including paramilitary troops and civilians.

In November 2001, as part of <a href="Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> with the United States, the United Kingdom invaded <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> to topple the <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> in <a href="Operation%20Herrick">Operation Herrick</a>. The <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Division</a> were deployed in <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> to assist in the liberation of the capital and defeat Taliban forces in the mountains. In 2006 the British Army began concentrating on fighting Taliban forces and bringing security to <a href="Helmand%20Province">Helmand Province</a>, with around 9,500 British troops (including marines, airmen and sailors) deployed at its peak—the second-largest force after that of the US. In December 2012 Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> announced that the combat mission would end in 2014, and troop numbers gradually fell as the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Army">Afghan National Army</a> took over the brunt of the fighting. Between 2001 and 26 April 2014 a total of 453 British military personnel died in Afghan operations. Operation Herrick ended with the handover of <a href="Camp%20Bastion">Camp Bastion</a> on 26 October 2014, but the British Army maintains a deployment in Afghanistan as part of <a href="Operation%20Toral">Operation Toral</a>.

In 2003 the United Kingdom was a major contributor to the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a>, sending a force of over 46,000 military personnel. The British Army controlled southern Iraq, maintained a peace-keeping presence in <a href="Basra">Basra</a>. All British troops were withdrawn from Iraq by 30 April 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to extend their mandate. One hundred seventy-nine British military personnel died in Iraqi operations. The <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">British Armed Forces</a> returned to Iraq in 2014 as part of <a href="Operation%20Shader">Operation Shader</a> to counter the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State</a> (ISIL).

The British Army maintains a standing liability to support the civil authorities in certain circumstances, usually in either niche capabilities (e.g. explosive ordance removal) or in general support of the civil authorities when their capacity is exceeded. In recent years this has been seen as Army personnel supporting the civil authorities in the face of the <a href="2001%20United%20Kingdom%20foot-and-mouth%20outbreak">2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak</a>, the 2002 Firefighters strike, widespread flooding in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013 and 2014 and most recently supporting the security services on <a href="Operation%20Temperer">Operation Temperer</a> following the <a href="2017%20Manchester%20Arena%20bombing">2017 Manchester Arena bombing</a>.

The British Army has been a volunteer force since national service ended during the 1960s. Since the creation of the part-time, reserve <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> in 1908 (renamed the Army Reserve in 2014) the full-time British Army has been known as the Regular Army. The size and structure of the army are evolving, and the Ministry of Defence publishes monthly personnel reports. In December 2016 there were 83,360 trained Regulars, 2,850 <a href="Brigade%20of%20Gurkhas">Gurkhas</a> and 26,300 trained <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Army Reservists</a>.

<a href="Future%20of%20the%20British%20Army%20%28Army%202020%20Refine%29">Army 2020</a> followed the <a href="Strategic%20Defence%20and%20Security%20Review%202010">Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010</a> (SDSR). According to the Ministry of Defence, Army 2020 will "ensure that the British Army remains the most capable Army in its class" and enable "it to better meet the security challenges of the 2020s and beyond". The SDSR initially outlined a reduction of the regular British Army by 7,000, to a trained strength of 95,000, by 2015. After the publication of "Future Reserves 2020", another independent review of army structure, it was announced that the Regular Army would be reduced to a trained strength of 82,000 and the Army Reserve would be increased to a trained strength of about 30,000; this would bring the ratio of regular to part-time personnel in line with the US and Canada and integrate the Army Reserve into the Regular Army.

In addition to the regular and reserve armies, all former Regular Army personnel (known as the <a href="Regular%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Regular Reserve</a>) may be recalled for duty as needed. The Regular Reserve has two categories: A and D. Category A is mandatory, with the length of time in the category dependent on time spent in Regular Army service. Category D is voluntary, and consists of personnel who are no longer required to serve in category A. Regular Reserves in both categories serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and may report for training or service overseas and at home, similar to the Army Reserve. In 2007, there were 121,800 Regular Reserves, of which 33,760 served in categories A and D. Beginning in April 2013, the full Regular Reserve strength was no longer reported—only those serving in categories A and D (30,000 in 2015).

The table below illustrates British Army personnel figures from 1710 to 2010. The Army Reserve (Territorial Army) was established in 1908.

The British Army's basic infantry weapon is the <a href="SA80">L85A2</a> assault rifle, sometimes equipped with an <a href="L17A2%20UGL">L17A2</a> under-barrel grenade launcher or other attachments with the <a href="Picatinny%20rail">Picatinny rail</a>. The rifle has several variants, including the <a href="L86%20LSW">L86A2</a>, the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine (issued to tank crews). These weapons are usually equipped with <a href="iron%20sights">iron sights</a> or an optical <a href="SUSAT">SUSAT</a>, although optical sights have been purchased to supplement these.

Support fire is provided by the <a href="FN%20Minimi">FN Minimi</a> light machine gun and the <a href="L7%20%28machine%20gun%29">L7 general-purpose machine gun</a> (GPMG), and indirect fire is provided by <a href="L16%2081mm%20mortar">L16 81mm mortar</a>s. The <a href="Lewis%20Machine%20and%20Tool%20Company">L129A1 sharpshooter rifle</a> was brought into service during the war in Afghanistan to give the infantry a long-range weapon. Sniper rifles include the <a href="L118A1">L118A1</a> 7.62 mm, <a href="L115A3">L115A3</a> and the <a href="AW50F">AW50F</a>, all manufactured by <a href="Accuracy%20International">Accuracy International</a>. Other weapons, such as the <a href="L128A1">L128A1</a> (Benelli M4) combat shotgun, may be temporarily used.

The army's <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a> is the <a href="Challenger%202">Challenger 2</a>. It is supported by the <a href="Warrior%20Infantry%20Fighting%20Vehicle">Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicle</a> as the primary <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a> and the many variants of the <a href="Combat%20Vehicle%20Reconnaissance%20%28Tracked%29">Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)</a> and <a href="FV430%20series">the FV430 series</a>, which had its engines and armour upgraded as the <a href="Bulldog%20APC">Bulldog</a>. Light armoured units often utilise the <a href="MWMIK">Supacat "Jackal" MWMIK</a> and <a href="Coyote%20Reconnaissance%20Vehicle">Coyote</a> for reconnaissance and fire support.

The army has three main artillery systems: the <a href="MLRS">Multi Launch Rocket System</a> (MLRS), the <a href="AS-90">AS-90</a> and the <a href="L118%20light%20gun">L118 light gun</a>. The MLRS, first used in <a href="Operation%20Granby">Operation Granby</a>, has a range. The AS-90 is a 155 mm self-propelled armoured gun with a range. The L118 light gun is a 105 mm towed gun used in support of 16 Air Assault Brigade, 3 Commando Brigade of the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> and the Adaptive Force. To identify artillery targets, the army operates weapon locators such as the <a href="Mobile%20Artillery%20Monitoring%20Battlefield%20Radar">MAMBA Radar</a> and utilises <a href="artillery%20sound%20ranging">artillery sound ranging</a>. For air defence it uses the Short-Range Air Defence (SHORAD) <a href="Rapier%20%28missile%29">Rapier FSC missile system</a>, widely deployed since the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>, and the Very Short-Range Air Defence (VSHORAD) <a href="Starstreak%20%28missile%29">Starstreak HVM</a> (high-velocity missile) launched by a single soldier or from a vehicle-mounted launcher.

Where armour is not required or mobility and speed are favoured the British Army utilises protected patrol vehicles, such as the Panther variant of the <a href="Iveco%20LMV">Iveco LMV</a>, and variants of the <a href="Cougar%20%28vehicle%29">Cougar</a> family (such as the Foxhound, Ridgeback, Husky and Mastiff). For day-to-day utility work the army commonly uses the <a href="Land%20Rover%20Wolf">Land Rover Wolf</a>, which is based on the <a href="Land%20Rover%20Defender">Land Rover Defender</a>.

Specialist engineering vehicles include bomb-disposal robots and the modern variants of the <a href="Armoured%20Vehicle%20Royal%20Engineers">Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers</a>, including the Titan bridge-layer, <a href="Trojan%20Armoured%20Vehicle%20Royal%20Engineers">Trojan</a> combat-engineer vehicle, <a href="Terrier%20Armoured%20Digger">Terrier Armoured Digger</a> and <a href="Python%20Minefield%20Breaching%20System">Python Minefield Breaching System</a>. Day-to-day utility work uses a series of support vehicles, including six-, nine- and fifteen-tonne trucks (often called "Bedfords", after a historic utility vehicle), heavy-equipment transporters (HET), close-support tankers, quad bikes and ambulances. Tactical communication uses the <a href="Bowman%20%28communications%20system%29">Bowman</a> radio system, and operational or strategic communication is controlled by the <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Signals">Royal Corps of Signals</a>.

The <a href="British%20Army%20Air%20Corps">Army Air Corps</a> (AAC) provides direct aviation support, with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> providing support helicopters. The primary attack helicopter is the <a href="Westland%20WAH-64%20Apache">Westland WAH-64 Apache</a>, a <a href="Licensed%20production">licence-built</a>, modified version of the US <a href="AH-64%20Apache">AH-64 Apache</a> which replaced the Westland Lynx AH7 in the anti-tank role. Other helicopters include the <a href="Westland%20Gazelle">Westland Gazelle</a> (a light surveillance aircraft), the <a href="Bell%20212">Bell 212</a> (in jungle "hot and high" environments) and the <a href="AgustaWestland%20AW159%20Wildcat">AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat</a>, a dedicated <a href="intelligence%2C%20surveillance%2C%20target%20acquisition%2C%20and%20reconnaissance">intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance</a> (ISTAR) helicopter. The <a href="Eurocopter%20Dauphin">Eurocopter AS 365N Dauphin</a> is used for <a href="special%20operations">special operations</a> aviation, and the <a href="Britten-Norman%20Islander">Britten-Norman Islander</a> is a light, fixed-wing aircraft used for airborne reconnaissance and <a href="command%20and%20control">command and control</a>. The army operates two <a href="unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">unmanned aerial vehicle</a>s ('UAV's) in a surveillance role: the small <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20Desert%20Hawk%20III">Lockheed Martin Desert Hawk III</a> and the larger <a href="Thales%20Watchkeeper%20WK450">Thales Watchkeeper WK450</a>.

British Army structure is broadly similar to that of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, with a single command (based in <a href="Andover%2C%20Hampshire">Andover, Hampshire</a>) known as "<a href="Army%20Headquarters%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Army Headquarters</a>". Under the Army 2020 Command structure, the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> is in charge of Army Headquarters. There are four lieutenant-general posts in Army headquarters: <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Deputy Chief of the General Staff</a>, <a href="Commander%20Field%20Army">Commander Field Army</a>, Commander <a href="Allied%20Rapid%20Reaction%20Corps">Allied Rapid Reaction Corps</a> and <a href="Commander%20Home%20Command">Commander Home Command</a>. Army Headquarters is responsible for providing forces at operational readiness for employment by the <a href="Permanent%20Joint%20Headquarters">Permanent Joint Headquarters</a>.

The command structure is hierarchical, with <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> and <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s controlling groups of units. Major units are <a href="regiment">regiment</a>- or <a href="battalion">battalion</a>-sized, and minor units are <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>-sized units (or <a href="platoons">platoons</a>). All units are Regular (full-time) or <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Army Reserve</a> (part-time).

Naming conventions of units differ for historical reasons, creating some confusion; the term "battalion" in the infantry is synonymous with a cavalry, artillery or engineer regiment, and the infantry "company" is synonymous with an engineer or cavalry squadron and an artillery battery. The table below illustrates the different names for equivalent units.

Adding to the confusion is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The <a href="Royal%20Logistic%20Corps">Royal Logistic Corps</a> and <a href="Intelligence%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Intelligence Corps</a> are not <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.

The field forces of the British Army after the <a href="Army%202020">Army 2020</a> reforms are organised in garrison as:
For operational tasks the most common unit is the <a href="Battlegroup%20%28army%29">battlegroup</a>, formed around a combat unit and supported by units (or sub-units) from other areas. An example of a battlegroup in the Reactive Force (e.g. the 1st Brigade) would be two companies of armoured infantry (e.g. from the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment), one squadron of heavy armour (e.g. A Squadron of the Royal Tank Regiment), a company of engineers (e.g. B Company of the 22nd Engineer Regiment), a battery of artillery (e.g. D Battery of the 1st Regiment of the Royal Horse Artillery) and smaller attachments from medical, logistic and intelligence units. Typically organised and commanded by a battlegroup headquarters and named after the unit which provided the most combat units, in this example it would be the 1 Mercian Battlegroup). This creates a self-sustaining mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically 600 to 1,000 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel.

The table below demonstrates how three or four battlegroups make up a <a href="brigade">brigade</a> and three or four brigades make up a <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division.</a> A division is currently the largest unit the British Army is capable of deploying independently, although it could be grouped with three or four other divisions from a multi-national coalition to form a <a href="corps">corps</a>.

The British Army contributes two of the three <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> formations to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Special%20Forces">United Kingdom Special Forces</a> directorate: the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service%2322%20SAS%20Regiment">Special Air Service</a> and <a href="Special%20Reconnaissance%20Regiment">Special Reconnaissance Regiment</a>s. The <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> consists of one regular-army and two reserve regiments. The regular regiment, 22 SAS, has its headquarters and depot in <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a> and consists of five squadrons (A, B, D, G and Reserve) and a training wing. 22 SAS is supported by two reserve regiments: <a href="Artists%20Rifles">21 SAS</a> and 23 SAS—collectively, the Special Air Service (Reserve) (SAS [R])—under the command of the <a href="1st%20Intelligence%2C%20Surveillance%20and%20Reconnaissance%20Brigade">1st Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade</a>.

The <a href="Special%20Reconnaissance%20Regiment">Special Reconnaissance Regiment</a> (SRR), formed in 2005, performs close reconnaissance and special surveillance tasks. The <a href="Special%20Forces%20Support%20Group">Special Forces Support Group</a>, under the operational control of the Director of Special Forces, provides operational manoeuvring support to the United Kingdom Special Forces.

The British Army historically included many units from what are now separate <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> "realms". When the <a href="English%20Empire">English Empire</a> was established in North America, Bermuda, and the West Indies in the early Seventeenth Century there was no standing English Army, only the Militia, and this was extended to the colonies. Colonial Militias defended colonies single-handedly at first against Indigenous peoples and European competitors. Once the standing English Army, later the British Army, came into existence, the colonial Militias fought side-by-side with it in a number of wars, including the <a href="Seven%20Years%20War">Seven Years War</a>. Some of the colonial Militias rebelled during the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American War of Independence</a>. Militia fought alongside the regular British Army (and Native allies) in defending British North America from their former countrymen during the <a href="American%20War%20of%201812">American War of 1812</a>. With the growth of the Empire around the world, "Non-European" (ie., non-white, except for officers) units were recruited in many colonies and <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a>s, but most were deemed auxiliaries and not part of the British Army. The <a href="West%20India%20Regiment">West India Regiment</a>s were an exception, as they were fully incorporated into the British Army, but were kept outside of Europe and non-whites were denied commissions. Locally-raised units in strategically-located colonies (including Bermuda, Gibraltar, Malta) and the Channel Islands were generally more fully integrated into the British Army as evident from their appearances in British Army Lists, unlike units such as <a href="King%27s%20African%20Rifles">King's African Rifles</a>. The larger colonies (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, et cet.) mostly achieved <a href="Dominion">Commonwealth Dominion</a> status before or after the First World War and were granted granted full legislative independence in 1931. While remaining within the British Empire, this placed their governments on a par with the British Government, and hence their military units comprised separate armies (e.g. the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>), although Canada retained the term Militia for its military forces until the Second World War. From the 1940s, these Dominions and many colonies chose full independence, usually becoming <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>s (as member states of the Commonwealth are known today).

Units raised in <a href="Self-governing%20colony">self-governing</a> and <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colonies</a> that are part of the British Realm remain under UK control. The UK retains responsibility for the defence of the fourteen remaining <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories">British Overseas Territories</a>, of which four have locally raised regiments:

Although the army primarily recruits within the United Kingdom, it accepts applications from <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> citizens and (occasionally) those from friendly nations who meet certain criteria. In 2016, it was decided to open all roles to women in 2018; women had not been permitted to join the <a href="Combat%20Arms">Combat Arms</a>. The British Army is an equal-opportunity employer (with some exceptions due to its medical standards), and does not discriminate based on race, religion or sexual orientation.

The minimum age is 16 (after the end of <a href="GCSE">GCSE</a>s), although soldiers under 18 may not serve in operations. The maximum recruitment age was raised in January 2007 from 26 to 33 years, and the maximum age for Army Reserve soldiers is higher. A soldier would traditionally enlist for a term of 22 years, although recently there has been a shift towards 12-year terms with a 22-year option. A soldier is not normally permitted to leave until they have served for at least four years, and must give 12 months' notice.

All soldiers must take an oath of allegiance upon joining the Army, a process known as attestation. Those who wish to swear by <a href="God%20in%20Abrahamic%20religions">God</a> use the following words:

Others replace the words "swear by Almighty God" with "solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm".

<a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%20Sandhurst">Royal Military Academy Sandhurst</a> (RMAS) is the officer-training school, and <a href="Royal%20School%20of%20Artillery">Royal School of Artillery</a> (RSA) trains the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>. <a href="Royal%20School%20of%20Military%20Engineering">Royal School of Military Engineering</a> (RSME) trains the Corps of <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>.

The Army Training Regiment, Grantham provides training for Army Reserve recruits, and the Army Training Regiment, Pirbright provides training for the <a href="Army%20Air%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Army Air Corps</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Signals">Royal Corps of Signals</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Logistic%20Corps">Royal Logistic Corps</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Electrical%20and%20Mechanical%20Engineers">Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers</a>, the <a href="Adjutant%20General%27s%20Corps">Adjutant General's Corps</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a> and the <a href="Intelligence%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Intelligence Corps</a>. The Army Training Regiment, Winchester trains the <a href="Royal%20Armoured%20Corps">Royal Armoured Corps</a>, the <a href="Army%20Air%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Army Air Corps</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Signals">Royal Corps of Signals</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Logistic%20Corps">Royal Logistic Corps</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Electrical%20and%20Mechanical%20Engineers">Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers</a>, the <a href="Adjutant%20General%27s%20Corps">Adjutant General's Corps</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a> and the <a href="Intelligence%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Intelligence Corps</a>.

There is an <a href="Infantry%20Training%20Centre%20%28British%20Army%29">Infantry Training Centre at Catterick</a> and an <a href="Infantry%20Battle%20School">Infantry Battle School</a> in Brecon. Other training centres are the <a href="Army%20Foundation%20College">Army Foundation College</a> (Harrogate) and <a href="Army%20Training%20Unit">Army Training Unit</a>s.

The army's official flag is the 3:5 <a href="Aspect%20ratio">ratio</a> <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a>, although a non-ceremonial flag flies at the Ministry of Defence building in Whitehall and is often used at recruiting and military events and exhibitions. It represents the army on the <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">Cenotaph</a> at <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London, the UK memorial to its war dead. Each British Army unit has a set of flags, known as the <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">colours</a>—normally a Regimental Colour and a Queen's Colour (the Union Jack).


<a href="Abeyance">Rank in abeyance</a>.

Each regiment and corps has distinctive insignia, such as a <a href="cap%20badge">cap badge</a>, <a href="beret">beret</a>, <a href="tactical%20recognition%20flash">tactical recognition flash</a> or <a href="stable%20belt">stable belt</a>. Many units also call soldiers of different ranks by different names; a NATO OR-1 (private) is called a guardsman in Guards regiments, a gunner in artillery units and a sapper in engineer units. These names do not affect a soldier's pay or role.

The British Army uniform has sixteen categories, ranging from ceremonial uniforms to combat dress to evening wear. No. 8 Dress, the day-to-day uniform, is known as "Personal Clothing System – Combat Uniform" (PCS-CU) and consists of a <a href="Multi-Terrain%20Pattern">Multi-Terrain Pattern</a> (MTP) windproof smock, a lightweight jacket and trousers with ancillary items such as <a href="Long%20underwear">thermals</a> and <a href="Raincoat">waterproofs</a>. The army has introduced <a href="tactical%20recognition%20flash">tactical recognition flash</a>es (TRFs); worn on the right arm of a combat uniform, the insignia denotes the wearer's regiment or corps.

Working <a href="Headgear">headdress</a> is typically a <a href="beret">beret</a>, whose colour indicates its wearer's type of regiment. Beret colours are:

In addition to working dress, the army has a number of parade uniforms for ceremonial and non-ceremonial occasions. The most-commonly-seen uniforms are No.1 Dress (full ceremonial, seen at formal occasions such as at the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace) and No.2 Dress (Service Dress), a brown uniform worn for non-ceremonial parades.

Bayesian probability

Bayesian probability is an <a href="Probability%20interpretations">interpretation of the concept of probability</a>, in which, instead of <a href="frequentist%20probability">frequency</a> or <a href="propensity%20probability">propensity</a> of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal belief.

The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of <a href="propositional%20logic">propositional logic</a> that enables reasoning with hypotheses, i.e., the propositions whose <a href="truth%20value">truth or falsity</a> is uncertain. In the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis, whereas under <a href="frequentist%20inference">frequentist inference</a>, a hypothesis is typically tested without being assigned a probability.

Bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies some <a href="prior%20probability">prior probability</a>, which is then updated to a <a href="posterior%20probability">posterior probability</a> in the light of new, relevant <a href="data">data</a> (evidence). The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation.

The term "Bayesian" derives from the 18th century mathematician and theologian <a href="Thomas%20Bayes">Thomas Bayes</a>, who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of <a href="Bayesian%20inference">Bayesian inference</a>. Mathematician <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> pioneered and popularised what is now called Bayesian probability.

Broadly speaking, there are two views on Bayesian probability that interpret the "probability" concept in different ways. According to the "objectivist view", probability is a reasonable expectation that represents the state of knowledge, can be interpreted as an extension of <a href="logic">logic</a>, and its rules can be justified by <a href="Cox%27s%20theorem">Cox's theorem</a>. According to the "subjectivist view", probability quantifies a personal belief, and its rules can be justified by requirements of rationality and coherence following from the <a href="Dutch%20book">Dutch book</a> argument or from the <a href="decision%20theory">decision theory</a> and <a href="de%20Finetti%27s%20theorem">de Finetti's theorem</a>.

Bayesian methods are characterized by concepts and procedures as follows:

Broadly speaking, there are two interpretations on Bayesian probability. For "<a href="Objectivity%20%28philosophy%29">objectivists</a>", interpreting probability as extension of <a href="logic">logic</a>, "probability" quantifies the reasonable expectation everyone (even a "robot") sharing the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by <a href="Cox%27s%20theorem">Cox's theorem</a>. For "<a href="Subjectivism">subjectivists</a>", "probability" corresponds to a personal belief. Rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose; the constraints are justified by the <a href="Dutch%20book">Dutch book</a> argument or by the <a href="decision%20theory">decision theory</a> and <a href="de%20Finetti%27s%20theorem">de Finetti's theorem</a>. The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.

The term "Bayesian" refers to <a href="Thomas%20Bayes">Thomas Bayes</a> (1702–1761), who proved a special case of what is now called <a href="Bayes%27%20theorem">Bayes' theorem</a> in a paper titled "<a href="An%20Essay%20towards%20solving%20a%20Problem%20in%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20Chances">An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances</a>". In that special case, the prior and posterior distributions were <a href="Beta%20distribution">Beta distribution</a>s and the data came from <a href="Bernoulli%20trial">Bernoulli trial</a>s. It was <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> (1749–1827) who introduced a general version of the theorem and used it to approach problems in <a href="celestial%20mechanics">celestial mechanics</a>, medical statistics, <a href="Reliability%20%28statistics%29">reliability</a>, and <a href="jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a>. Early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace's <a href="principle%20of%20insufficient%20reason">principle of insufficient reason</a>, was called "<a href="inverse%20probability">inverse probability</a>" (because it <a href="Inductive%20reasoning">infer</a>s backwards from observations to parameters, or from effects to causes). After the 1920s, "inverse probability" was largely supplanted by a collection of methods that came to be called <a href="frequentist%20statistics">frequentist statistics</a>.

In the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace developed in two directions, giving rise to "objective" and "subjective" currents in Bayesian practice.
<a href="Harold%20Jeffreys">Harold Jeffreys</a>' "Theory of Probability" (first published in 1939) played an important role in the revival of the Bayesian view of probability, followed by works by <a href="Abraham%20Wald">Abraham Wald</a> (1950) and <a href="Leonard%20J.%20Savage">Leonard J. Savage</a> (1954). The adjective "Bayesian" itself dates to the 1950s; the derived "Bayesianism", "neo-Bayesianism" is of 1960s coinage.
In the objectivist stream, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed and the data analysed. No subjective decisions need to be involved. In contrast, "subjectivist" statisticians deny the possibility of fully objective analysis for the general case.

In the 1980s there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods, mostly attributed to the discovery of <a href="Markov%20chain%20Monte%20Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> methods and the consequent removal of many of the computational problems, and to an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications. While frequentist statistics remains strong (as seen by the fact that most undergraduate teaching is still based on it ), Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, e.g., in the field of <a href="machine%20learning">machine learning</a>.

The use of Bayesian probabilities as the basis of <a href="Bayesian%20inference">Bayesian inference</a> has been supported by several arguments, such as <a href="Cox%27s%20theorem">Cox axioms</a>, the <a href="Dutch%20book">Dutch book argument</a>, arguments based on <a href="decision%20theory">decision theory</a> and <a href="de%20Finetti%27s%20theorem">de Finetti's theorem</a>.

<a href="Richard%20Threlkeld%20Cox">Richard T. Cox</a> showed that Bayesian updating follows from several axioms, including two <a href="functional%20equations">functional equations</a> and a hypothesis of differentiability. The assumption of differentiability or even continuity is controversial; Halpern found a counterexample based on his observation that the Boolean algebra of statements may be finite. Other axiomatizations have been suggested by various authors with the purpose of making the theory more rigorous.

The Dutch book argument was proposed by de Finetti; it is based on betting. A <a href="Dutch%20book">Dutch book</a> is made when a clever gambler places a set of bets that guarantee a profit, no matter what the outcome of the bets. If a <a href="bookmaker">bookmaker</a> follows the rules of the Bayesian calculus in the construction of his odds, a Dutch book cannot be made.

However, <a href="Ian%20Hacking">Ian Hacking</a> noted that traditional Dutch book arguments did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. For example, <a href="Ian%20Hacking">Hacking</a> writes "And neither the Dutch book argument, nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms, entails the dynamic assumption. Not one entails Bayesianism. So the personalist requires the dynamic assumption to be Bayesian. It is true that in consistency a personalist could abandon the Bayesian model of learning from experience. Salt could lose its savour."

In fact, there are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books (as discussed in the literature on "<a href="probability%20kinematics">probability kinematics</a>" following the publication of <a href="Richard%20Jeffrey">Richard C. Jeffreys</a>' rule, which is itself regarded as Bayesian). The additional hypotheses sufficient to (uniquely) specify Bayesian updating are substantial and not universally seen as satisfactory.

A <a href="statistical%20decision%20theory">decision-theoretic</a> justification of the use of Bayesian inference (and hence of Bayesian probabilities) was given by <a href="Abraham%20Wald">Abraham Wald</a>, who proved that every <a href="admissible%20decision%20rule">admissible</a> statistical procedure is either a Bayesian procedure or a limit of Bayesian procedures. Conversely, every Bayesian procedure is <a href="admissible%20decision%20rule">admissible</a>.

Following the work on <a href="expected%20utility">expected utility</a> <a href="optimal%20decision">theory</a> of <a href="Frank%20P.%20Ramsey">Ramsey</a> and <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">von Neumann</a>, decision-theorists have accounted for <a href="optimal%20decision">rational behavior</a> using a probability distribution for the <a href="Agent-based%20model">agent</a>. Johann Pfanzagl completed the "<a href="Theory%20of%20Games%20and%20Economic%20Behavior">Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</a>" by providing an axiomatization of subjective probability and utility, a task left uncompleted by von Neumann and <a href="Oskar%20Morgenstern">Oskar Morgenstern</a>: their original theory supposed that all the agents had the same probability distribution, as a convenience. Pfanzagl's axiomatization was endorsed by Oskar Morgenstern: "Von Neumann and I have anticipated" the question whether probabilities "might, perhaps more typically, be subjective and have stated specifically that in the latter case axioms could be found from which could derive the desired numerical utility together with a number for the probabilities (cf. p. 19 of The <a href="Theory%20of%20Games%20and%20Economic%20Behavior">Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</a>). We did not carry this out; it was demonstrated by Pfanzagl ... with all the necessary rigor".

Ramsey and <a href="Leonard%20Jimmie%20Savage">Savage</a> noted that the individual agent's probability distribution could be objectively studied in experiments. The role of judgment and disagreement in science has been recognized since <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and even more clearly with <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>. The objectivity of science lies not in the psychology of individual scientists, but in the process of science and especially in statistical methods, as noted by <a href="Charles%20Sanders%20Peirce">C. S. Peirce</a>. Recall that the objective methods for falsifying propositions about personal probabilities have been used for a half century, as noted previously. Procedures for <a href="statistical%20hypothesis%20testing">testing hypotheses</a> about probabilities (using finite samples) are due to <a href="Frank%20P.%20Ramsey">Ramsey</a> (1931) and <a href="Bruno%20de%20Finetti">de Finetti</a> (1931, 1937, 1964, 1970). Both <a href="Bruno%20de%20Finetti">Bruno de Finetti</a> and <a href="Frank%20P.%20Ramsey">Frank P. Ramsey</a> acknowledge their debts to <a href="pragmatic%20philosophy">pragmatic philosophy</a>, particularly (for Ramsey) to <a href="Charles%20Sanders%20Peirce">Charles S. Peirce</a>.

The "Ramsey test" for evaluating probability distributions is implementable in theory, and has kept experimental psychologists occupied for a half century.
This work demonstrates that Bayesian-probability propositions can be <a href="Falsifiability">falsified</a>, and so meet an empirical criterion of <a href="Charles%20Sanders%20Peirce">Charles S. Peirce</a>, whose work inspired Ramsey. (This <a href="falsifiability">falsifiability</a>-criterion was popularized by <a href="Karl%20Popper">Karl Popper</a>.)

Modern work on the experimental evaluation of personal probabilities uses the randomization, <a href="double%20blind">blinding</a>, and Boolean-decision procedures of the Peirce-Jastrow experiment. Since individuals act according to different probability judgments, these agents' probabilities are "personal" (but amenable to objective study).

Personal probabilities are problematic for science and for some applications where decision-makers lack the knowledge or time to specify an informed probability-distribution (on which they are prepared to act). To meet the needs of science and of human limitations, Bayesian statisticians have developed "objective" methods for specifying prior probabilities.

Indeed, some Bayesians have argued the prior state of knowledge defines "the" (unique) prior probability-distribution for "regular" statistical problems; cf. <a href="well-posed%20problem">well-posed problem</a>s. Finding the right method for constructing such "objective" priors (for appropriate classes of regular problems) has been the quest of statistical theorists from Laplace to <a href="John%20Maynard%20Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>, <a href="Harold%20Jeffreys">Harold Jeffreys</a>, and <a href="Edwin%20Thompson%20Jaynes">Edwin Thompson Jaynes</a>. These theorists and their successors have suggested several methods for constructing "objective" priors (Unfortunately, it is not clear how to assess the relative "objectivity" of the priors proposed under these methods):

Each of these methods contributes useful priors for "regular" one-parameter problems, and each prior can handle some challenging <a href="statistical%20model">statistical model</a>s (with "irregularity" or several parameters). Each of these methods has been useful in Bayesian practice. Indeed, methods for constructing "objective" (alternatively, "default" or "ignorance") priors have been developed by avowed subjective (or "personal") Bayesians like <a href="James%20Berger%20%28statistician%29">James Berger</a> (<a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>) and <a href="Jos%C3%A9-Miguel%20Bernardo">José-Miguel Bernardo</a> (<a href="University%20of%20Valencia">Universitat de València</a>), simply because such priors are needed for Bayesian practice, particularly in science. The quest for "the universal method for constructing priors" continues to attract statistical theorists.

Thus, the Bayesian statistician needs either to use informed priors (using relevant expertise or previous data) or to choose among the competing methods for constructing "objective" priors.

Bert Bell

De Benneville "Bert" Bell (February 25, 1895 – October 11, 1959) was the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) commissioner from 1945 until his death in 1959. As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity, and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States (US). He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>.

Bell played football at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where as <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a>, he led his team to an appearance in the <a href="1917%20Rose%20Bowl">1917 Rose Bowl</a>. After being drafted into the US Army during World War I, he returned to complete his collegiate career at Penn and went on to become an assistant football coach with the <a href="Penn%20Quakers%20football">Quakers</a> in the 1920s. During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, he was an assistant coach for the <a href="Temple%20Owls%20football">Temple Owls</a> and a co-founder and co-owner of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>.

With the Eagles, Bell led the way in cooperating with the other NFL owners to establish the <a href="National%20Football%20League%20Draft">National Football League Draft</a> in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the team and bought a share in the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Bell astutely argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion.

After the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling policy, negotiated a merger with the <a href="All-America%20Football%20Conference">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC), and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on enhancing the dramatic effect of late-season matches. During the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Television">Golden Age of Television</a>, he tailored the game's rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media and enforced a policy of blacking out local broadcasts of home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amid criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>, he unilaterally recognized the <a href="National%20Football%20League%20Players%20Association">NFLPA</a> and facilitated in the development of the first pension plan for the players. He survived to oversee the <a href="1958%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">"Greatest Game Ever Played"</a> and to envision what the league would become in the future.

Bell was born de Benneville Bell, on February 25, 1895, in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> to <a href="John%20C.%20Bell%20%28lawyer%29">John C. Bell</a> and Fleurette de Benneville Myers. His father was an attorney who served a term as the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Attorney%20General">Pennsylvania Attorney General</a>. His older brother, <a href="John%20C.%20Bell%2C%20Jr.">John C., Jr.</a>, was born in 1892. Bert's parents were very wealthy, and his mother's lineage predated the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. His father, a <a href="Penn%20Quakers">Quaker</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> (class of 1884) during the <a href="History%20of%20American%20football">early days of American football</a>, accompanied him to his first football game when Bell was six years old. Thereafter, Bell regularly engaged in football games with childhood friends.

In 1904, Bell matriculated at the <a href="Episcopal%20Academy">Episcopal Academy</a>, the <a href="Delancey%20School">Delancey School</a> from 1909 to 1911 and then the <a href="Haverford%20School">Haverford School</a> until 1914. About this time, his father was installed as athletics director at Penn and helped form the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA). At Haverford, Bell captained the school's football, basketball, and baseball teams, and "was awarded The Yale Cup <nowiki>[for being]</nowiki> 'The pupil who has done the most to promote athletics in the school.'" Although he excelled at baseball, his devotion was to football. His father, who was named a trustee at Penn in 1911, said of Bell's plans for college, "Bert will go to Penn or he will go to hell."

Bell entered Penn in the fall of 1914 as an English major and joined <a href="Phi%20Kappa%20Sigma">Phi Kappa Sigma</a>. In a rare occurrence for a sophomore, he became the starting quarterback for Penn's coach <a href="George%20H.%20Brooke">George H. Brooke</a>. On the team, he also was as a defender, punter, and punt returner. After the team's 3–0 start, Bell temporarily shared possession of his quarterbacking duties until he subsequently reclaimed them later in the season, as Penn finished with a record of 3–5–2.

Prior to Penn's 1916 season, his mother died while he was en route to her bedside. Nevertheless, he started the first game for the Quakers under new coach <a href="Bob%20Folwell">Bob Folwell</a>, but mixed results left him platooned for the rest of the season. Penn finished with a record of 7–2–1. However, the Quakers secured an invitation to the <a href="1917%20Rose%20Bowl">1917 Rose Bowl</a> against the <a href="Oregon%20Ducks">Oregon Ducks</a>. Although the best offensive gain for Penn during their 20–14 loss to Oregon was a 20-yard run by Bell, he was replaced late in the game at quarterback after throwing an interception.

In the 1917 season, Bell led Penn to a 9–2 record. Afterwards, he registered with a Mobile Hospital Unit of the US Army for <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and was deployed to <a href="France">France</a> in May 1918. As a result of his unit participating in hazardous duty, it received a congratulatory letter for bravery from <a href="General%20officer">General</a> <a href="John%20J.%20Pershing">John J. Pershing</a>, and Bell was promoted to <a href="first%20sergeant">first sergeant</a>. After the war, Bell returned to the United States in March 1919. He returned to Penn as captain of the team in the fall and again performed erratically. The Quakers finished 1919 with a 6–2–1 record. Academically, his aversion to attending classes forced him to withdraw from Penn without a degree in early 1920. His collegiate days ended with his having been a borderline <a href="All-America">All-America</a>n, but this period of his life had proven that he "possessed the qualities of a leader."

Bell assembled the <a href="Stanley%20Professionals">Stanley Professionals</a> in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any games because of negative publicity received by Chicago due the <a href="Black%20Sox%20Scandal">Black Sox Scandal</a>. He joined <a href="John%20Heisman">John Heisman</a>'s staff at Penn as an assistant coach in 1920, and Bell would remain there for several years. At Penn, he was well regarded as a football coach, and after its 1924 season, he drew offers for, but declined, head-coaching assignments at other universities. At least as early as 1926, his avocation was socializing and frequenting <a href="Saratoga%20Race%20Course">Saratoga Race Course</a>, where he counted as friends <a href="Tim%20Mara">Tim Mara</a>, <a href="Art%20Rooney">Art Rooney</a>, and <a href="George%20Preston%20Marshall">George Preston Marshall</a>. In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the emphasis of in-season scrimmages during practices by <a href="Lud%20Wray">Lud Wray</a>, a fellow assistant coach. Bell's resignation was accommodated prior to the start of the 1929 season.

Bell was then an employee of the <a href="Ritz-Carlton">Ritz-Carlton</a> in Philadelphia. At one point, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $) during the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>. His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz. From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the <a href="Temple%20Owls%20football">Temple Owls football</a> team. In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When <a href="Glenn%20Scobey%20Warner">Pop Warner</a> was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.

By early 1933, Bell's opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. After being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the <a href="Blue%20law">Pennsylvania Blue Laws</a> would have to be mollified, he was the "force majeure" in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. He borrowed funds from <a href="Frances%20Upton">Frances Upton</a>, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>.

After the inaugural <a href="1933%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season">1933 Philadelphia Eagles season</a>, Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the <a href="Ed%20Thorp%20Memorial%20Trophy">Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy</a> was affirmed. In <a href="1934%20NFL%20season">1934</a>, the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the <a href="1936%20NFL%20Draft">first draft</a> kicked off, at which he acted as <a href="Master%20of%20Ceremonies">Master of Ceremonies</a>. Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.

In the Eagles' first three years, the partners exhausted $85,000 (presently, $), and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of $4,500 (presently, $). Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles, wherein Bell led the Eagles to an 1–11 finish, their worst record ever. In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games. During the Eagles' 2-8-1 <a href="1937%20NFL%20season">1937 season</a>, his second child, <a href="Upton%20Bell">John "Upton"</a>, was born. In the Eagles' first profitable season, <a href="1938%20NFL%20season">1938</a>, they posted a 5–6 record. The Eagles finished 1–9–1 in <a href="1939%20NFL%20season">1939</a> and 1–10 in <a href="1940%20NFL%20season">1940</a>.

In December 1940, Bell conciliated the sale of Rooney's Steelers to <a href="Alexis%20Thompson%20%28American%20football%20owner%29">Alexis Thompson</a>, and then Rooney acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles. In a series of events known as the "Pennsylvania Polka", Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their "territorial rights" in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh. Ostensibly, Rooney had provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers. Bell became the Steelers head coach and Rooney became the general manager.

During the training camp of the Pittsburgh's inaugural season with the nickname Steelers, Bell was buoyant with optimism about the team's prospect, but he became crestfallen after Rooney denigrated the squad and flippantly remarked that they looked like the "[s]ame old Steelers" (SOS). After losing the first two games of the <a href="1941%20NFL%20season">1941 season</a>, Rooney compelled Bell into resigning as head coach. Bell's coaching career ended with a 10–46–2 record, his 0.179 winning percentage is second lowest in NFL history to only <a href="Phil%20Handler">Phil Handler</a>'s 0.105 for coaches with at least five seasons. And at 36 games under .500 he held the record for futility until <a href="John_McKay_%28American_football%29">John McKay</a> passed him in 1983 and <a href="Marion%20Campbell">Marion Campbell</a> passed him in 1988. His first daughter and last child, Jane Upton, was born several months after the season's conclusion.

By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters had been drafted into the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States Armed Forces</a> for <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The resulting difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared they might not be able to resume operations easily after the war, and since <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> was continuing unabated, then they should also.

Throughout Bell's affiliation with the Steelers, he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the franchise from him. Compounding Bell's problems, <a href="Arch%20Ward">Arch Ward</a> organized the <a href="All-America%20Football%20Conference">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC) in 1944 to displace the NFL's sovereignty in professional football. Ward's AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league, which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically. In <a href="Bill%20Dudley">Bill Dudley</a>'s contract proceedings with the Steelers, he attributed Bell's anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC. Furthermore, by the end of 1945, the Steelers were in their most economically perilous situation in its history.

<a href="Elmer%20Layden">Elmer Layden</a> was appointed the first NFL commissioner in 1941, but Ward appeared as dictating his hiring. Layden tendered his resignation for personal reasons January 1946. Bell, who was not well respected in Pittsburgh, was elected to replace him. He received a three-year contract at $20,000 ($) per year, and transacted a sale of his stake in the Steelers to Rooney, albeit for a price Bell did not construe was full-value. He was then immediately placed at the center of a controversy wherein the owners denied <a href="Dan%20Reeves%20%28NFL%20owner%29">Dan Reeves</a> permission to relocate the <a href="History%20of%20the%20St.%20Louis%20Rams%23NFL%20Cleveland%20Rams%20%281937%E2%80%931945%29">Cleveland Rams</a> to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Bell moderated a settlement, and, as a result, the <a href="History%20of%20the%20St.%20Louis%20Rams%23Los%20Angeles%20Rams%20%281946%E2%80%931979%29">Los Angeles Rams</a> were formed. As a precondition to the Rams leasing the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Coliseum">Los Angeles Coliseum</a>, they signed <a href="Kenny%20Washington%20%28American%20football%29">Kenny Washington</a>, which marked the beginning of the end of racial segregation on the field, but also caused "'all hell to break loose'" amidst the owners.

The drawing up of a regular season schedule had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. The crux of the problem was the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule. He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.

On the eve of the <a href="1946%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">1946 championship game</a>, Bell was notified that <a href="Merle%20Hapes">Merle Hapes</a> and <a href="Frank%20Filchock">Frank Filchock</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> had been implicated in a bribing scandal. Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes was suspended. At the next NFL owners' meeting, Bell was worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing. However, he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year. Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs.

Subsequently, he wrote an anti-gambling resolution into the league constitution, which empowered him with the ability to permanently ban any NFL associated personnel for betting on a game or for withholding information on a game being possibly fixed. Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games, and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game. Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events and put employees on the payroll of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams.

The NFL's struggle against the AAFC generated stress on wages, attendance, marketing, and by <a href="1949%20NFL%20season">1949</a>, it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years. Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless. In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had a negative impact on the sale of home tickets. Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL's first television contract—the <a href="1949%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">1949 championship game</a>. Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from <a href="Bill%20Radovich">Bill Radovich</a>, who had been <a href="Hollywood%20blacklist">blacklisted</a> for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC. Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell.

One of the primary impediments in an AAFC-NFL merger was the supposed violation of "territorial rights" claimed by Marshall. Eventually, Bell gathered enough support to effectuate a compromise with the AAFC. In late 1949, the leagues merged, and Bell would stay on as commissioner with his contract extended from five to ten years as three AAFC teams (the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>, and <a href="Baltimore%20Colts%20%281947%E2%80%931950%29">Baltimore Colts</a>) were subsumed. Seeking to capitalize on the publicity of the residual rivalry, he utilized "exquisite dramatic" and business sense and allocated the <a href="1950%20NFL%20season">1950</a> opening game to a contest between the <a href="1949%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season">1949 champion Eagles</a> versus the perennial AAFC champion Browns. Feeling financially secure after the merger, he purchased his first home for himself and his family in <a href="Narberth%2C%20Pennsylvania">Narberth, Pennsylvania</a>.

In 1950, Bell originated a blackout rule into the NFL which forbid all teams to televise their home games within a 75-mile radius of their stadium – except for the Rams. Consequently, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) opened an investigation into a violation of the <a href="Sherman%20Antitrust%20Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>. Ensuingly, the Rams attendance for 1950 dropped off by 50%, and this signaled a potential financial disaster. In 1951, he licensed the <a href="DuMont%20Television%20Network">DuMont Television Network</a> to air the championship games for the next five years, and he stipulated that teams were free to develop their own television contracts independently.

However, preceding 1951 season, he reimposed the blackout rule on all teams in the league. The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, "You can't give fans a game for free on TV and also expect them to go to the ballpark"; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952. After the 1951 season ended, he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL. He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week, and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally between all the teams. In the DOJ's case, the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract; Bell was ecstatic. Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns' football games. Although he hated to fly, at some indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league.

Bell authorized a <a href="Pro%20Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> to be held at the end of each season in order to showcase the talents of the best players. But in the early 1950s, on the field activities sometimes denigrated to borderline "assault and battery" with teams' star players being viciously targeted by opposing players. He answered charges the league was too savage by saying, "'I have never seen a maliciously dirty football player in my life and I don't believe there are any.'" Nevertheless, he ordered broadcasts to follow a strict rule of conduct whereby TV announcers would not be permitted to criticize the game, and neither fights, nor injuries, could be televised by virtue in his belief that announcers were "'salesman for professional football <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> we do not want kids believing that engaging in fights is the way to play football.'"

Bell was criticized for censoring TV broadcasts, a charge he dismissed as not pertinent because he believed he was not impeding the print media but only advertising a product. After CBS and NBC gained the rights to broadcast the games in 1956, he advised the franchises to avoid criticizing the games or the officials, and forewarned that TV would give "'us our greatest opportunity to sell the <nowiki>NFL</nowiki> and everyone must present to the public the greatest games ... combined with the finest sportsmanship.'" This relationship with television was the beginning of the NFL's rise to becoming America's most popular sport.

In <a href="Radovich%20v.%20National%20Football%20League">Radovich v. National Football League</a>, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> ruled in Radovich's favor and declared the NFL was subject to antitrust laws, and the implication was that the legality of the draft and <a href="reserve%20clause">reserve clause</a> were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">House Judiciary</a> committee, chaired by <a href="Emanuel%20Celler">Emanuel Celler</a>—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. <a href="Red%20Grange">Red Grange</a> and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.

However, Bell was speaking only for himself and without the auspices of the owners. At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a "super-majority". Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.

For the 1958 season, the durations of timeouts was extended from 60 to 90 seconds and Bell mandated officials call a few "TV timeouts" during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters. The <a href="1958%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">1958 championship game</a> became the first NFL championship game decided in overtime and it was considered to be the greatest football game ever played. The game further increased football's marketability to television advertising, and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst. Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, <a href="Raymond%20Berry">Raymond Berry</a> attributed it to Bell's realization of the impact the game would have on the prevalence of the sport.

The death of Mara in February 1959 unsettled Bell and he experienced a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> later that month. He converted to Catholicism in the summer of 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife, Mara's death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney, a practicing Catholic. Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, "I'd rather die watching football than in my bed with my boots off." Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at <a href="Franklin%20Field">Franklin Field</a> on October 11, 1959. The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans. Sitting behind the end zone during the fourth quarter of the game, he suffered a heart attack and died later that day.

Afterwards, he was remembered as "a man of buoyant joviality, <nowiki> with a rough and ready wit,</nowiki> laughter and genuine humility and honesty, clearly innocent of pretense and <nowiki>[pretension]</nowiki>." His funeral was held at Narberth's St. Margaret Roman Catholic Church and Monsignor Cornelius P. Brennan delivered the eulogy, as close friends and admirers attended the mass. <a href="Dominic%20Olejniczak">Dominic Olejniczak</a> and all the extant owners of the NFL franchises were pallbearers. Bell was interred at Calvary Cemetery in <a href="West%20Conshohocken%2C%20Pennsylvania">West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania</a>.

Bell was inducted into the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Professional Football Hall of Fame</a>, the <a href="Penn%20Athletics%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Penn Athletics Hall of Fame</a>, the <a href="Philadelphia%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame</a>, and <a href="Haverford%27s%20Athletic%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Haverford's Athletic Hall of Fame</a>. The <a href="Maxwell%20Football%20Club">Maxwell Football Club</a>, which he founded in 1937, has presented the best NFL player of the year with the <a href="Bert%20Bell%20Award">Bert Bell Award</a> since 1959. The <a href="Playoff%20Bowl">Bert Bell Benefit Bowl</a> was exhibited in his honor from 1960 through 1969.

Though his career spanned the <a href="Black%20players%20in%20American%20professional%20football">desegregation and reintegration of the NFL</a>, as an owner, he never had an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd. Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph. Although he did not have the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games, he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers, and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.

Bell was criticized as being too strict with his refusal to let sold-out games to be televised locally. Nevertheless, his balancing of television broadcasts against protecting game attendance made the NFL the "healthiest professional sport in America", and he was the "leading protagonist in pro football's evolution into America's major sport." He had understood that the league needed a cooperative television contract with revenue-sharing, but he failed to overcome the obstacles to achieve it. He was portrayed by sportswriters as ensuring the owners treated the players fairly, and his decision to recognize the NFLPA in the face of adversity from owners was a "master stroke" in thwarting Congressional intervention. After he initiated terms for a pension plan with the players in 1959, little progress was made with the NFLPA, however, the first players' pension plan-the Bert Bell National Football League Retirement Plan, was approved in 1962.

Bell's implementation of the draft did not show immediate results, but it was "the single greatest contributor to the <nowiki>[league]'s</nowiki> prosperity" in its first eighty-four years. His original version of the draft was later ruled unconstitutional, but his anchoring of the success of the league to competitive balance has been "hailed by contemporaries and sports historians". Bell had often said, "<nowiki>[o]</nowiki>n any given Sunday, any team in <nowiki>the NFL</nowiki> can beat any other team."

Bob Costas

Robert Quinlan Costas (born March 22, 1952) is an American sportscaster, on the air for <a href="NBC%20Sports">NBC Sports</a> television since the early 1980s. He was the prime-time host of 12 <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>, from <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992</a> until <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016</a>. Costas currently does play-by-play for <a href="MLB%20Network">MLB Network</a> and hosts an interview show called "Studio 42 with Bob Costas".

Costas was born in <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and grew up in <a href="Commack%2C%20New%20York">Commack</a>, New York. He is the son of Jayne (Quinlan), of <a href="Irish%20American">Irish</a> descent, and John George Costas, an electrical engineer of <a href="Greek%20American">Greek</a> descent. His father's ancestry can be traced back to the island of <a href="Kalymnos">Kalymnos</a> in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> in Greece.

He graduated from <a href="Commack%20School%20District">Commack High School South</a> and attended <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a>, Syracuse, New York. In 1973, he began his professional career at WSYR TV and Radio in Syracuse, while still completing his Communications degree at the <a href="S.I.%20Newhouse%20School%20of%20Public%20Communications">S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications</a>. After graduating in 1974, he joined <a href="KMOX">KMOX</a> Radio in St. Louis, Missouri.

In 2001, Syracuse University honored Costas with the George Arents Award, SU’s highest alumni honor, for "Excellence in Sports Broadcasting". In 2013, the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications honored him with the first Marty Glickman Award for Leadership in Sports Media.

Costas' sportscasting career began while attending Syracuse University, serving as an announcer for the <a href="Syracuse%20Blazers">Syracuse Blazers</a> minor-league hockey team playing in the <a href="Eastern%20Hockey%20League">Eastern Hockey League</a> and <a href="North%20American%20Hockey%20League">North American Hockey League</a>.

At age 22, he went to KMOX, calling play-by-play for the <a href="Spirits%20of%20St.%20Louis">Spirits of St. Louis</a> of the <a href="American%20Basketball%20Association">American Basketball Association</a> in 1974. Later he would call <a href="Missouri%20Tigers%20men%27s%20basketball">Missouri Tigers basketball</a> and co-host KMOX's "Open Line" call-in program.

He was a prominent contributor to the ABA book "<a href="Loose%20Balls">Loose Balls</a>: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association". He is extensively quoted on many topics. The book includes his reflections of ABA life during his tenure as radio voice of the Spirits of St. Louis.

Costas later did play-by-play for <a href="Chicago%20Bulls">Chicago Bulls</a> broadcasts on <a href="WGN-TV">WGN-TV</a> during the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Chicago%20Bulls%20season">1979–1980 NBA season</a>. He was also employed by <a href="CBS%20Sports">CBS Sports</a> as a regional <a href="NFL%20on%20CBS">CBS NFL</a> and <a href="NBA%20on%20CBS">CBS NBA</a> announcer from 1976 to 1979, after which he moved to NBC.

When Costas was hired by NBC, <a href="Don%20Ohlmeyer">Don Ohlmeyer</a>, who at the time ran the network's sports division, told the then 28-year-old Costas that he looked like a 14-year-old. Costas would recite this anecdote during an appearance on "<a href="Late%20Night%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien">Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a>". Ohlmeyer based his reaction on Costas's modest stature (Costas is 5'7") and boyish, baby-faced appearance.

For many years, Costas hosted NBC's <a href="NFL%20on%20NBC">National Football League</a> coverage and <a href="NBA%20on%20NBC">NBA</a> coverage. He also did play-by-play for <a href="NBA%20on%20NBC">National Basketball Association</a> and <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20NBC">Major League Baseball</a> coverage.

With the introduction of the <a href="NBCSN">NBC Sports Network</a>, Costas also became the host of the new monthly interview program "<a href="Costas%20Tonight">Costas Tonight</a>".

On March 30, 2015, it was announced Costas would join forces with <a href="Marv%20Albert">Marv Albert</a> (blow-by-blow) and <a href="Al%20Michaels">Al Michaels</a> (host) on the April 11, 2015 edition of NBC's <a href="Prime%20time">primetime</a> "<a href="Boxing%20on%20NBC">PBC on NBC</a>" boxing series. Costas was added to serve as a special contributor for the event from <a href="Barclays%20Center">Barclays Center</a> in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>. He would narrate and write a feature on the storied history of boxing in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

He has also hosted <a href="Golf%20Channel%20on%20NBC">NBC</a>'s coverage of the <a href="U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29">U.S. Open</a> golf tournament.

For <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20NBC">baseball telecasts</a>, he teamed with <a href="Sal%20Bando">Sal Bando</a> (<a href="1982%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1982</a>), <a href="Tony%20Kubek">Tony Kubek</a> (from <a href="1983%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1983</a> to <a href="1989%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1989</a>), and <a href="Joe%20Morgan">Joe Morgan</a> and <a href="Bob%20Uecker">Bob Uecker</a> (from <a href="1994%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1994</a> to <a href="2000%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">2000</a>).

One of his most memorable broadcasts occurred on June 23, 1984 (in what would go down in baseball lore as "<a href="The%20Sandberg%20Game">The Sandberg Game</a>"). Costas, along with Tony Kubek, was calling the Saturday baseball "<a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20NBC">Game of the Week</a>" from Chicago's <a href="Wrigley%20Field">Wrigley Field</a>. The game between the <a href="1984%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season">Chicago Cubs</a> and <a href="1984%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in particular was cited for putting <a href="Ryne%20Sandberg">Ryne Sandberg</a> (as well as the <a href="1984%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season">1984 Cubs</a> in general, who would go on to make their first postseason appearance since <a href="1945%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season">1945</a>) "on the map". In the ninth inning, the Cubs, trailing 9–8, faced the premier relief pitcher of the time, <a href="Bruce%20Sutter">Bruce Sutter</a>. Sandberg, then not known for his power, slugged a home run to left field against the Cardinals' ace closer. Despite this dramatic act, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again in the tenth inning, facing a determined Sutter with one man on base. Sandberg then shocked the national audience by hitting a second home run, even farther into the left field bleachers, to tie the game again. The Cubs went on to win in the 11th inning. When Sandberg hit that second home run, Costas said, ""Do you believe it?!"" The Cardinals' <a href="Willie%20McGee">Willie McGee</a> hit for the cycle in the same game.

While hosting Game 4 of the <a href="1988%20World%20Series">1988 World Series</a> between the <a href="1988%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and <a href="1988%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Oakland Athletics</a> on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, Costas angered many members of the Dodgers (especially the team's manager, <a href="Tommy%20Lasorda">Tommy Lasorda</a>) by commenting before the start of the game that the Dodgers quite possibly were about to put up the weakest-hitting lineup in World Series history. That comment ironically fired up the Dodgers' competitive spirit. Later (while being interviewed by NBC's <a href="Marv%20Albert">Marv Albert</a>), after the Dodgers had won Game 4 (en route to a 4–1 series victory), Lasorda sarcastically suggested the MVP of the 1988 World Series should be Bob Costas.

Besides calling the <a href="1989%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1989 American League Championship Series</a> for NBC, Costas also filled-in for a suddenly ill <a href="Vin%20Scully">Vin Scully</a>, who had come down with <a href="laryngitis">laryngitis</a>, for Game 2 of the <a href="1989%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">1989 National League Championship Series</a> alongside <a href="Tom%20Seaver">Tom Seaver</a>. Game 2 of the NLCS took place on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night. Afterward, Costas flew back to Toronto, where he resumed work on the ALCS the next night.

Bob Costas anchored NBC's pre- and post-game shows for NFL broadcasts and the pre and post-game shows for numerous World Series and <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a>s during the 1980s (the first being for the <a href="1982%20World%20Series">1982 World Series</a>). Costas did not get a shot at doing play-by-play (as the games on NBC were previously called by Vin Scully) for an All-Star Game until <a href="1994%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1994</a> and a World Series until <a href="1995%20World%20Series">1995</a> (when NBC split the coverage with <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> under "<a href="The%20Baseball%20Network">The Baseball Network</a>" umbrella), when NBC regained Major League Baseball rights after a four-year hiatus (when the broadcast network television contract moved over to <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20CBS">CBS</a>, exclusively). It was not until <a href="1997%20World%20Series">1997</a> when Costas finally got to do play-by-play for a World Series from start to finish. Costas ended up winning a <a href="Sports%20Emmy%20Award">Sports Emmy Award</a> for <a href="Outstanding%20Sports%20Personality%2C%20Play-by-Play">Outstanding Sports Personality, Play-by-Play</a>.

In <a href="1999%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1999</a>, Costas teamed with his then-<a href="NBC">NBC</a> colleague Joe Morgan to call two weekday night telecasts for <a href="ESPN%20Major%20League%20Baseball">ESPN</a>. The first was on <a href="Wednesday%20Night%20Baseball">Wednesday</a>, August 25 with <a href="1999%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Detroit Tigers</a> playing against the <a href="1999%20Seattle%20Mariners%20season">Seattle Mariners</a>. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the <a href="1999%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Atlanta Braves</a> playing against the <a href="1999%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">New York Mets</a>.

When NBC gained the NBA network contract from <a href="NBA%20on%20CBS">CBS</a> in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NBA%20season">1990</a>, Costas hosted the telecasts and was teamed in the studio with ex-<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Lakers</a> coach <a href="Pat%20Riley">Pat Riley</a>. He also hosted the studio program "<a href="NBA%20Showtime">Showtime</a>" and did play-by-play for the <a href="1991%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game">1991 All-Star Game</a>. In <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NBA%20season">1997</a>, Costas began a three-year stint as the lead play-by-play man for "<a href="NBA%20on%20NBC">The NBA on NBC</a>". Costas teamed with <a href="Isiah%20Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a> and <a href="Doug%20Collins%20%28basketball%29">Doug Collins</a> for NBA telecasts (from <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NBA%20season">1997</a> to <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NBA%20season">2000</a>).

NBC enlisted Costas' services after they were forced to (temporarily) remove <a href="Marv%20Albert">Marv Albert</a> from their broadcasts due to lingering personal and legal problems at the time. Costas stepped aside following the <a href="2000%20NBA%20Finals">2000 NBA Finals</a> in favor of a returning Marv Albert. Costas returned to call some games of the <a href="2002%20NBA%20Playoffs">2002 NBA Playoffs</a> after Albert was injured in a car accident two days before the playoffs.

While this, in essence, ended his active role on the "NBA on NBC" program (by this point, <a href="Hannah%20Storm">Hannah Storm</a> and briefly <a href="Ahmad%20Rash%C4%81d">Ahmad Rashād</a> had replaced Costas on studio anchoring duties), Costas would return to do play-by-play for selected playoff games. Costas also co-anchored (with <a href="Hannah%20Storm">Hannah Storm</a>) NBC's NBA Finals coverage in <a href="2002%20NBA%20Finals">2002</a>, which was their last to-date (before the NBA's network television contract moved to <a href="NBA%20on%20ABC">ABC</a>).

NBC Sports allowed Costas to opt out from having to cover the <a href="XFL">XFL</a>. He publicly denigrated the league throughout its existence and remains a vocal critic of the league and its premise.

In <a href="2006%20NFL%20season">2006</a>, Costas returned to NFL studio hosting duties for NBC's new "<a href="NBC%20Sunday%20Night%20Football">Sunday Night Football</a>", hosting its pre-game show "<a href="Football%20Night%20in%20America">Football Night in America</a>". Costas last hosted NFL telecasts for NBC in <a href="1992%20NFL%20season">1992</a> before being replaced in the studio by <a href="Jim%20Lampley">Jim Lampley</a> and subsequently, <a href="Greg%20Gumbel">Greg Gumbel</a>. Before becoming the studio host for "<a href="NFL%20on%20NBC">The NFL on NBC</a>" in <a href="1984%20NFL%20season">1984</a>, Costas did play-by-play of NFL games with analyst <a href="Bob%20Trumpy">Bob Trumpy</a>.

Costas is nicknamed "Rapping Roberto" by New York City's "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" sports media columnist Bob Raissman. <a href="Al%20Michaels">Al Michaels</a> also called him "Rapping Roberto" during the telecast between the <a href="2006%20Indianapolis%20Colts%20season">Indianapolis Colts</a> and the <a href="2006%20New%20York%20Giants%20season">New York Giants</a> on September 10, 2006, in response to Costas calling him "Alfalfa".

Costas hosted <a href="NHL%20on%20NBC">NBC's coverage</a> of the <a href="2008%20NHL%20Winter%20Classic">2008</a>, <a href="2009%20NHL%20Winter%20Classic">2009</a>, and the <a href="2010%20NHL%20Winter%20Classic">2010 NHL Winter Classic</a>. He was scheduled to host coverage of the <a href="2011%20NHL%20Winter%20Classic">2011</a> event as well but, due to the game's postponement, Costas only hosted pre-game coverage before leaving to go to <a href="2011%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season">Seattle</a> for his duties with NBC's NFL coverage the next night. He hosted the event in <a href="2012%20NHL%20Winter%20Classic">2012</a> as well as a post-game edition of "<a href="NHL%20Live">NHL Live</a>" on the NBC Sports Network.

Costas has frontlined many Olympics broadcasts for <a href="Olympics%20on%20NBC">NBC</a>. They include the Olympics in <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">Barcelona in 1992</a>, <a href="1996%20Summer%20Olympics">Atlanta in 1996</a>, <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">Sydney in 2000</a>, <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">Salt Lake City in 2002</a>, <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">Athens in 2004</a>, <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">Torino in 2006</a>, <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">Beijing in 2008</a>, <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics">Vancouver in 2010</a>, <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">London in 2012</a>, <a href="2014%20Winter%20Olympics">Sochi in 2014</a> and <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">Rio in 2016</a>. He discusses his work on the Olympic telecasts extensively in a book by Andrew Billings entitled "Olympic Media: Inside the Biggest Show on Television". A personal influence on Costas has been legendary <a href="ESPN%20on%20ABC">ABC Sports</a> broadcaster <a href="Jim%20McKay">Jim McKay</a>, who hosted many Olympics for <a href="Olympics%20on%20ABC">ABC</a> from the 1960s to the 1980s.

During the 1992 Barcelona and 1996 Atlanta Opening Ceremonies, Costas's remarks on <a href="China">China</a>'s teams' possible drug use caused an uproar among the American Chinese and international communities. Thousands of dollars were raised to purchase ads in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" and Sunday "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", featuring an image of the head of a statue of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> and reading: "Costas Poisoned Olympic Spirit, Public Protests NBC". However, Costas' comments were made subsequent to the suspension of Chinese coach Zhou Ming after seven of his swimmers were caught using steroids in 1994. Further evidence of Chinese athletes' drug use came in 1997 when Australian authorities confiscated 13 vials of <a href="Growth%20hormone">Somatropin</a>, a human growth hormone, from the bag of Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan upon her arrival for the <a href="1998%20World%20Aquatics%20Championships">1997 World Swimming Championships</a>. At the World Championships, four Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned substance <a href="Triamterene">Triamterene</a>, a diuretic used to dilute urine samples to mask the presence of anabolic steroids. Including these failed drug tests, 27 Chinese swimmers were caught using performance-enhancing drugs from 1990 through 1997; more than the rest of the world combined.

Along with co-host <a href="Meredith%20Vieira">Meredith Vieira</a> and <a href="Matt%20Lauer">Matt Lauer</a>, Costas' commentary of the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony">2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremonies</a> came under fierce criticism, with Costas being described as making "a series of <a href="jingoistic">jingoistic</a> remarks, including a joke about <a href="Idi%20Amin">Idi Amin</a> when <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>'s team appeared" and the combined commentary as being "ignorant" and "banal".

Following the Olympics, Costas appeared on <a href="Conan%20O%27Brien">Conan O'Brien</a>'s <a href="Conan%20%28talk%20show%29">talk show</a> and jokingly criticized his employer for its decision to air a preview of the upcoming series "<a href="Animal%20Practice">Animal Practice</a>" over a performance by <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a> during the London closing ceremonies. "So here is the balance NBC has to consider: The Who, 'Animal Practice.' <a href="Roger%20Daltrey">Roger Daltrey</a>, <a href="Pete%20Townshend">Pete Townshend</a> – monkey in a lab coat. I'm sure you'd be the first to attest, Conan, that when it comes to the tough calls, NBC usually gets 'em right," Costas said, alluding at the end to O'Brien's involvement in the <a href="2010%20Tonight%20Show%20conflict">2010 "Tonight Show" conflict</a>.

An eye infection Costas had at the start of the <a href="2014%20Winter%20Olympics">2014 Winter Olympics</a> forced him, on February 11, 2014, to cede his Olympic hosting duties to <a href="Matt%20Lauer">Matt Lauer</a> (four nights) and <a href="Meredith%20Vieira">Meredith Vieira</a> (two nights), the first time Costas had not done so at all since the <a href="1998%20Winter%20Olympics">1998 Winter Olympics</a> (as rights were not held by NBC).

Since <a href="2001%20Kentucky%20Derby">2001</a>, Costas has co-hosted the <a href="Kentucky%20Derby">Kentucky Derby</a>.

In 2009, he hosted <a href="Bravo%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">Bravo's</a> coverage of the 2009 <a href="Kentucky%20Oaks">Kentucky Oaks</a>.

On February 9, 2017, Costas announced during "<a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">Today</a>" that he had begun the process of stepping down from his main on-air roles at NBC Sports, announcing in particular that he would cede his role as primetime host for NBC's Olympics coverage to <a href="Mike%20Tirico">Mike Tirico</a> (who joined the network from ESPN in 2016), and that he would host <a href="Super%20Bowl%20LII">Super Bowl LII</a> as his final Super Bowl.

"USA Today" reported that he would similarly step down from "Football Night in America" in favor of Tirico. Costas explained that he was not outright retiring and expected to take on a role at NBC Sports similar to that of <a href="Tom%20Brokaw">Tom Brokaw</a>, being an occasional special correspondent to the division. He explained that his decision "opens up more time to do the things that I feel I'm most connected to, there will still be events, features, and interviews where I can make a significant contribution at NBC, but it will also leave more time for baseball (on MLB Network), and then, at some point down the road, I'll have a chance to do more of the long-form programming I enjoy." Costas told "USA Today" that his gradual retirement was planned in advance, and that he did not want to announce it during the <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016 Summer Olympics</a> or the NFL season because it would be too disruptive, and joked that "I'm glad that Sochi wasn’t the last one. You wouldn't want your pink-eye Olympics to be your last Olympics."

Costas also hosted the syndicated <a href="radio">radio</a> program "Costas Coast to Coast" from 1986 to 1996, which was revived as "<a href="Costas%20on%20the%20Radio">Costas on the Radio</a>". "Costas on the Radio", which ended its three-year run on May 31, 2009, aired on 200 stations nationwide each weekend and syndicated by the <a href="iHeartMedia">Clear Channel</a> owned <a href="Premiere%20Networks">Premiere Radio Networks</a>. During that period, Costas also served as the imaging voice of Clear Channel-owned <a href="KLOU">KLOU</a> in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a> during that station's period as "My 103.3". Like "Later", Costas' radio shows have focused on a wide variety of topics and have not been limited to sports discussion.

Costas hosted "<a href="Later%20%28talk%20show%29">Later with Bob Costas</a>" on NBC from 1988 until 1994. This late night show created by <a href="Dick%20Ebersol">Dick Ebersol</a>, coming on at 1:30 a.m. as the third program in NBC's nightly lineup after "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20Starring%20Johnny%20Carson">The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</a>" and "<a href="Late%20Night%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Night with David Letterman</a>", was something of a break from the typical TV talk show format of the era, featuring Costas and a single guest conversing for the entire half hour, without a band, opening monologue or studio audience. On several occasions, Costas held the guest over for multiple nights, and these in-depth discussions won Costas much praise for his interviewing skills. The show was taped in <a href="GE%20Building">GE Building</a>'s studios 3B or 8H at the <a href="Rockefeller%20Center">Rockefeller Plaza</a>, with Costas interviewing the guest for 45 minutes to an hour before turning the material over to editors who condensed it down to 22 minutes plus commercial breaks. More popular guests were given two or three part interviews that ran consecutive nights. In August 1991, <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a> became the only guest for four consecutive nights in the series' history. The program was critically acclaimed, and twice nominated for Emmy's during its -year run, with Costas as host. It won the Emmy Award for Best Informational Series in 1993.

In June 2005, Costas was named by <a href="CNN">CNN</a> president <a href="Jonathan%20Klein%20%28CNN%29">Jonathan Klein</a> as a regular substitute anchor for <a href="Larry%20King">Larry King</a>'s "<a href="Larry%20King%20Live">Larry King Live</a>" for one year. Costas, as well as Klein, have said Costas was not trying out for King's position on a permanent basis. <a href="Nancy%20Grace">Nancy Grace</a> was also named a regular substitute host for the show.

On August 18, 2005, Costas refused to host a "Larry King Live" broadcast where the subject was missing teenager <a href="Natalee%20Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a>. Costas said that because there were no new developments in the story, he felt it had no news value, and he was uncomfortable with television's drift in the direction of tabloid-type stories.

Beginning in October 2011, Costas was a correspondent for "<a href="Rock%20Center%20with%20Brian%20Williams">Rock Center with Brian Williams</a>". He gained acclaim for his November 2011 live interview of former <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University">Pennsylvania State University</a> assistant coach <a href="Jerry%20Sandusky">Jerry Sandusky</a> concerning <a href="Penn%20State%20child%20sex%20abuse%20scandal">charges of sexual abuse of minors</a>, in which Sandusky called in to deny the charges.

Costas hosts a monthly talk show "Costas Tonight" on <a href="NBC%20Sports%20Network">NBC Sports Network</a>.

In 2001, Costas was hired by <a href="HBO">HBO</a> to host a 12-week series called "<a href="On%20the%20Record%20with%20Bob%20Costas">On the Record with Bob Costas</a>". "On the Record with Bob Costas" was similar to the format of the old "Later" program as they both concentrated on in-depth interviews.

In <a href="2002%20NFL%20season">2002</a>, Costas began a stint as co-host of HBO's long-running series "<a href="Inside%20the%20NFL">Inside the NFL</a>". Costas remained host of "Inside the NFL" through the end of the <a href="2007%20NFL%20season">2007 NFL season</a>. He hosted the show with <a href="Cris%20Collinsworth">Cris Collinsworth</a> and former NFL legends <a href="Dan%20Marino">Dan Marino</a> and <a href="Cris%20Carter">Cris Carter</a>. The program aired each week during the NFL season.

In 2005, "On the Record with Bob Costas" was revamped to become "<a href="Costas%20Now">Costas Now</a>", a monthly issue oriented sports program that occasionally employed a town hall style format.

Costas left HBO to sign with <a href="MLB%20Network">MLB Network</a> in February 2009.

At the channel's launch on January 1, 2009, he hosted the premiere episode of "All Time Games", a presentation of the recently discovered <a href="kinescope">kinescope</a> of Game 5 of the <a href="1956%20World%20Series">1956 World Series</a>. During the episode, he held a forum with <a href="Don%20Larsen">Don Larsen</a>, who pitched MLB's only postseason <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a> during that game, and <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Yogi Berra</a>, who caught the game.

Costas joined the network full-time on February 3, 2009. He hosts a regular interview show titled "MLB Network Studio 42 with Bob Costas" as well as special programming, and provides play-by-play for select live baseball game telecasts.

As aforementioned, Costas is currently hosting "Thursday Night Football" on NBC and NFL Network, having returned to broadcasting after a brief absence.

Costas provided significant contributions to the <a href="Ken%20Burns">Ken Burns</a>, <a href="PBS">PBS</a> mini series "<a href="Baseball%20%28TV%20series%29">Baseball</a>" as well as its follow-up "<a href="Baseball%20%28TV%20series%29">The 10th Inning</a>". He also appears in another PBS film, "<a href="A%20Time%20for%20Champions">A Time for Champions</a>", produced by <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>'s <a href="KETC">Nine Network of Public Media</a>.

Costas is a devoted baseball fan. He's been suggested as a potential <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">commissioner</a> and wrote "Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball" in <a href="2000%20in%20literature">2000</a>. For his 40th birthday, then <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> manager <a href="Tony%20La%20Russa">Tony La Russa</a> allowed Costas to manage the club during a spring training game. The first time Costas visited baseball legend <a href="Stan%20Musial">Stan Musial</a>'s St. Louis eatery, he left a <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>3.31 tip on a ten dollar tab in homage to Musial's lifetime batting average (.331). Costas delivered the <a href="eulogy">eulogy</a> at <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a>'s <a href="funeral">funeral</a>. In eulogizing Mantle, Costas described the baseball legend as ""a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic"." Costas has even carried a <a href="1958%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1958</a> Mickey Mantle <a href="baseball%20card">baseball card</a> in his wallet. Costas also delivered the eulogy for Musial after his death in early 2013.

Costas was outspoken about his disdain for Major League Baseball instituting a playoff <a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29%23Major%20League%20Baseball">wild card</a>. Costas believed it diminishes the significance and drama of winning a divisional championship. He prefers a system in which winning the wild card puts a team at some sort of disadvantage, as opposed to an equal level with teams who outplayed them over a 162-game season. Or, as explained in his book "Fair Ball", have only the three division winners in each league go to the postseason, with the team with the best record receiving a buy-in to the League Championship Series. Once, on the air on <a href="HBO">HBO</a>'s "<a href="Inside%20the%20NFL">Inside the NFL</a>", he mentioned that the NFL regular season counted for something, but baseball's was beginning to lose significance. With the advent of the second wild card, Costas has said he feels the format has improved, since there is now a greater premium placed on finishing first. He has suggested a further tweak: Make the wild card round a best two of three, instead of a single game, with all three games, if necessary, on the homefield of the wild card of the better record.

Costas serves as a member of the advisory board of the <a href="Baseball%20Assistance%20Team">Baseball Assistance Team</a>, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties.

On May 26, 2007, Costas discussed the presidency of <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> on his radio show, stating he liked Bush personally, and had been optimistic about his presidency, but said the course of the Iraq war, and other mis-steps have led him to conclude Bush's presidency had "tragically failed" and considered it "overwhelmingly evident, even if you're a conservative Republican, if you're honest about it, this is a failed administration." The following summer, Costas interviewed Bush during the president's appearance at the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a> in Beijing.

During a segment on the "<a href="NBC%20Sunday%20Night%20Football">Sunday Night Football</a>" halftime show on December 2, 2012, Costas paraphrased <a href="Fox%20Sports%20%28USA%29">Fox Sports</a> columnist <a href="Jason%20Whitlock">Jason Whitlock</a> in regards to <a href="Jovan%20Belcher">Jovan Belcher</a>'s murder-suicide the day prior, stating that the United States' <a href="Gun%20culture%23Present-day%20gun%20culture%20in%20the%20United%20States">gun culture</a> was causing more <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic dispute</a>s to result in death, and that it was likely Belcher and his girlfriend would not have died had he not possessed a gun.

Critics interpreted his remarks as support for <a href="gun%20control">gun control</a>, resulting in mostly negative reactions. Many (including former Republican Presidential candidates <a href="Mike%20Huckabee">Mike Huckabee</a> and <a href="Herman%20Cain">Herman Cain</a>) felt that Costas should not have used a program typically viewed as entertainment to publicize political views on sensitive topics, <a href="Lou%20Dobbs">Lou Dobbs</a> criticized his remarks for supporting the abolishment of the <a href="Second%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Second Amendment</a> by quoting a <a href="sports%20writer">sports writer</a>, while <a href="Andrew%20Levy">Andrew Levy</a> remarked that he had been given a civics lecture by someone who had "gotten rich thanks in part to a sport that destroys men’s bodies and brains." However, liberal reporter <a href="Erik%20Wemple">Erik Wemple</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" praised Costas for speaking out for gun control on the broadcast, feeling that the incident's connection to the NFL provided him with an obligation to acknowledge the incident during the halftime show, stating that "the things that [NFL players] do affect the public beyond whether their teams cover the point spread. And few cases better exemplify that dynamic as powerfully as the Belcher incident."

During the following week, Costas defended his remarks in an appearance on <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a>'s program "<a href="The%20Last%20Word%20with%20Lawrence%20O%27Donnell">The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell</a>", where he stated that the remarks were related to the country's gun culture, and not about gun control as critics had inferred. Costas did suggest that more regulation be placed on America's gun culture: 
"Now, do I believe that we need more comprehensive and more sensible gun control legislation? Yes I do. That doesn't mean repeal the Second Amendment. That doesn't mean a prohibition on someone having a gun to protect their home and their family. It means sensible and more comprehensive gun control legislation. But even if you had that, you would still have the problem of what Jason Whitlock wrote about, and what I agree with. And that is a gun culture in this country."

During his coverage of the <a href="2014%20Winter%20Olympics">2014 Winter Olympics</a>, Costas was criticized by some conservative members of the media, including <a href="Michelle%20Malkin">Michelle Malkin</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Beck">Glenn Beck</a> for supposedly praising <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>’s role in defusing tensions surrounding Syria, and Iran. Several media commentators, including <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28political%20commentator%29">Bill O’Reilly</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Goldberg">Bernard Goldberg</a>, defended Costas’ remarks as factually correct and pointed out that Costas had also voiced considerable criticism of both Russia and Putin while broadcasting from <a href="Sochi">Sochi</a>. During an interview on <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News</a> Goldberg said "... the idea that Costas somehow portrayed Vladimir Putin as a benign figure is ridiculous." Costas defended himself on O'Reilly's broadcast on March 3, reiterating that he criticized Putin immediately preceding, and following, the statements that were questioned. O'Reilly then aired a portion of an Olympic commentary in which Costas was pointedly critical of the Russian leader. Costas also indicated that Senator John McCain, who had been among those who had initially criticized Costas, had called Costas to apologize after hearing the full segment in context.

Costas was married from 1983 to 2001 to Carole "Randy" Randall Krummenacher. They had two children, son Keith (born 1986) and daughter Taylor (born 1989). Costas once jokingly promised <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> center fielder <a href="Kirby%20Puckett">Kirby Puckett</a> that, if he was batting over .350 by the time his child was born, he would name the baby Kirby. Kirby was hitting better than .350, but Bob's son initially was not given a first (or second) name of Kirby. After Puckett reminded Costas of the agreement, the birth certificate was changed to "Keith Michael Kirby Costas". On March 12, 2004, Costas married his second wife, Jill Sutton. Costas and his wife now reside primarily in New York, but he has often said he thinks of St. Louis as his hometown.

Costas's children have also won Sports Emmys; Keith has won two as an <a href="associate%20producer">associate producer</a> on MLB Network's "<a href="MLB%20Tonight">MLB Tonight</a>" and Taylor as an associate producer on NBC's coverage of the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>.

Bamberg

Bamberg () is a town in <a href="Upper%20Franconia">Upper Franconia</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, on the river <a href="Regnitz">Regnitz</a> close to its confluence with the river <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a>. A large part of the town has been a <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> since 1993.

During the post-<a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> centuries of Germanic migration and settlement, the region afterwards included in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Bamberg">Diocese of Bamberg</a> was inhabited for the most part by <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a>. The town, first mentioned in 902, grew up by the castle "" which gave its name to the <a href="Babenberg">Babenberg</a> family. On their extinction it passed to the <a href="Saxony">Saxon</a> house. The area was Christianized chiefly by the monks of the <a href="Rule%20of%20St.%20Benedict">Benedictine</a> <a href="Fulda%20Abbey">Fulda Abbey</a>, and the land was under the spiritual authority of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Diocese of Würzburg</a>.

In 1007, <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry II</a> or "Heinrich II" made Bamberg a family inheritance, the seat of a separate <a href="diocese">diocese</a>. The emperor's purpose in this was to make the Diocese of Würzburg less unwieldy in size and to give Christianity a firmer footing in the districts of <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>, east of Bamberg. In 1008, after long negotiations with the Bishops of Würzburg and <a href="Diocese%20of%20Eichst%C3%A4tt">Eichstätt</a>, who were to cede portions of their dioceses, the boundaries of the new diocese were defined, and <a href="Pope%20John%20XVIII">Pope John XVIII</a> granted the papal confirmation in the same year. Henry II ordered the building of a new <a href="Bamberg%20Cathedral">cathedral</a>, which was consecrated 6 May 1012. The church was enriched with gifts from the <a href="pope">pope</a>, and Henry had it dedicated in honor of him. In 1017 Henry also founded <a href="Michaelsberg%20Abbey%2C%20Bamberg">Michaelsberg Abbey</a> on the "" ("Mount St. Michael"), near Bamberg, a Benedictine abbey for the training of the clergy. The emperor and his wife <a href="Cunigunde%20of%20Luxemburg">Kunigunde</a> gave large temporal possessions to the new diocese, and it received many privileges out of which grew the secular power of the bishop. Pope Benedict VIII visited Bamberg in 1020 to meet Henry II for discussions concerning the Holy Roman Empire. While he was here he placed the diocese in direct dependence on the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>. He also personally consecrated some of Bamberg's churches. For a short time Bamberg was the centre of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. Henry and Kunigunde were both buried in the cathedral.

From the middle of the 13th century onward the <a href="bishop">bishop</a>s were princes of the Empire and ruled Bamberg, overseeing the construction of monumental buildings. In 1248 and 1260 the see obtained large portions of the estates of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Merania">Counts of Meran</a>, partly through purchase and partly through the appropriation of extinguished fiefs. The old <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Bamberg">Bishopric of Bamberg</a> was composed of an unbroken territory extending from <a href="Schl%C3%BCsselfeld">Schlüsselfeld</a> in a northeasterly direction to the <a href="Franconian%20Forest">Franconian Forest</a>, and possessed in addition estates in the Duchies of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Carinthia">Carinthia</a> and <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>, in the <a href="Nordgau%20%28Bavaria%29">Nordgau</a> (the present <a href="Upper%20Palatinate">Upper Palatinate</a>), in <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, and on the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. By the changes resulting from the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>, the territory of this see was reduced nearly one half in extent. Since 1279 the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20city%20of%20Bamberg">coat of arms of the city of Bamberg</a> is known in form of a seal.

The <a href="Bamberg%20witch%20trials">witch trials</a> of the 17th century claimed about one thousand victims in Bamberg, reaching a climax between 1626 and 1631, under the rule of <a href="Prince-Bishop">Prince-Bishop</a> Johann Georg II Fuchs von Dornheim. The famous "<a href="Drudenhaus%20%28prison%29">Drudenhaus</a>" (witch prison), built in 1627, is no longer standing today; however, detailed accounts of some cases, such as that of <a href="Johannes%20Junius">Johannes Junius</a>, remain.

In 1647, the <a href="University%20of%20Bamberg">University of Bamberg</a> was founded as ".

<a href="Bambrzy">Bambrzy</a> (") are German <a href="Poles">Poles</a> who are descended from settlers from the Bamberg area who settled in villages around <a href="Pozna%C5%84">Poznań</a> in the years 1719–1753.

In 1759, the possessions and jurisdictions of the diocese situated in <a href="Austria">Austria</a> were sold to that state. When the secularization of church lands took place (1802) the diocese covered and had a population of 207,000. Bamberg thus lost its independence in 1802, becoming part of <a href="Electorate%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a> in 1803.

Bamberg was first connected to the German rail system in 1844, which has been an important part of its infrastructure ever since. After a communist uprising took control over Bavaria in the years following <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the state government fled to Bamberg and stayed there for almost two years before the Bavarian capital of <a href="Munich">Munich</a> was retaken by "<a href="Freikorps">Freikorps</a>" units (see <a href="Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic">Bavarian Soviet Republic</a>). The first republican constitution of Bavaria was passed in Bamberg, becoming known as the "Bamberger Verfassung" (Bamberg Constitution).

In February 1926 Bamberg served as the venue for the <a href="Bamberg%20Conference">Bamberg Conference</a>, convened by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in his attempt to foster unity and to stifle dissent within the then-young <a href="Nazi%20party">Nazi party</a>. Bamberg was chosen for its location in Upper Franconia, reasonably close to the residences of the members of the dissident northern Nazi faction but still within Bavaria.

In 1973, the town celebrated the 1,000th anniversary of its founding.

Bamberg is located in <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>, north of <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> by railway and east of <a href="W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a>, also by rail. It is situated on the Regnitz river, before it flows into the <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a> river.

Its geography is shaped by the Regnitz and by the foothills of the <a href="Steigerwald">Steigerwald</a>, part of the German uplands. From northeast to southwest, the town is divided into first the Regnitz plain, then one large and several small islands formed by two arms of the Regnitz ('), and finally the part of town on the hills, the "Hill Town" (').

Bamberg extends over seven hills, each crowned by a beautiful church. This has led to Bamberg being called the "Franconian Rome" — although a running joke among Bamberg's tour guides is to refer to Rome instead as the "Italian Bamberg". The hills are Cathedral Hill, Michaelsberg, Kaulberg/Obere Pfarre, Stefansberg, Jakobsberg, Altenburger Hill and Abtsberg.

Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20Climate%20Classification">Köppen Climate Classification</a> subtype for this climate is "" (Marine West Coast Climate/<a href="Oceanic%20climate">Oceanic climate</a>), with a certain continental influence as indicated by average winter nighttime temperatures well below zero.
In 2013 (latest data available) the <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> per inhabitant was €56,723. This places the district 10th out of 96 districts (rural and urban) in Bavaria(overall average: €39,691).

The old town of Bamberg is listed as a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Sites">World Heritage Site</a>, primarily because of its authentic medieval appearance. The town established a documentation centre in 2005 to support World Heritage activities.
Some of the main sights are:


<a href="Bamberg%20Cathedral">Bamberg Cathedral</a> is a late <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> building with four towers. It was founded in 1004 by Emperor Henry II, finished in 1012 and consecrated on 6 May 1012. It was later partially destroyed by fire in 1081. The new cathedral, built by Saint <a href="Otto%20of%20Bamberg">Otto of Bamberg</a>, was consecrated in 1111 and in the 13th century received its present late-Romanesque form.

The cathedral is long, wide, high, and the four towers are each about high. It contains many historic works of art, such as the marble tomb of the founder and his wife, considered one of the greatest works of the sculptor <a href="Tilman%20Riemenschneider">Tilman Riemenschneider</a>, and carved between 1499 and 1513. Another treasure of the cathedral is an <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian statue</a> known as the <a href="Bamberg%20Horseman">Bamberg Horseman</a> ("). This statue, possibly depicting the emperor <a href="Conrad%20III%20of%20Germany">Conrad III</a>, most likely dates to the second quarter of the 13th century. The statue also serves as a symbol of the town of Bamberg.
The ' (New Residence) (1698–1704) was initially occupied by the prince-bishops, and from 1864 to 1867 by the deposed King <a href="Otto%20of%20Greece">Otto of Greece</a>. Its ' (Rose Garden) overlooks the town. It has over 4500 roses.

The is located on the highest of Bamberg's seven hills. It was mentioned for the first time in 1109. Between 1251 and 1553 it was the residence of Bamberg's bishops. Destroyed in 1553 by <a href="Albert%20Alcibiades%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Kulmbach">Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach</a>, it was used, after scanty repairs, only as a prison, and increasingly decayed.

In 1801, A. F. Marcus bought the castle and completely repaired it. His friend, the famous German writer <a href="E.T.A.%20Hoffmann">E.T.A. Hoffmann</a>, who was very impressed by the building, lived there for a while. The next owner, Anton von Greifenstein, in 1818 founded an association to save the castle. This society still maintains the whole property today. The Altenburg today houses a restaurant.

Other churches are the ', an 11th century Romanesque <a href="basilica">basilica</a>; the '; the ' or ' (1320–1387), which has now been restored to its original pure <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> style. The ', 12th century Romanesque (restored), on the Michaelsberg, was formerly the church of the <a href="Rule%20of%20St.%20Benedict">Benedictine</a> <a href="Michaelsberg%20Abbey%2C%20Bamberg">Michaelsberg Abbey</a> secularized in 1803 and now contains the ', or <a href="almshouse">almshouse</a>, and the <a href="museum">museum</a> and municipal art collections.

Of the bridges connecting the sections of the lower town the ' was completed in 1455. Halfway across this, on an island, is the ' or town hall (rebuilt 1744-1756). The lyceum, formerly a <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> college, contains a natural history museum. The old palace (") was built in 1591 on the site of an old residence of the counts of <a href="Babenberg">Babenberg</a>. Monuments include the Maximilian fountain (1880), with statues of <a href="Maximilian%20I%20Joseph%20of%20Bavaria">King Maximilian I of Bavaria</a>, the emperor Henry II and his wife, <a href="Conrad%20III%20of%20Germany">Conrad III</a> and <a href="Otto%20of%20Bamberg">Saint Otto</a>, bishop of Bamberg.

There are also underground tunnels beneath the town. These were originally constructed as mines which supplied sandstone which could be used for construction or as an abrasive cleaner. Mining came to an end in 1920 but a tunnel network remained. The tunnels were used as an <a href="air%20raid%20shelter">air raid shelter</a> during World War II. A part of the network can be visited on a guided tour.

Bamberg is known for its smoked <a href="Rauchbier">Rauchbier</a> and is home to nine breweries, <a href="Brauerei%20F%C3%A4ssla">Brauerei Fässla</a>, <a href="Brauerei%20Greifenklau">Brauerei Greifenklau</a>, Brauerei Heller-Trum (<a href="Schlenkerla">Schlenkerla</a>), <a href="Brauerei%20Kaiserdom">Brauerei Kaiserdom</a>, <a href="Brauerei%20Keesmann">Keesmann Bräu</a>, <a href="Klosterbr%C3%A4u%20Bamberg">Klosterbräu</a>, <a href="Brauerei%20Mahr">Mahrs Bräu</a> and <a href="Brauerei%20Spezial">Brauerei Spezial</a>, and one <a href="brewpub">brewpub</a>, <a href="Ambr%C3%A4usianum%20Bamberg">Ambräusianum</a>.

It takes less than two hours to Munich on the train and about four hours to reach Berlin. But the <a href="Nuremberg%E2%80%93Erfurt%20high-speed%20railway">Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway</a> is currently being constructed through the Thuringian mountains and should shorten the journey time considerably.

East-west connections are poorer. Bamberg is connected to other towns in eastern Upper Franconia such as <a href="Bayreuth">Bayreuth</a>, <a href="Coburg">Coburg</a>, and <a href="Kronach">Kronach</a> via the <a href="Bamberg%E2%80%93Hof%20railway">Bamberg–Hof line</a> with trains usually running at least every hour. Connections on the <a href="W%C3%BCrzburg%E2%80%93Bamberg%20railway">Würzburg–Bamberg line</a> to the west are hourly regional trains to Würzburg, which is fully connected to the ICE network. Tourists arriving at <a href="Frankfurt%20International%20Airport">Frankfurt International Airport</a> can take advantage of the new direct connection from Frankfurt main station.

Bamberg is not near any of the major (i.e. single-digit) <a href="autobahns">autobahns</a>.

The Ludwig Canal was opened in 1846 but closed in 1950 after damage during the <a href="World%20War%20II">second world war</a>. With the completion of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in 1992, uninterrupted water transport was again made possible between the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>.

Local public transport within Bamberg relies exclusively on buses. More than 20 routes connect the outlying quarters and some villages in the vicinity to the central bus station. In addition, there are several "Night Lines" (the last of these, though, tend to run around midnight) and some <a href="park-and-ride">park-and-ride</a> lines from parking lots on the periphery to the town centre. A short-lived tram system existed in the 1920s.

Bamberg was an important base for the Bavarian, German and then American military stationed at <a href="Warner%20Barracks%20in%20Bamberg%2C%20Germany">Warner Barracks</a>. Warner Barracks was closed in the fall of 2014, with the last battalion leaving being the 54th Engineer Battalion and returned to the German government. In 2016, a large part of the facility was taken over by the <a href="German%20Federal%20Police">German Federal Police</a> for training purposes.
Muna Kasserne was a small base occupied by the 504th Maintenance Company, 71st Maintenance Bn. It was part of Warner Barracks although located separately.

Bamberg is an urban district, or "kreisfreie Stadt". Its town council ("Stadtrat") and its Mayor ("Oberbürgermeister") are elected every six years, though not in the same year. Thus, the last municipal election for the town council was in 2014, for the Mayor in 2012.

The role instead went to <a href="Butch%20Patrick">Butch Patrick</a>. Mumy appeared in one episode as a friend of Eddie's.

Mumy guest starred in an episode of NBC-TV's "<a href="I%20Dream%20of%20Jeannie">I Dream of Jeannie</a>", "Whatever Became of Baby Custer?" (1965). That same year, he also appeared in an episode of "<a href="Bewitched">Bewitched</a>" entitled "Junior Executive" (1965), in which he played a young Darrin Stevens.
Mumy starred in "<a href="Dear%20Brigitte">Dear Brigitte</a>" (1965), a film adaptation of the novel "Erasmus with Freckles", as Erasmus Leaf, a child mathematical genius who develops a crush on <a href="Brigitte%20Bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a> (played by herself in the film). His parents, played by <a href="James%20Stewart">James Stewart</a> and <a href="Glynis%20Johns">Glynis Johns</a>, attempt to manage his obsession.

While notable for several historic roles as both a child and adult actor, Mumy is best known for his iconic television role in a classic 60s science fiction series. From 1965 to 1968, Mumy portrayed Will Robinson in "<a href="Lost%20in%20Space">Lost in Space</a>", who was the recipient of numerous warnings, (most famously "Danger, Will Robinson") from the show's <a href="Robot%20B-9">robot character</a>, voiced by <a href="Dick%20Tufeld">Dick Tufeld</a>.

Mumy was later cast in "<a href="Bless%20the%20Beasts%20and%20Children%20%28film%29">Bless the Beasts and Children</a>" (1971) as Teft, a leader in a group of misfit teenage boys resolved to save a herd of bison from hunters. He also played a musician friend of <a href="Cliff%20DeYoung">Cliff DeYoung</a>'s character in the TV movie "<a href="Sunshine%20%281973%20film%29">Sunshine</a>" (1973), and later reprised the role in "<a href="Sunshine%20Christmas">Sunshine Christmas</a>" and in the TV series "<a href="Sunshine%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Sunshine</a>".

In 1974, he played Nick Butler in the pilot episode of NBC's "<a href="The%20Rockford%20Files">The Rockford Files</a>" and also made an appearance in a later episode in season 1, as a sidewalk artist. In 1996, he was a writer and co-creator of "<a href="Space%20Cases">Space Cases</a>", a <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> television show with themes similar to those of "Lost in Space". He played a <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> officer in the "" episode "<a href="The%20Siege%20of%20AR-558%20%28DS9%20episode%29">The Siege of AR-558</a>" (November 1998), in which he assists in defeating a <a href="Jem%27Hadar">Jem'Hadar</a> fleet. To Mumy's delight, his character was human this time; while playing <a href="Lennier">Lennier</a> in <a href="Babylon%205">Babylon 5</a>, he was required to wear prosthetic makeup. He was more recently seen in a 2006 episode of "<a href="Crossing%20Jordan">Crossing Jordan</a>" and in the <a href="Sci%20Fi">Sci Fi</a> original film "<a href="A.I.%20Assault">A.I. Assault</a>".

Mumy has narrated over 50 episodes of the <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20Network">Arts & Entertainment Channel</a>'s "<a href="Biography%20%28TV%20series%29">Biography</a>" series, as well as hosted and narrated several other documentaries and specials for A & E, <a href="Animal%20Planet">Animal Planet</a> network, <a href="Syfy">The Sci-Fi Channel</a>, and <a href="E%21">E!</a>.

He has done voice over work in national commercials for such businesses as <a href="Bud%20Ice">Bud Ice</a>, <a href="Farmers%20Insurance%20Group">Farmers Insurance</a>, <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a>, <a href="Blockbuster%20%28movie%20rental%20store%29">Blockbuster</a>, <a href="Twix">Twix</a>, <a href="Oscar%20Mayer">Oscar Mayer</a> and <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a>.

Mumy is an accomplished musician who plays the <a href="banjo">banjo</a>, bass, guitar, harmonica, keyboards, <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>, and percussion. His various musical credits include songs he has written and recorded with <a href="America%20%28band%29">America</a>, performed on tour with <a href="Shaun%20Cassidy">Shaun Cassidy</a>, and played with <a href="Rick%20Springfield">Rick Springfield</a>'s band in the film "Hard to Hold". He created the band <a href="The%20Be%20Five">The Be Five</a> with other "Babylon 5" actors.

Mumy has released a number of solo CDs, including "Dying to Be Heard", "In the Current", "Pandora's Box", "After Dreams Come True", "Los Angeles Times" and "Ghosts", as well as nine albums with music partner <a href="Robert%20Haimer">Robert Haimer</a> as <a href="Barnes%20and%20Barnes">Barnes and Barnes</a>. Their most famous hit is the song "<a href="Fish%20Heads%20%28song%29">Fish Heads</a>", which "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine named one of the top 100 videos of all time. He also performs with the Jenerators, a blues-rock band based in Los Angeles featuring Tom Hebenstreit on vocals, electric guitars, and keyboards; Mumy on vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, harmonica, keyboards and percussion; Gary Stockdale on vocals and bass; <a href="Miguel%20Ferrer">Miguel Ferrer</a> on vocals, percussion and drums; David Jolliffe on guitar, percussion and vocals; and Chris Ross on drums and percussion. Additionally, Mumy released a Byrds-tribute song, "When Roger Was Jim" (2012).

Mumy produces and hosts "The Real Good Radio Hour", a weekly series on KSAV Internet Radio focusing on various styles of music and the artists who pioneered them.

In 1996, Mumy and his "Lost in Space" costar <a href="Jonathan%20Harris">Jonathan Harris</a> were reunited at a <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> convention in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>. Mumy worked again with Harris on the retrospective special "Lost In Space: Forever" (1998), where they reprised their roles in a scene written by Mumy (Harris rewrote his own lines). This occurred the year after the rest of the cast (including both Mumy and Harris) stated in a "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" article that the <a href="Syfy">Sci Fi Channel</a> planned to do a "Lost in Space" marathon while promoting a new movie. Harris was to appear in the planned TV movie, "Lost in Space: The Journey Home", but died before production started in 2002, and the production was subsequently cancelled. Mumy read the eulogy at Harris' funeral and was asked to narrate an account of his longtime friend's life on <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20Biography">A&E "Biography"</a> that year.

In a 2010 interview on "Blog Talk Radio"'s "Lessons Learned", Rick Tocquigny was asked if Mumy was a Jonathan Harris fan before they appeared together on "Lost in Space". Tocquigny said that at age five, Mumy was too young to watch his mentor's show "<a href="The%20Third%20Man%20%28TV%20series%29">The Third Man</a>", which would have been aired late at night, but he was old enough to see "<a href="The%20Bill%20Dana%20Show">The Bill Dana Show</a>".

On June 14, 2006, Mumy got to work with Harris one last time, though posthumously. Years before Harris died, he recorded voice work for the animated short "<a href="The%20Bolt%20Who%20Screwed%20Christmas">The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas</a>," narrating the film and playing the part of The Bolt. As a tribute to Harris, writer-director <a href="John%20Wardlaw">John Wardlaw</a> added a scene that reunited "Lost in Space" cast members Mumy, <a href="Marta%20Kristen">Marta Kristen</a>, and <a href="Angela%20Cartwright">Angela Cartwright</a> as the animated Ratchett family.

In May 2013, 11 years after Harris' death in November 2002, Mumy commented on his connection with his friend and acting mentor offscreen and their onscreen connection while working in character as Will Robinson and Dr. Smith oncreen, in "Lost in Space". Mumy noted: "I never really had too many uncomfortable moments working with any actor. I was comfortable working with most everybody. It’s just the more that Jonathan and I did together, the more he changed the character. He really changed the character of Dr. Smith himself. He really turned him from a snarling saboteur villain to this bumbling insulting kook. The more he played it for comedy, the more Irwin Allen liked it. The show really went the way that Jonathan led it. But we had great chemistry together, and we never had a bad day. We were always prepared, as was Bobby May who was inside the robot. When we had our work to do—and I think this is a very big reason [for] the way it went—they’d get us done in a couple of takes. Nobody screwed up. It was easier for the crew and it was easier for us, and people seemed to like it."

Mumy attends "Lost in Space" reunions and shows, and co-authored a 2015 book, "Lost (and Found) in Space" with Angela Cartwright.

Mumy and co-author <a href="Peter%20David">Peter David</a> published the short story, "The Black '59" (1992), in the anthology "Shock Rock", edited by F. Paul Wilson.

Mumy, his wife, Eileen, and their two actor children, Seth and <a href="Liliana%20Mumy">Liliana</a> live in <a href="Laurel%20Canyon%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles</a>.

House of Bonaparte

The House of Bonaparte is an imperial and royal European <a href="dynasty">dynasty</a> founded in 1804 by <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon I</a>, a French military leader who had risen to notability out of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and who in 1804 transformed the <a href="First%20French%20Republic">First French Republic</a> into the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a>, five years after <a href="Coup%20of%2018%20Brumaire">his "coup d'état"</a> of November 1799. Napoleon turned the "<a href="Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e">Grande Armée</a>" against every major European power and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, extending the power of the dynasty.

The House of Bonaparte formed the <a href="Imperial%20House%20of%20France%20%28First%20French%20Empire%29">Imperial House of France</a> during the French Empire, together with some non-Bonaparte family members. In addition to holding the title of <a href="Emperor%20of%20the%20French">Emperor of the French</a>, the Bonaparte dynasty held various other titles and territories during the Napoleonic Wars, including their ancestral <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%28Napoleonic%29">Kingdom of Italy</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Spain">Kingdom of Spain</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Westphalia">Kingdom of Westphalia</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Holland">Kingdom of Holland</a>, and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">Kingdom of Naples</a>. The dynasty held power for around a decade until the Napoleonic Wars began to take their toll. Making very powerful enemies, such as <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austria</a>, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a>, <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>, as well as royalist (particularly <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a>) restorational movements in France, Spain, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Two Sicilies</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, the dynasty eventually collapsed due to the final defeat of Napoleon at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> and the restoration of former dynasties by the <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>.

During the reign of Napoleon I, the Imperial Family consisted of the Emperor's immediate relations – his wife, son, siblings, and some other close relatives, namely <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Joachim Murat</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Fesch">Joseph Fesch</a>, and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Beauharnais">Eugène de Beauharnais</a>.

Between the years 1852 and 1870 there was a <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">Second French Empire</a>, when a member of the Bonaparte dynasty again ruled France: <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>, the son of <a href="Louis%20Bonaparte">Louis Bonaparte</a>. However, during the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870–1871 the dynasty was again ousted from the Imperial Throne. Since that time there has been a series of pretenders. Supporters of the Bonaparte family's claim to the <a href="throne%20of%20France">throne of France</a> are known as <a href="Bonapartists">Bonapartists</a>. Current head <a href="Jean-Christophe%2C%20Prince%20Napol%C3%A9on">Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon</a>, has a Bourbon mother.

The Bonaparte (originally "Buonaparte") family were <a href="Patrician%20%28post-Roman%20Europe%29">patricians</a> in the Italian towns of <a href="Sarzana">Sarzana</a>, <a href="San%20Miniato">San Miniato</a> and <a href="Florence%2C%20Italy">Florence</a>. The name derives from Italian, "buona", "good" and "parte", "part" or "side".
Gianfaldo Buonaparte was the first known Buonaparte at Sarzana around 1200. His descendant 
Giovanni Buonaparte in 1397 married Isabella Calandrini, a cousin of later cardinal <a href="Filippo%20Calandrini">Filippo Calandrini</a>. Giovanni became mayor of Sarzana and was named commissioner of the <a href="Lunigiana">Lunigiana</a> by <a href="Giovanni%20Maria%20Visconti">Giovanni Maria Visconti</a> in 1408. Their great-grandson Francesco Buonaparte was an equestrian <a href="mercenary">mercenary</a> at the service of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoese</a> <a href="Bank%20of%20Saint%20George">Bank of Saint George</a>. In 1490 he went to the island of <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> which was controlled by the bank. In 1493 he married the daughter of Guido da Castelletto, representative of the Bank of Saint George in <a href="Ajaccio">Ajaccio</a>, Corsica. Most of their descendants during subsequent generations were members of the Ajaccio town council. Napoleons father <a href="Carlo%20Buonaparte">Carlo Buonaparte</a> received a patent of nobility by the King of France in 1771.

There also existed a Buonaparte family in <a href="Florence%2C%20Italy">Florence</a>, however its eventual relation with the Sarzana and San Miniato families is unknown. <a href="Jacopo%20Buonaparte">Jacopo Buonaparte</a> of San Miniato was a friend and advisor to <a href="Medici">Medici</a> <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VII">Pope Clement VII</a>. Jacopo was also a witness to and wrote an account of the <a href="sack%20of%20Rome%20%281527%29">sack of Rome</a>, which is one of the most important historical documents recounting that event. Two of Jacopo's nephews, Pier Antonio Buonaparte and Giovanni Buonaparte, however, took part in the 1527 Medici rebellion, after which they were banished from Florence and later were restored by <a href="Alessandro%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Duke%20of%20Florence">Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence</a>. Jacopo's brother Benedetto Buonaparte maintained political neutrality. The San Miniato branch extinguished with Jacopo in 1550. The last member of the Florence family was a canon named Gregorio Bonaparte, who died in 1803, leaving Napoleon as heir.

A Buonaparte tomb lies in the Church of San Francesco in San Miniato, another in Ajaccio, the "Chapelle Impériale", built by Napoleon III. in 1857.

<a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> is the most prominent name associated with the Bonaparte family because he conquered much of the Western world during the early part of the 19th century. He was elected as First Consul of France on 10 November 1799 with the help of his brother, <a href="Lucien%20Bonaparte">Lucien Bonaparte</a>, and president of the <a href="Council%20of%20Five%20Hundred">Council of Five Hundred</a> at <a href="Saint-Cloud">Saint-Cloud</a>. He was crowned Emperor of the French and ruled from 1804–1814, 1815.

Following his conquest of most of Western Europe, Napoleon I made his elder brother <a href="Joseph%20Bonaparte">Joseph</a> (1768–1844) king first of <a href="Naples">Naples</a> (1806–1808) and then of Spain (1808–1813), his younger brother <a href="Louis%20Bonaparte">Louis</a> (1778–1846) King of Holland (1806–1810) (subsequently forcing his abdication after his failure to subordinate Dutch interests to those of France) and his youngest brother <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Bonaparte">Jérôme Bonaparte</a> (1784–1860) King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Westphalia">Westphalia</a>, the short-lived realm created from some of the states of northwestern Germany (1807–1813).

Napoleon's son <a href="Napoleon%20II">Napoléon François Charles Joseph</a> (1811–1832) was created King of Rome (1811–1814) and was later styled Napoléon II by loyalists of the dynasty, though he only ruled for two weeks after his father's abdication. Louis-Napoléon (1808–1873), son of Louis, was President of France in 1848–1852 and Emperor in 1852–1870, reigning as <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>; his son, <a href="Napol%C3%A9on%2C%20Prince%20Imperial">Napoléon, Prince Imperial</a> (1856–1879) died fighting the <a href="Zulu%20people">Zulu</a>s in <a href="Colony%20of%20Natal">Natal</a>, today the South African province of <a href="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a>. With his death, the family lost much of its remaining political appeal, though claimants continue to assert their right to the imperial title. A political movement for Corsican independence surfaced in the 1990s which included a Bonapartist restoration in its programme.







Disputed since 1997:

<a href="Carlo%20Buonaparte">Carlo-Maria</a> (<a href="Ajaccio">Ajaccio</a>, 1746–<a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a>, 1785) married <a href="Letizia%20Ramolino">Maria Letizia Ramolino</a> (Ajaccio, 1750–Rome, 1836) in 1764. He was a minor official in the local courts. They had eight children:


The arms of the Bonaparte family were: "Gules two bends sinister between two mullets or". In 1804 Napoleon I changed the arms to "Azure an imperial eagle or". The change applied to all members of his family except for his brother Lucien and his nephew, the son from Jerome's first marriage.

According to a studies by G.Lucotte and his coauthors based on DNA research since 2011, <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> belonged to <a href="Y-DNA">Y-DNA</a> (direct male ancestry) haplogroup <a href="Haplogroup%20E1b1b%20%28Y-DNA%29%23E1b1b1c%20.28E-M123.29">E1b1b1c1* (E-M34*)</a>. This haplogroup, rare in Europe, has its highest concentration in <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> (Jordan, Yemen). According to the authors of the study, "Probably Napoléon also knew his remote oriental patrilineal origins, because Francesco Buonaparte (the Giovanni son), who was a mercenary under the orders of the Genoa Republic in Ajaccio in 1490, was nicknamed "The <a href="Moors">Maure</a> of <a href="Sarzana">Sarzane</a>" " The latest study identifies the common Bonaparte DNA markers from Carlo (Charles) Bonaparte to 3 living descendants.

Lucotte et al. published in October 2013 the extended Y-STR of Napoleon I based on descendant testing, and the descendants were E-M34, just like the emperor's beard hair tested a year before. The persons tested were the patrilineal descendants of Jérome Bonaparte, one of Napoleon's brothers, and of <a href="Alexandre%20Colonna-Walewski">Alexandre Colonna-Walewski</a>, Napoleon's illegitimate son with Marie Walewska. These three tests all yielded the same Y-STR haplotype (109 markers) confirming with 100% certainty that the first Emperor of the French belonged to the M34 branch of haplogroup E1b1b.

The headship of the family is in dispute between <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20Napol%C3%A9on">Charles, Prince Napoléon</a>, born 1950, great-great-grandson of <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Bonaparte">Jérôme Bonaparte</a> by his second marriage; and his son <a href="Jean-Christophe%2C%20Prince%20Napol%C3%A9on">Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon</a> (born 1986) who was appointed heir in the will of his grandfather <a href="Louis%2C%20Prince%20Napol%C3%A9on">Louis, Prince Napoléon</a>. The only other male member of the family is Charles's recently married brother, <a href="Prince%20J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Napol%C3%A9on">Prince Jérôme Napoléon</a> (born 1957). There are no other legitimate descendants in the male line from Napoleon I or his brothers. There are, however, numerous descendants of Napoleon's illegitimate, but recognized son <a href="Alexandre%20Colonna-Walewski">Alexandre Colonna-Walewski</a> from his union with <a href="Marie%2C%20Countess%20Walewski">Marie, Countess Walewski</a>. A descendant of Napoleon's sister Caroline Bonaparte is the actor <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Auberjonois%20%28actor%29">René Auberjonois</a>. Recent DNA matches with living descendants of Jerome and Count Walewski have confirmed the existence of descendants of Lucien Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, namely the Clovis family.

<doc id="4906" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4906" title="Beta sheet">
Beta sheet

The β-sheet (also β-pleated sheet) is a common motif of regular <a href="protein%20secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a> in <a href="protein">protein</a>s. Beta sheets consist of beta strands (also β-strand) connected laterally by at least two or three backbone <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A β-strand is a stretch of <a href="peptide">polypeptide</a> chain typically 3 to 10 <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s long with backbone in an extended conformation. The supramolecular association of β-sheets has been implicated in formation of the protein aggregates and fibrils observed in many human diseases, notably the <a href="amyloidosis">amyloidoses</a> such as <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

The first β-sheet structure was proposed by <a href="William%20Astbury">William Astbury</a> in the 1930s. He proposed the idea of hydrogen bonding between the <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s of parallel or antiparallel extended β-strands. However, Astbury did not have the necessary data on the bond geometry of the amino acids in order to build accurate models, especially since he did not then know that the <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a> was planar. A refined version was proposed by <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> and <a href="Robert%20Corey">Robert Corey</a> in 1951. Their model incorporated the planarity of the peptide bond which they previously explained as resulting from keto-enol <a href="tautomerization">tautomerization</a>.

The majority of β-strands are arranged adjacent to other strands and form an extensive <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a> network with their neighbors in which the <a href="amine">N−H</a> groups in the backbone of one strand establish <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s with the <a href="carbonyl">C=O</a> groups in the backbone of the adjacent strands. In the fully extended β-strand, successive side chains point straight up, then straight down, then straight up, etc. Adjacent β-strands in a β-sheet are aligned so that their C atoms are adjacent and their side chains point in the same direction. The "pleated" appearance of β-strands arises from tetrahedral chemical bonding at the C atom; for example, if a side chain points straight up, then the bond to the C′ must point slightly downwards, since its bond angle is approximately 109.5°. The pleating causes the distance between C and C to be approximately , rather than the expected from two fully extended "<a href="Cis-trans%20isomerism">trans</a>" <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide</a>s. The "sideways" distance between adjacent C atoms in <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen-bonded</a> β-strands is roughly .

However, β-strands are rarely perfectly extended; rather, they exhibit a twist due to the <a href="chirality%20%28chemistry%29">chirality</a> of their component amino acids. The energetically preferred <a href="dihedral%20angle">dihedral angle</a>s near ("φ", "ψ") = (–135°, 135°) (broadly, the upper left region of the <a href="Ramachandran%20plot">Ramachandran plot</a>) diverge significantly from the fully extended conformation ("φ", "ψ") = (–180°, 180°). The twist is often associated with alternating fluctuations in the <a href="dihedral%20angle">dihedral angle</a>s to prevent the individual β-strands in a larger sheet from splaying apart. A good example of a strongly twisted β-hairpin can be seen in the protein <a href="BPTI">BPTI</a>.

The side chains point outwards from the folds of the pleats, roughly perpendicularly to the plane of the sheet; successive residues point outwards on alternating faces of the sheet.

Because peptide chains have a directionality conferred by their <a href="N-terminal%20end">N-terminus</a> and <a href="C-terminal%20end">C-terminus</a>, β-strands too can be said to be directional. They are usually represented in protein topology diagrams by an arrow pointing toward the C-terminus. Adjacent β-strands can form <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s in antiparallel, parallel, or mixed arrangements.

In an antiparallel arrangement, the successive β-strands alternate directions so that the N-terminus of one strand is adjacent to the C-terminus of the next. This is the arrangement that produces the strongest inter-strand stability because it allows the inter-strand hydrogen bonds between carbonyls and amines to be planar, which is their preferred orientation. The peptide backbone dihedral angles ("φ", "ψ") are about (–140°, 135°) in antiparallel sheets. In this case, if two atoms C and C are adjacent in two <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen-bonded</a> β-strands, then they form two mutual backbone hydrogen bonds to each other's flanking <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide groups</a>; this is known as a close pair of hydrogen bonds.

In a parallel arrangement, all of the N-termini of successive strands are oriented in the same direction; this orientation may be slightly less stable because it introduces nonplanarity in the inter-strand hydrogen bonding pattern. The dihedral angles ("φ", "ψ") are about (–120°, 115°) in parallel sheets. It is rare to find less than five interacting parallel strands in a motif, suggesting that a smaller number of strands may be unstable, however it is also fundamentally more difficult for parallel β-sheets to form because strands with N and C termini aligned necessarily must be very distant in sequence. There is also evidence that parallel β-sheet may be more stable since small amyloidogenic sequences appear to generally aggregate into β-sheet fibrils composed of primarily parallel β-sheet strands, where one would expect anti-parallel fibrils if anti-parallel were more stable.

In parallel β-sheet structure, if two atoms C and C are adjacent in two <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen-bonded</a> β-strands, then they do "not" hydrogen bond to each other; rather, one residue forms hydrogen bonds to the residues that flank the other (but not vice versa). For example, residue "i" may form hydrogen bonds to residues "j" − 1 and "j" + 1; this is known as a wide pair of hydrogen bonds. By contrast, residue "j" may hydrogen-bond to different residues altogether, or to none at all.

Finally, an individual strand may exhibit a mixed bonding pattern, with a parallel strand on one side and an antiparallel strand on the other. Such arrangements are less common than a random distribution of orientations would suggest, suggesting that this pattern is less stable than the anti-parallel arrangement, however bioinformatic analysis always struggles with extracting structural thermodynamics since there are always numerous other structural features present in whole proteins. Also proteins are inherently constrained by folding kinetics as well as folding thermodynamics, so one must always be careful in concluding stability from bioinformatic analysis.

The <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>ing of β-strands need not be perfect, but can exhibit localized disruptions known as <a href="beta%20bulge">β-bulge</a>s.

The hydrogen bonds lie roughly in the plane of the sheet, with the <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide</a> <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> groups pointing in alternating directions with successive residues; for comparison, successive carbonyls point in the "same" direction in the <a href="alpha%20helix">alpha helix</a>.

Large aromatic residues (<a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a>, <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, <a href="tryptophan">tryptophan</a>) and β-branched amino acids (<a href="threonine">threonine</a>, <a href="valine">valine</a>, <a href="isoleucine">isoleucine</a>) are favored to be found in β-strands in the "middle" of β-sheets. Interestingly, different types of residues (such as Pro) are likely to be found in the "edge" strands in β-sheets, presumably to avoid the "edge-to-edge" association between proteins that might lead to aggregation and <a href="amyloid">amyloid</a> formation.

A very simple <a href="structural%20motif">structural motif</a> involving β-sheets is the <a href="beta%20hairpin">β-hairpin</a>, in which two antiparallel strands are linked by a short loop of two to five residues, of which one is frequently a <a href="glycine">glycine</a> or a <a href="proline">proline</a>, both of which can assume the dihedral-angle conformations required for a tight <a href="turn%20%28biochemistry%29">turn</a> or a <a href="beta%20bulge%20loop">β-bulge loop</a>. Individual strands can also be linked in more elaborate ways with longer loops that may contain <a href="alpha%20helix">α-helices</a>.

The Greek key motif consists of four adjacent antiparallel strands and their linking loops. It consists of three antiparallel strands connected by hairpins, while the fourth is adjacent to the first and linked to the third by a longer loop. This type of structure forms easily during the <a href="protein%20folding">protein folding</a> process. It was named after a pattern common to Greek ornamental artwork (see <a href="meander%20%28art%29">meander</a>).

Due to the chirality of their component amino acids, all strands exhibit right handed twist evident in most higher-order β-sheet structures. In particular, the linking loop between two parallel strands almost always has a right-handed crossover chirality, which is strongly favored by the inherent twist of the sheet. This linking loop frequently contains a helical region, in which case it is called a <a href="beta-alpha-beta">β-α-β</a> motif. A closely related motif called a β-α-β-α motif forms the basic component of the most commonly observed protein <a href="tertiary%20structure">tertiary structure</a>, the <a href="TIM%20barrel">TIM barrel</a>.

A simple <a href="structural%20motif">supersecondary</a> protein topology composed of 2 or more consecutive antiparallel β-strands linked together by <a href="beta%20hairpin">hairpin</a> loops. This motif is common in β-sheets and can be found in several structural architectures including <a href="beta%20barrel">β-barrels</a> and <a href="beta%20propeller">β-propellers</a>.

The psi-loop (Ψ-loop) motif consists of two antiparallel strands with one strand in between that is connected to both by hydrogen bonds. There are four possible strand topologies for single Ψ-loops. This motif is rare as the process resulting in its formation seems unlikely to occur during protein folding. The Ψ-loop was first identified in the <a href="aspartic%20acid%20protease">aspartic protease</a> family.

β-sheets are present in <a href="All-%CE%B2%20proteins">all-β</a>, <a href="%CE%91%2B%CE%B2%20proteins">α+β</a> and <a href="%CE%91/%CE%B2%20proteins">α/β</a> domains, and in many <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s or small proteins with poorly defined overall architecture. <a href="All-%CE%B2%20proteins">All-β domains</a> may form <a href="beta%20barrel">β-barrels</a>, β-sandwiches, β-prisms, <a href="Beta-propeller%20domain">β-propellers</a>, and <a href="Beta%20helix">β-helices</a>.

The topology of a β-sheet describes the order of <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen-bonded</a> β-strands along the backbone. For example, the <a href="flavodoxin%20fold">flavodoxin fold</a> has a five-stranded, parallel β-sheet with topology 21345; thus, the edge strands are β-strand 2 and β-strand 5 along the backbone. Spelled out explicitly, β-strand 2 is H-bonded to β-strand 1, which is H-bonded to β-strand 3, which is H-bonded to β-strand 4, which is H-bonded to β-strand 5, the other edge strand. In the same system, the Greek key motif described above has a 4123 topology. The <a href="secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a> of a β-sheet can be described roughly by giving the number of strands, their topology, and whether their <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s are parallel or antiparallel.

β-sheets can be "open", meaning that they have two edge strands (as in the <a href="flavodoxin%20fold">flavodoxin fold</a> or the <a href="immunoglobulin%20fold">immunoglobulin fold</a>) or they can be "closed <a href="beta-barrel">β-barrel</a>s" (such as the <a href="TIM%20barrel">TIM barrel</a>). <a href="beta-barrel">β-Barrels</a> are often described by their "stagger" or "shear". Some open β-sheets are very curved and fold over on themselves (as in the <a href="SH3%20domain">SH3 domain</a>) or form horseshoe shapes (as in the <a href="ribonuclease%20inhibitor">ribonuclease inhibitor</a>). Open β-sheets can assemble face-to-face (such as the <a href="beta-propeller%20domain">β-propeller domain</a> or <a href="immunoglobulin%20fold">immunoglobulin fold</a>) or edge-to-edge, forming one big β-sheet.

β-pleated sheet structures are made from extended β-strand polypeptide chains, with strands linked to their neighbours by <a href="hydrogen%20bonds">hydrogen bonds</a>. Due to this extended backbone conformation, β-sheets resist <a href="Stretching">Stretching</a>. β-sheets in proteins may carry out <a href="low-frequency%20collective%20motion%20in%20proteins%20and%20DNA">low-frequency</a> accordion-like motion as observed by the <a href="Raman%20spectroscopy">Raman spectroscopy</a> and analyzed with the quasi-continuum model.

A <a href="beta%20helix">β-helix</a> is formed from repeating structural units consisting of two or three short β-strands linked by short loops. These units "stack" atop one another in a helical fashion so that successive repetitions of the same strand hydrogen-bond with each other in a parallel orientation. See the <a href="beta%20helix">β-helix</a> article for further information.<br>
In lefthanded β-helices, the strands themselves are quite straight and untwisted; the resulting helical surfaces are nearly flat, forming a regular <a href="triangular%20prism">triangular prism</a> shape, as shown for the 1QRE archaeal carbonic anhydrase at right. Other examples are the lipid A synthesis enzyme <a href="LpxA">LpxA</a> and insect antifreeze proteins with a regular array of Thr sidechains on one face that mimic the structure of ice. <br>

Righthanded β-helices, typified by the <a href="pectate%20lyase">pectate lyase</a> enzyme shown at left or <a href="P22%20phage">P22 phage</a> tailspike protein, have a less regular cross-section, longer and indented on one of the sides; of the three linker loops, one is consistently just two residues long and the others are variable, often elaborated to form a binding or active site. <br>
A two-sided β-helix (right-handed) is found in some bacterial <a href="metalloprotease">metalloprotease</a>s; its two loops are each six residues long and bind stabilizing calcium ions to maintain the integrity of the structure, using the backbone and the Asp side chain oxygens of a GGXGXD sequence motif. This fold is called a β-roll in the SCOP classification.

Some proteins that are disordered or helical as monomers, such as amyloid β (see <a href="amyloid%20plaque">amyloid plaque</a>) can form β-sheet-rich oligomeric structures associated with pathological states. The amyloid β protein's oligomeric form is implicated as a cause of <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's</a>. Its structure has yet to be determined in full, but recent data suggest that it may resemble an unusual two-strand β-helix.

The side chains from the amino acid residues found in a β-sheet structure may also be arranged such that many of the adjacent sidechains on one side of the sheet are hydrophobic, while many of those adjacent to each other on the alternate side of the sheet are polar or charged (hydrophilic), which can be useful if the sheet is to form a boundary between polar/watery and nonpolar/greasy environments.

Beryl

Beryl is a <a href="mineral">mineral</a> composed of <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a> <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> <a href="Silicate%20minerals%23Cyclosilicates">cyclosilicate</a> with the <a href="chemical%20formula">chemical formula</a> BeAl(SiO). Well-known varieties of beryl include <a href="emerald">emerald</a> and <a href="Aquamarine%20%28gemstone%29">aquamarine</a>. Naturally occurring, <a href="Hexagonal%20crystal%20system">hexagonal</a> <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s of beryl can be up to several meters in size, but terminated crystals are relatively rare. Pure beryl is colorless, but it is frequently tinted by impurities; possible colors are green, blue, yellow, red (the rarest), and white.

The name "beryl" is derived (via , , and ) from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> βήρυλλος "beryllos" which referred to a "precious blue-green color-of-sea-water stone"; akin to <a href="Prakrit">Prakrit</a> "verulia", "veluriya" ("beryl"). The term was later adopted for the mineral beryl more exclusively.

When the first eyeglasses were constructed in 13th century Italy, the lenses were made of beryl (or of rock crystal) as glass could not be made clear enough. Consequently, glasses were named Brillen in German (bril in Dutch and Briller in Danish).

Beryl of various colors is found most commonly in <a href="granite">granitic</a> <a href="pegmatite">pegmatite</a>s, but also occurs in <a href="mica">mica</a> <a href="schist">schist</a>s in the <a href="Urals">Ural Mountains</a>, and <a href="limestone">limestone</a> in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>. Beryl is often associated with <a href="tin">tin</a> and <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> ore bodies. Beryl is found in Europe in <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> (especially morganite), <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, as well as <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, Colombia, <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, the United States, and <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>. US beryl locations are in <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a> and <a href="Utah">Utah</a>.

<a href="New%20England">New England</a>'s <a href="pegmatites">pegmatites</a> have produced some of the largest beryls found, including one massive crystal from the <a href="Bumpus%20Quarry">Bumpus Quarry</a> in <a href="Albany%2C%20Maine">Albany, Maine</a> with dimensions with a mass of around 18 <a href="Tonne">metric tons</a>; it is New Hampshire's state mineral. , the world's largest known naturally occurring crystal of any mineral is a crystal of beryl from Malakialina, Madagascar, long and in diameter, and weighing .

Aquamarine (from , being, water : sea, "<a href="i.e.">i.e.</a>" <a href="sea%20water">sea water</a>, marīna, from marīnus; of the sea.) is a blue or <a href="cyan">cyan</a> variety of beryl. It occurs at most localities which yield ordinary beryl. The gem-gravel <a href="Placer%20mining">placer</a> deposits of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> contain aquamarine. Clear yellow beryl, such as that occurring in Brazil, is sometimes called "aquamarine chrysolite". The deep blue version of aquamarine is called "maxixe". Maxixe is commonly found in the country of Madagascar. Its color fades to white when exposed to sunlight or is subjected to heat treatment, though the color returns with irradiation.

The pale blue color of aquamarine is attributed to Fe. Fe ions produce golden-yellow color, and when both Fe and Fe are present, the color is a darker blue as in maxixe. Decoloration of maxixe by light or heat thus may be due to the charge transfer between Fe and Fe. Dark-blue maxixe color can be produced in green, pink or yellow beryl by irradiating it with high-energy particles (<a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s, <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s or even <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s).

In the United States, aquamarines can be found at the summit of <a href="Mount%20Antero">Mt. Antero</a> in the <a href="Sawatch%20Range">Sawatch Range</a> in central Colorado. In <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, aquamarine has been discovered in the <a href="Big%20Horn%20Mountains">Big Horn Mountains</a>, near <a href="Powder%20River%20Pass">Powder River Pass</a>. Another location within the United States is the <a href="Sawtooth%20Range%20%28Idaho%29">Sawtooth Range</a> near <a href="Stanley%2C%20Idaho">Stanley, Idaho</a>, although the minerals are within a wilderness area which prevents collecting. In Brazil, there are mines in the states of <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, <a href="Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Espírito Santo</a>, and <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>, and minorly in <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Norte">Rio Grande do Norte</a>. The mines of Colombia, Zambia, Madagascar, <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a>, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> and <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> also produce aquamarine.

The largest aquamarine of gemstone quality ever mined was found in Marambaia, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 1910. It weighed over , and its dimensions were long and in diameter. The largest cut aquamarine gem is the <a href="Dom%20Pedro%20aquamarine">Dom Pedro aquamarine</a>, now housed in the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">National Museum of Natural History</a>.

Emerald is green beryl, colored by trace amounts of <a href="chromium">chromium</a> and sometimes <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a>. Most emeralds are highly <a href="inclusion%20%28mineral%29">included</a>, so their brittleness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor.

The modern English word "emerald" comes via <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> "Emeraude", imported from <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "Ésmeraude" and <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> "Esmaraldus", from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "smaragdus", from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> σμάραγδος "smaragdos" meaning ‘green gem’, from Hebrew ברקת "bareket" (one of the twelve stones in the <a href="Hoshen">Hoshen</a> pectoral pendant of the Kohen HaGadol), meaning ‘lightning flash’, referring to ‘emerald’, relating to Akkadian "baraqtu", meaning ‘emerald’, and possibly relating to the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word मरकत "marakata", meaning ‘green’. The <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic</a> word אזמרגד "izmargad", meaning ‘emerald’, is a back-loan, deriving from Greek smaragdos.

Emeralds in antiquity were mined by the <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptians</a> and in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, as well as <a href="Swat%20%28Pakistan%29">Swat</a> in northern <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. A rare type of emerald known as a trapiche emerald is occasionally found in the mines of <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>. A trapiche emerald exhibits a "star" pattern; it has raylike spokes of dark carbon impurities that give the emerald a six-pointed radial pattern. It is named for the "trapiche", a grinding wheel used to process <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a> in the region. Colombian emeralds are generally the most prized due to their transparency and fire. Some of the rarest emeralds come from three main emerald mining areas in Colombia: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor. Fine emeralds are also found in other countries, such as <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. In the US, emeralds can be found in <a href="Hiddenite%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hiddenite, North Carolina</a>. In 1998, emeralds were discovered in the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a>.

Emerald is a rare and valuable gemstone and, as such, it has provided the <a href="incentive">incentive</a> for developing synthetic emeralds. Both hydrothermal and "flux-growth" synthetics have been produced. The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll Chatham. The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr., which has been on the market since 1964. Gilson's emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds which become coated on both sides. Growth occurs at the rate of 1 mm per month, a typical seven-month growth run producing emerald crystals of 7 mm of thickness. The green color of emeralds is widely attributed to presence of Cr ions. Intensely green beryls from Brazil, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in which the color is attributed to <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a> have also been sold and certified as emeralds.

"Golden beryl" can range in colors from pale yellow to a brilliant gold. Unlike <a href="emerald">emerald</a>, golden beryl generally has very few flaws. The term "golden beryl" is sometimes synonymous with "heliodor" (from Greek "hēlios – ἥλιος" "sun" + "dōron – δῶρον" "gift") but golden beryl refers to pure yellow or golden yellow shades, while heliodor refers to the greenish-yellow shades. The golden yellow color is attributed to Fe ions. Both golden beryl and heliodor are used as gems. Probably the largest cut golden beryl is the flawless 2054-<a href="Carat%20%28unit%29">carat</a> stone on display in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%23Hall%20of%20Geology%2C%20Gems%2C%20and%20Minerals">Hall of Gems</a>, <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, United States.
Colorless beryl is called "goshenite". The name originates from <a href="Goshen%2C%20Massachusetts">Goshen, Massachusetts</a>, where it was originally discovered. Since all these color varieties are caused by impurities and pure beryl is colorless, it might be tempting to assume that goshenite is the purest variety of beryl. However, there are several elements that can act as inhibitors to color in beryl and so this assumption may not always be true. The name goshenite has been said to be on its way to extinction and yet it is still commonly used in the gemstone markets. Goshenite is found to some extent in almost all beryl localities. In the past, goshenite was used for manufacturing eyeglasses and lenses owing to its transparency. Nowadays, it is most commonly used for gemstone purposes and also considered as a source of beryllium.

The gem value of goshenite is relatively low. However, goshenite can be colored yellow, green, pink, blue and in intermediate colors by irradiating it with high-energy particles. The resulting color depends on the content of Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Fe, and Co impurities.

Morganite, also known as "pink beryl", "rose beryl", "pink emerald", and "cesian (or "caesian") beryl", is a rare light pink to rose-colored <a href="Gemstone">gem</a>-quality variety of beryl. Orange/yellow varieties of morganite can also be found, and color banding is common. It can be routinely heat treated to remove patches of yellow and is occasionally treated by irradiation to improve its color. The pink color of morganite is attributed to Mn ions.
Pink beryl of fine color and good sizes was first discovered on an island on the coast of Madagascar in 1910. It was also known, with other gemstone minerals, such as <a href="tourmaline">tourmaline</a> and <a href="kunzite">kunzite</a>, at <a href="Pala%2C%20California">Pala, California</a>. In December 1910, the <a href="New%20York%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">New York Academy of Sciences</a> named the pink variety of beryl "morganite" after financier <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan">J. P. Morgan</a>.
On October 7, 1989, one of the largest gem morganite specimens ever uncovered, eventually called "The Rose of Maine," was found at the Bennett Quarry in Buckfield, <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, US. The crystal, originally somewhat orange in hue, was long and about across, and weighed (along with its matrix) just over .

Red beryl (formerly known as "bixbite" and marketed as "red emerald" or "scarlet emerald") is a red variety of beryl. It was first described in 1904 for an occurrence, its <a href="Type%20locality%20%28geology%29">type locality</a>, at Maynard's Claim (Pismire Knolls), Thomas Range, <a href="Juab%20County%2C%20Utah">Juab County</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. The old synonym "bixbite" is deprecated from the <a href="World%20Jewellery%20Confederation">CIBJO</a>, because of the risk of confusion with the mineral <a href="bixbyite">bixbyite</a> (both were named after the mineralogist <a href="Maynard%20Bixby">Maynard Bixby</a>). The dark red color is attributed to Mn ions.
Red beryl is very rare and has been reported only from a handful of locations: <a href="Wah%20Wah%20Mountains">Wah Wah Mountains</a>, <a href="Beaver%20County%2C%20Utah">Beaver County, Utah</a>; <a href="Black%20Range">Paramount Canyon</a> and <a href="Black%20Range">Round Mountain</a>, <a href="Sierra%20County%2C%20New%20Mexico">Sierra County, New Mexico</a>, although the latter locality does not often produce gem grade stones; and Juab County, Utah. The greatest concentration of gem-grade red beryl comes from the Ruby-Violet Claim in the Wah Wah Mountains of the Thomas range of mid-western Utah, discovered in 1958 by Lamar Hodges, of <a href="Fillmore%2C%20Utah">Fillmore, Utah</a>, while he was prospecting for <a href="uranium">uranium</a>. Red beryl has been known to be confused with <a href="pezzottaite">pezzottaite</a>, a <a href="caesium">caesium</a> analog of beryl, that has been found in Madagascar and more recently Afghanistan; cut gems of the two varieties can be distinguished from their difference in <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a>, and rough crystals can be easily distinguished by differing crystal systems (pezzottaite trigonal, red beryl hexagonal). Synthetic red beryl is also produced. Like emerald and unlike most other varieties of beryl, red beryl is usually highly included.

While gem beryls are ordinarily found in pegmatites and certain metamorphic stones, red beryl occurs in topaz-bearing <a href="rhyolite">rhyolite</a>s. It is formed by crystallizing under low pressure and high temperature from a pneumatolytic phase along fractures or within near-surface <a href="miarolitic%20cavities">miarolitic cavities</a> of the rhyolite. Associated minerals include bixbyite, <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, <a href="orthoclase">orthoclase</a>, <a href="topaz">topaz</a>, <a href="spessartine">spessartine</a>, <a href="pseudobrookite">pseudobrookite</a> and <a href="hematite">hematite</a>.

The <a href="University%20of%20Basel">University of Basel</a>, founded in 1460, Switzerland's oldest university and the city's centuries long commitment to <a href="humanism">humanism</a>, have made Basel a "safe haven" during times of political unrest in other parts of Europe to the likes of <a href="Erasmus%20of%20Rotterdam">Erasmus of Rotterdam</a>, the <a href="Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger">Holbein</a> family, and more recently also to <a href="Hermann%20Hesse">Hermann Hesse</a> and <a href="Karl%20Jaspers">Karl Jaspers</a>. 

Basel has been the seat of a <a href="Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Basel">Prince-Bishopric</a> since the <a href="11th%20century">11th century</a>, and joined the <a href="Old%20Swiss%20Confederacy">Swiss Confederacy</a> in 1501. 
The city has been a commercial hub and important cultural centre since the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and <a href="pharmaceutical%20industry">pharmaceutical industry</a> in the 20th century. In 1897 the city was chosen as the location for the first <a href="World%20Zionist%20Congress">World Zionist Congress</a> by <a href="Theodor%20Herzl">Theodor Herzl</a>, and all together the congress has taken place in Basel for ten times over a time span of fifty years, more than in any other city in the world. The city is also home to the worldwide seat of the <a href="Bank%20for%20International%20Settlements">Bank for International Settlements</a>. 

Today the city of Basel, together with Zürich and Geneva, is counted among the cities with the highest standards of living in the entire world.

There are settlement traces on the <a href="Rhine%20knee">Rhine knee</a> from the early <a href="La%20T%C3%A8ne%20period">La Tène period</a> (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the <a href="Raurici">Raurici</a> at the site of "Basel-Gasfabrik", to the northwest of the Old City, likely identical with the town of "Arialbinnum" mentioned on the "<a href="Tabula%20Peutingeriana">Tabula Peutingeriana</a>". The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an <a href="Basel%20oppidum">oppidum</a> on the site of <a href="Basel%20Minster">Basel Minster</a>, probably in reaction to the <a href="Gallic%20War">Roman invasion of Gaul</a>.

In <a href="Roman%20Gaul">Roman Gaul</a>, <a href="Augusta%20Raurica">Augusta Raurica</a> was established some 20 km from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a <a href="castra">castra</a> (castle) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castle. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a> of <a href="Germania%20Superior">Germania Superior</a>. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the "<a href="Provincia%20Maxima%20Sequanorum">Provincia Maxima Sequanorum</a>" formed by <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>.

The Germanic confederation of the <a href="Alemanni">Alemanni</a> attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled, one such event being the <a href="Battle%20of%20Solicinium">Battle of Solicinium</a> (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the <a href="Swiss%20Plateau">Swiss Plateau</a>. From this time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.

The <a href="Duchy%20of%20Alemannia">Duchy of Alemannia</a> fell under <a href="Francia">Frankish</a> rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former <a href="bishopric%20of%20Augusta%20Raurica">bishopric of Augusta Raurica</a> was re-established as the <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Basel">Bishopric of Basel</a>. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription "Basilia fit", Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop <a href="Haito">Haito</a>, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the <a href="Carolingian%20Empire">Carolingian Empire</a>, Basel was first given to <a href="West%20Francia">West Francia</a>, but passed to <a href="East%20Francia">East Francia</a> with the <a href="treaty%20of%20Meerssen">treaty of Meerssen</a> of 870.

The city was plundered and destroyed by a <a href="Magyar%20invasion">Magyar invasion</a> of 917. The rebuilt city became part of <a href="Upper%20Burgundy">Upper Burgundy</a>, and as such was incorporated into the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> in 1032.

Since the donation by <a href="Rudolph%20III%20of%20Burgundy">Rudolph III of Burgundy</a> of the <a href="Moutier-Grandval%20Abbey">Moutier-Grandval Abbey</a> and all its possessions to Bishop <a href="Adalbero%20II">Adalbero II</a> in 999 till the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>, Basel was ruled by <a href="Prince-Bishop">prince-bishop</a>s (see <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Basel">Bishop of Basel</a>, whose memory is preserved in the <a href="crosier">crosier</a> shown on the Basel <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat-of-arms</a> – see above).

In 1019, the construction of the <a href="Basel%20Minster">cathedral of Basel</a> (known locally as the "Münster") began under <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>.
In 1225–1226, the <a href="Basel%20Bridge">bridge over the Rhine</a> was constructed by Bishop <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Thun">Heinrich von Thun</a> and Lesser Basel (<a href="Kleinbasel">Kleinbasel</a>) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community which had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river "between <a href="Lake%20Constance">Lake Constance</a> and the sea".

The Bishop also allowed the <a href="furriers">furriers</a> to establish a <a href="guild">guild</a> in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market.

In 1347, <a href="Black%20Death">the plague came to Europe</a> but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible—several had been tortured and confessed—demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the <a href="Basel%20massacre">Basel massacre</a>, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors - young orphans - were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the <a href="1356%20Basel%20earthquake">Basel earthquake of 1356</a> which destroyed much of the city along with a <a href="R%C3%B6tteln%20Castle">number of castles</a> in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.
In 1412 (or earlier), the well-known guesthouse "Zum Goldenen Sternen" was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century <a href="Council%20of%20Basel">Council of Basel</a> (1431–1449), including the 1439 election of <a href="antipope%20Felix%20V">antipope Felix V</a>. In 1459, <a href="Pope%20Pius%20II">Pope Pius II</a> endowed the <a href="University%20of%20Basel">University of Basel</a> where such notables as <a href="Erasmus%20of%20Rotterdam">Erasmus of Rotterdam</a> and <a href="Paracelsus">Paracelsus</a> later taught. At the same time the new craft of <a href="printing%20press">printing</a> was <a href="Global%20spread%20of%20the%20printing%20press%23%23Switzerland">introduced to Basel</a> by apprentices of <a href="Johann%20Gutenberg">Johann Gutenberg</a>.

The <a href="Schwabe%20publishing%20house">Schwabe publishing house</a> was founded in 1488 by <a href="Johannes%20Petri">Johannes Petri</a> and is the oldest publishing house still in business. <a href="Johann%20Froben">Johann Froben</a> also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated in the <a href="Upper%20Rhenish%20Circle">Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle</a>; the Bishop of Basel was added to the <a href="Bench%20of%20the%20Ecclesiastical%20Princes">Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes</a>. In 1500 the construction of the <a href="Basel%20M%C3%BCnster">Basel Münster</a> was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.

The city had remained neutral through the <a href="Swabian%20War">Swabian War</a> of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Basel%20%281499%29">Treaty of Basel</a> ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.

On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its <a href="Canton%20of%20Basel">eleventh canton</a>. It was the only canton that had been asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.

In 1503, the new bishop <a href="Christoph%20von%20Utenheim">Christoph von Utenheim</a> refused to give Basel a new constitution whereupon, to show its power, the city began the construction of a new city hall.

In 1529, the city became Protestant under <a href="Johannes%20Oecolampadius">Oecolampadius</a> and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For the centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the <a href="Daig%20%28Switzerland%29">"Daig"</a> played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a "de facto" <a href="Aristocracy">city aristocracy</a>.

The first edition of "Christianae religionis institutio" ("<a href="Institutes%20of%20the%20Christian%20Religion">Institutes of the Christian Religion</a>" – <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>'s great exposition of <a href="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.

In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectfully until his death in 1556 then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist <a href="David%20Joris">David Joris</a>.

In 1543, "<a href="De%20humani%20corporis%20fabrica">De humani corporis fabrica</a>", the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by <a href="Andreas%20Vesalius">Andreas Vesalius</a> (1514–1564).

There are indications <a href="Joachim%20Meyer">Joachim Meyer</a>, author of the influential 16th-century <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a> text "Kunst des Fechten" ("The Art of Fencing"), came from Basel. In 1662 the "Amerbaschsches Kabinett" was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.

The 18th-century mathematician <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.

In 1792, the <a href="Rauracian%20Republic">Republic of Rauracia</a>, a revolutionary <a href="French%20client%20republic">French client republic</a>, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of <a href="Basel-Landschaft">Basel-Landschaft</a>.

On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo (the <a href="Zoo%20Basel">Zoo Basel</a>) opened its doors in the south of the city towards <a href="Binningen%2C%20Switzerland">Binningen</a>.

In 1897 the first <a href="World%20Zionist%20Congress">World Zionist Congress</a> was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress took place in Basel for ten times, more than in any other city in the world.

Basel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Basel%20%281499%29">Treaty of Basel (1499)</a> ended the <a href="Swabian%20War">Swabian War</a>. Two years later Basel joined the <a href="Switzerland">Swiss Confederation</a>. The <a href="Peace%20of%20Basel">Peace of Basel</a> in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the <a href="First%20Coalition">First Coalition</a> against France during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>.

<a href="EuroAirport%20Basel%20Mulhouse%20Freiburg">EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg</a> is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to <a href="Schengen%20Agreement">Schengen</a> there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could "emigrate" to the other side of the airport.

Basel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations — those of the German, French and Swiss networks — lie within the city (although the Swiss (<a href="Basel%20SBB%20railway%20station">Basel SBB</a>) and French (<a href="Basel%20SBB%20railway%20station">Bâle SNCF</a>) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and <a href="Immigration">Immigration</a> facilities). <a href="Basel%20Badischer%20Bahnhof">Basel Badischer Bahnhof</a> is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the <a href="Basel%20Regional%20S-Bahn">Basel Regional S-Bahn</a>.

Within the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):


A somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of <a href="reaction%20ferry">reaction ferry</a> boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 or 30 metres. To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45° from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.

It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the <a href="Schengen%20Area">Schengen Area</a> on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the <a href="European%20Union%20Customs%20Union">European Union Customs Union</a> (though it did join the <a href="EU%20Single%20Market">EU Single Market</a>) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.

This combination first appeared in 1949, and is ascribed to Gustave Tops, a <a href="Demographics%20of%20Belgium">Belgian</a> <a href="Bartender">barman</a>, who created it at the <a href="Hotel%20Metropole%2C%20Brussels">Hotel Metropole</a> in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> in honor of <a href="Perle%20Mesta">Perle Mesta</a>, then <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a> <a href="ambassador">ambassador</a> to <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>. The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a typical Russian spirit, and the blackness of the coffee liqueur.

Bunnies &amp; Burrows

Bunnies & Burrows ("B&B") is a <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> (RPG) inspired by the novel "<a href="Watership%20Down">Watership Down</a>". Published by <a href="Fantasy%20Games%20Unlimited">Fantasy Games Unlimited</a> in <a href="1976%20in%20games">1976</a>, the game centered on intelligent <a href="rabbits">rabbits</a>. It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-<a href="humanoid">humanoid</a> roles, and the first to have detailed <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a> and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by <a href="Steve%20Jackson%20Games">Steve Jackson Games</a> as an official <a href="List%20of%20GURPS%20books">"GURPS" supplement</a> in 1992.

As <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s, <a href="player%20character">player character</a>s are faced with dangers mirroring those in the real world. The only true "<a href="monster">monster</a>s" in the game are humans, but there are many predators and natural hazards. The characters' position in the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a> promotes an emphasis on role-playing and problem solving over combat.

Originally published by <a href="Fantasy%20Games%20Unlimited">Fantasy Games Unlimited</a> in 1976, only two years after the first role-playing game "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>" was published, this edition is now long out of print. The game was inspired by <a href="Richard%20Adams">Richard Adams</a>' fantasy novel "<a href="Watership%20Down">Watership Down</a>", and the players were given the opportunity to take on the role of rabbits. As such, the game emphasized role-playing over combat for, according to <a href="Steffan%20O%27Sullivan">Steffan O'Sullivan</a>, "You're playing a rabbit, after all – how much combat do you want to do?" <a href="David%20M.%20Ewalt">David M. Ewalt</a>, in his book "Of Dice and Men", commented that "Bunnies & Burrows" "pushed setting even farther" than other early RPGs like "Dungeons & Dragons" and "<a href="En%20Garde%21">En Garde!</a>", as the "player characters were intelligent rabbits and had to compete for food, avoid predators, and deal with internal warren politics". The poor production values provided a barrier to the acceptance of the game. The art, by Charles Loving, was "sketchy and of poor quality", while the document as a whole gave the appearance of having been <a href="Typewriter">typewritten</a>.

Building on this first edition, in 1979, B. Dennis Sustare wrote ""Different Worlds Present the World of Druid's Valley: A Bunnies & Burrows Campaign"" in "<a href="Different%20Worlds">Different Worlds</a>", a magazine published by <a href="Chaosium">Chaosium</a>. It detailed how to combine the world of "Bunnies & Burrows" with other <a href="fantasy%20world">fantasy world</a>s. This was followed by the <a href="Adventure%20%28role-playing%20games%29">mini-adventure</a> ""The Jackrabbits' Lair"", written by Daniel J. Maxfield, in "Pegasus", a magazine published by <a href="Judges%20Guild">Judges Guild</a>.

A second edition of "Bunnies & Burrows" was printed in 1982 by Fantasy Games Unlimited, although the continuing popularity of the first edition is evidenced by how it was still being actively played in 2008.

During a rise of "retro" games in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Steve Jackson Games entered negotiations with Dennis Sustare and Scott Robinson, the current owners of the "Bunnies & Burrows" copyright, to publish an official "GURPS" supplement. In 1988, O'Sullivan wrote an unofficial conversion of "Bunnies & Burrows" to "<a href="GURPS">GURPS</a>" while the negotiations continued. He indicated that he hoped to one day work on the official supplement. "<a href="GURPS%20Bunnies%20%26amp%3B%20Burrows">GURPS Bunnies & Burrows</a>" was published in 1992.

The setting also had an unofficial conversion in 2004 to be used in "<a href="Risus">Risus: The Anything RPG</a>" by Boyd Mayberry under their "Rules for Free Fan-Supplements and Articles".

"Bunnies & Burrows" was the first role-playing game to allow for non-humanoid play. In addition, it was also the first role-playing game to have detailed martial arts rules (known as ""Bun Fu"") and the first attempt at a skill system. For its time, the game was considered "light years" ahead of the <a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Original "Dungeons & Dragons"</a>.

<a href="Player%20%28game%29">Players</a> of "Bunnies & Burrows" take the role of <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s as their <a href="player%20characters">player characters</a>. Interaction with many different animal species is part of normal gameplay. <a href="Human">Human</a>s, whose thought processes and motivations are completely <a href="Alien%20%28signifier%29">alien</a>, are the only monster to be encountered.

"Bunnies & Burrows" has the advantage of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in <a href="Fictional%20universe">game worlds</a> that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a <a href="fox">fox</a>. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game is one of the first to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.

The mechanics of the <a href="role-playing%20game%20system">role-playing game system</a> were created specifically for "Bunnies & Burrows", common at the time of its original publishing. It features eight <a href="statistic%20%28role-playing%20games%29">abilities</a> and eight <a href="character%20class">classes</a>. The task resolution system is based on rolls of <a href="percentile%20dice">percentile dice</a>. Although newer systems have updated game mechanics significantly, the ideas presented in "Bunnies & Burrows" created the framework for modern role-playing games.

<a href="Steve%20Jackson%20%28American%20game%20designer%29">Steve Jackson</a> reviewed "Bunnies & Burrows" in "<a href="The%20Space%20Gamer">The Space Gamer</a>" No. 10. Jackson concluded that ""B & B" is probably with the retail price [...] at least to a FRP fan. The writing style is intelligent, lucid, and occasionally witty; the rules are workable [...] the art, as I think I pointed out, is so bad it's great; and the whole idea is appealing."

Although the game had "incredible role-playing potential", the concept of role-playing rabbits can be viewed as bizarre, and as such at least one commentator believes that "most people thought it was stupid" when it was first released. This view is mirrored by Lev Lafayette, who, when describing his first exposure to the game, says "Oh, how we laughed. 'Who on earth would want to roleplay a rabbit?', we mocked. 'What's the point? You can't do anything!'".

Bundaberg Rum

Bundaberg Rum is a dark <a href="rum">rum</a> produced in <a href="Bundaberg">Bundaberg</a>, Australia. It is often referred to as "Bundy".
The Bundaberg Distilling Company owns its own <a href="cola">cola</a>-producing facility, which supplies the cola for its <a href="Alcopop">ready-to-drink</a> Bundaberg Rum and Cola products.

Bundaberg Rum originated because the local sugar mills had a problem with what to do with the waste <a href="molasses">molasses</a> after the sugar was extracted (it was heavy, difficult to transport and the costs of converting it to stock feed were rarely worth the effort). Sugar men first began to think of the profits that could be made from distilling. The vital meeting was held at the Royal Hotel on 1 August 1885, W M C Hickson served as the chairman, and other notables in attendance included all the big sugar mill owners of that time, W G Farquhar, F L Nott, S McDougall, T Penny, S H Bravo and A H Young, all to become the first directors of the Company. They started with a capital of <a href="pound%20sterling">₤</a>5,000.

The Bundaberg Distilling Company began its operations in 1888.

Bundaberg rum was first produced in 1889, production ceased from 1907 to 1914 and from 1936 to 1939 after fires, the second of which caused rum from the factory to spill into the nearby <a href="Burnett%20River">Burnett River</a>.

H T Christsen Pty Ltd operated their own Bundaberg Rum bottling plant in Bourbong Street, Bundaberg at the rear of their large grocery and hardware business in the centre of town. The spirit was sold at UP and OP strength from their business. Spokesperson for the original family, Mr Rod Patch, recalls the origins of the shape of the current "Bundy Bottle". It originated from the Bushells Coffee Chicory bottle that Bundaberg folks sold to his grandfather at the firm for one penny a bottle, after which they were washed and filled with the famous spirit. The shape remains the same but the capacity has been increased to the current 700ml. Patch's great grandfather, Hans Truval Christsen, a Danish immigrant from Copenhagen and his son Frederick Christsen had an employment policy of employing staff from the Salvation Army faith in the rum bottling process as they were less likely to be tempted to sample the spirit. The Christsen family supported settlement farming families through hard times and these good deeds were acknowledged with the naming of Christsen Park at Bargara Beach.

In 1961, the company introduced the <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> as its unusual choice of mascot, to imply that the rum could ward off the coldest chill.

In 2000, the Bundaberg Rum company and <a href="Distillation">distillery</a> were sold to British company <a href="Diageo">Diageo</a>.

In 2014, a decision by Diageo to relocate the bottling operations of Queensland's iconic drink, "Bundaberg Rum", to the western Sydney suburb of <a href="Huntingwood%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Huntingwood</a> resulted in local job losses in the city that bears its name. The decision drew criticism from all levels of Queensland politics:

Later a Diageo spokeswoman clarified by saying "Some premium products, such as the Master Distillers Collection, would continue to be bottled in Bundaberg. This was not a decision we have taken lightly, however it is a necessary one to ensure the longer term sustainability of the distillery. We remain absolutely committed to Bundaberg and the distillery and will continue to invest and focus on our core business of distilling, maturing and blending great quality rum in Bundaberg as we have done for the last 125 years."

The Bundaberg Rum distillery is open to visitors for tours of the facility. There is also a museum which offers free samples of Bundaberg Rum products for visitors in a historic Queenslander house. The <a href="Australia%27s%20big%20things%23Queensland">Big Bundy Bottle</a> is also outside of the bondstore. A new $8.5 million visitor centre opened to the public in August 2016 replacing the smaller historic house next door.

In 2009 as part of the <a href="Q150">Q150</a> celebrations, the Bundaberg Rum Distillery was announced as one of the <a href="Q150%20Icons">Q150 Icons</a> of Queensland for its role as a "location".


Bundaberg Rum is a major sponsor of the Australian <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wallabies</a> <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> team and also sponsors the Bundaberg Rum Rugby Series. Bundaberg is also a sponsor of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs">NSW Waratahs</a>. Bundaberg Rum sponsored the rugby league <a href="ANZAC%20Test">ANZAC Test</a> till 2009. Bundaberg Rum signed a 5-year deal with the <a href="National%20Rugby%20League">NRL</a> to be the official dark rum of the NRL. They are also the naming-rights sponsor of NRL Friday Night Football.

From 2009 until 2011, Bundaberg Rum sponsored <a href="V8%20Supercar">V8 Supercar</a> team <a href="Walkinshaw%20Racing">Walkinshaw Racing</a>.

Bundaberg Rum has been distinguished with numerous awards. In 2011, Bundaberg Rum's Master Distillers' Collective rum was launched, with the first three releases, the 10 Year Old, Port Barrel and Golden Reserve, winning awards in the global stage.

Bundaberg Rum has also been criticised for targeting its advertising towards young people and boys, through television commercials during <a href="National%20Rugby%20League">NRL</a> broadcasts, and other promotions. A series of advertisements featuring the Bundaberg Rum bear, a <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> known as Bundy R. Bear, were produced by advertising agency <a href="Leo%20Burnett%20Worldwide">Leo Burnett</a> to align the product 'with a larrikin approach to Australian mateship'. The Bundaberg Rum bear first appeared in 1961. It was designed to soften rum's aggressive image and broaden its appeal from the traditional older male drinker to a more sociable audience. The advertisements have been cited as a favourite among Australia's youth.

Ben Nevis

Ben Nevis (, ; ) is the highest mountain in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, located in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Standing at above sea level, it is located at the western end of the <a href="Grampian%20Mountains%20%28Scotland%29">Grampian Mountains</a> in the <a href="Lochaber">Lochaber</a> area of the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a>, close to the town of <a href="Fort%20William%2C%20Highland">Fort William</a>.

The mountain is a popular destination, attracting an estimated 100,000 ascents a year, around three-quarters of which use the Pony Track from <a href="Glen%20Nevis">Glen Nevis</a>.
The cliffs of the north face are among the highest in Scotland, providing classic <a href="scrambling">scrambles</a> and <a href="rock%20climbing">rock climbs</a> of all difficulties for climbers and <a href="mountaineering">mountaineers</a>. They are also the principal locations in Scotland for <a href="ice%20climbing">ice climbing</a>.

The summit, which is the collapsed dome of an ancient <a href="volcano">volcano</a>, features the ruins of an <a href="observatory">observatory</a> which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904. The <a href="meteorology">meteorological</a> data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather. <a href="C.%20T.%20R.%20Wilson">C. T. R. Wilson</a> was inspired to invent the <a href="cloud%20chamber">cloud chamber</a> after a period spent working at the observatory.

"Ben Nevis" is an <a href="Anglicisation">Anglicisation</a> of the <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Scottish Gaelic</a> name "Beinn Nibheis". "Beinn" is the most common Gaelic word for "mountain", "Nibheis" is variously understood, though the word is commonly translated as "malicious" or "venomous". An alternative interpretation is that "Beinn Nibheis" derives from "beinn nèamh-bhathais", from "nèamh" "heavens, clouds" and "bathais" "top of a man's head". One translation would therefore be "the mountain with its head in the clouds", though "mountain of Heaven" is also frequently given.

As is common for many <a href="Scottish%20mountains">Scottish mountains</a>, it is known both to locals and visitors as simply "the Ben".

Ben Nevis forms a <a href="massif">massif</a> with its neighbour to the northeast, <a href="C%C3%A0rn%20M%C3%B2r%20Dearg">Càrn Mòr Dearg</a>, to which it is linked by the Càrn Mòr Dearg <a href="Ar%C3%AAte">Arête</a>. Both mountains are among the nine in Scotland over ; <a href="Aonach%20Beag">Aonach Beag</a> and <a href="Aonach%20M%C3%B2r">Aonach Mòr</a> are also on the Nevis massif.

The western and southern flanks of Ben Nevis rise in about from the floor of Glen Nevis – the longest and steepest hill slope in Britain – with the result that the mountain presents an aspect of massive bulk on this side. To the north, by contrast, cliffs drop some to Coire Leis (pronounced Koruh Laysh.) A descent of 200 meters from this <a href="Cirque">corrie</a> leads to the Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut (known as the CIC Hut), a private <a href="mountain%20hut">mountain hut</a> located at above sea level, owned by the <a href="Scottish%20Mountaineering%20Club">Scottish Mountaineering Club</a> and used as a base for the many <a href="climbing">climbing</a> routes on the mountain's north face. The hut is situated just above the confluence of Allt a' Mhuilinn and Allt Coire na Ciste.
In addition to the main summit, Ben Nevis has two subsidiary "tops" listed in <a href="Munro%27s%20Tables">Munro's Tables</a>, both of which are called Càrn Dearg ("red hill"). The higher of these, at , is situated to the northwest, and is often mistaken for Ben Nevis itself in views from the Fort William area. The other Càrn Dearg () juts out into Glen Nevis on the mountain's southwestern side. A lower hill, Meall an t-Suidhe (), is located further west, forming a saddle with Ben Nevis which contains a small <a href="loch">loch</a>, Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe. The popular tourist path from Glen Nevis skirts the side of this hill before ascending Ben Nevis's broad western flank.

Ben Nevis is all that remains of a <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> <a href="volcano">volcano</a> that met a cataclysmic end in the <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> period around 350 million years ago. Evidence near the summit shows light-coloured granite (which had cooled in subterranean chambers several kilometres beneath the surface) lies among dark basaltic lavas (that only form on the surface). The two lying side-by-side is evidence the huge volcano collapsed in on itself creating an explosion comparable to <a href="Minoan%20eruption">Thera</a> (<a href="2nd%20millennium%20BC">2nd millennium BC</a>) or <a href="Krakatoa">Krakatoa</a> (1883).
The mountain is now all that remains of the imploded inner dome of the volcano.
Its form has been extensively shaped by <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a>.

Research has shown <a href="igneous">igneous</a> rock from the Devonian period (around 400 million years ago) <a href="intrusion">intrudes</a> into the surrounding metamorphic <a href="schist">schist</a>s; the intrusions take the form of a series of concentric <a href="ring%20dike">ring dike</a>s. The innermost of these, known as the Inner Granite, constitutes the southern bulk of the mountain above Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, and also the neighbouring ridge of Càrn Mòr Dearg; Meall an t-Suidhe forms part of the Outer Granite, which is redder in colour. The summit dome itself, together with the steep northern cliffs, is composed of <a href="andesite">andesite</a> and <a href="basaltic">basaltic</a> lavas.

Ben Nevis has a highland (alpine) maritime (oceanic) <a href="Polar%20climate">Polar climate</a> ("ET" climate in Köppen's classification). Ben Nevis's altitude, maritime location and topography frequently lead to cool and cloudy weather conditions, which can pose a danger to ill-equipped walkers. According to the observations carried out at the summit observatory from 1883–1904, fog was present on the summit for almost 80% of the time between November and January, and 55% of the time in May and June. The average winter temperature was around , and the mean monthly temperature for the year was . In an average year the summit sees 261 gales, and receives of rainfall, compared to only in nearby Fort William, in <a href="Inverness">Inverness</a> and in London. Rainfall on Ben Nevis is about twice as high in the winter as it is in the spring and summer. Snow can be found on the mountain almost <a href="Snow%20patches%20in%20Scotland">all year round</a>, particularly in the gullies of the north face – with the higher reaches of Observatory Gully holding snow until September most years and sometimes until the new snows of the following season.

The first recorded ascent of Ben Nevis was made on 17 August 1771 by James Robertson, an <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> <a href="botany">botanist</a>, who was in the region to collect botanical specimens. Another early ascent was in 1774 by John Williams, who provided the first account of the mountain's geological structure. <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a> climbed the mountain in 1818, comparing the ascent to "mounting ten <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St. Pauls</a> without the convenience of a staircase". The following year <a href="William%20MacGillivray">William MacGillivray</a>, who was later to become a distinguished naturalist, reached the summit only to find "fragments of earthen and glass ware, chicken bones, corks, and bits of paper". It was not until 1847 that Ben Nevis was confirmed by the <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> as the highest mountain in Britain and Ireland, ahead of its rival <a href="Ben%20Macdhui%20%28Scotland%29">Ben Macdhui</a>.

The <a href="%23Observatory">summit observatory</a> was built in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first <a href="trail">path</a> to the summit was built at the same time as the observatory and was designed to allow <a href="pony">ponies</a> to carry up supplies, with a maximum gradient of one in five. The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more so after the arrival of the <a href="West%20Highland%20Railway">West Highland Railway</a> in Fort William in 1894. Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a <a href="rack%20railway">rack railway</a> to the summit, none of which came to fruition.

In 2000, the Ben Nevis Estate, comprising all of the south side of the mountain including the summit, was bought by the Scottish conservation charity the <a href="John%20Muir%20Trust">John Muir Trust</a>.

The 1883 Pony Track to the summit (also known as the "Ben Path", the "Mountain Path" or the "Tourist Route") remains the simplest and most popular route of ascent. It begins at <a href="Achintee%2C%20Fort%20William">Achintee</a> on the east side of Glen Nevis about from Fort William town centre, at around 20 metres above sea level. Bridges from the Visitor Centre and the <a href="youth%20hostel">youth hostel</a> now allow access from the west side of Glen Nevis. The path climbs steeply to the saddle by Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe (colloquially known as the 'Halfway Lake') at 570 m, then ascends the remaining 700 metres up the stony west flank of Ben Nevis in a series of zig-zags. The path is regularly maintained but running water, uneven rocks and loose scree make it hazardous and slippery in places. Thanks to the zig-zags, the path is not unusually steep apart from in the initial stages, but inexperienced walkers should be aware that the descent is relatively arduous and wearing on the knees.
A route popular with experienced <a href="hillwalking">hillwalkers</a> starts at Torlundy, a few miles north-east of Fort William on the <a href="A82%20road">A82 road</a>, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a <a href="head%20for%20heights">head for heights</a>. In common with other approaches on this side of the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.

It is also possible to climb Ben Nevis from the Nevis Gorge car park at Steal at the head of the road up Glen Nevis, either by the south-east ridge or via the summit of Càrn Dearg (south-west). These routes require mild scrambling, are shorter and steeper than the Pony Track, and tend only to be used by experienced hill walkers.

The summit of Ben Nevis comprises a large stony <a href="plateau">plateau</a> of about . The highest point is marked with a large, solidly built <a href="cairn">cairn</a> atop which sits an Ordnance Survey <a href="trig%20point">trig point</a>. The summit is the highest ground for over , before the <a href="Scandinavian%20Mountains">Scandinavian Mountains</a> in <a href="west">west</a>ern <a href="Norway">Norway</a> are reached, which contain many peaks higher than Ben Nevis. The summit is much higher than the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a> as well as the rest of the British Isles.

The ruined walls of the observatory are a prominent feature on the summit. An emergency shelter has been built on top of the observatory tower for the benefit of those caught out by bad weather. Although the base of the tower is slightly lower than the true summit of the mountain, the roof of the shelter overtops the trig point by several feet, making it the highest man-made structure in the UK. A <a href="war%20memorial">war memorial</a> to the dead of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> is located next to the observatory.

On 17 May 2006, a piano that had been buried under one of the cairns on the peak was uncovered by the <a href="John%20Muir%20Trust">John Muir Trust</a>, which owns much of the mountain. The piano is believed to have been carried up for charity by removal men from <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a> over 20 years earlier.

The view from the UK's highest point is extensive. Under ideal conditions, it can extend to over , including such mountains as the <a href="Torridon%20Hills">Torridon Hills</a>, <a href="Morven%2C%20Caithness">Morven</a> in <a href="Caithness">Caithness</a>, <a href="Lochnagar">Lochnagar</a>, <a href="Ben%20Lomond">Ben Lomond</a>, <a href="Barra%20Head">Barra Head</a> and to <a href="Knocklayd">Knocklayd</a> in <a href="County%20Antrim">County Antrim</a>, Northern Ireland.

A meteorological observatory on the summit was first proposed by the <a href="Scottish%20Meteorological%20Society">Scottish Meteorological Society</a> (SMS) in the late 1870s, at a time when similar observatories were being built around the world to study the weather at high altitude. In the summer of 1881, <a href="Clement%20Lindley%20Wragge">Clement Lindley Wragge</a> climbed the mountain daily to make observations (earning him the nickname "Inclement Rag"), leading to the opening on 17 October 1883 of a permanent observatory run by the SMS. The building was manned full-time until 1904, when it was closed due to inadequate government funding. The twenty years worth of readings still provide the most comprehensive set of data on mountain weather in Great Britain.

In September 1894, <a href="C.%20T.%20R.%20Wilson">C. T. R. Wilson</a> was employed at the observatory for a couple of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a <a href="Brocken%20spectre">Brocken spectre</a> and <a href="glory%20%28optical%20phenomenon%29">glory</a>, caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the <a href="cloud%20chamber">cloud chamber</a>, used to detect <a href="ionising%20radiation">ionising radiation</a>.

Marjory Roy, a member of the Scottish Meteorological Society is the author of the book "'The Ben Nevis Weathermen'," which is in print and available from SMC or from the West Highland Museum in Fort William. This tells the story of the funding, building and operating of the Ben Nevis Observatory in Fort William, Scotland.

Ben Nevis's popularity, climate and complex <a href="topography">topography</a> contribute to a high number of <a href="mountain%20rescue">mountain rescue</a> incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in <a href="navigation">navigating</a> to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem stems from the fact that the summit plateau is roughly <a href="kidney">kidney</a>-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise <a href="compass">compass</a> <a href="bearing%20%28navigation%29">bearings</a> taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.

In the late 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts on the summit plateau to assist walkers attempting the descent in <a href="fog">fog</a>gy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions. Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man-made intrusion into the natural landscape, which create a false sense of security and could lessen mountaineers' sense of responsibility for their own safety. Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play. A series of solidly-constructed cairns currently (September 2009) marks the upper reaches of the Pony Track.

The north face of Ben Nevis is riven with buttresses, ridges, towers and pinnacles, and contains many classic scrambles and rock climbs. It is of major importance for British winter climbing, with many of its routes holding snow often until late April. It was one of the first places in Scotland to receive the attention of serious mountaineers, with a descent of <a href="Tower%20Ridge">Tower Ridge</a> in 1892 the earliest documented climbing expedition on the Ben. (It was not climbed from bottom to top for another two years). The Scottish Mountaineering Club's Charles Inglis Clark hut was built below the north face in Coire Leis in 1929. Because of its remote location, it is said to be the only genuine <a href="Mountain%20hut">alpine hut</a> in Britain. It remains popular with climbers, especially in winter.

Tower Ridge is the longest of the north face's four main <a href="ridges">ridges</a>, with around 600 metres of ascent. It is not technically demanding (its <a href="grade%20%28climbing%29%23British">grade</a> is Difficult), and most pitches can be tackled unroped by competent climbers, but it is committing and very exposed. Castle Ridge (Moderate), the northernmost of the main ridges, is an easier scramble, while Observatory Ridge (Very Difficult), the closest ridge to the summit, is "technically the hardest of the Nevis ridges in summer and winter". Between the Tower and Observatory Ridges are the Tower and Gardyloo Gullies; the latter takes its name from the cry of ""garde à l'eau"" (French for "watch out for the water") formerly used in Scottish cities as a warning when householders threw their slops (and worse) out of a <a href="tenement">tenement</a> window into the street. The gully's top wall was the refuse pit for the now-disused summit observatory. The North-east Buttress (Very Difficult) is the southernmost and bulkiest of the four ridges; it is as serious as Observatory Ridge but not as technically demanding, mainly because an "infamous" rock problem, the 'Man-trap', can be avoided on either side.
The north face contains dozens of graded rock climbs along its entire length, with particular concentrations on the Càrn Dearg Buttress (below the <a href="Munro">Munro</a> top of Càrn Dearg NW) and around the North-east Buttress and Observatory Ridge. Classic rock routes include "Rubicon Wall" on Observatory Buttress (Severe) – whose second ascent in 1937, when it was considered the hardest route on the mountain, is described by <a href="W.%20H.%20Murray">W. H. Murray</a> in "Mountaineering in Scotland" – and, on Càrn Dearg, "Centurion" and "The Bullroar" (both HVS), "Torro" (E2), and "Titan's Wall" (E3), these four described in the <a href="Scottish%20Mountaineering%20Club">SMC</a>'s guide as among "the best climbs of their class in Scotland".

Many seminal lines were recorded before the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> by pioneering <a href="Scottish%20Mountaineering%20Club">Scottish climbers</a> like J N Collie, Willie Naismith, <a href="Harold%20Raeburn">Harold Raeburn</a>, and William and <a href="Ladies%27%20Scottish%20Climbing%20Club">Jane</a> Inglis Clark. Other classic routes were put up by G. Graham Macphee, Dr <a href="J.%20H.%20B.%20Bell">James H. B. Bell</a> and others between the Wars; these include Bell's 'Long Climb', at reputedly the longest sustained climb on the British mainland. In summer 1943 conscientious objector <a href="Brian%20Pinder%20Kellett">Brian Kellett</a> made a phenomenal seventy-four repeat climbs and seventeen first ascents including fourteen solos, returning in 1944 to add fifteen more new lines, eleven solo, including his eponymous HVS on Gardyloo buttress. Much more recently, an extreme and as-yet ungraded climb on Echo Wall was completed by <a href="Dave%20MacLeod">Dave MacLeod</a> in 2008 after two years of preparation.
The north face is also one of Scotland's foremost venues for winter mountaineering and ice climbing, and holds snow until quite late in the year; in a good year, routes may remain in winter condition until mid-spring. Most of the possible rock routes are also suitable as winter climbs, including the four main ridges; Tower Ridge, for example, is grade IV on the <a href="Grade%20%28climbing%29%23Grade%20systems%20for%20ice%20climbing">Scottish winter grading system</a>, having been upgraded in 2009 by the Scottish Mountaineering Club after requests by the local Mountain Rescue Team, there being numerous benightments and incidents every winter season. Probably the most popular ice climb on Ben Nevis is "The Curtain" (IV,5) on the left side of the Càrn Dearg Buttress. At the top end of the scale, "Centurion" in winter is a grade VIII,8 face climb.

In February 1960 James R. Marshall and Robin Clark Smith recorded six major new ice routes in only eight days including Orion Direct (V,5 400m); this winter version of Bell's Long Climb was "the climax of a magnificent week's climbing by Smith and Marshall, and the highpoint of the <a href="Glossary%20of%20climbing%20terms%23step%20cutting">step-cutting</a> era."

The history of <a href="hill%20running">hill running</a> on Ben Nevis dates back to 1895. William Swan, a barber from Fort William, made the first recorded timed ascent up the mountain on or around 27 September of that year, when he ran from the old post office in Fort William to the summit and back in 2 hours 41 minutes.
The following years saw several improvements on Swan's record, but the first competitive race was held on 3 June 1898 under Scottish Amateur Athletic Association rules. Ten competitors ran the course, which started at the Lochiel Arms Hotel in <a href="Banavie">Banavie</a> and was thus longer than the route from Fort William; the winner was 21-year-old Hugh Kennedy, a gamekeeper at Tor Castle, who finished (coincidentally with Swan's original run) in 2 hours 41 minutes.

Regular races were organised until 1903, when two events were held; these were the last for 24 years, perhaps due to the closure of the summit observatory the following year. The first was from <a href="Achintee">Achintee</a>, at the foot of the Pony Track, and finished at the summit; It was won in just over an hour by Ewen MacKenzie, the observatory roadman. The second race ran from new Fort William post office, and MacKenzie lowered the record to 2 hours 10 minutes, a record he held for 34 years.

The <a href="Ben%20Nevis%20hill%20race">Ben Nevis Race</a> has been run in its current form since 1937. It now takes place on the first Saturday in September every year, with a maximum of 500 competitors taking part. It starts and finishes at the <a href="Claggan%20Park%2C%20Fort%20William">Claggan Park</a> football ground on the outskirts of Fort William, and is long with of ascent. Due to the seriousness of the mountain environment, entry is restricted to those who have completed three hill races, and runners must carry waterproofs, a hat, gloves and a whistle; anyone who has not reached the summit after two hours is turned back. As of 2010 the records have stood unbroken since 1984, when <a href="Kenny%20Stuart">Kenny Stuart</a> and Pauline Haworth of <a href="Keswick%2C%20Cumbria">Keswick</a> Athletic Club won the men's and the women's races with times of 1:25:34 and 1:43:25 respectively.

Ben Nevis is becoming popular with ski mountaineers and boarders. The Red Burn (Allt Coire na h-Urcaire) just to the North of the tourist path gives the easiest descent, but most if not all of the easier gullies on the North Face have been skied, as has the slope once adorned by the abseil poles into Coire Leis. No 4 gully is probably the most skied. Although Tower scoop makes it a no-fall zone, Tower Gully is becoming popular, especially in May and June when there is spring snow.
Ben Nevis's popularity and high-profile have led to concerns in recent decades over the impact of humans on the fragile mountain environment. These concerns contributed to the creation of The <a href="http%3A//www.nevislandscape.co.uk/">Nevis Landscape Partnership</a>, a five-year programme which aims to protect, enhance and future-proof Ben Nevis by delivering nineteen ambitious environmental projects between 2014 and 2019. The Nevis Landscape Partnership is supported by five partner organisations (John Muir Trust, Forestry Commission Scotland, The Highland Council, Scottish Natural Heritage & The Nevis Partnership) and has been made possible by Heritage Lottery Funding.

Now in project year three (March 2016 – March 2017), there have been significant positive changes implemented by Nevis Landscape Partnership and their projects, most significantly the upgrades to the <a href="http%3A//www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/bennevis.shtml">Ben Nevis Mountain Track</a>. Work to upgrade the mountain track started in November 2015 after two contracts were awarded to McGowan Ltd. & Cairngorm Wilderness Contracts. Both contractors immediately started bagging stone from high up Ben Nevis to be brought down to by helicopter to replace crumbling steps and stabilise eroding parts of the path. The project will eventually upgrade 3.5 km of the mountain track from the starting point at Achintee all the way up to John's Wall; this year the maintenance was focused on a difficult middle section which was most in need of attention. After six months of hard work and battling with the weather, the contractors have now upgraded 1 km of the mountain track which is roughly 30% of the overall maintenance this project will carry out. The next contracted works will resume towards the end of September, after the Ben Nevis Race, for stage two of the project.

Volunteer effort has already been a huge help and will continue to be a large contributing factor to the overall upgrade of the mountain track. Nevis Landscape Partnership are working closely with National Trust for Scotland to run <a href="http%3A//www.nts.org.uk/thistlecamps/">Thistle Camp Working Holidays</a> which will focus on much-needed maintenance on the first section of the Ben Nevis footpath and allow outdoor enthusiasts to actively be a part of maintaining and protecting the United Kingdom's highest mountain for this generation and many more to come.

The <a href="Ben%20Nevis%20Distillery">Ben Nevis Distillery</a> is a <a href="single%20malt%20Scotch">single malt whisky</a> distillery at the foot of the mountain, located by Victoria Bridge to the north of Fort William. Founded in 1825 by John McDonald (known as "Long John"), it is one of the oldest licensed distilleries in Scotland, and is a popular visitor attraction in Fort William. The water used to make the whisky comes from the Allt a' Mhuilinn, the stream that flows from Ben Nevis's northern corrie. "Ben Nevis" 80/- organic <a href="ale">ale</a> is, by contrast, brewed in <a href="Bridge%20of%20Allan">Bridge of Allan</a> near <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a>.

"Ben Nevis" was the name of a <a href="White%20Star%20Line">White Star Line</a> <a href="packet%20ship">packet ship</a> which in 1854 carried the group of immigrants who were to become the <a href="Wends%20of%20Texas">Wends of Texas</a>. At least another eight vessels have carried the name since then.

A mountain in <a href="Svalbard">Svalbard</a> is also named <a href="Ben%20Nevis%20%28Svalbard%29">Ben Nevis</a>, after the Scottish peak. It is 922 metres high, and located south of the head of <a href="Raudfjorden">Raudfjorden</a>, Albert I Land, in the northwestern part of the island of <a href="Spitsbergen">Spitsbergen</a>.

Bipolar I disorder

Bipolar I disorder (BP-I; pronounced "type one bipolar disorder") is a <a href="bipolar%20spectrum%20disorder">bipolar spectrum disorder</a> characterized by the occurrence of at least one <a href="manic%20episode">manic</a> or <a href="mixed%20episode">mixed episode</a>. Most patients also, at other times, have one or more depressive episodes, and all experience a <a href="Hypomania">hypomanic</a> stage before progressing to full mania.

It is a type of <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>, and conforms to the classic concept of manic-depressive illness, which can include <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> during mood episodes. The difference with <a href="bipolar%20II%20disorder">bipolar II disorder</a> is that the latter requires that the individual must never have experienced a full manic or mixed-manic episode - only less severe hypomanic episode(s).

The essential feature of bipolar I disorder is a clinical course characterized by the occurrence of one or more manic episodes or mixed episodes (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). Often, individuals have had one or more <a href="major%20depressive%20episode">major depressive episode</a>s. One episode of mania is sufficient to make the diagnosis of bipolar disorder; the patient may or may not have history of <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">major depressive disorder</a>. Episodes of substance-induced mood disorder due to the direct effects of a <a href="medication">medication</a>, or other <a href="somatic%20psychology">somatic</a> treatments for depression, <a href="drug%20abuse">drug abuse</a>, or <a href="toxin">toxin</a> exposure, or of mood disorder due to a general medical condition need to be excluded before a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder can be made. In addition, the episodes must not be better accounted for by <a href="schizoaffective%20disorder">schizoaffective disorder</a> or superimposed on <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="schizophreniform%20disorder">schizophreniform disorder</a>, <a href="delusional%20disorder">delusional disorder</a>, or a <a href="psychotic%20disorder">psychotic disorder</a> not otherwise specified.

Routine medical assessments are often prescribed to rule-out or identify a <a href="Somatic%20psychology">somatic</a> cause for bipolar I symptoms. These tests can include <a href="ultrasound">ultrasound</a>s of the head, <a href="x-ray%20computed%20tomography">x-ray computed tomography</a> (CAT scan), <a href="electroencephalogram">electroencephalogram</a>, <a href="HIV%20test">HIV test</a>, <a href="full%20blood%20count">full blood count</a>, <a href="thyroid%20function%20test">thyroid function test</a>, <a href="liver%20function%20test">liver function test</a>, <a href="urea">urea</a> and <a href="creatinine">creatinine</a> levels and if patient is on <a href="lithium">lithium</a>, lithium levels are taken. Drug screening includes <a href="recreational%20drug">recreational drug</a>s, particularly <a href="synthetic%20cannabinoid">synthetic cannabinoid</a>s, and exposure to toxins.

<a href="Mood%20stabilizer">Mood stabilizer</a>s are often used as part of the treatment process.

Some <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s, like <a href="venlafaxine">venlafaxine</a>, have been found to precipitate a manic episode.

Information on the condition, importance of regular <a href="sleep">sleep</a> patterns, routines and eating habits and the importance of <a href="medication%20compliance">compliance with medication</a> as <a href="medical%20prescription">prescribed</a>. <a href="Behavior%20modification">Behavior modification</a> through <a href="mental%20health%20counselor">counseling</a> can have positive influence to help reduce the effects of risky behavior during the manic phase. Additionally, the lifetime prevalence for bipolar I disorder is estimated to be 1%.

The fifth edition of the <a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (<a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>) was released in May 2013. There are several proposed revisions to occur in the diagnostic criteria of Bipolar I Disorder and its subtypes. For Bipolar I Disorder 296.40 Most Recent Episode Hypomanic and 296.4x Most Recent Episode Manic, the proposed revision includes the following specifiers: with Psychotic Features, with Mixed Features, with Catatonic Features, with Rapid Cycling, with Anxiety (mild to severe), with Suicide Risk Severity, with Seasonal Pattern, and with Postpartum Onset. Bipolar I Disorder 296.5x Most Recent Episode Depressed will include all of the above specifiers plus the following: with Melancholic Features and with Atypical Features. The categories for specifiers will be removed in DSM-5 and part A will add “or there are at least 3 symptoms of Major Depression of which one of the symptoms is depressed mood or anhedonia. For Bipolar I Disorder 296.7 Most Recent Episode Unspecified, the listed specifiers will be removed.

The criteria for manic and hypomanic episodes in parts A & B will be edited. Part A will include “and present most of the day, nearly every day,” and part B will include “and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior.” These criteria as defined in the DSM-IV-TR have created confusion for clinicians and need to be more clearly defined.

There have also been proposed revisions to part B of the diagnostic criteria for a Hypomanic Episode, which is used to diagnose For Bipolar I Disorder 296.40, Most Recent Episode Hypomanic. Part B lists "inflated self-esteem, flight of ideas, distractibility, and decreased need for sleep" as symptoms of a Hypomanic Episode. This has been confusing in the field of child psychiatry because these symptoms closely overlap with symptoms of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).

Note that many of the above changes are still under active consideration and are not definite.

Bacardi

Bacardi Limited ( ; ; ) is the largest privately held, family-owned <a href="Distilled%20beverage">spirits</a> company in the world. Originally known for its eponymous Bacardi white <a href="rum">rum</a>, it now has a portfolio of more than 200 brands and labels. Founded in 1862, and family-owned for seven generations, Bacardi employs 6,000 people, manufactures at 29 facilities in 16 markets on four continents, with sales in more than 150 countries. Bacardi Limited refers to the Bacardi group of companies, including Bacardi International Limited. The company sells in excess of 200 million bottles per year. The company's sales in 2007 were US$5.5 billion, up from $4.9 billion in 2006. In recent years sales have stagnated, with the company recording US$4.6 billion in 2014. It laid off 10% of its North American workforce in 2015.

Bacardi Limited is headquartered in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Bermuda">Hamilton, Bermuda</a>, and has a 16-member board of directors led by the original founder's great-great grandson, Facundo L. Bacardí. Along with other leading alcohol producers, Bacardi is part of a <a href="International%20Alliance%20for%20Responsible%20Drinking">producers' commitments organization</a> which aims to reduce harmful drinking.

<a href="Facundo%20Bacardi">Facundo Bacardí Massó</a>, a Catalan wine merchant, was born in <a href="Sitges">Sitges</a>, <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, in 1814, and emigrated to Cuba in 1830. During this period, rum was cheaply made and not considered a refined drink, and rarely sold in upmarket taverns. Facundo began attempting to "tame" rum by isolating a proprietary strain of yeast still used in Bacardi production. This yeast gives Bacardi rum its flavour profile. After experimenting with several techniques he hit upon filtering the rum through charcoal, which removed impurities. In addition to this, Facundo aged the rum in white oak barrels, which had the effect of mellowing the drink. The final product was the first clear, or "white" rum in the world.

Moving from the experimental stage to a more commercial endeavour, he and his brother José set up a <a href="Santiago%20de%20Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a> distillery they bought in 1862, which housed a <a href="still">still</a> made of copper and <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a>. In the rafters of this building lived <a href="Leaf-nosed%20bat">fruit bats</a> – the inspiration for the Bacardi bat logo. This logo was pragmatic considering with high illiteracy rate in the 19th century, it enabled customers to easily identify the product.

The 1880s and 90s were turbulent times for Cuba and the company. <a href="Emilio%20Bacardi">Emilio Bacardi</a>, Don Facundo's eldest son, was repeatedly imprisoned and was exiled from Cuba for having fought in the rebel army against Spain in the <a href="Cuban%20War%20of%20Independence">Cuban War of Independence</a>.

Emilio's brothers, Facundo and José, and his brother-in-law Henri (Don Enrique) Schueg, remained in Cuba with the difficult task of sustaining the company during a period of war. The women in the family were exiled in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston, Jamaica</a>. After the Cuban War of Independence and the US occupation of Cuba, "The Original <a href="Cuba%20Libre">Cuba Libre</a>" and the <a href="Daiquiri">Daiquiri</a> were both created, using Bacardi rum. In 1899 US General <a href="Leonard%20Wood">Leonard Wood</a> appointed Emilio Bacardi Mayor of <a href="Santiago%20de%20Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a>.

In 1912, Emilio Bacardi travelled to Egypt, where he purchased a <a href="mummy">mummy</a> (still on display) for the future Emilio Bacardi Moreau Municipal Museum in Santiago de Cuba. In Santiago, his brother Facundo M. Bacardí continued to manage the company along with Schueg, who began the company's international expansion by opening bottling plants in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> (1910) and New York City (1915). The New York plant was soon shut down due to <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>, yet during this time Cuba became a hotspot for US tourists.

In 1922 Emilio opened a new distillery in Santiago. In 1930 Schueg opened the <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> <a href="Bacardi%20Building%20%28Havana%29">Bacardi building in Havana</a> and the third generation of the Bacardí family entered the business. Facundito Bacardí was known to have invited Americans (still subject to Prohibition) to "Come to Cuba and bathe in Bacardi rum." A new product was introduced: <a href="Hatuey%20beer">Hatuey beer</a>.
Bacardi's transition into an international brand was due mostly to Schueg's "business genius"; Schueg "branded Cuba as the home of rum, and Bacardi as the king of rums" and expanded overseas, first to Mexico (1931), then to Puerto Rico (1936), under the brand name Ron Bacardi. (Ron is the Spanish word for rum). Post-Prohibition production in Puerto Rico enabled rum to be sold tariff-free in the US. He then expanded to the United States (1944).

During World War II, the company was led by Schueg's son-in-law, José "Pepin" Bosch. Pepin founded Bacardi Imports in New York City, and became Cuba's Minister of the Treasury in 1949.

Portuondo and other Bacardí family members initially supported the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban revolutionaries</a>, including <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a> and the broader <a href="26th%20of%20July%20Movement">M-26-7 movement</a>: Bosch personally donated tens of thousands of dollars to the movement, and acted as an intermediary between the revolutionaries and the CIA to assuage the latter's concerns. Family members, employees, and facilities were put to use by the movement and the company supported the revolution publicly with advertisements and parties. But their support turned to opposition as the pro-Soviet <a href="Che%20Guevara">Che Guevara</a> wing of the movement began to dominate and as Castro turned against their interests.

The Bacardí family (and hence the company) maintained a fierce <a href="Cuban%20dissident%20movement">opposition to Fidel Castro's</a> revolution in Cuba in the 1960s. In his book "Bacardi, The Hidden War", <a href="Hernando%20Calvo%20Ospina">Hernando Calvo Ospina</a> outlines the political element to the family's money. Ospina describes how the Bacardi family and the company left Cuba after the Castro regime confiscated the company’s Cuban assets on 15 October 1960, particularly nationalizing and banning all private property on the island as well as all bank accounts. However, due to concerns over the previous Cuban leader, <a href="Fulgencio%20Batista">Fulgencio Batista</a>, the company had started foreign branches a few years before the revolution; the company moved the ownership of its trademarks, assets and proprietary formulas out of the country to the Bahamas prior to the revolution and also built plants in Puerto Rico and Mexico after Prohibition to save import taxes on rum being imported to the U.S. This helped the company survive after the communist government confiscated all Bacardí assets in the country without any compensation.

Ospina also explains the close ties Bacardí family members had to the U.S. political elite as well as to organizations of state such as the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a>. The family funded various <a href="Cuban%20exile">Cuban exile</a> organizations, such as <a href="CANF">CANF</a>.

More recently, Bacardi lawyers were influential in the drafting of the 1996 <a href="Helms-Burton%20Act">Helms-Burton Act</a>, which sought to extend the scope of the <a href="United%20States%20embargo%20against%20Cuba">United States embargo against Cuba</a>. In 1999, <a href="Otto%20Reich">Otto Reich</a>, a lobbyist in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> on behalf of Bacardi, drafted section 211 of the <a href="Omnibus%20Consolidated%20and%20Emergency%20Appropriations%20Act%2C%20FY1999">Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, FY1999</a> (), a bill that became known as the Bacardi Act. Section 211 denied trademark protection to products of Cuban businesses expropriated after the Cuban revolution, a provision keenly sought by Bacardi. The act was aimed primarily at the <a href="Havana%20Club">Havana Club</a> brand in the U.S. The brand was created by the José Arechabala S.A. and nationalised without compensation in the Cuban revolution, the Arechabala family left Cuba and stopped producing rum. They therefore allowed the US trademark registration for "Havana Club" to lapse in 1973. Taking advantage of the lapse, the Cuban government registered the mark in the US in 1976. This new law was drafted to invalidate the lawful trademark registration. Section 211 has been challenged unsuccessfully by the Cuban government and the European Union in U.S. courts. It was also ruled illegal by the <a href="WTO">WTO</a> in 2001 and 2002. The U.S. Congress has yet to re-examine the matter. The brand was assigned by the Cuban government to Pernod Ricard in 1993.

Bacardi drinks are not found in Cuba today. The main brand of rum in Cuba is <a href="Havana%20Club">Havana Club</a>, produced by a company that was confiscated and nationalized by the government during the revolution. Bacardi later bought the brand from the original owners, the Arechabala family. The Cuban government, in partnership with the French company <a href="Pernod%20Ricard">Pernod Ricard</a>, sells its Havana Club products internationally, except in the United States and its territories. Bacardi created its own line of Havana Club rum based on the original recipe from the Arechabala family, manufactures it in Puerto Rico, and sells it in Florida. Bacardi continues to fight in the courts, attempting to legalize their own <a href="Havana%20Club%20%28Bacardi%29">Havana Club</a> trademark outside the United States. Drinks now made in the former Cuban Bacardi distillery are sold in Cuba under the name Caney.

Despite having no production facilities in Cuba today, Bacardi in the UK has recently decided to re-emphasize its Cuban heritage, primarily for commercial reasons. Facing increased competition in the rum market from the now international brand Havana Club, the company concluded that it was important for sales to associate its rum with Cuba. TV advertisements with slogans of "Welcome to the Latin Quarter" are but one example of this. In 1998, under the distinctive bat logo, the phrase "company founded in Santiago de Cuba in 1862" was added.

Bacardi has faced criticism and legal problems for supposedly attempting to encourage consumers to believe that they were purchasing rum made in Cuba, rather than just marking its heritage. Bacardi adverts in Spain, since 1966, had described a popular combination of rum and Coke as "rum and coke". However, after 1998, it began to describe the drink as <a href="Cuba%20Libre">Cuba Libre</a> – literally translated as "Free Cuba", which is the original name of the drink and what it is mostly called in Latin America. In this instance, Bacardi faced a legal ruling from the Spanish Association of Advertising Users which forced the company to stop the advert. They concluded that it could "mislead the viewer as to the true nature of the product", as the advert contained so much Caribbean imagery, one might conclude it came from Cuba.

The <a href="Bacardi%20Building%20%28Havana%29">Bacardi Building</a> in Havana is regarded as one of the finest <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> buildings in Latin America.

In August 2012, a temporary worker at the company's <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, bottling subsidiary, Bacardi Bottling, was fatally injured while servicing a palletizer machine. After conducting an investigation, the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Labor">U.S. Department of Labor</a>'s <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) determined that Bacardi was in violation of several safety regulations, including two willful violations. Bacardi Bottling was fined $192,000 by OSHA.

Bacardi Limited has made numerous acquisitions to diversify away from the eponymous Bacardi rum brand. In 1993, Bacardi merged with <a href="Martini%20%26amp%3B%20Rossi">Martini & Rossi</a>, the Italian producer of <a href="Martini%20%28vermouth%29">Martini vermouth</a> and sparkling wines, creating the Bacardi-Martini group.

In 1998, the company acquired <a href="Dewar%27s">Dewar's</a> scotch, including <a href="Royal%20Brackla">Royal Brackla</a> and <a href="Bombay%20Sapphire">Bombay Sapphire</a> gin from <a href="Diageo">Diageo</a> for $2 billion. Bacardi acquired the Cazadores tequila brand in 2002 and in 2004 purchased <a href="Grey%20Goose%20%28vodka%29">Grey Goose</a>, a French-made vodka, from <a href="Sidney%20Frank">Sidney Frank</a> for $2 billion. In 2006 Bacardi Limited purchased New Zealand vodka brand <a href="42%20Below">42 Below</a>.

Other associated brands include the <a href="Havana%20Club%20%28Bacardi%29">US version of Havana Club</a>, <a href="Drambuie">Drambuie</a> Scotch whisky liqueur, DiSaronno <a href="Amaretto">Amaretto</a>, <a href="Eristoff">Eristoff</a> vodka, <a href="Duo%20and%20trio%20cocktails%23B%20and%20B">B&B</a> and <a href="B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dictine">Bénédictine</a> liqueurs.

In its 150-year history, Bacardi rum has won more than 550 awards for quality and product profile, making it the world’s most awarded rum. Emblems of gold medals and the Spanish Coat of Arms awarded during the formative years of the business appear on the bottle.

Bacardi rums have been entered for a number of international <a href="spirit%20ratings">spirit ratings</a> awards. Several Bacardi spirits have performed notably well. Bacardi 8, for example, received two gold medals and a silver medal from the <a href="San%20Francisco%20World%20Spirits%20Competition">San Francisco World Spirits Competition</a> between 2008 and 2010. In addition, it received the International High Quality Trophy at <a href="Monde%20Selection">Monde Selection</a>'s World Quality Selections in 2010, and a Grand Gold Medal in 2011. Bacardi Gold, Bacardi 8, and Bacardi Reserva Limitada were also awarded International High Quality Trophy awards at the 2010 Monde Selection’s World Quality Selections. However, it should be noted that these awards are non-competitive, and only products that pay to enter are assessed.

Proof66, a website that aggregates professional ratings from the <a href="Beverage%20Testing%20Institute">Beverage Testing Institute</a> and other professional rating organizations, places Bacardi Reserva Limitada, Bacardi 1873 Solera, and Bacardi 8 in the First Tier or Top 10th percentile of all rated spirits.

<a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> lived in Cuba from 1939 until shortly after the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a>. He lived at <a href="Finca%20Vig%C3%ADa">Finca Vigía</a>, in the small town of San Francisco de Paula, located very close to Bacardi’s <a href="Modelo%20Brewery">Modelo Brewery</a> for Hatuey Beer in <a href="Cotorro%2C%20Havana">Cotorro, Havana</a>.

In 1954, Compañía Ron Bacardi S.A. threw Hemingway a party when he was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> – soon after the publication of his novel "<a href="The%20Old%20Man%20and%20the%20Sea">The Old Man and the Sea</a>" (1952) – in which he honored the company by mentioning its Hatuey beer. Hemingway also mentioned Bacardi and Hatuey in his novels "<a href="To%20Have%20and%20Have%20Not">To Have and Have Not</a>" (1937) and "<a href="For%20Whom%20the%20Bell%20Tolls">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>" (1940). <a href="Guillermo%20Cabrera%20Infante">Guillermo Cabrera Infante</a> wrote an account of the festivities for the periodical "Ciclón", titled "El Viejo y la marca" ("The Old Man and the Brand"). In his account he described how "on one side there was a wooden stage with two streamers – Hatuey beer and Bacardi rum – on each end and a Cuban flag in the middle. Next to the stage was a bar, at which people crowded, ordering daiquiris and beer, all free.” A sign at the event read "Bacardi rum welcomes the author of "The Old Man and the Sea"".

In his article "The Old Man and the Daiquiri", Wayne Curtis writes about how Hemingway’s "home bar also held a bottle of Bacardi rum". Hemingway wrote in "Islands in the Stream", "...this frozen daiquirí, so well beaten as it is, looks like the sea where the wave falls away from the bow of a ship when she is doing thirty knots."

In 1964 Bacardi opened its new US headquarters in Miami, Florida. Exiled Cuban architect Enrique Gutierrez created a building that was hurricane-proof, using a system of steel cables and pulleys which allow the building to move slightly in the event of a strong shock. The steel cables are anchored into the bedrock and extend through marble-covered shafts up to the top floor, where they are led over large pulleys. Outside, on both sides of the eight-story building, more than 28,000 tiles painted and fired by Brazilian artist Francisco Brennard, depicting abstract blue flowers, were placed on the walls according to the artist's exact specifications.

In 1972, the Company commissioned the square building in the plaza. Architect Ignacio Carrera-Justiz used cantilevered construction, a style invented by <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>. Wright observed how well trees with taproots withstood hurricane-force winds. The building, raised 47 feet off the ground around a central core, features four massive walls, made of sections of inch-thick hammered glass mural tapestries, designed and manufactured in France. The design came from a painting by German artist Johannes M. Dietz.

In 2006, Bacardi USA leased a 15-story headquarters complex in <a href="Coral%20Gables%2C%20Florida">Coral Gables, Florida</a>. Bacardi had employees in seven buildings across <a href="Miami-Dade%20County">Miami-Dade County</a> at the time.

Bacardi vacated its former headquarters buildings on <a href="Biscayne%20Boulevard">Biscayne Boulevard</a> in <a href="Midtown%20Miami">Midtown Miami</a>. The building currently serves as the headquarters of the <a href="National%20YoungArts%20Foundation">National YoungArts Foundation</a>. Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as "historic". <a href="University%20of%20Miami">University of Miami</a> professor of architecture Allan Schulman said "Miami's brand is its identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about". In 2007 Chad Oppenheim, the head of Oppenheim Architecture + Design, described the Bacardi buildings as "elegant, with a <a href="Modernist%20architecture">Modernist</a> [look combined with] a local flavour."

The current American headquarters is at 2701 LeJeune Road in Coral Gables. The 300 employees occupy of leased office space.

Bacardi had architects <a href="Ludwig%20Mies%20Van%20Der%20Rohe">Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe</a> and <a href="Felix%20Candela">Felix Candela</a> design <a href="Ludwig%20Mies%20Van%20Der%20Rohe%20and%20Felix%20Candela%27s%20Industrial%20Buildings">office buildings and a bottling plant</a> for them in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> during the 1950s. The building complex was added to the tentative list of <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>'s <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> list on 20 November 2001.

Black and Tans

The Black and Tans (), officially the Royal Irish Constabulary Special Reserve, was a force of <a href="Special%20Constable">Temporary Constables</a> recruited to assist the <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Constabulary">Royal Irish Constabulary</a> (RIC) during the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>. The force was the brainchild of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, then British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a>. Recruitment began in Great Britain in late 1919. Thousands, many of them <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> veterans of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, answered the British government's call for recruits. Most of the recruits came from Britain, although it also had some members from Ireland. Their role was to help the RIC maintain control and fight the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281917%E2%80%9322%29">Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA), the army of the <a href="Irish%20Republic">Irish Republic</a>. The nickname "Black and Tans" arose from the colours of the improvised uniforms they initially wore, composed of mixed <a href="khaki">khaki</a> British Army and <a href="rifle%20green">rifle green</a> RIC uniform parts. The Black and Tans became infamous for their attacks on civilians and civilian property.

The Black and Tans were sometimes confused with the <a href="Auxiliary%20Division">Auxiliary Division</a>, a <a href="counter-insurgency">counter-insurgency</a> unit of the RIC made up of former British officers. However, sometimes the term "Black and Tans" is used to cover both of these groups.

The late 19th and early 20th centuries in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> were dominated by <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish nationalists'</a> pursuit of <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule%20movement">Home Rule</a> from the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>. The issue of Home Rule was shelved with the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and in 1916 <a href="Irish%20republicanism">Irish republicans</a> staged the <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a> against British rule in an attempt to establish a republic. Growing support amongst the Irish populace for the republican <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a> political party saw it win 73 out of 105 seats in the <a href="Irish%20general%20election%2C%201918">Irish general election, 1918</a>. On 21 January 1919, Sinn Féin established themselves as the <a href="First%20D%C3%A1il">First Dáil</a>, which then declared an independent <a href="Irish%20Republic">Irish Republic</a>. They also declared the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281917%E2%80%9322%29">Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) the official army of the state, which in the same month began the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>. The main targets of the IRA offensive were the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the British Army in Ireland.

In September 1919 <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, the British Prime Minister, outlawed the Dáil and augmented the British Army presence in Ireland, starting work on the next <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland%20Act%201920">Home Rule Act</a>.
In January 1920, the British government started advertising in British cities for men willing to "face a rough and dangerous task", helping to boost the ranks of the RIC in policing an increasingly anti-British Ireland. There was no shortage of recruits, many of them unemployed First World War army veterans, and by November 1921 about 9,500 men had joined. This sudden influx of men led to a shortage of RIC uniforms, and the new recruits were issued with <a href="khaki">khaki</a> army uniforms (usually only trousers) and dark green RIC or blue <a href="British%20police">British police</a> surplus tunics, caps and belts. These uniforms differentiated them from the British Army and the regular RIC, and gave rise to the force's nickname: Christopher O'Sullivan wrote in the "<a href="Limerick%20Echo">Limerick Echo</a>" on 25 March 1920 that, meeting a group of recruits on a train at <a href="Limerick%20Junction">Limerick Junction</a>, the attire of one reminded him of the <a href="Scarteen">Scarteen</a> <a href="fox%20hunting">Hunt</a>, whose "Black and Tans" nickname derived from the colouration of its <a href="Kerry%20Beagle">Kerry Beagle</a>s. Ennis comedian <a href="Mike%20Nono">Mike Nono</a> elaborated the joke in Limerick's Theatre Royal, and the nickname soon took hold, persisting even after the men received full RIC uniforms. The popular Irish claim made at the time that most of men serving the Black and Tans had criminal records and had been recruited straight from British prisons is incorrect, as a criminal record would disqualify one from working as a policeman. The vast majority of the men serving in the Black and Tans were unemployed veterans of the First World War who were having trouble finding jobs, and for most of them it was economic reasons that drove them to join the Temporary Constables.

The new recruits received three months' hurried training, and were rapidly posted to RIC barracks, mostly in rural <a href="County%20Dublin">County Dublin</a>, <a href="Munster">Munster</a> and eastern <a href="Connacht">Connacht</a>. The first men arrived on 25 March 1920. The British government also raised another unit, the <a href="Auxiliary%20Division">Auxiliary Division</a> of the constabulary, known as the Auxiliaries or Auxies, consisting of ex-army officers. The Black and Tans aided the Auxiliaries in the British government's attempts to break both the IRA and the Dáil. The Blacks and Tans were meant to back up the RIC in the struggle against the IRA, playing a defensive-reactive role whereas the role of the "Auxies" were those of heavily armed, mobile units meant for offensive operations in the Irish countryside intended to hunt down and destroy IRA units. At least part of the infamy of the Blacks and Tans is undeserved as many of the war crimes attributed to the Blacks and Tans were actually the work of the "Auxies".

Temporary Constables were paid the relatively good wage of 10 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s (half a <a href="Pound%20stirling%23Pre-decimal">pound</a>) a day, plus full board and lodging. With minimal police training, their main role was to increase the strength of police posts, where they functioned as sentries, guards, escorts for government agents, reinforcement to the regular police, and crowd control. They mounted a determined <a href="counter-insurgency">counter-insurgency</a> campaign. They and the Auxies became known as "Tudor's Toughs" after the police commander, Major-General Sir <a href="Henry%20Hugh%20Tudor">Henry Hugh Tudor</a>. They were viewed by republicans as akin to an army of occupation because of these duties. They soon gained a reputation for brutality, as the RIC campaign against the IRA and Sinn Féin members was stepped up and police reprisals for IRA attacks were condoned by the government.

Alexander Will, from <a href="Forfar">Forfar</a> in Scotland, was the first Temporary Constable to die in the conflict. He was killed during an IRA attack on the RIC barracks in <a href="Rathmore%2C%20County%20Kerry">Rathmore</a>, County Kerry, on 11 July 1920.

The Black and Tans were not subject to strict discipline in their first months and, as a result, their deaths at the hands of the IRA in 1920 were often repaid with arbitrary reprisals against the civilian population. In the summer of 1920, the Black and Tans burned and sacked many small towns and villages in Ireland, beginning with <a href="Tuam">Tuam</a> in <a href="County%20Galway">County Galway</a> in July 1920 and also including <a href="Trim%2C%20County%20Meath">Trim</a>, <a href="Balbriggan">Balbriggan</a>, <a href="Knockcroghery">Knockcroghery</a>, <a href="Thurles">Thurles</a> and <a href="Templemore">Templemore</a> amongst many others. In November 1920, the Tans "besieged" <a href="Tralee">Tralee</a> in revenge for the IRA abduction and killing of two local RIC men. They closed all the businesses in the town, let no food in for a week and shot dead three local civilians. On 14 November, the Tans were suspected of abducting and murdering a Roman Catholic priest, Father <a href="Michael%20Griffin%20%28Irish%20priest%29">Michael Griffin</a>, in <a href="Galway">Galway</a>. His body was found in a bog in <a href="Barna">Barna</a> a week later. From October 1920 to July 1921, the Galway region was "remarkable in many ways", most notably the level of police brutality towards suspected IRA members, which was far above the norm in the rest of Ireland. On the night of 11 December 1920, they sacked <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a>, <a href="Burning%20of%20Cork">destroying a large part of the city centre</a>.

In January 1921, the British Labour Commission produced a report on the situation in Ireland which was highly critical of the government's security policy. It said the government, in forming the Black and Tans, had "liberated forces which it is not at present able to dominate". However, since 29 December 1920, the British government had sanctioned "official reprisals" in Ireland – usually meaning burning property of IRA men and their suspected sympathisers. Taken together with an increased emphasis on discipline in the RIC, this helped to curb the random atrocities the Black and Tans committed since March 1920 for the remainder of the war, if only because reprisals were now directed from above rather than being the result of a spontaneous desire for revenge.

Many of the activities popularly attributed to the Black and Tans may have been committed by the <a href="Auxiliary%20Division">Auxiliary Division</a>; For instance, <a href="Tom%C3%A1s%20Mac%20Curtain">Tomás Mac Curtain</a>, the Mayor of Cork, was assassinated in March 1920 by local RIC men under the command of an Inspector General who had been a 'plague on the local Catholic population' and the shooting dead of 13 civilians at <a href="Croke%20Park">Croke Park</a> on <a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%281920%29">Bloody Sunday</a> was supposedly carried out by the regular RIC, although a small detachment of Auxiliaries were also present. Most Republicans did not make a distinction, and "Black and Tans" was often used as a catch-all term for all police groups.

The actions of the Black and Tans alienated public opinion in both Ireland and Great Britain. Their violent tactics encouraged the Irish public to increase their covert support of the IRA, while the British public pressed for a move towards a peaceful resolution. <a href="E.%20F.%20L.%20Wood%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Halifax">Edward Wood</a> MP, better known as the future Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, rejected force and urged the British government to make an offer to the Irish "conceived on the most generous lines". Sir <a href="John%20Simon%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Simon">John Simon</a> MP, another future Foreign Secretary, was also horrified at the tactics being used. <a href="Lionel%20Curtis">Lionel Curtis</a>, writing in the imperialist journal "<a href="The%20Round%20Table%20Journal">The Round Table</a>", wrote: "If the British Commonwealth can only be preserved by such means, it would become a negation of the principle for which it has stood". The <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King</a>, senior Anglican bishops, MPs from the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> parties, <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a>, <a href="Jan%20Smuts">Jan Smuts</a>, the <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">Trades Union Congress</a> and parts of the press were increasingly critical of the actions of the Black and Tans. <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> said of the British peace offer: "It is not fear of losing more lives that has compelled a reluctant offer from England but it is the shame of any further imposition of agony upon a people that loves liberty above everything else".

About 7,000 Black and Tans served in Ireland in 1920–22. More than one-third left the service before they were disbanded along with the rest of the RIC in 1922, an extremely high wastage rate, and well over half received government pensions. A total of 404 members of the <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Constabulary">Royal Irish Constabulary</a> died in the conflict and more than 600 were wounded but it is not clear how many of these were regular RIC men and how many were Black and Tans or Auxiliaries.

Those who returned to civilian life sometimes had problems re-integrating. At least two former Black and Tans were hanged for murder in Britain and another wanted for murder committed suicide before the police could arrest him.

Due to the ferocity of the Tans' behaviour in Ireland and the numerous <a href="war%20crimes">war crimes</a> they committed, feelings continue to run high regarding their actions. "Black and Tan" or "Tan" remains a pejorative term for the British in Ireland, and the reputation of the Tans is still hated in Ireland. The term can still stir bad reactions because of their remembered brutality. One of the best known Irish Republican songs is <a href="Dominic%20Behan">Dominic Behan</a>'s "<a href="Come%20out%20Ye%20Black%20and%20Tans">Come out Ye Black and Tans</a>". The <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a> is sometimes referred to as the "Tan War" or "Black-and-Tan War." This term was preferred by those who fought on the anti-Treaty side in the <a href="Irish%20Civil%20War">Irish Civil War</a> and is still used by Republicans today. The "Cogadh na Saoirse" medal, awarded since 1941 by the <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland">Irish government</a> to IRA veterans of the War of Independence, bears a ribbon with two vertical stripes in black and tan.

Bunsen burner

A Bunsen burner, named after <a href="Robert%20Bunsen">Robert Bunsen</a>, is a common piece of <a href="laboratory%20equipment">laboratory equipment</a> that produces a single open gas <a href="flame">flame</a>, which is used for heating, sterilization, and combustion.

The gas can be <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> (which is mainly <a href="methane">methane</a>) or a <a href="liquefied%20petroleum%20gas">liquefied petroleum gas</a>, such as <a href="propane">propane</a>, <a href="butane">butane</a>, or a mixture of both.

In 1852 the University of Heidelberg hired Bunsen and promised him a new laboratory building. The city of Heidelberg had begun to install <a href="coal-gas">coal-gas</a> street lighting, and so the university laid gas lines to the new laboratory.

The designers of the building intended to use the gas not just for illumination, but also in burners for laboratory operations. For any burner lamp, it was desirable to maximize the temperature and minimize luminosity. However, existing laboratory burner lamps left much to be desired not just in terms of the heat of the flame, but also regarding economy and simplicity.

While the building was still under construction in late 1854, Bunsen suggested certain design principles to the university's mechanic, <a href="Peter%20Desaga">Peter Desaga</a>, and asked him to construct a prototype. (Similar principles had been used in an earlier burner design by <a href="Michael%20Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>, as well as in a device patented in 1856 by the gas engineer R. W. Elsner) The Bunsen/Desaga design succeeded in generating a hot, sootless, non-luminous flame by mixing the gas with air in a controlled fashion before combustion. Desaga created adjustable slits for air at the bottom of the cylindrical burner, with the flame igniting at the top. By the time the building opened early in 1855 Desaga had made 50 burners for Bunsen's students. Two years later Bunsen published a description, and many of his colleagues soon adopted the design. Bunsen burners are now used in laboratories all around the world.

The device in use today safely burns a continuous stream of a flammable <a href="gas">gas</a> such as <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> (which is principally <a href="methane">methane</a>) or a <a href="liquefied%20petroleum%20gas">liquefied petroleum gas</a> such as <a href="propane">propane</a>, <a href="butane">butane</a>, or a mixture of both.

The hose barb is connected to a gas nozzle on the laboratory bench with rubber tubing. Most laboratory benches are equipped with multiple gas nozzles connected to a central gas source, as well as vacuum, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, and steam nozzles. The gas then flows up through the base through a small hole at the bottom of the barrel and is directed upward. There are open slots in the side of the tube bottom to admit air into the stream using the <a href="Venturi%20effect">Venturi effect</a>, and the gas burns at the top of the tube once ignited by a flame or spark. The most common methods of lighting the burner are using a <a href="match">match</a> or a <a href="spark%20lighter">spark lighter</a>.

The amount of air mixed with the gas stream affects the completeness of the <a href="combustion">combustion</a> reaction. Less air yields an incomplete and thus cooler reaction, while a gas stream well mixed with air provides oxygen in a <a href="stoichiometric">stoichiometric</a> amount and thus a complete and hotter reaction. The air flow can be controlled by opening or closing the slot openings at the base of the barrel, similar in function to the <a href="Choke%20valve">choke</a> in a <a href="carburettor">carburettor</a>.
If the collar at the bottom of the tube is adjusted so more air can mix with the gas before combustion, the flame will burn hotter, appearing blue as a result. If the holes are closed, the gas will only mix with ambient air at the point of combustion, that is, only after it has exited the tube at the top. This reduced mixing produces an incomplete reaction, producing a cooler but brighter yellow, which is often called the "safety flame" or "<a href="luminous%20flame">luminous flame</a>". The yellow flame is <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> due to small <a href="soot">soot</a> particles in the flame, which are heated to <a href="incandescence">incandescence</a>. The yellow flame is considered "dirty" because it leaves a layer of carbon on whatever it is heating. When the burner is regulated to produce a hot, blue flame, it can be nearly invisible against some backgrounds. The hottest part of the flame is the tip of the inner flame, while the coolest is the whole inner flame. Increasing the amount of fuel gas flow through the tube by opening the <a href="needle%20valve">needle valve</a> will increase the size of the flame. However, unless the airflow is adjusted as well, the flame temperature will decrease because an increased amount of gas is now mixed with the same amount of air, starving the flame of oxygen.

Generally, the burner is placed underneath a <a href="Tripod%20%28laboratory%29">laboratory tripod</a>, which supports a <a href="Beaker%20%28glassware%29">beaker</a> or other container. The burner will often be placed on a suitable <a href="heatproof%20mat">heatproof mat</a> to protect the laboratory bench surface.

A Bunsen burner is also regularly used in microbiology labs to work sterile. The burner is placed on the bench (working surface in the lab), where it creates an aseptic region, in which microbiologist can work

Other burners based on the same principle exist. The most important alternatives to the Bunsen burner are:

Blue whale

The blue whale ("Balaenoptera musculus") is a <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a> belonging to the <a href="baleen%20whale">baleen whale</a>s (<a href="Mysticeti">Mysticeti</a>). At up to in length and with a maximum recorded weight of and probably reaching over , it is the <a href="Largest%20organisms">largest animal</a> known to have ever existed.

Long and slender, the blue whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath. There are at least three distinct <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>: "B. m. musculus" of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic</a> and North Pacific, "B. m. intermedia" of the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> and "B. m. brevicauda" (also known as the <a href="pygmy%20blue%20whale">pygmy blue whale</a>) found in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> and <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">South Pacific Ocean</a>. "B. m. indica", found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s known as <a href="krill">krill</a>.

Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on <a href="Earth">Earth</a> until the beginning of the twentieth century. For over a century, they were hunted almost to <a href="extinction">extinction</a> by <a href="whaling">whalers</a> until protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, in at least five groups. The <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> estimates that there are probably between 10,000 and 25,000 blue whales worldwide today. Before whaling, the largest population was in the <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a>, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, <a href="Antarctica">Antarctic</a>, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>, and at least two in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>. As of 2014, the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population had rebounded to nearly its pre-hunting population.

Blue whales are <a href="rorquals">rorquals</a> (family <a href="Balaenopteridae">Balaenopteridae</a>), a family that includes the <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a>, the <a href="fin%20whale">fin whale</a>, <a href="Bryde%27s%20whale">Bryde's whale</a>, the <a href="sei%20whale">sei whale</a>, and the <a href="minke%20whale">minke whale</a>. The family Balaenopteridae is believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder <a href="Mysticeti">Mysticeti</a> as long ago as the middle <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> (28 <a href="Ma%20%28unit%29">Ma</a> ago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.

The blue whale is usually classified as one of eight species in the genus "Balaenoptera"; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, "Sibbaldus", but this is not accepted elsewhere. <a href="DNA">DNA</a> <a href="sequencing">sequencing</a> analysis indicates that the blue whale is <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetically</a> closer to the sei whale ("Balaenoptera borealis") and Bryde's whale ("Balaenoptera brydei") than to other "Balaenoptera" species, and closer to the humpback whale ("Megaptera") and the <a href="gray%20whale">gray whale</a> ("Eschrichtius") than to the minke whales ("Balaenoptera acutorostrata" and "Balaenoptera bonaerensis"). If further research confirms these relationships, it will be necessary to reclassify the rorquals.

There have been at least 11 documented cases of blue whale-<a href="fin%20whale">fin whale</a> hybrid adults in the wild. Arnason and Gullberg describe the genetic distance between a blue and a fin as about the same as that between a human and a gorilla. Researchers working off Fiji believe they photographed a hybrid <a href="Humpback%20whale">humpback</a>-blue whale including the discovery through DNA analysis from a meat sample found in a Japanese market.

The first published description of the blue whale comes from <a href="Robert%20Sibbald">Robert Sibbald</a>'s "Phalainologia Nova" (1694). In September 1692, Sibbald found a blue whale that had stranded in the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a> – a male long – that had "black, horny plates" and "two large apertures approaching a pyramid in shape".

The specific name "musculus" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and could mean "muscle", but it can also be interpreted as "little mouse". <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, who named the species in his seminal "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" of 1758, would have known this and may have intended the ironic <a href="double%20entendre">double meaning</a>. <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a> called this species "sulphur-bottom" in his novel "<a href="Cetology%20of%20Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>" (1851) due to an orange-brown or yellow tinge on the underparts from <a href="diatom">diatom</a> films on the skin. Other common names for the blue whale have included "Sibbald's rorqual" (after Sibbald, who first described the species), the "great blue whale" and the "great northern rorqual". These names have now fallen into disuse. The first known usage of the term "blue whale" was in Melville's "Moby-Dick", which only mentions it in passing and does not specifically attribute it to the species in question. The name was really derived from the Norwegian "blåhval", coined by <a href="Svend%20Foyn">Svend Foyn</a> shortly after he had perfected the harpoon gun; the Norwegian scientist <a href="Georg%20Ossian%20Sars">G. O. Sars</a> adopted it as the Norwegian common name in 1874.

Authorities classify the species into three or four subspecies: "B. m. musculus", the northern blue whale consisting of the North Atlantic and North Pacific populations, "B. m. intermedia", the southern blue whale of the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>, "B. m. brevicauda", the <a href="pygmy%20blue%20whale">pygmy blue whale</a> found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific, and the more problematic "B. m. indica", the great Indian rorqual, which is also found in the Indian Ocean and, although described earlier, may be the same subspecies as "B. m. brevicauda".

The pygmy blue whale formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">Last Glacial Maximum</a>. This is likely because blue whales were driven north by expanding ice, and some have stayed there ever since. The pygmy blue whale's evolutionarily recent origins cause it to have a relatively low genetic diversity.

The blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales. The head is flat, "U"-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from the <a href="Blowhole%20%28anatomy%29">blowhole</a> to the top of the upper lip. The front part of the mouth is thick with <a href="baleen">baleen</a> plates; around 300 plates, each around one metre (3 ft) long, hang from the upper jaw, running back into the mouth. Between 70 and 118 grooves (called ventral pleats) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding (see <a href="Blue%20whale%23Feeding">feeding</a> below).

The <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a> is small; its height averages about , and usually ranges between and , though it can be as small as or as large as . It is visible only briefly during the dive sequence. Located around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, but others may have prominent and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsals. When surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a vertical single-column spout, typically high, but reaching up to . Its <a href="lung">lung</a> capacity is . Blue whales have twin blowholes shielded by a large splashguard.

The flippers are long. The upper sides are grey with a thin white border; the lower sides are white. The head and tail fluke are generally uniformly grey. The whale's upper parts, and sometimes the flippers, are usually mottled. The degree of mottling varies substantially from individual to individual. Some may have a uniform slate-grey color, but others demonstrate a considerable variation of dark blues, greys and blacks, all tightly mottled.

Blue whales can reach speeds of over short bursts, usually when interacting with other whales, but is a more typical traveling speed. Satellite <a href="telemetry">telemetry</a> of Australian pygmy blue whales <a href="Animal%20Migration">migrating</a> to <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> has shown that they cover between 0.09 and 455.8 kilometers (0.056 and 283.2 miles) per day. When feeding, they slow down to .

Blue whales typically swim at a depth of about 13 meters (42.5 feet) when migrating in order to eliminate <a href="Drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a> from surface waves. The deepest confirmed dive is 506 meters (1,660 feet).

Blue whales most commonly live alone or with one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations where there is a high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered over a small area. They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.

The blue whale is the largest animal known to have ever lived. By comparison, one of the largest known <a href="dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a> of the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> Era was "<a href="Argentinosaurus">Argentinosaurus</a>", which is estimated to have weighed up to , comparable to the average blue whale.

Blue whales are difficult to weigh because of their size. They were never weighed whole, but cut into blocks 0.5–0.6 meters (1.6–2 ft) across and weighed by parts. This caused a considerable loss of blood and body fluids, estimated to be about 6% of the total weight. As a whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific are smaller on average than those from Antarctic waters. Adult weights typically range from . There is some uncertainty about the biggest blue whale ever found, as most data came from blue whales killed in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> waters during the first half of the twentieth century, which were collected by whalers not well-versed in standard zoological measurement techniques. The standard measuring technique is to measure in a straight line from the upper jaw to the notch in the tail flukes. This came about because the edges of the tail flukes were typically cut off, and the lower jaw often falls open upon death. Many of the larger whales in the whaling records (especially those over ) were probably measured incorrectly or even deliberately exaggerated. The heaviest weight ever reported was ; for a southern hemisphere female in 1947, it is likely that the largest blue whales would have weighed over . The longest whales ever recorded were two females measuring , but in neither of these cases was the piecemeal weight gathered. Possibly the largest recorded male was killed near the <a href="South%20Shetland%20Islands">South Shetland Islands</a> in 1926 and was measured at 31.7 m (104 ft).

Females are generally a few feet longer than males. However, males may be slightly heavier on average than females of the same length, owing to heavier muscles and bones. Verified measurements rarely exceed . The longest measured by Macintosh and Wheeler (1929) was a female , while the largest male was ; one of the same authors later found a male of and stated that those lengths may be exceeded. The longest whale measured by scientists was long. Lieut. Quentin R. Walsh, <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">USCG</a>, while acting as whaling inspector of the <a href="factory%20ship">factory ship</a> "Ulysses", verified the measurement of a pregnant blue whale caught in the Antarctic in the 1937–38 season. A male was verified by Japanese scientists in the 1947–48 whaling season. The longest reported in the North Pacific was a female taken by Japanese whalers in 1959, and the longest reported in the North Atlantic was a female caught in the <a href="Davis%20Strait">Davis Strait</a>. The average weight of the longest scientifically verified specimens () would be calculated to be 176.5 tonnes (194.6 tons), varying from 141 tonnes (155.4 tons) to 211.5 tonnes (233.1 tons) depending on fat condition. One study found that a hypothetical blue whale would be too large to exist in real life, due to metabolic and energy constraints.

Due to its large size, several organs of the blue whale are the largest in the animal kingdom. A blue whale's <a href="tongue">tongue</a> weighs around and, when fully expanded, its mouth is large enough to hold up to of food and water. Despite the size of its mouth, the dimensions of its throat are such that a blue whale cannot swallow an object wider than a beach ball. The <a href="heart">heart</a> of an average sized blue whale weighs and is the <a href="largest%20body%20part">largest</a> known in any animal. During the first seven months of its life, a blue whale calf drinks approximately of milk every day. Blue whale calves gain <a href="body%20weight">weight</a> quickly, as much as every 24 hours. Even at birth, they weigh up to —the same as a fully grown <a href="hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a>. Blue whales have proportionally small brains, only about , about 0.007% of its body weight, although with a highly convoluted cerebral cortex. The <a href="blue%20whale%20penis">blue whale penis</a> is the largest penis of any living organism and also set the <a href="Guinness%20World%20Record">Guinness World Record</a> as the longest of any animal's. The reported average length varies but is usually mentioned to have an average length of to .
Blue whales feed almost exclusively on <a href="krill">krill</a>, though they also take small numbers of <a href="copepod">copepod</a>s. The species of this <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a> eaten by blue whales varies from ocean to ocean. In the North Atlantic, "<a href="Meganyctiphanes%20norvegica">Meganyctiphanes norvegica</a>", "<a href="Thysanoessa%20raschii">Thysanoessa raschii</a>", "<a href="Thysanoessa%20inermis">Thysanoessa inermis</a>" and "<a href="Thysanoessa%20longicaudata">Thysanoessa longicaudata</a>" are the usual food; in the North Pacific, "<a href="Euphausia%20pacifica">Euphausia pacifica</a>", "<a href="Thysanoessa%20inermis">Thysanoessa inermis</a>", "<a href="Thysanoessa%20longipes">Thysanoessa longipes</a>", "<a href="Thysanoessa%20spinifera">Thysanoessa spinifera</a>", "<a href="Nyctiphanes%20symplex">Nyctiphanes symplex</a>" and "<a href="Nematoscelis%20megalops">Nematoscelis megalops</a>"; and in the Southern Hemisphere, "<a href="Euphausia%20superba">Euphausia superba</a>", "<a href="Euphausia%20crystallorophias">Euphausia crystallorophias</a>", "<a href="Euphausia%20valentini">Euphausia valentini</a>", and "<a href="Nyctiphanes%20australis">Nyctiphanes australis</a>".

An adult blue whale can eat up to 40 million krill in a day. The whales always feed in the areas with the highest concentration of krill, sometimes eating up to of krill in a single day. The daily energy requirement of an adult blue whale is in the region of . Their feeding habits are seasonal. Blue whales gorge on krill in the rich waters of the Antarctic before migrating to their breeding grounds in the warmer, less-rich waters nearer the equator. The blue whale can take in up to 90 times as much energy as it expends, allowing it to build up considerable energy reserves.

Because krill move, blue whales typically feed at depths of more than during the day and only surface-feed at night. Dive times are typically 10 minutes when feeding, though dives of up to 21 minutes are possible. The whale feeds by lunging forward at groups of krill, taking the animals and a large quantity of water into its mouth. The water is then squeezed out through the baleen plates by pressure from the ventral pouch and tongue. Once the mouth is clear of water, the remaining krill, unable to pass through the plates, are swallowed. The blue whale also incidentally consumes small fish, crustaceans and squid caught up with krill.

Mating starts in late autumn and continues to the end of winter. Little is known about mating behaviour or breeding grounds. In the fall, males will follow females for prolonged periods of time. Occasionally, a second male will attempt to displace the first, and the whales will race each other at high speed, ranging from to in New Zealand. This often causes the racing whales to breach, which is rare in blue whales. This racing behavior may even escalate to physical violence between the males. Scientists have observed this behavior in multiple parts of the world, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada and the South Taranaki Bight in New Zealand.

Females typically give birth once every two to three years at the start of the winter after a <a href="gestation%20period">gestation period</a> of 10 to 12 months. The calf weighs about and is around in length. Blue whale calves drink 380–570 litres (100–150 U.S. gallons) of milk a day. Blue whale milk has an energy content of about 18,300 kJ/kg (4,370 kcal/kg). The calf is <a href="weaning">weaned</a> after six months, by which time it has doubled in length. The first video of a calf thought to be nursing was made 5 February 2016.

Sexual maturity is typically reached at five to ten years of age. In the Northern Hemisphere, whaling records show that males averaged and females at sexual maturity, while in the Southern Hemisphere it was , respectively. In the Northern Hemisphere, as adults, males averaged and females with average calculated weights of 90.5 and 101.5 tonnes (100 and 112 tons), respectively. Blue whales in the eastern North Pacific population were found to be on average 0.91 meters (3 ft) shorter, therefore with males averaging 23.3 meters (76 ft) and 80.5 tonnes (88.5 tons) and females 24 meters (79 ft) and 90.5 tonnes (100 tons). Antarctic males averaged and females , averaging 101.5 and 118 tonnes (112 and 130 tons). Pygmy blue whales average 19.2 meters (63 feet) at sexual maturity, with males averaging 21 meters and females 22 meters (69 and 72 feet) when fully grown, averaging 76 and 90 tonnes (83.5 and 99 tons).

In the eastern North Pacific, photogrammetric studies have shown sexually mature (but not necessarily fully grown) blue whales today average , and about 65.5 tonnes (72 tons) with the largest found being about 24.5 m (80.5 ft). A female washed ashore near <a href="Pescadero%2C%20California">Pescadero, California</a> in 1979.

The weight of individual blue whales varies significantly according to fat condition. Antarctic blue whales gain 50% of their lean body weight in the summer feeding season, i.e. a blue whale entering the Antarctic weighing 100 tons would leave weighing 150 tons. Pregnant females probably gain 60–65%. The fattened weight is 120% the average weight and the lean weight is 80%.

Scientists estimate that blue whales can live for at least 80 years, but since individual records do not date back into the whaling era, this will not be known with certainty for many years. The longest recorded study of a single individual is 34 years, in the eastern North Pacific.

The whales' only natural predator is the <a href="orca">orca</a>. Studies report that as many as 25% of mature blue whales have scars resulting from orca attacks. The mortality rate of such attacks is unknown.

Blue whale strandings are extremely uncommon, and, because of the species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, they can become the focus of public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near <a href="Bragar">Bragar</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Lewis">Isle of Lewis</a> in the <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a> of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.

In June 2015, a female blue whale estimated at 12.2 meters (40 feet) and 20 tonnes (22 tons) was stranded on a beach in Maharashtra, India, the first live stranding in the region. Despite efforts by the Albaug forest department and local fishermen, the whale died 10 hours after being stranded. In August 2009, a wounded blue whale was stranded in a bay in Steingrímsfjördur, Iceland. The first rescue attempt failed, as the whale (thought to be over 20 meters long) towed the >20 ton boat back to shore at speeds of up to . The whale was towed to sea after 7 hours by a stronger boat. It is unknown whether it survived. In December 2015, a live blue whale thought to be over 20 metres (65 feet) long was rescued from a beach in Chile. Another stranded blue whale, thought to be about 12.2 metres (40 feet) long, was rescued in India in February 2016. Boats were used in all successful cases.

Estimates made by Cummings and Thompson (1971) suggest the source level of sounds made by blue whales are between 155 and 188 <a href="decibel">decibel</a>s when measured relative to a reference pressure of one <a href="micropascal">micropascal</a> at one metre. All blue whale groups make calls at a <a href="fundamental%20frequency">fundamental frequency</a> between 10 and 40 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a>; the lowest frequency sound a human can typically perceive is 20 Hz. Blue whale calls last between ten and thirty seconds. Blue whales off the coast of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> have been repeatedly recorded making "songs" of four notes, lasting about two minutes each, reminiscent of the well-known humpback whale songs. As this phenomenon has not been seen in any other populations, researchers believe it may be unique to the "B. m. brevicauda" (pygmy) subspecies. The loudest sustained noise from a blue whale was at 188 dB.

The purpose of vocalization is unknown. Richardson "et al." (1995) discuss six possible reasons:


Blue whales are not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead targeted <a href="Sperm%20whale">sperm</a> and <a href="right%20whale">right whale</a>s. In 1864, the Norwegian <a href="Svend%20Foyn">Svend Foyn</a> equipped a <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a> with <a href="harpoon">harpoon</a>s specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of <a href="Finnmark">Finnmark</a> in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.

Soon, blue whales were being hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> (1898), and <a href="Spitsbergen">Spitsbergen</a> (1903). In 1904–05 the first blue whales were taken off <a href="South%20Georgia%20Island">South Georgia</a>. By 1925, with the advent of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to increase dramatically. In the 1930–31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone. By the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance.

<a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, in his 1962 book "Profiles of the Future", was the first prominent <a href="intellectual">intellectual</a> to call attention to the plight of the blue whale. He mentioned its large brain and said, "we do not know the true nature of the entity we are destroying."

All of the historical coastal Asian groups were driven to near-extinction in short order by Japanese industrial hunts. Those groups that once migrated along western Japan to the <a href="East%20China%20Sea">East China Sea</a> were likely wiped out much earlier, as the last catches on <a href="Amami%20Oshima">Amami Oshima</a> were between the 1910s and the 1930s, and the last known stranding records on the Japanese archipelago, excluding the <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyu Islands</a>, were over a half-century ago. Commercial catches were continued until 1965 and whaling stations targeting blues were mainly placed along the <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> and <a href="Sanriku">Sanriku</a> coasts.

Blue whale hunting was banned in 1966 by the <a href="International%20Whaling%20Commission">International Whaling Commission</a>, and illegal whaling by the Soviet Union finally halted in the 1970s, by which time 330,000 blue whales had been caught in the Antarctic, 33,000 in the rest of the Southern Hemisphere, 8,200 in the North Pacific, and 7,000 in the North Atlantic. The largest original population, in the Antarctic, had been reduced to a mere 360 individuals, about 0.15% of their initial numbers.

Since the introduction of the whaling ban, studies have examined whether the <a href="conservation%20reliant%20species">conservation reliant</a> global blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable. In the Antarctic, best estimates show an increase of 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels. Recovery varies regionally, and the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population (historically a relatively small proportion of the global total) has rebounded to about 2,200 individuals, an estimated 97% of its pre-hunting population.

The total world population was estimated to be between 5,000 and 12,000 in 2002; there are high levels of uncertainty in available estimates for many areas. A more recent estimate by the IUCN puts the global population at 10,000–25,000.

The <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> counts the blue whale as "endangered", as it has since the list's inception. In the United States, the <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> lists them as endangered under the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. The largest known concentration, consisting of about 2,800 individuals, is the northeast Pacific population of the northern blue whale ("B. m. musculus") subspecies that ranges from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> to <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>, but is most commonly seen from California in summer. Infrequently, this population visits the northwest Pacific between <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka</a> and the northern tip of Japan.

In the North Atlantic, two stocks of "B. m. musculus" are recognised. The first is found off <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland</a>, Nova Scotia and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Saint%20Lawrence">Gulf of Saint Lawrence</a>. This group is estimated to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a> between the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted as far north as <a href="Spitsbergen">Spitsbergen</a> and <a href="Jan%20Mayen">Jan Mayen</a>, though such sightings are rare. Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500. Off Ireland, the first confirmed sightings were made in 2008, since then <a href="Porcupine%20Seabight">Porcupine Seabight</a> has been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with fin whales. One was sighted along <a href="Galicia%2C%20Spain">Galicia, Spain</a>, in 2017.

Five or more subpopulations have been suggested, and several of these mainly in the western North Pacific have been considered either functionally or virtually extinct. Of the populations that once existed off coastal Japan, the last recorded confirmed stranding was in the 1910s. Today, call types suggest only two populations in the North Pacific. Some scientists regard that historical populations off Japan were driven to extinction by whaling activities, mostly from the Kumanonada Sea off <a href="Wakayama">Wakayama</a>, in the , and in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Hy%C5%ABga">Sea of Hyūga</a>. Nowadays, possible vagrants from either eastern or offshore populations are observed on very rare occasions off <a href="Kushiro">Kushiro</a>. There were also small, but constant catch records around the <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a> and in the coastal waters of the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a>; this species is normally considered not to frequent into <a href="marginal%20sea">marginal sea</a>s, such as the <a href="Sea%20of%20Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a>, on usual migrations. Whales were known to migrate further north to eastern <a href="Kamchatka">Kamchatka</a>, the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Anadyr">Gulf of Anadyr</a>, off <a href="Abashiri">Abashiri</a> or the southern Sea of Okhotsk, and the <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a>. Only three sightings were made between 1994 and 2004 in Russia with one sighted off east coast of the peninsula in 2009, and the last known occurrence in the eastern Sea of Okhotsk was in 1948. In addition, whales have not been confirmed off the <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a> for over past 80 years. In 2017, 13 or more whales were observed off Kamchatka and Commander Islands. Historically, wintering grounds existed off the <a href="Hawaiian%20Archipelago">Hawaiian Archipelago</a>, the <a href="Northern%20Mariana%20Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a>, the <a href="Bonin%20Islands">Bonin Islands</a> and <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyu Islands</a>, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, the <a href="Zhoushan%20Archipelago">Zhoushan Archipelago</a>, and the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a> such as in <a href="Daya%20Bay">Daya Bay</a>, off the <a href="Leizhou%20Peninsula">Leizhou Peninsula</a>, and off <a href="Hainan%20Island">Hainan Island</a>, and further south to the <a href="Paracel%20Islands">Paracel Islands</a>. Archaeological records suggest blue whales once migrated into the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a>, along the <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a> and northwestern <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, and to the <a href="Yellow%20Sea">Yellow</a> and <a href="Bohai%20Sea">Bohai Sea</a> as well. A stranding was recorded in <a href="Wanning">Wanning</a> in 2005. One whale was sighted off <a href="Weizhou%20Island">Weizhou Island</a> in 2017.For further status in Chinese and Korean waters, see "<a href="Wildlife%20of%20China">Wildlife of China</a>".

As of 2014, the eastern North Pacific blue whale population had rebounded to an estimated 2,200 individuals, which is thought to be about 97% of its pre-whaling numbers.

In the Southern Hemisphere, there appear to be two distinct subspecies, "B. m. intermedia", the Antarctic blue whale, and the little-studied pygmy blue whale, "B. m. brevicauda", found in Indian Ocean waters. The most recent surveys (midpoint 1998) provided an estimate of 2,280 blue whales in the Antarctic (of which fewer than 1% are likely to be pygmy blue whales). Estimates from a 1996 survey show that 424 pygmy blue whales were in a small area south of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> (the Madagascar Plateau) alone, thus it is likely that numbers in the entire Indian Ocean are in the thousands. If this is true, the global numbers would be much higher than estimates predict. However, slower reproduction rate of the species, along with the impacts of whaling, may affect population recoveries as the total population size is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100. 

Several congregating grounds are recently confirmed in <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a>, such as Perth Canyon off <a href="Rottnest%20Island">Rottnest Island</a>, the <a href="Great%20Australian%20Bight">Great Australian Bight</a> off <a href="Portland%2C%20Victoria">Portland</a>, and in <a href="South%20Taranaki%20Bight">South Taranaki Bight</a> and off <a href="Kahurangi%20Point">Kahurangi Point</a> which was discovered just in 2007 and was confirmed in 2014, representing possibly a unique population based on haplotypes. Southern blue and pygmy blue females use waters off <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, and coastal areas of eastern <a href="North%20Island">North Island</a> of New Zealand, from <a href="Northland%20Region">Northland</a> waters such as the <a href="Bay%20of%20Islands">Bay of Islands</a> and <a href="Hauraki%20Gulf">Hauraki Gulf</a> to the <a href="Bay%20of%20Plenty">Bay of Plenty</a> in the south, as breeding and calving grounds. Whales off southern and western Australia are known to migrate into tropical coastal waters in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and off <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a>. (Animals in the Philippines may or may not originate from North Pacific populations or from a pygmy blue population in the northern Indian Ocean as whales regularly appear off <a href="Bohol">Bohol</a>, north of the <a href="Equator">Equator</a>.) At least on occasions, whales also migrate through remote islands such as <a href="Cook%20Islands">Cook Islands</a>, and Chilean pelagic waters adjacent to <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a> and <a href="Isla%20Salas%20y%20G%C3%B3mez">Isla Salas y Gómez</a>, where possibilities of undiscovered wintering grounds have been considered.

Blue whales also migrate through western African waters such as off <a href="Angola">Angola</a> and <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>, and at least whales around Iceland are known to migrate to Mauritania.

A fourth subspecies, "B. m. indica", was identified by <a href="Edward%20Blyth">Blyth</a> in 1859 in the northern Indian Ocean, but is now thought to be the same subspecies as "B. m. brevicauda", the pygmy blue whale. Records for Soviet catches seem to indicate that the female adult size is closer to that of the pygmy blue than "B. m. musculus"; the populations of "B. m. indica" and "B. m. brevicauda" appear to be discrete, and the breeding seasons differ by almost six months. Along mainland Indian coasts, appearances of whales had been scarce excluding unconfirmed record(s), the first blue whale since after the last <a href="Cetacean%20stranding">stranding</a> record in <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> in 1914, was sighted off <a href="Kunkeshwar">Kunkeshwar</a> along with several <a href="Bryde%27s%20whale">Bryde's whale</a>s in May 2015.

Migratory patterns of these subspecies are not well known. For example, pygmy blue whales have been recorded in the northern Indian Ocean (<a href="Oman">Oman</a>, Maldives and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>), where they may form a distinct resident population. Furthermore, sightings have been recorded from elsewhere in and adjacent to <a href="Arabian%20Sea">Arabian Sea</a>, including from <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a>, <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, coasts of <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> including <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> to <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, and within the <a href="Strait%20of%20Malacca">Strait of Malacca</a>. The first official confirmation within <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>'s EEZ occurred at <a href="Trang%20Province">Trang</a> in 2013.

In addition, the population of blue whales occurring off <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="Peru">Peru</a> may also be a distinct subspecies. Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean. In Chile, the <a href="Cetacean%20Conservation%20Center">Cetacean Conservation Center</a>, with support from the <a href="Chilean%20Navy">Chilean Navy</a>, is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of <a href="Chiloe%20Island">Chiloe Island</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Corcovado">Gulf of Corcovado</a> (<a href="Chilo%C3%A9%20National%20Park">Chiloé National Park</a>), where 326 blue whales were spotted in 2007. In this regions, it is normal for blue whales to enter <a href="Fiord">Fiord</a>s. Whales also reach southern Los Lagos, such as off <a href="Caleta%20Zorra">Caleta Zorra</a>, live along with other rorquals.

Efforts to calculate the blue whale population more accurately are supported by marine mammologists at <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>, who maintain the Ocean Biogeographic Information System—Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations (OBIS-SEAMAP), a collation of marine mammal sighting data from around 130 sources.

Due to their enormous size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in "<a href="National%20Geographic%20Magazine">National Geographic Magazine</a>" of a blue whale being attacked by <a href="orca">orca</a>s off the <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a>; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably died as a result of them shortly after the attack. In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off <a href="California">California</a>, with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The blue whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed. A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in <a href="Monterey%20Bay">Monterey Bay</a>, with the orcas swimming in a line up to the blue whale's side. The blue whale fled and escaped. Orcas have virtually no chance against an adult blue whale, but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment. Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.

Blue whales may be wounded, sometimes fatally, after colliding with ocean vessels, as well as becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including <a href="Marine%20mammals%20and%20sonar">sonar</a>, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which makes it harder for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8 kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100 Hz). Research on blue whales in the <a href="Southern%20California%20Bight">Southern California Bight</a> has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of <a href="polychlorinated%20biphenyl">polychlorinated biphenyl</a> (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.

With <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a> causing <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s and <a href="permafrost">permafrost</a> to melt rapidly and allowing a large amount of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a <a href="Shutdown%20of%20thermohaline%20circulation">disruption in the thermohaline circulation</a>. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.

The change in ocean temperature would also affect the blue whale's food supply. The warming trend and decreased salinity levels would cause a significant shift in krill location and abundance.

Before modern whaling began in the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure and very poorly understood. They, along with other large whales were mythologized and indistinguishable from sea monsters. Even after the first specimens were described, the blue whale went by many names and scientists often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were inaccurate. The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.

The blue whale rose from relative obscurity in the 1970s, after the release of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.

Today, the blue whale is renowned for being the largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as 110 feet (33.5 meters) or more. While such lengths were reported in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters). This is probably true (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet) but is highly misleading as the average size is much smaller.

The global population was reduced by more than 99% during the 20th century. Most of this was in the Antarctic, which had been reduced to 360 individuals or about 0.15% of their original numbers; other populations were not as badly depleted. The Antarctic blue whale population is growing at the relatively rapid rate of about 7.3% per year, but it was hunted to such a low level that it remains at a tiny fraction of pre-whaling numbers. The global population still requires protection, but it is not in immediate danger of extinction.

Other myths and misconceptions include that the blue whale's arteries can be swum through, that the heartbeat can be heard from 19 miles away, and that the blue whale penis is 16 feet long.

The <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London%23Major%20specimens%20and%20exhibits">Natural History Museum</a> in London contains a famous mounted skeleton and life-size model of a blue whale, which were both the first of their kind in the world, but have since been replicated at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Cruz">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>. Similarly, the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> in New York City has a full-size model in its Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life.

The <a href="South%20African%20Museum">South African Museum</a> in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> features a hall devoted to whales and natural history known as the Whale Well. The centrepiece of the exhibit is a suspended mounted blue whale skeleton, from the carcass of a partially mature specimen that washed ashore in the mid 1980s. The skeleton's jaw bones are mounted on the floor of Whale Well to permit visitors direct contact with them, and to walk between them so as to appreciate the size of the animal. Other mounted skeletons include that of a <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a> and a <a href="right%20whale">right whale</a>, together with in-scale composite models of other whales, dolphins and porpoises.

The <a href="Tokyo%20National%20Museum">Tokyo National Museum</a> in <a href="Ueno%20Park">Ueno Park</a> displays a life-sized model of a blue whale in the front.

Bolsheviks

The Bolsheviks, originally also Bolshevists or Bolsheviki (; derived from большинство "bol'shinstvo", "majority", literally meaning "one of the majority") were a <a href="faction%20%28political%29">faction</a> of the <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> <a href="Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">Russian Social Democratic Labour Party</a> (RSDLP) which split apart from the <a href="Menshevik">Menshevik</a> faction at the <a href="2nd%20Congress%20of%20the%20RSDLP">Second Party Congress</a> in 1903. The RSDLP was a <a href="revolutionary%20socialist">revolutionary socialist</a> political party formed in 1898 in <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a> in <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> to unite the various revolutionary organisations of the Russian Empire into one party.

In the Second Party Congress vote, the Bolsheviks won on the majority of important issues, hence their name. They ultimately became the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>. The Bolsheviks or Reds came to power in <a href="Russia">Russia</a> during the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> phase of the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> of 1917, and founded the <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</a> (RSFSR). With the Reds defeating the <a href="White%20movement">Whites</a>, and others during the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War of 1917–1922</a>, the <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">RSFSR</a> became the chief constituent of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in December 1922.

The Bolsheviks, founded by <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Bogdanov">Alexander Bogdanov</a>, were by 1905 a major organization consisting primarily of workers under a democratic internal hierarchy governed by the principle of <a href="democratic%20centralism">democratic centralism</a>, who considered themselves the leaders of the revolutionary <a href="proletariat">working class</a> of Russia. Their beliefs and practices were often referred to as Bolshevism.

In the <a href="2nd%20Congress%20of%20the%20Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party</a>, held in Brussels and London during August 1903, Lenin and <a href="Julius%20Martov">Julius Martov</a> disagreed over the membership rules. Lenin wanted members "who recognise the Party Programme and support it by material means and by personal participation in one of the party's organisations." Julius Martov suggested "by regular personal assistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations." Lenin advocated limiting party membership to a smaller core of active members, as opposed to "<a href="Card-carrying%20Communists">card carriers</a>" who might only be active in party branches from time to time or not at all. This active base would develop the cadre, a core of "<a href="professional%20revolutionaries">professional revolutionaries</a>", consisting of loyal communists who would spend most of their time organising the party toward a mass revolutionary party capable of leading a <a href="Proletarian%20revolution">workers' revolution</a> against the <a href="Tsardom%20of%20Russia">Tsarist</a> autocracy.

A main source of the factions could be directly attributed to Lenin's steadfast opinion and unwillingness to "bear opinions which were contrary to his own". It was obvious at early stages in Lenin's revolutionary practices that he would not be willing to concede on any party policy that conflicted with his own predetermined ideas. It was the loyalty that he had to his own self-envisioned utopia that caused the party split. He was seen even by fellow party members as being so narrow minded that he believed that there were only two types of people: "Friend and enemy—those who followed him, and all the rest." <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, one of Lenin's fellow revolutionaries (though they had differing views as to how the revolution and party should be handled), compared Lenin in 1904 to the French revolutionary <a href="Maximilien%20de%20Robespierre">Robespierre</a>. Lenin's view of politics as verbal and ideological warfare and his inability to accept criticism even if it came from his own dedicated followers was the reason behind this accusation.

The root of the split was a book titled "<a href="What%20is%20to%20be%20Done%3F">What is to be Done?</a>" that Lenin wrote while serving a sentence of exile. In Germany, the book was published in 1902; in Russia, strict censorship outlawed its publication and distribution. One of the main points of Lenin's writing was that a revolution can only be achieved by the strong leadership of one person (or of a very select few people) over the masses. After the proposed revolution had successfully overthrown the government, this individual leader must release power, to allow socialism to fully encompass the nation. Lenin also wrote that revolutionary leaders must dedicate their entire lives to the cause in order for it to be successful. Lenin said that if professional revolutionaries did not maintain control over the workers then they would lose sight of the party's objective and adopt opposing beliefs, and even abandon the revolution entirely. Lenin's view of a socialist intelligentsia showed that he was not a complete supporter of Marxist theory, which also created some party unrest. For example, Lenin agreed with the Marxist idea of eliminating social classes, but in his utopian society there would still be visible distinctions between those in politics and the common worker. Most party members considered unequal treatment of workers immoral, and were loyal to the idea of a completely <a href="classless%20society">classless society</a>, so Lenin's variations caused the party internal dissonance. Although the party split of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would not become official until 1903, the differences originally began to surface with the publication of "What is to be Done?". Through the influence of the book, Lenin also undermined another group of reformers known as "Economists", who were pushing for economic reform while wanting to leave the government relatively unchanged, and who failed to recognize the importance of uniting the working population behind the party's cause.

Other than the debate between Lenin and Julius Martov; Lenin felt membership should require support of the Party program, financial contributions, and finally involvement in a Party organization whereas Martov didn't see the need for joining Party organizations, internal unrest also rose over the structure that was best suited for Soviet power. As discussed in "<a href="What%20is%20to%20be%20Done%3F">What is to be Done?</a>", Lenin firmly believed that a rigid political structure was needed to effectively initiate a formal revolution. This idea was met with opposition from his once close followers including Julius Martov, Georgy Plekhanov, Leon Trotsky, and Pavel Axelrod.> Georgy Plekhanov and Lenin's major dispute arose addressing the topic of nationalizing land or leaving it for private use. Lenin wanted to nationalize to aid in collectivization. Plekhanov thought worker motivation would remain higher if individuals were able to maintain their own property. Those who opposed Lenin and wanted to continue on the Marxist path towards complete socialism and disagreed with his strict party membership guidelines became known as "softs" while Lenin supporters became known as "hards."

The base of active and experienced members would be the recruiting ground for this professional core. Sympathizers would be left outside and the party would be organised based on the concept of <a href="democratic%20centralism">democratic centralism</a>. Martov, until then a close friend of Lenin, agreed with him that the core of the party should consist of professional revolutionaries, but argued that party membership should be open to sympathizers, revolutionary workers and other <a href="fellow%20traveler">fellow traveler</a>s.

The two had disagreed on the issue as early as March–May 1903, but it was not until the Congress that their differences became irreconcilable and split the party. At first the disagreement appeared to be minor and inspired by personal conflicts. For example, Lenin's insistence on dropping less active editorial board members from "<a href="Iskra">Iskra</a>" or Martov's support for the Organizing Committee of the Congress which Lenin opposed, The differences quickly grew and the split became irreparable.

The two factions were originally known as "hard" (Lenin's supporters) and "soft" (Martov's supporters). Soon, however, the terminology changed to "Bolsheviks" and "Mensheviks", from the Russian "bolshinstvo" (majority) and "menshinstvo" (minority). On the other hand, Martov's supporters won the vote concerning the question of party membership. Neither Lenin nor Martov had a firm majority throughout the Congress as delegates left or switched sides. At the end, the Congress was evenly split between the two factions.

From 1907 on, English language articles sometimes used the term "Maximalist" for "Bolshevik" and "Minimalist" for "Menshevik", which proved confusing since there was also a "Maximalist" faction within the Russian <a href="Socialist-Revolutionary%20Party">Socialist-Revolutionary Party</a> in 1904–06 (which after 1906 formed a separate <a href="Union%20of%20Socialists-Revolutionaries%20Maximalists">Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists</a>) and then again after 1917.

The average party member was very young. In 1907, 22% of Bolsheviks were under 20, 37% were 20–24 and 16% were 25–29. By 1905, 62% of the members were industrial workers (3% of the population in 1897). 22% of Bolsheviks were gentry (1.7% of the total population), 38% were uprooted peasants, compared with 19% and 26% for the <a href="Mensheviks">Mensheviks</a>. In 1907, 78.3% of the Bolsheviks were Russian and 10% were Jewish (34% and 20% for the Mensheviks). Total membership was 8,400 in 1905, 13,000 in 1906 and 46,100 by 1907 (8,400, 18,000, 38,200 respectively for the Mensheviks). By 1910, both factions together had fewer than 10,000 members.

The two factions were in a state of flux in 1903–04 with many members changing sides. The founder of Russian Marxism, <a href="Georgy%20Plekhanov">Georgy Plekhanov</a>, who was at first allied with <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> and the Bolsheviks, parted ways with them by 1904. <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a> at first supported the Mensheviks, but left them in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks. He remained a self-described "non-factional social democrat" until August 1917 when he joined Lenin and the Bolsheviks as their positions assembled and he came to believe that Lenin was right on the issue of the party.

All but one member of the Central Committee were arrested in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> in early 1905. The remaining member, with the power of appointing a new one, was won over by the Bolsheviks.

The lines between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks hardened in April 1905 when the Bolsheviks held a Bolsheviks-only meeting in London, which they called the Third Party Congress. The Mensheviks organised a rival conference and the split was thus formalised.

The Bolsheviks played a relatively minor role in the <a href="1905%20Russian%20Revolution">1905 Revolution</a>, and were a minority in the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Soviet">Saint Petersburg Soviet</a> of Workers' Deputies led by Trotsky. The less significant Moscow <a href="Soviet%20%28council%29">Soviet</a>, however, was dominated by the Bolsheviks. These soviets became the model for those formed in 1917.

As the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201905">Russian Revolution of 1905</a> progressed, Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and smaller non-Russian social democratic parties operating within the Russian Empire attempted to reunify at the <a href="4th%20Congress%20of%20the%20RSDLP">Fourth (Unification) Congress of the RSDLP</a> held at <a href="Folkets%20hus">Folkets hus</a>, <a href="Norra%20Bantorget">Norra Bantorget</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, April 1906. When the Mensheviks struck an alliance with the <a href="General%20Jewish%20Labour%20Bund%20in%20Lithuania%2C%20Poland%20and%20Russia">Jewish Bund</a>, the Bolsheviks found themselves in a minority.

However, all factions retained their respective factional structure and the Bolsheviks formed the <a href="Bolshevik%20Centre">Bolshevik Centre</a>, the de facto governing body of the Bolshevik faction within the RSDLP. At the Fifth Congress held in London in May 1907, the Bolsheviks were in the majority, but the two factions continued functioning mostly independently of each other.

Tensions had existed between Lenin and Bogdanov as early as 1904: Lenin had fallen out with <a href="Nikolai%20Valentinov">Nikolai Valentinov</a>, after the latter had introduced him to <a href="Ernst%20Mach">Ernst Mach</a>'s Empiriocriticism, a viewpoint that Bogdanov had been exploring and developing as Empiriomonism. Having worked as co-editor with Plekhanov on "Zayra" he had come to agree with the latter's rejection of Bogdanov's Empiriomonism. With the defeat of the revolution in mid-1907 and the adoption of a new, highly restrictive election law, the Bolsheviks began debating whether to boycott the new parliament known as the <a href="Third%20Duma">Third Duma</a>. Lenin, <a href="Grigory%20Zinoviev">Grigory Zinoviev</a>, <a href="Lev%20Kamenev">Lev Kamenev</a> and others argued for participating in the Duma while <a href="Alexander%20Bogdanov">Alexander Bogdanov</a>, <a href="Anatoly%20Lunacharsky">Anatoly Lunacharsky</a>, <a href="Mikhail%20Pokrovsky">Mikhail Pokrovsky</a> and others argued that the social democratic faction in the Duma should be recalled. The latter became known as <a href="recallists">recallists</a> ("otzovists" in Russian). A smaller group within the Bolshevik faction demanded that the RSDLP central committee should give its sometimes unruly Duma faction an ultimatum, demanding complete subordination to all party decisions. This group became known as "<a href="ultimatists">ultimatists</a>" and was generally allied with the recallists.

With most Bolshevik leaders either supporting Bogdanov or undecided by mid-1908 when the differences became irreconcilable, Lenin concentrated on undermining Bogdanov's reputation as a philosopher. In 1909, he published a scathing book of criticism entitled "<a href="Materialism%20and%20Empirio-criticism">Materialism and Empirio-criticism</a>" (1909), assaulting Bogdanov's position and accusing him of philosophical idealism. In June 1909, Bogdanov proposed the formation of Party Schools as "Proletarian Universities" at a Bolshevik mini-conference in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> organised by the editorial board of the Bolshevik magazine "<a href="Proletary">Proletary</a>" in June 1909. However, this was not accepted and Lenin tried to expel him from the Bolshevik faction. Bogdanov was then involved with setting up <a href="Vpered">Vpered</a>, which ran the Capri Party School from August to December 1909.

With both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks weakened by splits within their ranks and by <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>ist repression, they were tempted to try to re-unite the party. In January 1910, Leninists, recallists and various Menshevik factions held a meeting of the party's Central Committee in Paris. Kamenev and Zinoviev were dubious about the idea, but were willing to give it a try under pressure from "conciliator" Bolsheviks like <a href="Victor%20Nogin">Victor Nogin</a>.

One of the more underlying reasons that aided in preventing any reunification of the party was the Russian police. The police were able to infiltrate both parties' inner circles by sending in spies who then reported on the opposing party's intentions and hostilities. This allowed the tensions to remain high between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In turn it prevented them from uniting under common ground which could have possibly sped up the entire revolution.

Lenin was firmly opposed to any re-unification, but was outvoted within the Bolshevik leadership. The meeting reached a tentative agreement and one of its provisions made Trotsky's <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>-based "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>" a party-financed 'central organ'. Kamenev, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910 when Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations.

The factions permanently broke off relations in January 1912 after the Bolsheviks organised a Bolsheviks-only <a href="Prague%20Party%20Conference">Prague Party Conference</a> and formally expelled Mensheviks and recallists from the party. As a result, they ceased to be a faction in the RSDLP and instead declared themselves an independent party, called Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks) – or RSDLP(b). Unofficially the Party has been referred to as the "Bolshevik Party". Throughout the century, the Party adopted a number of different names. In 1918, RSDLP(b) became (All-)Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) and remained so until 1925. From 1925–52 the name was All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), and from 1952–1991 <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>.

As the party split became permanent and politically recognized in 1912 due to an all Bolshevik meeting of Congress further divisions became evident. One of the most notable differences was how each faction decided to fund its revolution. The Mensheviks decided to fund their revolution through membership dues while Lenin often resorted to much more drastic measures since he required a higher budget. One of the common methods the Bolsheviks used was committing bank robberies, one of which in 1907 resulted in the party gaining over 250,000 rubles which is the equivalent of about $125,000. Bolsheviks were in constant need of money because Lenin practiced his beliefs exercised in his writings that revolutions must be led by individuals who devote their entire life to the cause. To compensate he awarded them with salaries for their sacrifice and dedication. This measure was taken to help ensure that the revolutionists stayed focused on their duties and motivated them to perform their jobs. Lenin also used the party money to print and copy pamphlets which were distributed in cities and at political rallies in attempts to expand their operations. This was an obvious difference between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks party beliefs. Both factions also managed to gain funds simply by receiving donations from wealthy supporters.

Further differences in party agendas became evident as the beginning of World War I loomed near. Stalin was especially eager for the start of the war, hoping that it would turn into a war between classes or essentially a Russian Civil War. This desire for war was fueled by Lenin's vision that the workers and peasants would resist joining the war effort, and therefore be more compelled to join the socialist movement. Through the increase in support Russia would then be forced to withdraw from the Allied Powers in order to resolve her internal conflict. Unfortunately for the Bolsheviks, Lenin's assumptions were incorrect and despite his and the party's attempts to push for a civil war through involvement in two conferences in 1915 and 1916 in Switzerland the party remained in the minority in calling for the ceasefire by the Russian Army in World War I.
Although the Bolshevik leadership decided to form a separate party, convincing pro-Bolshevik workers within Russia to follow suit proved difficult. When the first meeting of the Fourth Duma was convened in late 1912, only one out of six Bolshevik deputies, <a href="Matvei%20Muranov">Matvei Muranov</a>, (another one, Roman Malinovsky, was later exposed as an <a href="Okhrana">Okhrana</a> [Tsarist secret police] agent) voted to break away from the <a href="Menshevik">Menshevik</a> faction within the Duma on 15 December 1912. The Bolshevik leadership eventually prevailed and the Bolsheviks formed their own Duma faction in September 1913.

One final difference between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks was simply how ferocious and tenacious the party was willing to be in order to achieve its goals. Lenin was open minded to retreating on political ideas if he saw the guarantee of long term gains benefiting the party. This practice was commonly seen trying to recruit peasants and uneducated workers by promising them how glorious life would be after the revolution. His approach was "land seizure for the peasants and national self-determination for the minorities – as nothing more than temporary concessions."

In 1918, at Lenin's suggestion, the party renamed itself the "Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)". In 1925, this was changed to "All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)". In 1952, at the <a href="19th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">19th Party Congress</a>, according to <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>'s suggestion, the Bolshevik party was renamed the "Communist Party of Soviet Union".

"Bolo" was a derogatory expression for Bolsheviks used by <a href="British%20Empire">British</a> service personnel in the <a href="North%20Russian%20Expeditionary%20Force">North Russian Expeditionary Force</a> which intervened against the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> during the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, Joseph Goebbels, and other Nazi leaders used it in reference to the worldwide political movement coordinated by the <a href="Comintern">Comintern</a>. During the days of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, labour union leaders and other leftists were sometimes derisively described as "Bolshies". The usage is roughly equivalent to the term "<a href="Commie">Commie</a>", "<a href="Communist">Red</a>", or "<a href="pinko">pinko</a>" in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> during the same period. The term "Bolshie" later became a slang term for anyone who was rebellious, aggressive, or truculent.

Battle of Świecino

The Battle of Świecino (named for the village of <a href="%C5%9Awiecino">Świecino</a>, near Żarnowiec Lake, northern Poland) also called the Battle of <a href="%C5%BBarnowiec">Żarnowiec</a> or in German Battle of Schwetz, took place on September 17, 1462 during the <a href="Thirteen%20Years%27%20War%20%281454%E2%80%9366%29">Thirteen Years' War</a>. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281385%E2%80%931569%29">Poles</a> commanded by <a href="Piotr%20Dunin">Piotr Dunin</a>, consisting of some 2000 mercenares and Poles, decisively defeated the 2700 man army of the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a> commanded by <a href="Fritz%20Raweneck">Fritz Raweneck</a> and <a href="Kaspar%20Nostyc">Kaspar Nostyc</a>. Auxiliary forces sent by duke <a href="Eric%20II%20of%20Pomerania">Eric II of Pomerania</a>, an ally of the Polish king, did not enter the battle.

The Polish forces consisted mostly of the mercenaries hired by the Polish king, <a href="Casimir%20IV%20of%20Poland">Casimir IV the Jagiellon</a> and the city of Danzig (<a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a>). This army included 1000 cavalry, of which 112 were heavy cavalry, and another 1000 of infantry. 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry were mercenaries hired by Polish king, while the rest were units from Danzig (<a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a>).

Most of the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic army</a>, under the command of Fritz Raweneck and Kaspar Nostyc, were troops gathered from the nearby castles Mewe (<a href="Gniew">Gniew</a>), Stargard (<a href="Starogard%20Gda%C5%84ski">Starogard Gdański</a>), <a href="Nowe">Nowe</a>, <a href="Skarszewy">Skarszewy</a> and <a href="Kiszewy">Kiszewy</a>. This army totalled 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry. Raweneck also had the supply chain (<a href="tabor%20%28formation%29">tabors</a>), cannons and up to 1300 auxiliary infantry of Pomeranian peasants, used mainly for fortification works.

The battle started in the evening. Adopting a relatively new tactic, Polish units built a fortified camp on the Hussite model consisting of wagons linked by a chain surrounded by a deep ditch (<a href="Tabor%20%28formation%29">tabor</a>). The units of Raveneck and his subordinate, Kaspar Nostyc (commander from Conitz (<a href="Chojnice">Chojnice</a>) also created a tabor. Piotr Dunin decided not to wait for the enemy and attacked first, setting infantry with crossbows on the left, defended by cavalry between the tabor and the coast of the nearby lake of Rogoźnica. Raveneck placed cavalry in front of his tabor, and infantry behind it, without any strategic plan. The first phase of the battle was started by a charge of Polish heavy cavalry under <a href="Pawe%C5%82%20Jasie%C5%84ski">Paweł Jasieński</a>. Fierce fighting continued for three hours and ended without a clear winner. After a short pause at midday, Teutonic units were able to push the Poles back; however, they found themselves under very heavy fire from crossbows of the Polish infantry, which caused huge losses and a withdrawal. During this fight Raveneck was wounded. He stopped his soldiers and tried to attack again, but this charge ended with a total defeat - Raveneck died and the rest of the cavalry surrendered or escaped. The Teutonic infantry tried to defend themselves at the tabor but its resistance was broken by a quick attack of Polish cavalry.

The Teutonic Order's army lost around 1000 soldiers, including some 300 cavalrymen. Fifty soldiers were captured. The Teutonic commander was also killed in battle and was buried in the Żarnowiec chapter church.

The Poles lost just 100 soldiers, although 150 later died from their wounds. Among the dead on the Polish side was <a href="Maciej%20Hagen">Maciej Hagen</a> from Gdańsk. Piotr Dunin was wounded twice.

The direct result of the battle of Świecino was that the city of Danzig and Pomerania were freed from the danger of an attack by the Teutonic Order. As a result, the royal and municipal armed forces could be used elsewhere in the war, mainly to protect the Vistula waterway and to capture the Teutonic held strongholds. This way that Teutonic forces in Prussia on the right bank of Vistula were cut off from supplies from Western Europe.

The psychological significance of the battle was that this was the first open field battle won by the royal forces, so it increased the morale of the Polish forces and lowered the morale of the Teutonic Knights. Many military historians say that the battle of Świecino was the turning point of the <a href="Thirteen%20Years%27%20War%20%281454%E2%80%9366%29">Thirteen Years' War</a>, leading to the final Polish victory in 1466.

Barney Bubbles

Barney Bubbles (born Colin Fulcher; 30 July 1942 – 14 November 1983) was an English <a href="graphic%20artist">graphic artist</a> whose work encompassed <a href="graphic%20design">graphic design</a> and music video direction. Bubbles, who also sketched and painted privately, is best known for his distinctive contribution to the design practices associated with the British independent music scene of the 1970s and 1980s. His record sleeves, laden with symbols and riddles, were his most recognisable output.

Fulcher was born in Tranmere Road, <a href="Whitton%2C%20London">Whitton</a>, <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a> (now Greater London), in July 1942. He attended <a href="Isleworth%20and%20Syon%20School">Isleworth Grammar School</a>. In 1958 he embarked on a retail display course for a National Diploma in Design (NDD) at the art school of <a href="Richmond%20upon%20Thames%20College">Twickenham College of Technology</a>. During his five years at the college Fulcher received a multi-disciplinary education that included training in cardboard design, display and packaging, skills that would be utilised later in his record sleeve work.

After leaving college in 1963 Fulcher worked as an assistant at the design company Michael Tucker + Associates in London. Its clients included <a href="Pirelli">Pirelli</a>. In a rare interview in November 1981 in "<a href="The%20Face%20%28magazine%29">The Face</a>", Bubbles described Tucker's discipline as "very Swiss; very hard; unjustified; very grey. He taught me everything about typography." Tucker's studio produced the posters for <a href="Hugh%20Hudson">Hugh Hudson</a>'s Pirelli-sponsored film "The Tortoise & The Hare" (1967), for which Fulcher designed the poster lettering on a freelance basis.

In May 1965, Fulcher was recruited by The Conran Group as senior graphic designer alongside <a href="Stafford%20Cliff">Stafford Cliff</a>, <a href="Virginia%20Clive-Smith">Virginia Clive-Smith</a> and <a href="John%20Muggeridge">John Muggeridge</a>. He produced a variety of commercial commissions for Conran, including the Norman-style archer logo for <a href="Strongbow%20cider">Strongbow cider</a> and items for Conran's new homewares chain <a href="Habitat%20%28retailer%29">Habitat</a>. Fulcher also established an association with <a href="Justin%20de%20Blank">Justin de Blank</a>, a director at Conran, which blossomed when de Blank left to launch his own upmarket provisions company and restaurant business in 1968.

Between 1965 and 1966 Fulcher organised happenings, parties and other events under the name "A1 Good Guyz" with two graduates of Twickenham Art College, David Wills and Roy Burge.

In 1967 Fulcher became known as Barney Bubbles, though he did not change his name by <a href="deed%20poll">deed poll</a> for several more years. The name came about when Fulcher was operating a light show that created a bubble effect by mixing oils and water on projection slides. These lightshows were for groups including <a href="The%20Gun%20%28band%29">the Gun</a> and <a href="Quintessence%20%28English%20band%29">Quintessence</a> at underground venues including <a href="the%20Roundhouse">the Roundhouse</a>, <a href="Jim%20Haynes">Jim Haynes</a>'s Drury Lane <a href="Arts%20Lab">Arts Lab</a>, the <a href="Electric%20Cinema%2C%20Notting%20Hill">Electric Cinema</a> and <a href="Middle%20Earth">Middle Earth</a>.

With Wills, Bubbles undertook freelance design commissions, including a redesign of "Motor Racing" magazine and a recipe book for the English Egg Marketing Board. With a team of contributors Bubbles and Wills art-directed <a href="Oz%20%28magazine%29">"Oz"</a> magazine issue 12, dubbed "The Tax Dodge Special" and published in May 1968.

Early in 1969, Bubbles took the lease on a three-storey building at 307 <a href="Portobello%20Road">Portobello Road</a> in Notting Hill Gate, West London. He converted the ground-floor space into a graphic art studio, which he named Teenburger Designs. With a business association established with two entrepreneurs, Edward Molton and Stephen Warwick, and with <a href="John%20Muggeridge">John Muggeridge</a> from Conran serving briefly as an assistant, he set about working primarily for the music industry. His first record sleeve design was for <a href="Quintessence%20%28English%20band%29">Quintessence</a>'s LP "<a href="In%20Blissful%20Company">In Blissful Company</a>" (1969). The gatefold sleeve design uses illustrations by Gopala on the front and back, and contains a monochrome glued-in booklet inside.

Teenburger also provided record sleeve designs for the bands <a href="Brinsley%20Schwarz">Brinsley Schwarz</a> and <a href="Red%20Dirt%20%28band%29">Red Dirt</a>, as well as <a href="Vertigo%20Records">Vertigo</a> artists such as <a href="Cressida%20%28progressive%20rock%20band%29">Cressida</a>, <a href="Gracious%21">Gracious!</a> and Dr Z, whose LP "Three Parts To My Soul" is particularly noted for its complex and colourful fold-out sleeve.

Following the closure of Teenburger in 1970 as a result of the disappearance of Molton and Warwick, Bubbles worked as the designer of the underground newspaper <a href="Friends%20%28magazine%29">"Friends"</a> (later renamed "Frendz").

While he was working at Friends, Bubbles formed an association with <a href="Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a> and became responsible for a run of their album sleeves, including "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Space">In Search of Space</a>", "<a href="Doremi%20Fasol%20Latido">Doremi Fasol Latido</a>" and "<a href="Space%20Ritual">Space Ritual</a>". Bubbles engaged in many aspects of the group's visual identity, titling releases and designing posters, adverts, stage decoration and performance plans, some of which were adorned with mystical and mock-Teutonic insignia. In 1972 Bubbles produced the triple LP package "<a href="Glastonbury%20Fayre">Glastonbury Fayre</a>". This comprised a six-panel fold-out card sleeve, two poster inserts, a booklet and a cut-out and build miniature pyramid, housed in a clear vinyl bag (with two sleeve variations and three label variations).

From 1973 onwards, Bubbles increasingly avoided credits for his artwork, typically working anonymously or occasionally adopting alternative pseudonyms. During this period he designed album sleeves and additional material for such acts as the <a href="Sutherland%20Brothers">Sutherland Brothers</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Coyne">Kevin Coyne</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Broughton%20Band">Edgar Broughton Band</a>, <a href="Chilli%20Willi%20and%20the%20Red%20Hot%20Peppers">Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers</a>, <a href="Quiver%20%28Rock%20band%29">Quiver</a>, the <a href="Kursaal%20Flyers">Kursaal Flyers</a> and <a href="Michael%20Moorcock">Michael Moorcock and the Deep Fix</a>.

In 1976 his design relationship with Hawkwind came to an end. It was rekindled once, in 1978, for the <a href="Hawklords">Hawklords</a> spin-off, but otherwise continued only with design commissions for projects involving the band's saxophonist <a href="Nik%20Turner">Nik Turner</a>.

Barney Bubbles joined <a href="Stiff%20Records">Stiff Records</a> as designer and art director early in 1977. With the label's co-founder <a href="Jake%20Riviera">Jake Riviera</a> he generated a body of creative work that helped to secure Stiff's reputation as an exciting new independent label. Bubbles created sleeves for bands including <a href="The%20Damned%20%28band%29">the Damned</a>, <a href="Elvis%20Costello">Elvis Costello</a>, <a href="Ian%20Dury">Ian Dury</a> and <a href="Wreckless%20Eric">Wreckless Eric</a>. Often these were accompanied by quirky logos such as the face logo for <a href="Ian%20Dury%23The%20Blockheads">Blockhead</a>, advertisements and promotional items. The marketing of Elvis Costello's "<a href="My%20Aim%20Is%20True">My Aim Is True</a>" included advertisements in three UK music papers from which a poster of Costello could be constructed, and the first 1,000 pressings contained an insert headed "Help Us Hype Elvis", which, if completed and returned to Stiff, ensured that a friend would receive a free copy.

When Riviera left Stiff in late 1977, Bubbles joined him at his new label <a href="Radar%20Records">Radar Records</a> and later at Riviera's <a href="F-Beat%20Records">F-Beat Records</a>. At these labels, Bubbles created more designs for Elvis Costello, as well as other artists such as <a href="Nick%20Lowe">Nick Lowe</a>, <a href="Carlene%20Carter">Carlene Carter</a> and <a href="Clive%20Langer">Clive Langer</a> & The Boxes.

Bubbles also maintained his freelance output, producing designs for <a href="Peter%20Jenner">Peter Jenner</a> (Ian Dury and <a href="Billy%20Bragg">Billy Bragg</a>'s manager), and others. He created a prodigious output by working for such bands, musicians and performers as <a href="Vivian%20Stanshall">Vivian Stanshall</a>, <a href="Generation%20X%20%28band%29">Generation X</a>, <a href="Big%20Star">Big Star</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Moped">Johnny Moped</a>, <a href="Whirlwind">Whirlwind</a>, Billy Bragg, <a href="Clover%20%28band%29">Clover</a>, <a href="the%20Sinceros">the Sinceros</a>, <a href="Roger%20Chapman">Roger Chapman</a>, <a href="Phillip%20Goodhand-Tait">Phillip Goodhand-Tait</a>, <a href="Dr.%20Feelgood%20%28band%29">Dr. Feelgood</a>, <a href="Inner%20City%20Unit">Inner City Unit</a> and <a href="the%20Psychedelic%20Furs">the Psychedelic Furs</a>. As a result, his work appeared on releases by labels such as Aura, <a href="Chiswick">Chiswick</a>, <a href="Utility">Utility</a>, <a href="Go%21%20Discs">Go! Discs</a>, <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic</a>, <a href="Charisma">Charisma</a>, <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, <a href="Line%20Records">Line Records</a>, <a href="United%20Artists%20Records">United Artists</a> and <a href="Riddle%20Records">Riddle Records</a>. His signature style emerged as one that was colourful, playful, loaded with geometry, art-history and music-history references, jokes, cryptograms and symbols. The overriding appetite was for going against the grain of accepted design standards. His work is simultaneously complex in meaning and simple in its delivery. Examples include:

Barney Bubbles directed several videos, including <a href="the%20Specials">the Specials</a>' "<a href="Ghost%20Town%20%28The%20Specials%20song%29">Ghost Town</a>", <a href="Squeeze%20%28band%29">Squeeze</a>'s "<a href="Is%20That%20Love">Is That Love</a>" and "<a href="Tempted%20%28Squeeze%20song%29">Tempted</a>", <a href="Elvis%20Costello">Elvis Costello</a>'s "<a href="Clubland%20%28song%29">Clubland</a>" and "<a href="New%20Lace%20Sleeves">New Lace Sleeves</a>", and <a href="Fun%20Boy%20Three">Fun Boy Three</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lunatics%20%28Have%20Taken%20Over%20the%20Asylum%29">The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum)</a>". Two promos for the punk act <a href="Johnny%20Moped">Johnny Moped</a>, "Incendiary Device" and "Darling Let's Have Another Baby", were never commercially released to broadcasters.

“A good video can sell a record which might not do so well," Bubbles told "<a href="Smash%20Hits">Smash Hits</a>" magazine in 1982. "The record companies know that. I think Chrysalis would agree that The Specials’ 'Ghost Town' video helped sales a good deal. This year I intend to make videos which are really inexpensive but really inventive. It can be done, you know."

In 1979, riding on the reputation of his work for Stiff, Bubbles was engaged by the venerable UK music newspaper "<a href="New%20Musical%20Express">New Musical Express</a>" to spearhead a complete overhaul of its decades-old brand. Bubbles' redesign incorporated elements of <a href="Pop%20art">Pop art</a> and 1920's Soviet poster art into a "sleek, forward-looking" graphic format. His restyling included a fresh <a href="logo">logo</a> with "clean, stencilled, military-style lettering", which heralded the title's change from "New Musical Express" to "NME".

In 1979 <a href="Derek%20Boshier">Derek Boshier</a> curated an exhibition entitled Lives at the <a href="Hayward%20Gallery">Hayward Gallery</a>, London, and he commissioned Bubbles to design the catalogue and poster. Together with the photographer <a href="Chris%20Gabrin">Chris Gabrin</a>, Bubbles also exhibited a video and mixed-media installation in the exhibition.

In the early 1980s Bubbles created furniture designs, some of which were featured in "<a href="The%20Face%20%28magazine%29">The Face</a>", November 1981.

In 1982 Bubbles conceived the album "Ersatz", working primarily with <a href="Nik%20Turner">Nik Turner</a> and other musicians from <a href="Inner%20City%20Unit">Inner City Unit</a>. The LP was released under the name of The Imperial Pompadours.

Bubbles painted privately, increasingly in the early 1980s.

Barney Bubbles committed <a href="suicide">suicide</a> in London on 14 November 1983 by gassing himself, trapping the fumes in a plastic bag he placed over his head. He had considerable personal and financial worries. His sleeves were being rejected by musicians, such as Elvis Costello, and by record companies, and he was being chased by the <a href="Inland%20Revenue">Inland Revenue</a> for unpaid taxes dating back many years. He displayed impulsive and erratic behaviour: for example, close friends recall him lacerating his face with razorblades and making threats to kill. He committed suicide on his late parents' wedding anniversary.

Barney Bubbles is recognized as a "founding father" of <a href="Album%20cover">album cover art</a>, who created "hundreds of record sleeves that have sold in their millions across the world". The first exhibition dedicated to Bubbles' work was held at London gallery Artomatic in 2001, and was curated by the art-design team Rebecca And Mike.

A biography, "Reasons to be Cheerful: The Life & Work Of Barney Bubbles" by <a href="Paul%20Gorman">Paul Gorman</a>, was published in 2008. The book was welcomed as a long-overdue recognition of Bubbles' achievements and selected by British music magazine "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" as its "pageRank.Book of the Year".

A revised second edition of "Reasons To Be Cheerful" was published in October 2010 to coincide with Gorman's curation of the exhibition "Process: The Working Practices of Barney Bubbles" at London gallery Chelsea Space.

In January 2012, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a documentary, "In Search Of Barney Bubbles", written and produced by Mark Hodkinson.

In summer 2012 Gorman curated "The Past The Present & The Possible", which presented 250 examples of Bubbles' finished artworks as part of the exhibition White Noise at the 23rd International Poster & Graphic Design Festival in Chaumont, France.

Under the heading "Génération Bubbles!", the cover and a 10-page feature in the July 2012 issue of French design magazine "<a href="%C3%89tapes">Étapes</a>" were dedicated to the exhibition and Bubbles' influence over contemporary design practice.

The work of Barney Bubbles has been featured in general and group exhibitions, including "Destroy: Punk Graphic Design in Britain", held at London's <a href="Southbank%20Centre">Southbank Centre</a> in 1998 and "Communicate: British Independent Graphic Design since the Sixties", staged at the <a href="Barbican%20Centre">Barbican Centre</a> in 2004.

The <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> included Bubbles' works in the 2011 show "Postmodernism: Style & Subversion 1970–1990", and the following year's "British Design 1948–2012".

Basic English

Basic English is an <a href="English%20language">English</a>-based <a href="Controlled%20natural%20language">controlled language</a> created by linguist and philosopher <a href="Charles%20Kay%20Ogden">Charles Kay Ogden</a> as an <a href="international%20auxiliary%20language">international auxiliary language</a>, and as an aid for teaching <a href="ESL">English as a second language</a>. Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English. It was presented in Ogden's book "Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar" (1930).

Ogden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest publicity just after the Allied victory in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> as a means for world peace. Although Basic English was not built into a program, similar simplifications have been devised for various international uses. Ogden's associate <a href="I.%20A.%20Richards">I. A. Richards</a> promoted its use in schools in China. More recently, it has influenced the creation of <a href="Voice%20of%20America">Voice of America</a>'s <a href="Special%20English">Special English</a> for news broadcasting, and <a href="Simplified%20Technical%20English">Simplified Technical English</a>, another English-based controlled language designed to write technical manuals.

What survives today of Ogden's Basic English is the basic 850-word list used as the beginner's vocabulary of the English language taught worldwide, especially in <a href="Asia">Asia</a>.

Ogden tried to simplify English while keeping it normal for native speakers, by specifying grammar restrictions and a <a href="controlled%20natural%20language">controlled small vocabulary</a> which makes an extensive use of <a href="Paraphrase">paraphrasing</a>. Most notably, Ogden allowed only 18 verbs, which he called "operators". His "General Introduction" says "There are no 'verbs' in Basic English", with the underlying assumption that, as noun use in English is very straightforward but verb use/conjugation is not, the elimination of verbs would be a welcome simplification.

Ogden's word lists include only word roots, which in practice are extended with the defined set of affixes and the full set of forms allowed for any available word (noun, pronoun, or the limited set of verbs). The 850 core words of Basic English are found in Wiktionary's <a href="wikt%3AAppendix%3ABasic%20English%20word%20list">Basic English word list</a>. This core is theoretically enough for everyday life. However, Ogden prescribed that any student should learn an additional 150-word list for everyday work in some particular field, by adding a list of 100 words particularly useful in a general field (e.g., science, verse, business, etc.), along with a 50-word list from a more specialised subset of that general field, to make a <a href="wikt%3AAppendix%3A1000%20basic%20English%20words">basic 1000-word</a> vocabulary for everyday work and life.

Moreover, Ogden assumed that any student already should be familiar with (and thus may only review) a core subset of around 200 "international" words. Therefore, a first-level student should graduate with a core vocabulary of around 1200 words. A realistic general core vocabulary could contain 2000 words (the core 850 words, plus 200 international words, and 1000 words for the general fields of trade, economics, and science). It is enough for a "standard" English level. This 2000 word vocabulary represents "what any learner should know". At this level students could start to move on their own.

Ogden's and Voice of America's serve as dictionaries for the <a href="Simple%20English%20Wikipedia">Simple English Wikipedia</a>.

The <a href="grammar">word use</a> of Basic English is similar to full English, but the rules are much simpler, and there are fewer <a href="wikt%3Aexception">exceptions</a>. Not all meanings of each word are allowed.

Ogden's rules of <a href="grammar">grammar</a> for Basic English help people use the 850 words to talk about things and events in a normal way.


Like all <a href="international%20auxiliary%20language">international auxiliary language</a>s (or IALs), Basic English may be criticised as inevitably based on personal preferences, and thus, paradoxically, inherently divisive. Moreover, like all natural language based IALs, Basic is subject to criticism as unfairly biased towards the native speaker community.

As a teaching aid for <a href="ESL">English as a Second Language</a>, Basic English has been criticised for the choice of the core vocabulary and for its grammatical constraints.

In 1944, <a href="readability">readability</a> expert <a href="Rudolf%20Flesch">Rudolf Flesch</a> published an article in "<a href="Harper%27s%20Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a>", "How Basic is Basic English?" in which he claimed, "It's not basic, and it's not English." The essence of his complaint is that the vocabulary is too restricted, and, as a result, the text ends up being awkward and more difficult than necessary. He also argues that the words in the Basic vocabulary were arbitrarily selected, and notes that there had been no empirical studies showing that it made language simpler.

In the novel "<a href="The%20Shape%20of%20Things%20to%20Come">The Shape of Things to Come</a>", published in 1933, <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> depicted Basic English as the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of a new elite that after a prolonged struggle succeeds in uniting the world and establishing a <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> <a href="world%20government">world government</a>. In the future world of Wells' vision, virtually all members of humanity know this language.

From 1942 to 1944 <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a> was a proponent of Basic English, but in 1945 he became critical of <a href="universal%20language">universal language</a>s. Basic English later inspired his use of <a href="Newspeak">Newspeak</a> in "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>".

<a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> criticized his own 1945 novel "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited">Brideshead Revisited</a>", which he had previously called his magnum opus, in the preface of the 1959 reprint: "It <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a><nowiki>]</nowiki> was a bleak period of present privation and threatening disaster—the period of <a href="soya%20beans">soya beans</a> and Basic English—and in consequence the book is infused with a kind of gluttony, for food and wine, for the splendours of the recent past, and for rhetorical and ornamental language that now, with a full stomach, I find distasteful."

In his story "<a href="Gulf%20%28novella%29">Gulf</a>", science fiction writer <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> used a <a href="constructed%20language">constructed language</a> called <a href="Speedtalk">Speedtalk</a>, in which every Basic English word is replaced with a single <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>, as an appropriate means of communication for a race of genius supermen.

Brass instrument

A brass instrument is a <a href="musical%20instrument">musical instrument</a> that produces sound by <a href="Sympathetic%20resonance">sympathetic vibration</a> of air in a tubular <a href="resonator">resonator</a> in sympathy with the vibration of the player's lips. Brass instruments are also called "labrosones", literally meaning "lip-vibrated instruments".

There are several factors involved in producing different <a href="Pitch%20of%20brass%20instruments">pitches on a brass instrument</a>. <a href="Slide%20%28wind%20instrument%29">Slides</a>, <a href="valve">valve</a>s, <a href="Crook%20%28music%29">crooks</a> (though they are rarely used today), or <a href="Key%20%28instrument%29">keys</a> are used to change vibratory length of tubing, thus changing the available <a href="harmonic%20series%20%28music%29">harmonic series</a>, while the player's <a href="embouchure">embouchure</a>, lip tension and air flow serve to select the specific harmonic produced from the available series.

The view of most scholars (see <a href="organology">organology</a>) is that the term "brass instrument" should be defined by the way the sound is made, as above, and not by whether the instrument is actually made of <a href="brass">brass</a>. Thus one finds brass instruments made of wood, like the <a href="alphorn">alphorn</a>, the <a href="cornett">cornett</a>, the <a href="Serpent%20%28instrument%29">serpent</a> and the <a href="didgeridoo">didgeridoo</a>, while some <a href="woodwind%20instrument">woodwind instrument</a>s are made of brass, like the <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a>.

Modern brass instruments generally come in one of two families:

There are two other families that have, in general, become functionally obsolete for practical purposes. Instruments of both types, however, are sometimes used for <a href="historically%20informed%20performance">period-instrument performances</a> of Baroque or Classical pieces. In more modern compositions, they are occasionally used for their intonation or tone color.

Brass instruments may also be characterised by two generalizations about geometry of the <a href="bore%20%28wind%20instruments%29">bore</a>, that is, the tubing between the mouthpiece and the flaring of the tubing into the <a href="Bell%20%28wind%29%23Parts">bell</a>. Those two generalizations are with regard to

While all modern valved and slide brass instruments consist in part of conical and in part of cylindrical tubing, they are divided as follows:

The second division, based on bore diameter in relation to length, determines whether the <a href="fundamental%20frequency">fundamental tone</a> or the first <a href="overtone">overtone</a> is the lowest <a href="Harmonic%20series%20%28music%29%23Partial">partial</a> practically available to the player:


For half tube instruments the 'fundamental', although half the frequency of the second harmonic, is in fact a pedal note rather than a true fundamental

The instruments in this list fall for various reasons outside the scope of much of the discussion above regarding families of brass instruments.

Valves are used to change the length of tubing of a brass instrument allowing the player to reach the notes of various harmonic series. Each valve pressed diverts the air stream through additional tubing, individually or in conjunction with other valves. This lengthens the vibrating air column thus lowering the fundamental tone and associated harmonic series produced by the instrument. Designs exist, although rare, in which this behaviour is reversed, i.e., pressing a valve removes a length of tubing rather than adding one. One modern example of such an ascending valve is the Yamaha YSL-350C trombone, in which the extra valve tubing is normally engaged to pitch the instrument in , and pressing the thumb lever removes a whole step to pitch the instrument in C. Valves require regular <a href="lubrication">lubrication</a>.

A core standard valve layout based on the action of three valves had become almost universal by (at latest) 1864 as witnessed by <a href="Arban%20method">Arban's Method</a> published in that year. The effect of a particular combination of valves may be seen in the table below. This table is correct for the core 3-valve layout on almost any modern valved brass instrument. The most common four-valve layout is a superset of the well-established 3-valve layout and is noted in the table, despite the exposition of four-valve and also five-valve systems (the latter used on the tuba) being incomplete in this article.

Since valves "lower" the pitch, a valve that makes a pitch too low (flat) creates an interval wider than desired, while a valve that plays sharp creates an interval narrower than desired. <a href="Intonation%20%28music%29">Intonation</a> deficiencies of brass instruments that are independent of the tuning or temperament system are inherent in the physics of the most popular valve design, which uses a small number of valves in combination to avoid redundant and heavy lengths of tubing (this is entirely separate from the slight deficiencies between <a href="Classical%20music">Western music's</a> dominant <a href="Equal%20temperament">equal (even) temperament system</a> and the <a href="Just%20intonation">just (not equal) temperament</a> of the harmonic series itself). Since each lengthening of the tubing has an inversely proportional effect on pitch (<a href="Pitch%20of%20brass%20instruments">Pitch of brass instruments</a>), while pitch perception is logarithmic, there is no way for a simple, uncompensated addition of length to be correct in every combination when compared with the pitches of the open tubing and the other valves.

For example, given a length of tubing equaling 100 units of length when open, one may obtain the following tuning discrepancies:

Playing notes using valves (notably 1st + 3rd and 1st + 2nd + 3rd) requires <a href="%23Valve%20tuning%20compensation">compensation</a> to adjust the tuning appropriately, either by the player's lip-and-breath control, via mechanical assistance of some sort, or, in the case of horns, by the position of the stopping hand in the bell. 'T' stands for trigger on a trombone.

Traditionally the valves lower the pitch of the instrument by adding extra lengths of tubing based on a <a href="just%20tuning">just tuning</a>:

Combining the valves and the harmonics of the instrument leads to the following ratios and comparisons to 12-tone equal tuning and to a common <a href="five-limit%20tuning">five-limit tuning</a> in C:
The additional tubing for each valve usually features a short tuning slide of its own for fine adjustment of the valve's tuning, except when it is too short to make this practicable. For the first and third valves this is often designed to be adjusted as the instrument is played, to account for the deficiencies in the valve system.
In most trumpets and cornets, the compensation must be provided by extending the third valve slide with the third or fourth finger, and the first valve slide with the left hand thumb (see <a href="%23Trigger%20or%20throw">Trigger or throw</a> below). This is used to lower the pitch of the 1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations. On the trumpet and cornet, these valve combinations correspond to low D, low C, low G, and low F, so chromatically, to stay in tune, one must use this method.

In instruments with a fourth valve, such as tubas, euphoniums, <a href="piccolo%20trumpet">piccolo trumpet</a>s, etc. that valve lowers the pitch by a perfect fourth; this is used to compensate for the sharpness of the valve combinations 1-3 and 1-2-3 (4 replaces 1-3, 2-4 replaces 1-2-3). All three normal valves may be used in addition to the fourth to increase the instrument's range downwards by a perfect fourth, although with increasingly severe <a href="Intonation%20%28music%29">intonation</a> problems.

When four-valved models without any kind of compensation play in the corresponding register, the sharpness becomes so severe that players must finger the note a half-step below the one they are trying to play. This eliminates the note a half-step above their open fundamental.

Manufacturers of low brass instruments may choose one or a combination of four basic approaches to compensate for the tuning difficulties, whose respective merits are subject to debate:

In the Compensation system, each of the first two (or three) valves has an additional set of tubing extending from the back of the valve. When the third (or fourth) valve is depressed in combination with another one, the air is routed through both the usual set of tubing plus the extra one, so that the pitch is lowered by an appropriate amount. This allows compensating instruments to play with accurate intonation in the octave below their open second partial, which is critical for tubas and euphoniums in much of their repertoire.

The compensating system was applied to horns to serve a different purpose. It was used to allow a double horn in F and B to ease playing difficulties in the high register. In contrast to the system in use in tubas and euphoniums, the default 'side' of the horn is the longer F horn, with secondary lengths of tubing coming into play when the first, second or third valves are pressed; pressing the thumb valve takes these secondary valve slides and the extra length of main tubing out of play to produce a shorter B horn. A later "full double" design has completely separate valve section tubing for the two sides, and is considered superior, although rather heavier in weight.

Initially, compensated instruments tended to sound stuffy and blow less freely due to the air being doubled back through the main valves. In early designs, this led to sharp bends in the tubing and other obstructions of the air-flow. Some manufacturers therefore preferred adding more ‘straight’ valves instead, which for example could be pitched a little lower than the 2nd and 1st valves and were intended to be used instead of these in the respective valve combinations. While no longer featured in euphoniums for decades, many professional tubas are still built like this, with five valves being common on CC- and BB-tubas and five or six valves on F-tubas.

Compensating double horns can also suffer from the stuffiness resulting from the air being passed through the valve section twice, but as this really only affects the longer F side, a compensating double can be very useful for a 1st or 3rd horn player, who uses the F side less.

Another approach was the addition of two sets of slides for different parts of the range. Some euphoniums and tubas were built like this, but today, this approach has become highly exotic for all instruments except horns, where it is the norm, usually in a double, sometimes even triple configuration.

Some valved brass instruments provide triggers or throws that manually lengthen (or, less commonly, shorten) the main tuning slide, a valve slide, or the main tubing. These mechanisms alter the pitch of notes that are naturally sharp in a specific register of the instrument, or shift the instrument to another playing range. Triggers and throws permit speedy adjustment while playing.

Trigger is used in two senses:

A throw is a simple metal grip for the player's finger or thumb, attached to a valve slide. The general term "throw" can describe a u-hook, a saddle (u-shaped grips), or a ring (ring-shape grip) in which a player's finger or thumb rests. A player extends a finger or thumb to lengthen a slide, and retracts the finger to return the slide to its original position.

Triggers or throws are sometimes found on the first valve slide. They are operated by the player's thumb and are used to adjust a large range of notes using the first valve, most notably the player's written top line F, the A above directly above that, and the B above that. Other notes that require the first valve slide, but are not as problematic without it include the first line E, the F above that, the A above that, and the third line B.

Triggers or throws are often found on the third valve slide. They are operated by the player's fourth finger, and are used to adjust the lower D and C. Trumpets typically use throws, whilst cornets may have a throw or trigger.

Trombone triggers are primarily but not exclusively installed on the F-trigger, bass, and contrabass trombones to alter the length of tubing, thus making certain ranges and pitches more accessible.

A euphonium occasionally has a trigger on valves other than 2 (especially 3), although many professional quality euphoniums, and indeed other brass band instruments, have a trigger for the main tuning slide.

The two major types of valve mechanisms are "<a href="rotary%20valve">rotary valve</a>s" and "<a href="piston%20valve">piston valve</a>s". The first piston valve instruments were developed just after the start of the 19th century. The "Stölzel valve" (invented by <a href="Heinrich%20St%C3%B6lzel">Heinrich Stölzel</a> in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the "Vienna valve" was an improved design. However many professional musicians preferred rotary valves for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured towards the end of the 19th century. Since the early decades of the 20th century, piston valves have been the most common on brass instruments except for the orchestral horn and the tuba. See also the article <a href="Brass%20Instrument%20Valves">Brass Instrument Valves</a>.

Because the player of a brass instrument has direct control of the prime vibrator (the lips), brass instruments exploit the player's ability to select the <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a> at which the instrument's column of air vibrates. By making the instrument about twice as long as the equivalent woodwind instrument and starting with the second harmonic, players can get a good range of notes simply by varying the tension of their lips (see <a href="embouchure">embouchure</a>).

Most brass instruments are fitted with a removable <a href="Mouthpiece%20%28brass%29">mouthpiece</a>. Different shapes, sizes and styles of mouthpiece may be used to suit different embouchures, or to more easily produce certain tonal characteristics. Trumpets, trombones, and tubas are characteristically fitted with a cupped mouthpiece, while horns are fitted with a conical mouthpiece.

One interesting difference between a <a href="woodwind%20instrument">woodwind instrument</a> and a brass instrument is that woodwind instruments are non-directional. This means that the sound produced propagates in all directions with approximately equal volume. Brass instruments, on the other hand, are highly directional, with most of the sound produced traveling straight outward from the bell. This difference makes it significantly more difficult to record a brass instrument accurately. It also plays a major role in some performance situations, such as in marching bands.

Traditionally the instruments are normally made of <a href="brass">brass</a>, <a href="Metal%20polishing">polish</a>ed and then <a href="lacquer">lacquer</a>ed to prevent <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>. Some higher quality and higher cost instruments use <a href="gold">gold</a> or <a href="silver">silver</a> plating to prevent corrosion. 

Alternatives to brass include other alloys containing significant amounts of <a href="copper">copper</a> or silver. These alloys are <a href="biostatic">biostatic</a> due to the <a href="oligodynamic%20effect">oligodynamic effect</a>, and thus suppress growth of <a href="mold">mold</a>s, <a href="fungi">fungi</a> or <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>. Brass instruments constructed from <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> or <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> have good sound quality but are rapidly colonized by microorganisms and become unpleasant to play.

Most higher quality instruments are designed to prevent or reduce <a href="galvanic%20corrosion">galvanic corrosion</a> between any steel in the valves and springs, and the brass of the tubing. This may take the form of desiccant design, to keep the valves dry, <a href="sacrificial%20zinc">sacrificial zinc</a>s, replaceable valve cores and springs, plastic insulating washers, or nonconductive or noble materials for the valve cores and springs. Some instruments use several such features.

The process of making the large open end (bell) of a brass instrument is called "metal beating". In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes <a href="sheet%20metal">sheet metal</a> into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a <a href="oxy-fuel%20welding%20and%20cutting">torch</a> and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A <a href="Lathe%20%28tool%29">lathe</a> is used to <a href="metal%20spinning">spin</a> the bell head and to form a bead at the edge of bell head.
