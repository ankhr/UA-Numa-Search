Bill Clinton

William Jefferson Clinton (born August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">42nd President of the United States</a> from 1993 to 2001. Prior to the presidency, he was the <a href="Governor%20of%20Arkansas">Governor of Arkansas</a> during two separate terms, from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992. Before that, he served as <a href="Arkansas%20attorney%20general">Arkansas attorney general</a>, from 1977 to 1979. A member of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>, Clinton was ideologically a <a href="New%20Democrats">New Democrat</a> and many of his policies reflected a <a href="Centrism">centrist</a> "<a href="Third%20Way">Third Way</a>" political philosophy.

Clinton was born and raised in <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> and is an alumnus of <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a>, where he was a member of <a href="Kappa%20Kappa%20Psi">Kappa Kappa Psi</a> and the <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa%20Society">Phi Beta Kappa Society</a>; he earned a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> to attend the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>. Clinton is married to <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, who served as <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Senators%20from%20New%20York">U.S. Senator from New York</a> from 2001 to 2009, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">United States Secretary of State</a> from 2009 to 2013, and was the Democratic nominee for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">2016</a>. Bill and Hillary each earned <a href="Juris%20Doctor">degrees</a> from <a href="Yale%20Law%20School">Yale Law School</a>, where they met and began dating. As <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Arkansas">Governor of Arkansas</a>, Clinton overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the <a href="National%20Governors%20Association">National Governors Association</a>.

Clinton was elected president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201992">1992</a>, defeating incumbent Republican opponent <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>. At age 46, he became the <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%20by%20age">third-youngest president</a> (behind <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> (42) and <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> (43)) and the first from the <a href="Baby%20Boomer">Baby Boomer</a> generation. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history and signed into law the <a href="North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>. After failing to pass <a href="Clinton%20health%20care%20plan%20of%201993">national health care reform</a>, the Democratic House was ousted when the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> <a href="Republican%20Revolution">won control</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> in 1994, for the first time in 40 years. Two years later, in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201996">1996</a>, Clinton became the first Democrat since <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> to be elected to a second term. Clinton passed <a href="Personal%20Responsibility%20and%20Work%20Opportunity%20Act">welfare reform</a> and the <a href="State%20Children%27s%20Health%20Insurance%20Program">State Children's Health Insurance Program</a>, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the <a href="Gramm-Leach-Bliley%20Act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> and the <a href="Commodity%20Futures%20Modernization%20Act%20of%202000">Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000</a>.

In 1998, Clinton was <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Bill%20Clinton">impeached</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> for committing <a href="perjury">perjury</a> while testifying before a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> and also for <a href="obstruction%20of%20justice">obstruction of justice</a> during a lawsuit that was filed against him. Both issues were related to a <a href="Lewinsky%20scandal">scandal</a> that involved White House (and later <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a>) employee <a href="Monica%20Lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a>. Clinton was acquitted by the <a href="U.S.%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office.

During the last three years of Clinton's presidency from 1998 to 2000, the <a href="Congressional%20Budget%20Office">Congressional Budget Office</a> reported a budget surplus. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnian</a> and <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo</a> wars, signed the <a href="Iraq%20Liberation%20Act">Iraq Liberation Act</a> in opposition to <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, and participated in the <a href="2000%20Camp%20David%20Summit">2000 Camp David Summit</a> to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.

Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office <a href="approval%20rating">approval rating</a> of any U.S. president since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Since then, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the <a href="Clinton%20Foundation">William J. Clinton Foundation</a> to address international causes, such as the prevention of AIDS and <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, "<a href="My%20Life%20%28Bill%20Clinton%20autobiography%29">My Life</a>". He has remained active in politics by campaigning for Democratic candidates, including his wife's campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination in <a href="Hillary%20Clinton%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">2008</a> and <a href="Hillary%20Clinton%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">2016</a>, and <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s presidential campaigns in <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">2008</a> and <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202012">2012</a>.

In 2009, Clinton was named the United Nations <a href="Special%20Envoy%20of%20the%20Secretary-General">Special Envoy</a> to <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> and after the <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a>, Clinton teamed with <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> to form the <a href="Clinton%20Bush%20Haiti%20Fund">Clinton Bush Haiti Fund</a>. Since leaving office, Clinton has received high ratings in <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">public opinion polls of U.S. presidents</a>.

On September 22, 2017, it was announced that Clinton's upcoming novel "The President is Missing", to be released in 2018 and written with author <a href="James%20Patterson">James Patterson</a>, will be turned into a television series to be aired on cable network <a href="Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29">Showtime</a>.

Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in <a href="Hope%2C%20Arkansas">Hope, Arkansas</a>. He was the son of <a href="William%20Jefferson%20Blythe%20Jr.">William Jefferson Blythe Jr.</a> (1918–1946), a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and <a href="Virginia%20Clinton%20Kelley">Virginia Dell Cassidy</a> (later Virginia Kelley: 1923–1994). His parents married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to a previous wife. Soon after Bill was born, Virginia traveled to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> to study nursing. She left her son in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store. At a time when the southern United States was <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">racially segregated</a>, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on <a href="credit%20%28finance%29">credit</a> to people of all races. In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married <a href="Roger%20Clinton%20Sr.">Roger Clinton Sr.</a>, who owned an <a href="Car%20dealership">automobile dealership</a> in <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a>, with his brother and <a href="Earl%20T.%20Ricks">Earl T. Ricks</a>. The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.

Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned fifteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather. Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, <a href="Roger%20Clinton%20Jr.">Roger Clinton Jr.</a>, to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.

In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and <a href="Hot%20Springs%20High%20School%20%28Arkansas%29">Hot Springs High School</a>, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician. Clinton was in the chorus and played the <a href="tenor%20saxophone">tenor saxophone</a>, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography "<a href="My%20Life%20%28Bill%20Clinton%20autobiography%29">My Life</a>":

Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient <a href="Roman%20Senator">Roman Senator</a> <a href="Catiline">Catiline</a> in a mock trial in his Latin class. After a vigorous defense that made use of his "budding rhetorical and political skills", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck that it "made him realize that someday he would study law".

Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life that contributed to his decision to become a public figure, both occurring in 1963. One was his visit as a <a href="Boys%20Nation">Boys Nation</a> senator to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> to meet President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. The other was watching <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>'s 1963 "<a href="I%20Have%20a%20Dream">I Have a Dream</a>" speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.

With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the <a href="School%20of%20Foreign%20Service">School of Foreign Service</a> at <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a> in Washington, D.C., receiving a <a href="List%20of%20tagged%20degrees">Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service</a> degree in 1968.

In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for <a href="class%20president">class president</a>. From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator <a href="J.%20William%20Fulbright">J. William Fulbright</a>. While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity <a href="Alpha%20Phi%20Omega">Alpha Phi Omega</a> and was elected to <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. Clinton was also a member of the <a href="DeMolay%20International">Order of DeMolay</a>, a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a>. He is a member of <a href="Kappa%20Kappa%20Psi">Kappa Kappa Psi</a> honorary band fraternity.

Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> to <a href="University%20College%2C%20Oxford">University College</a> in Oxford, England, where he initially read for a <a href="B.Phil.">B.Phil.</a> in <a href="Philosophy%2C%20Politics%2C%20and%20Economics">Philosophy, Politics, and Economics</a> but transferred to a <a href="B.Litt.">B.Litt.</a> in politics and, ultimately, a <a href="B.Phil.">B.Phil.</a> in politics. Clinton did not expect the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at <a href="Yale%20Law%20School">Yale Law School</a>, <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.

During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a <a href="Draft%20lottery%20%281969%29">draft</a> letter that mandated deployment to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Adler's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist <a href="Sara%20Maitland">Sara Maitland</a> said of Clinton, "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a>, which he played at Oxford.

While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being "a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace", having "a powerful collaborator in his wife," and for winning "general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget".

While at Oxford, Clinton also participated in <a href="Opposition%20to%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War protests</a> and organized an October 1969 <a href="Moratorium%20to%20End%20the%20War%20in%20Vietnam">Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam</a> event.

During <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England during 1968 and 1969. He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and was aware that he might lose his draft deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a> or <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a>, and he then made arrangements to join the <a href="Reserve%20Officers%27%20Training%20Corps">Reserve Officers' Training Corps</a> (ROTC) program at the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a>.

He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way "to maintain my political viability within the system". Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would have to be <a href="Draft%20lottery%20%281969%29">drafted</a> before him, making it unlikely that he would be drafted. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)

<a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a <a href="notarize">notarize</a>d statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:

During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Reserve">Navy Reserve</a>, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, <a href="James%20Carville">James Carville</a>, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.

After Oxford, Clinton attended <a href="Yale%20Law%20School">Yale Law School</a> and earned a <a href="Juris%20Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> (J.D.) degree in 1973. In 1971, he met fellow law student <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Rodham</a> in the <a href="Lillian%20Goldman%20Law%20Library">Yale Law Library</a>; she was a class year ahead of him. They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his plans to be a coordinator for the <a href="George%20McGovern%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201972">George McGovern campaign</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201972">1972 United States presidential election</a> in order to move in with her in California. They married on October 11, 1975, and their only child, <a href="Chelsea%20Clinton">Chelsea</a>, was born on February 27, 1980.

Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading <a href="George%20McGovern">George McGovern</a>'s effort there. He spent considerable time in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Dallas">mayor of Dallas</a> <a href="Ron%20Kirk">Ron Kirk</a>, future <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Texas">governor of Texas</a> <a href="Ann%20Richards">Ann Richards</a>, and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>.

After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a>. In 1974, he ran for the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican <a href="John%20Paul%20Hammerschmidt">John Paul Hammerschmidt</a>, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a>. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52 percent to 48 percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for <a href="Arkansas%20Attorney%20General">Arkansas Attorney General</a>. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, Clinton was elected.
Clinton was elected <a href="Governor%20of%20Arkansas">Governor of Arkansas</a> in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate <a href="Lynn%20Lowe">Lynn Lowe</a>, a farmer from <a href="Texarkana%2C%20Arkansas">Texarkana</a>. At age 32, he became the youngest governor in the country. Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the "Boy Governor". He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the <a href="Mariel%20boatlift">Mariel boatlift</a>) detained in <a href="Fort%20Chaffee">Fort Chaffee</a> in 1980. <a href="Monroe%20Schwarzlose">Monroe Schwarzlose</a> of <a href="Kingsland%2C%20Arkansas">Kingsland</a> in <a href="Cleveland%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Cleveland County</a>, polled 31 percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> challenger <a href="Frank%20D.%20White">Frank D. White</a> in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.

Clinton joined friend <a href="Bruce%20Lindsey">Bruce Lindsey</a>'s Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For <a href="senior%20citizen">senior citizen</a>s, he removed the <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a> from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the <a href="New%20Democrats">New Democrats</a>, a group of <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the <a href="Democratic%20Leadership%20Council">Democratic Leadership Council</a> (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201984">landslide victory in 1984</a>, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the <a href="Democratic%20response%20to%20the%20State%20of%20the%20Union%20address">Democratic response</a> to Reagan's <a href="1985%20State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address">1985 State of the Union Address</a> and served as chair of the <a href="National%20Governors%20Association">National Governors Association</a> from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.

In the early 1980s, Clinton identified reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the <a href="Legal%20Services%20Corporation">Legal Services Corporation</a>. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special <a href="Arkansas%20General%20Assembly">legislative session</a>—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), <a href="Jonesboro%2C%20Arkansas">Jonesboro</a> businessmen <a href="Woody%20Freeman">Woody Freeman</a> (1984), and <a href="Sheffield%20Nelson">Sheffield Nelson</a> of Little Rock (1990).
Also in the 1980s, The Clintons' personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the <a href="Whitewater%20controversy">Whitewater controversy</a> investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration. After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.

According to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions. During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by <a href="electric%20chair">electric chair</a> and three by <a href="lethal%20injection">lethal injection</a>. Later, as president, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.

In 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after then-<a href="Governor%20of%20New%20York">New York Governor</a> <a href="Mario%20Cuomo">Mario Cuomo</a> declined to run and Democratic front-runner <a href="Gary%20Hart">Gary Hart</a> withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed <a href="Governor%20of%20Massachusetts">Massachusetts Governor</a> <a href="Michael%20Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a>. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the <a href="1988%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1988 Democratic National Convention</a>, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice as long as it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate <a href="Democratic%20Leadership%20Council">Democratic Leadership Council</a> in 1990 and 1991.

During his presidency, <a href="Presidency%20of%20Bill%20Clinton%23Legislation%20and%20programs">Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs</a>, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the <a href="North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> and <a href="welfare%20reform">welfare reform</a>, have been attributed to a <a href="centrism">centrist</a> <a href="Third%20Way">Third Way</a> philosophy of governance. His policy of <a href="fiscal%20conservatism">fiscal conservatism</a> helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. The <a href="Congressional%20Budget%20Office">Congressional Budget Office</a> reported budget surpluses of $69 billion in 1998, $126 billion in 1999, and $236 billion in 2000, during the last three years of Clinton's presidency. Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000. Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000. At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to <a href="Chappaqua%2C%20New%20York">Chappaqua, New York</a> in order to satisy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York.

In the first primary contest, the <a href="Iowa%20caucuses">Iowa Caucus</a>, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator <a href="Tom%20Harkin">Tom Harkin</a>. During the campaign for the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20primary">New Hampshire primary</a>, reports of an extramarital affair with <a href="Gennifer%20Flowers">Gennifer Flowers</a> surfaced. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator <a href="Paul%20Tsongas">Paul Tsongas</a> in the New Hampshire polls. Following <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXVI">Super Bowl XXVI</a>, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20New%20Hampshire%2C%201992">New Hampshire primary</a>, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him "The Comeback Kid" for earning a firm second-place finish.

Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern primaries</a> on <a href="Super%20Tuesday">Super Tuesday</a> gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor <a href="Jerry%20Brown">Jerry Brown</a> was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South. With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate. Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in <a href="Jerry%20Brown">Jerry Brown</a>'s home state of California.
During the campaign, questions of <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> regarding state business and the politically powerful <a href="Rose%20Law%20Firm">Rose Law Firm</a>, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay. Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents "for the price of one".

Clinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that <a href="Ricky%20Ray%20Rector">Ricky Ray Rector</a> would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to Arkansas state and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" article as a possible political move to counter "soft on crime" accusations.

Bush's <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20approval%20rating">approval ratings</a> were around 80 percent during the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his , which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep. By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40 percent. Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When <a href="Pat%20Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a> and <a href="Pat%20Robertson">Pat Robertson</a> addressed Christian themes at the <a href="1992%20Republican%20National%20Convention">Republican National Convention</a>—with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated. Clinton then pointed to his moderate, "New Democrat" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious. Many Democrats who had supported <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton. Clinton and his running mate, <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a>, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a "new beginning".
Clinton won the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201992">1992 presidential election</a> (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> (168 electoral votes) and billionaire <a href="populism">populist</a> <a href="Ross%20Perot">Ross Perot</a> (0 electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>, the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the <a href="96th%20United%20States%20Congress">96th United States Congress</a> during the presidency of <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>.

Clinton was <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Bill%20Clinton">inaugurated</a> as the 42nd president of the United States on January 20, 1993. Shortly after taking office, he signed the <a href="Family%20and%20Medical%20Leave%20Act%20of%201993">Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993</a> on February 5, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support, and was popular with the public.

Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993—the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in "<a href="Roe%20v.%20Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>"—Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international <a href="family%20planning">family planning</a> programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush. Clinton said that abortion should be kept "safe, legal, and rare"—a slogan that had been suggested by <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Diego">University of California, San Diego</a> political scientist <a href="Samuel%20L.%20Popkin">Samuel L. Popkin</a> and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning. During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.

On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a <a href="budget%20deficit">budget deficit</a>. Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a <a href="joint%20session%20of%20Congress">joint session of Congress</a>, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.

On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office, causing the <a href="White%20House%20travel%20office%20controversy">White House travel office controversy</a> even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be <a href="At-will%20employment">dismissed without cause</a>. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.
In August, Clinton signed the <a href="Omnibus%20Budget%20Reconciliation%20Act%20of%201993">Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993</a>, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90 percent of small businesses, and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.

On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding <a href="Clinton%20health%20care%20plan">a health care reform plan</a>; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a>, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer <a href="John%20F.%20Harris">John F. Harris</a> stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by <a href="George%20J.%20Mitchell">George J. Mitchell</a> failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.

In November 1993, <a href="David%20Hale%20%28Whitewater%29">David Hale</a>—the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the <a href="Whitewater%20controversy">Whitewater controversy</a>—alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. A <a href="U.S.%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.

On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the <a href="Brady%20Handgun%20Violence%20Prevention%20Act">Brady Bill</a>, which mandated federal <a href="background%20check">background check</a>s on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the <a href="National%20Instant%20Criminal%20Background%20Check%20System">NICS system</a> was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the <a href="Earned%20Income%20Tax%20Credit">Earned Income Tax Credit</a>, a subsidy for low-income workers.

In December that year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers <a href="Larry%20Patterson">Larry Patterson</a> and Roger Perry were first reported by <a href="David%20Brock">David Brock</a> in "<a href="The%20American%20Spectator">The American Spectator</a>." In the affair later known as "<a href="Troopergate%20%28Bill%20Clinton%29">Troopergate</a>", the officers alleged that they arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named "Paula", a reference to <a href="Paula%20Jones">Paula Jones</a>. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated "bad journalism", and that "the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives".

That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as "<a href="Don%27t%20Ask%2C%20Don%27t%20Tell">Don't Ask, Don't Tell</a>", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexuality a secret, and forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation. The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a> (R-AZ) and <a href="Sam%20Nunn">Sam Nunn</a> (D-GA). According to <a href="David%20Mixner">David Mixner</a>, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that "the President should lift the ban ... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress". Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions. Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future. Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not "out of whack". The policy remained controversial, and was finally <a href="Don%27t%20Ask%2C%20Don%27t%20Tell%20Repeal%20Act%20of%202010">repealed in 2011</a>, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.

On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the <a href="North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> into law. Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of <a href="Ross%20Perot">Ross Perot</a>. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.

The <a href="Violent%20Crime%20Control%20and%20Law%20Enforcement%20Act">Omnibus Crime Bill</a>, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994, made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, "My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons." It also included a subsection of <a href="Federal%20Assault%20Weapons%20Ban">assault weapons ban</a> for a ten-year period.

The Clinton administration also launched the first official <a href="White%20House">White House</a> website, <a href="whitehouse.gov">whitehouse.gov</a>, on October 21, 1994. It was followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000. The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, "Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 – Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public."

After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201994">mid-term elections in 1994</a>, for the first time in forty years.

The <a href="White%20House%20FBI%20files%20controversy">White House FBI files controversy</a> of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to <a href="FBI">FBI</a> security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel <a href="Robert%20Ray%20%28prosecutor%29">Robert Ray</a> determined that there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, "there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved" in seeking the files.

On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the <a href="Defense%20of%20Marriage%20Act">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA), which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states. <a href="Paul%20Yandura">Paul Yandura</a>, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton's signing of DOMA "was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to "head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a "very reactionary Congress". Administration spokesman <a href="Richard%20Socarides">Richard Socarides</a> said, "the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected." Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something "which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that". Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist <a href="Evan%20Wolfson">Evan Wolfson</a> has called these claims "historic revisionism". In a July 2, 2011, editorial "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" opined, "The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments." Ultimately, in <a href="United%20States%20v.%20Windsor">United States v. Windsor</a>, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.

Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and is generally credited as the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his Presidency, Clinton controversially issued two substantial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. And Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector <a href="Employment%20Non-Discrimination%20Act">Employment Non-Discrimination Act</a>, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the <a href="Human%20Rights%20Campaign">Human Rights Campaign</a>. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by <a href="GLAAD">GLAAD</a> for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.

The <a href="1996%20United%20States%20campaign%20finance%20controversy">1996 United States campaign finance controversy</a> was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself. The Chinese government denied all accusations.

As part of a 1996 initiative to curb <a href="Illegal%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">illegal immigration</a>, Clinton signed the <a href="Illegal%20Immigration%20Reform%20and%20Immigrant%20Responsibility%20Act%20of%201996">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act</a> (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton, the <a href="History%20of%20laws%20concerning%20immigration%20and%20naturalization%20in%20the%20United%20States%231990s">U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform</a> recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.

<a href="Ken%20Gormley%20%28academic%29">Ken Gormley</a>, author of "The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr", reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the <a href="Asia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</a> (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED). According to officials, the IED was large enough to "blow up the entire presidential motorcade". Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by <a href="Lewis%20C.%20Merletti">Lewis C. Merletti</a>, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">Secret Service</a>. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge. This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila. Once more, the word "wedding" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt. Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high. Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag. Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base. The president was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> and the plot was masterminded by <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>. Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.

In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201996">1996 presidential election</a>, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2 percent of the popular vote over Republican <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a> (40.7 percent of the popular vote) and <a href="Reform%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Reform</a> candidate <a href="Ross%20Perot">Ross Perot</a> (8.4 percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> to be elected president more than once. The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the <a href="105th%20United%20States%20Congress">105th United States Congress</a>. Clinton received 379, or over 70 percent of the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.

In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a>—a Democrat—and <a href="Orrin%20Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a>—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the <a href="State%20Children%27s%20Health%20Insurance%20Program">State Children's Health Insurance Program</a> (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the <a href="Adoption%20and%20Safe%20Families%20Act">Adoption and Safe Families Act</a> and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the <a href="Foster%20Care%20Independence%20Act">Foster Care Independence Act</a>. He negotiated the passage of the <a href="Balanced%20Budget%20Act%20of%201997">Balanced Budget Act of 1997</a> by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the <a href="Gramm%E2%80%93Leach%E2%80%93Bliley%20Act">Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act</a>, which repealed the part of the <a href="Glass%E2%80%93Steagall%20Act">Glass–Steagall Act</a> that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of <a href="Investment%20banking">investment</a>, <a href="commercial%20bank">commercial bank</a>ing, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.

After the 1998 elections, the House <a href="Impeachment%20and%20acquittal%20of%20Bill%20Clinton">impeached Clinton</a>, alleging <a href="perjury">perjury</a> and <a href="obstruction%20of%20justice">obstruction of justice</a> related to the <a href="Lewinsky%20scandal">Lewinsky scandal</a>. Clinton was only the second U.S. president to be impeached, after <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>. Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a>) employee <a href="Monica%20Lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a>. After the <a href="Starr%20Report">Starr Report</a> was submitted to the House providing what it termed "substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment", the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the <a href="United%20States%20midterm%20election">mid-term elections</a>. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a <a href="lame-duck%20session">lame-duck session</a> in December 1998.
While the <a href="House%20Judiciary%20Committee">House Judiciary Committee</a> hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for <a href="perjury">perjury</a> and <a href="obstruction%20of%20justice">obstruction of justice</a>. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> that had been convened to investigate <a href="perjury">perjury</a> he may have committed in his sworn deposition during "Jones v. Clinton," <a href="Paula%20Jones">Paula Jones</a>'s sexual harassment lawsuit. The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.

The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges. The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm <a href="Williams%20%26amp%3B%20Connolly">Williams & Connolly</a>. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.

On January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the "Jones" case.

Clinton <a href="Bill%20Clinton%20pardon%20controversy">controversially issued</a> 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001. Most of the controversy surrounded <a href="Marc%20Rich">Marc Rich</a> and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, <a href="Hugh%20Edwin%20Rodham">Hugh Rodham</a>, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons. Federal prosecutor <a href="Mary%20Jo%20White">Mary Jo White</a> was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican <a href="James%20Comey">James Comey</a>, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.

Many military events occurred during Clinton's presidency. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Mogadishu%20%281993%29">Battle of Mogadishu</a> occurred in <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a> in 1993. During the operation, <a href="MH-60%20Black%20Hawk">two U.S. helicopters</a> were shot down by <a href="rocket-propelled%20grenade">rocket-propelled grenade</a> attacks to their <a href="tail%20rotor">tail rotor</a>s, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In 1995, U.S. and <a href="NATO">NATO</a> aircraft <a href="1995%20NATO%20bombing%20campaign%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">attacked Bosnian Serb targets</a> to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Agreement</a>.

In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Justice">International Court of Justice</a> after the shooting down of <a href="Iran%20Air%20Flight%20655">Iran Air Flight 655</a> by the U.S. Navy <a href="guided%20missile%20cruiser">guided missile cruiser</a>.

Capturing <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until <a href="Death%20of%20Osama%20bin%20Laden">bin Laden's death in 2011</a>). Despite claims by <a href="Mansoor%20Ijaz">Mansoor Ijaz</a> and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer the <a href="9/11%20Commission%20Report">9/11 Commission Report</a> stated that "we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim".

In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden and the <a href="1998%20United%20States%20embassy%20bombings">1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa</a> by <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, both of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton <a href="Operation%20Infinite%20Reach">ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan</a>, targeting the <a href="Al-Shifa%20pharmaceutical%20factory">Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory</a> in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.

To stop the <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> and <a href="genocide">genocide</a> of Albanians by anti-guerilla military units in the former <a href="Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>'s province of <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a <a href="NATO">NATO</a> bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named <a href="Operation%20Allied%20Force">Operation Allied Force</a>. General <a href="Wesley%20Clark">Wesley Clark</a> was <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander%20Europe">Supreme Allied Commander of NATO</a> and oversaw the mission. With <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201244">United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244</a>, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a <a href="Kosovo%20Force">peacekeeping force</a> to be deployed to the region. NATO announced that its forces had suffered zero combat deaths, and two deaths from an <a href="Boeing%20AH-64%20Apache">Apache helicopter</a> crash. Opinions in the popular press criticized pre-war genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated. In 2001, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Interim%20Administration%20Mission%20in%20Kosovo">U.N.-supervised</a> <a href="Judiciary%20of%20Kosovo">Supreme Court of Kosovo</a> ruled that genocide did not take place, but recognized "a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments". The term "ethnic cleansing" was used as an alternative to "genocide" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is no difference. <a href="Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Slobodan Milošević</a>, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was <a href="Trial%20of%20Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">eventually brought to trial</a> before the <a href="International%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20former%20Yugoslavia">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> in <a href="the%20Hague">the Hague</a> on charges of <a href="crimes%20against%20humanity">crimes against humanity</a>, genocide, and war crimes. Milošević died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.

In Clinton's <a href="1998%20State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address">1998 State of the Union Address</a>, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:

Seeking to weaken Hussein's grip on power, Clinton signed the <a href="Iraq%20Liberation%20Act%20of%201998">Iraq Liberation Act of 1998</a> into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of "regime change" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces. The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Fox">Operation Desert Fox</a>, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that "So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors." American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.

Clinton's November 2000 visit to <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the <a href="U.S.%E2%80%93China%20Relations%20Act%20of%202000">U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000</a>, which granted <a href="permanent%20normal%20trade%20relations">permanent normal trade relations</a> (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China. The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform. Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal <a href="United%20States%20federal%20budget">budget surplus</a> for the first time since 1969.

After initial successes such as the <a href="Oslo%20Accords">Oslo Accords</a> of the early 1990s, which also led to the <a href="Israel%E2%80%93Jordan%20peace%20treaty">Israel–Jordan peace treaty</a> in 1994 and the <a href="Wye%20River%20Memorandum">Wye River Memorandum</a> in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the <a href="Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian%20conflict">Israeli–Palestinian conflict</a>. He brought Israeli Prime Minister <a href="Ehud%20Barak">Ehud Barak</a> and Palestinian Authority chairman <a href="Yasser%20Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> together at <a href="Camp%20David">Camp David</a> for the <a href="2000%20Camp%20David%20Summit">Camp David Summit</a> in July 2000, which lasted 14 days. Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton stated Arafat "missed the opportunity" to facilitate a "just and lasting peace". In his <a href="My%20Life%20%28Bill%20Clinton%20autobiography%29">autobiography</a>, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit. Following another attempt in December 2000 at <a href="Bolling%20Air%20Force%20Base">Bolling Air Force Base</a>, in which the president offered the <a href="The%20Clinton%20Parameters">Clinton Parameters</a>, the situation broke down completely after the end of the <a href="Taba%20Summit">Taba Summit</a> and with the start of the <a href="Second%20Intifada">Second Intifada</a>.

Clinton appointed two justices to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>: <a href="Ruth%20Bader%20Ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> in 1993 and <a href="Stephen%20Breyer">Stephen Breyer</a> in 1994.

Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the <a href="United%20States%20courts%20of%20appeals">United States courts of appeals</a> and 305 judges to the <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">United States district court</a>s. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of <a href="Bill%20Clinton%20judicial%20appointment%20controversies">judicial appointment controversies</a>, as 69 nominees to <a href="United%20States%20federal%20judge">federal judgeships</a> did not receive a vote in the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>-controlled <a href="Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>. In all, 84 percent of his nominees were confirmed.

<a href="Sonia%20Sotomayor">Sonia Sotomayor</a> was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997 to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Second%20Circuit">Second Circuit</a>. Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition.

Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts. In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women. Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Fourth%20Circuit">Fourth Circuit</a> (<a href="Roger%20Gregory">Roger Gregory</a>) and the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Seventh%20Circuit">Seventh Circuit</a> (<a href="Ann%20Claire%20Williams">Ann Claire Williams</a>). Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly <a href="LGBT">gay or lesbian</a> federal judge when he named <a href="Deborah%20Batts">Deborah Batts</a> to the <a href="U.S.%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York</a>. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a <a href="voice%20vote">voice vote</a> in 1994.

Clinton's job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s throughout his first term. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s. After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point. According to a <a href="CBS%20News">CBS News</a>/"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68 percent, which matched those of <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. Clinton's average <a href="Gallup%20Organization">Gallup poll</a> approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years. Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.

As he was leaving office, a CNN/"<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"/Gallup poll revealed that 45 percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55 percent thought he "would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life"; 68 percent thought he would be remembered more for his "involvement in personal scandal" than for "his accomplishments"; and 58 percent answered "No" to the question "Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?" The same percentage said he would be remembered as either "outstanding" or "above average" as a president, while 22 percent said he would be remembered as "below average" or "poor". <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a> characterized public consensus on Clinton as, "You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics – and he's done a heck of a good job."

In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned. Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13% of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.

In 2014, 18% of respondents in a <a href="Quinnipiac%20University%20Polling%20Institute">Quinnipiac University Polling Institute</a> poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.

A 2015 poll by "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" asked 162 scholars of the <a href="American%20Political%20Science%20Association">American Political Science Association</a> to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.

As the first <a href="baby%20boomers">baby boomer</a> president, Clinton was the first president since <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> who was not alive during World War II. Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of <a href="sound%20bite">sound bite</a>-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings. When Clinton played the saxophone on "<a href="The%20Arsenio%20Hall%20Show">The Arsenio Hall Show</a>", he was described by some religious conservatives as "the MTV president". Opponents sometimes referred to him as "Slick Willie", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by "Pine Bluff Commercial" journalist <a href="Paul%20Greenberg%20%28journalist%29">Paul Greenberg</a>; Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as <a href="Winthrop%20Rockefeller">Winthrop Rockefeller</a>, <a href="Dale%20Bumpers">Dale Bumpers</a> and <a href="David%20Pryor">David Pryor</a>. The claim "Slick Willie" would last throughout his presidency. Standing at a height of (1.88 m), Clinton is tied with five others as the <a href="Heights%20of%20presidents%20and%20presidential%20candidates%20of%20the%20United%20States">fourth-tallest president</a> in the nation's history. His folksy manner led him to be <a href="List%20of%20nicknames%20of%20United%20States%20Presidents">nicknamed</a> <a href="Bubba">Bubba</a>, especially in the South. Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as "The Big Dog" or "Big Dog". His prominent role in campaigning for <a href="Barack%20Obama">President Obama</a> during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">2012 presidential election</a> and his widely publicized speech at the <a href="2012%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">2012 Democratic National Convention</a>, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname "Explainer-in-Chief".

Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency. In 1998, <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel</a> laureate <a href="Toni%20Morrison">Toni Morrison</a> called Clinton "the first Black president", saying, "Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a>-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas". Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and he compared this to the stereotyping and <a href="double%20standard">double standard</a>s that blacks typically endure. Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging to both Clinton and the African-American community at large. Clinton, a <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a>, has been open about his faith.

Shortly after Clinton took office, <a href="Richard%20Mellon%20Scaife">Richard Mellon Scaife</a>, a conservative newspaper owner, organized a fundraising campaign to smear Clinton's image in the media. Leading the <a href="Arkansas%20Project">Arkansas Project</a>, Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton's home state of Arkansas who would be willing to dish out negative allegations against the president.
In 1994, <a href="Paula%20Jones">Paula Jones</a> initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming that he made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge <a href="Susan%20Webber%20Wright">Susan Webber Wright</a> on the grounds that it lacked legal merit. Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998. In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. <a href="Robert%20S.%20Bennett">Robert S. Bennett</a>, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing "a pack of lies" and "an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States" funded by Clinton's political enemies. Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000. Bennett said that the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House, Clinton <a href="Lewinsky%20scandal">denied having sexual relations</a> with <a href="Monica%20Lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a> – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.

In 1992, <a href="Gennifer%20Flowers">Gennifer Flowers</a> stated that she had a relationship with Clinton that began in 1980. Flowers at first denied that she had an affair with Clinton, but later changed her story. After Clinton at first denied having a relationship with Flowers on "60 Minutes", he later admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.
In 1998, <a href="Kathleen%20Willey">Kathleen Willey</a> alleged that Clinton groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave "false information" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a>, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. <a href="Linda%20Tripp">Linda Tripp</a>'s grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.

Also in 1998, <a href="Juanita%20Broaddrick">Juanita Broaddrick</a> alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she stated she did not remember the exact date. In another 1998 event, <a href="Elizabeth%20Gracen">Elizabeth Gracen</a> recanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1982. Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton. Throughout the year, however, Gracen eluded a <a href="subpoena">subpoena</a> from Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court.

Bill Clinton continues to be active in public life, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations. Clinton has spoken in prime time at every <a href="Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> since 1988. <a href="Robert%20Reich">Robert Reich</a> has suggested that Clinton is in a state of <a href="permanent%20campaign">"permanent election"</a>, due to the impeachment proceedings during his presidency and his continuing support in the campaigns of his wife Hillary Clinton.

In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences, and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this). In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the <a href="United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20conference">United Nations Climate Change conference</a> in Montreal.

The <a href="William%20J.%20Clinton%20Presidential%20Center%20and%20Park">William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park</a> in <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a> was dedicated in 2004. Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, "<a href="My%20Life%20%28Bill%20Clinton%20autobiography%29">My Life</a>" in 2004. In 2007, he released "", which also became a <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"New York Times" Best Seller</a> and garnered positive reviews.
In the aftermath of the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 Asian tsunami</a>, <a href="Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">U.N. Secretary-General</a> <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a> appointed Clinton to head a relief effort. After <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year. As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXIX">Super Bowl XXXIX</a> pre-game show, and traveled to the affected areas. They also spoke together at the funeral of <a href="Boris%20Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> in April 2007.
Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton created the <a href="William%20J.%20Clinton%20Foundation">William J. Clinton Foundation</a> to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global <a href="public%20health">public health</a>, poverty alleviation and religious and <a href="ethnic%20conflict">ethnic conflict</a>. In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the <a href="Large%20Cities%20Climate%20Leadership%20Group">Large Cities Climate Leadership Group</a> in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director <a href="Inder%20Singh%20%28philanthropist%29">Inder Singh</a> announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30 percent in developing nations. Clinton also spoke in favor of <a href="California%20Proposition%2087%20%282006%29">California Proposition 87</a> on <a href="energy%20development">alternative energy</a>, which was voted down.

During the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202008">2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign</a>, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10 million toward her campaign. Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad. Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania. Considering Bill's remarks, many thought that he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary. Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the <a href="2008%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">2008 Democratic National Convention</a>, saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is "ready to lead". After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.

In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists <a href="2009%20imprisonment%20of%20American%20journalists%20by%20North%20Korea">imprisoned</a> there. <a href="Euna%20Lee">Euna Lee</a> and <a href="Laura%20Ling">Laura Ling</a> had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China. <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> had made a similar visit in 1994. After Clinton met with North Korean leader <a href="Kim%20Jong-il">Kim Jong-il</a>, Kim issued a pardon.

Since then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations <a href="Special%20Envoy%20of%20the%20Secretary-General">Special Envoy</a> to Haiti in 2009. In response to the <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a>, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery. Clinton continues to visit Haiti to witness the inauguration of refugee villages, and to raise funds for victims of the earthquake. In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of <a href="NTR%20plc">NTR</a>, Ireland's first environmental foundation. At the <a href="2012%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">2012 Democratic National Convention</a>, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.

During the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">2016 Presidential Election</a>, Clinton again encouraged voters to support <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, NC. In a series of tweets, then-President-Elect <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> criticized his ability to get people out to vote.

In September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery. In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung. On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to <a href="NewYork%E2%80%93Presbyterian%20Hospital">NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital</a> in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two <a href="coronary%20stent">coronary stent</a>s implanted in his heart. After this procedure, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (<a href="vegan">vegan</a>) diet, which had been recommended by doctors <a href="Dean%20Ornish">Dean Ornish</a> and <a href="Caldwell%20Esselstyn">Caldwell Esselstyn</a>.

The Clintons accrued several million dollars in legal fees during his presidency; the bills were paid off four years after he left office. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have received millions of dollars in book authorship fees. In 2016, "Forbes" reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001 to December 2015 (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing). Also in 2016, "CNN" reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015. In May 2015, "<a href="The%20Hill%20%28newspaper%29">The Hill</a>" reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, "<a href="Hard%20Choices">Hard Choices</a>", during the same time period. In July 2014, "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president. Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012. In June 2014, ABC News and "The Washington Post" reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, the "New York Times" reported that the Clintons' income tax returns show they have made $109 million in the 8 years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.

Bill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech. Hillary Clinton said that she and Bill came out of the White House financially "broke" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. "We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education." She added, "Bill has worked really hard ... we had to pay off all our debts ... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members."

Various colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including <a href="Legum%20Doctor">Doctorate of Law</a> degrees and <a href="Doctor%20of%20Humane%20Letters">Doctor of Humane Letters</a> degrees. He is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholar">Rhodes Scholar</a>, although he did not complete his studies there. Schools have been named for Clinton, and statues have been built to pay him homage. U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, and New York. He was presented with the <a href="Medal%20for%20Distinguished%20Public%20Service">Medal for Distinguished Public Service</a> by <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="William%20Cohen">William Cohen</a> in 2001. The <a href="Clinton%20Presidential%20Center">Clinton Presidential Center</a> was opened in <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a> in his honor on December 5, 2001.

He has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic, Papua New Guinea, Germany, and Kosovo.

Black letter law

In <a href="common%20law">common law</a> legal systems, black letter laws are the well-established legal rules that are no longer subject to reasonable dispute. Some examples are the "black-letter law" of <a href="contract">contract</a>s or the "black-letter law" of <a href="trademark">trademark</a>s. Black-letter law can be contrasted with <a href="legal%20theory">legal theory</a> or unsettled legal issues.

In a 1831 case in the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, "Jackson <a href="ex%20dem.">ex dem.</a> Bradford v. Huntington", the phrase "<a href="black%20letter">black letter</a>" was used: ""It is seldom that a case in our time savors so much of the black letter, but the course of decisions in New York renders it unavailable..."". The phrase "black-letter law" was used in the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Supreme%20Court">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> case "Naglee v. Ingersoll," 7 Pa. 185 (1847). The phrase does not come from association with <a href="Black%27s%20Law%20Dictionary">Black's Law Dictionary</a>, which was first published in 1891. Instead, it presumably refers to the practice of setting law books and citing legal precedents in <a href="blackletter">blackletter</a> type, a tradition that survived long after the switch to Roman and italic text for other printed works.

The phrase definitely refers to a distillation of the <a href="common%20law">common law</a> into general and accepted legal principles. One can see this in the quote above from the Supreme Court where the Court is noting that while the black letter law is clear, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> precedent deviates from the general principles.

In <a href="common%20law">common law</a>, the informal black letter legal doctrine includes the basic principles of <a href="law">law</a> generally accepted by the <a href="court">court</a>s and/or embodied in the <a href="statute">statute</a>s of a particular <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>. The letter of the law is its actual implementation, thereby demonstrating that black letter laws are those <a href="statute">statute</a>s, rules, <a href="acts">acts</a>, <a href="laws">laws</a>, provisions, etc. that are or have been written down, codified, or indicated somewhere in <a href="legal">legal</a> texts throughout history of specific <a href="State%20%28polity%29">state</a> law. This is often the case for many <a href="precedent">precedent</a>s that have been set in the <a href="common%20law">common law</a>. An example of such a state within the <a href="common%20law%20jurisdiction">common law jurisdiction</a>, and using the black letter <a href="legal%20doctrine">legal doctrine</a> is <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. Canada is a <a href="monarchical%20state">monarchical state</a>, with its roots invested in <a href="Colonial%20England">Colonial England</a>, and black letter law is the <a href="principles%20of%20law">principles of law</a> accepted by the <a href="majority%20of%20judges">majority of judges</a> in most <a href="provinces">provinces</a> and <a href="Territories%20of%20Canada">territories</a>. Sometimes this is referred to as "<a href="hornbook%20law">hornbook law</a>" meaning <a href="treatise">treatise</a> or textbook, often relied upon as <a href="authoritative">authoritative</a>, competent, and generally accepted in the field of Canadian law. In <a href="Legal%20English">lawyer lingo</a>, hornbook law or black letter law is a fundamental and well-accepted legal principle that does not require any further explanation, since a hornbook is a primer of basics. Law is the rule which establish that a <a href="principle">principle</a>, <a href="provision%20%28law%29">provision</a>, <a href="references">references</a>, <a href="inference">inference</a>, <a href="observation">observation</a>, etc. may not require further explanation or clarification when the very nature of them shows that they are basic and elementary.

The phrase is nearly synonymous with the phrase "<a href="hornbook%20law">hornbook law</a>". There are a number of venerable legal sources that distill the common law on various subjects known as <a href="Restatement%20of%20the%20Law">Restatement of the Law</a>.

Blue law

Blue laws, also known as Sunday laws, are laws designed to restrict or ban some or all Sunday activities for religious reasons, particularly to promote the observance of a day of worship or rest. Blue laws may also restrict shopping or ban sale of certain items on specific days, most often on Sundays in the western world. Blue laws are enforced in parts of the United States and Canada as well as some European countries, particularly in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and Norway, keeping most stores closed on Sundays.

In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has held blue laws as constitutional numerous times, citing secular basis such as securing a day of rest for mail carriers, as well as protecting workers and families, in turn contributing to societal stability and guaranteeing the <a href="free%20exercise%20of%20religion">free exercise of religion</a>. The origin of the blue laws also partially stems from religion, particularly the prohibition of <a href="Sabbath%20desecration">Sabbath desecration</a> in Christian Churches following the <a href="first-day%20Sabbatarian">first-day Sabbatarian</a> tradition. Both <a href="labour%20unions">labour unions</a> and <a href="trade%20associations">trade associations</a> have historically supported the legislation of blue laws. Blue laws are technically classed as "<a href="Malum%20prohibitum">mala prohibita</a>" or "wrong [as or because] prohibited" (as opposed to "<a href="Malum%20in%20se">mala in se</a>" or "wrong or evil in itself"). Most blue laws have been repealed in the United States, although many states still ban the sale of <a href="alcoholic%20beverages">alcoholic beverages</a> or cars on Sundays. <a href="Bergen%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bergen County, New Jersey</a> is notable for their blue laws banning the sale of clothing, shoes, furniture, home supplies and appliances on Sundays kept through county-wide referendum.

The very first known law regarding prohibition of Sunday labor for religious reasons was in <a href="538">538</a> at the <a href="Third%20Council%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Third Council of Orléans</a>.

The first occurrence of the phrase "blue laws" so far found is in the "New-York Mercury" of March 3, 1755, where the writer imagines a future newspaper praising the revival of "our <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>'s <a href="Blue%20Laws%20%28Connecticut%29">old Blue Laws</a>". In his 1781 book "General History of Connecticut", the Reverend <a href="Samuel%20Peters">Samuel Peters</a> (1735–1826) used it to describe various laws first enacted by <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> colonies in the 17th century that prohibited various activities, recreational as well as commercial, on Sunday (Saturday evening through Sunday night). Sometimes the sale of certain types of merchandise was prohibited, and in some cases all retail and business activity.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that blue laws were originally printed on blue paper. Rather, the word "blue" was used in the 17th century as a disparaging reference to rigid moral codes and those who observed them, particularly in "blue-stocking", a reference to <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s supporters in the parliament of 1653. Moreover, although Reverend Peters claimed that the term "blue law" was originally used by Puritan colonists, his work has since been found to be unreliable. In any event, Peters never asserted that the blue laws were originally printed on blue paper, and this has come to be regarded as an example of <a href="false%20etymology">false etymology</a>, another version of which is that the laws were first bound in books with blue covers.

As Protestant moral reformers organized the Sabbath reform in nineteenth-century America, calls for the enactment and/or enforcement of stricter Sunday laws developed. Numerous Americans were arrested for working, keeping an open shop, drinking alcohol, traveling, and recreating on Sundays. Erwin Fahlbusch and Geoffrey William Bromiley write that throughout their existence, organizations advocating <a href="first-day%20Sabbatarianism">first-day Sabbatarianism</a>, such as the <a href="Lord%27s%20Day%20Alliance">Lord's Day Alliance</a> in North America and the <a href="Lord%27s%20Day%20Observance%20Society">Lord's Day Observance Society</a> in the British Isles, were supported by <a href="labor%20unions">labor unions</a> in lobbying "to prevent secular and commercial interests from hampering freedom of worship and from exploiting workers." For example, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> was supported by the Lord's Day Alliance in securing "a day of rest for city postal clerks whose hours of labor, unlike those of city mail carriers, were largely unregulated." In Canada, the "Ligue du Dimanche", a Roman Catholic Sunday league, supported the <a href="Lord%27s%20Day%20Act">Lord's Day Act</a> in 1923 and promoted first-day Sabbatarian legislation. Beginning in the 1840s, workingmen, Jews, Seventh Day Baptists, free-thinkers, and other groups began to organize opposition. Throughout the century, Sunday laws served as a major source of church-state controversy and as an issue that drove the emergence of modern American minority-rights politics. On the other hand, the more recent "<a href="Dies%20Domini">Dies Domini</a>", written by <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> in 1998, advocates Sunday legislation in that it protects civil servants and workers; the North Dakota Catholic Conference in 2011 likewise maintained that blue laws, in accordance with the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, "ensure that, for reasons of economic productivity, citizens are not denied time for rest and divine worship." Similarly, Chief Justice <a href="Earl%20Warren">Earl Warren</a>, while acknowledging the partial religious origin of blue laws, acknowledged their "secular purpose they served by providing a benefit to workers at the same time that they enhanced labor productivity."

Many European countries still place strong restrictions on store opening hours on Sundays, an example being Germany's <a href="Ladenschlussgesetz">Ladenschlussgesetz</a>.

The Lord's Day Act, which since 1906 had prohibited business transactions from taking place on Sundays, was declared unconstitutional in the 1985 case "<a href="R.%20v.%20Big%20M%20Drug%20Mart%20Ltd.">R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.</a>" Calgary police officers witnessed several transactions at the Big M Drug Mart, all of which occurred on a Sunday. Big M was charged with a violation of the Lord's Day Act. A provincial court ruled that the Lord's Day Act was unconstitutional, but the Crown proceeded to appeal all the way to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a>. In a unanimous 6–0 decision, the Lord's Day Act was ruled an infringement of the freedom of conscience and religion defined in section 2(a) of the <a href="Charter%20of%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>.

A Toronto referendum in 1950 allowed only team sports to be played professionally on Sunday. Theatre performances, movie screenings, and horse racing were not permitted until the 1960s.

The Supreme Court later concluded, in "<a href="R.%20v.%20Edwards%20Books%20and%20Art%20Ltd.">R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd.</a>", [1986] (2 S.C.R. 713) that Ontario's Retail Business Holiday Act, which required some Sunday closings, did not violate the Charter because it did not have a religious purpose. Nonetheless, as of today, virtually all provincial Sunday Closing laws have ceased to exist. Some were struck down by provincial courts, but most were simply abrogated, often due to competitive reasons where out-of-province or foreign merchants were open.

In the <a href="Cook%20Islands">Cook Islands</a>, blue laws were the first written legislation, enacted by the <a href="London%20Missionary%20Society">London Missionary Society</a> in 1827, with the consent of "<a href="Ali%27i">ariki</a>" (chiefs). In <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a>, the <a href="Vava%27u%20Code">Vava'u Code</a> (1839) was inspired by <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> <a href="missionary">missionary</a> teachings, and was a form of blue law. In <a href="Niue">Niue</a>, certain activities remain forbidden on Sunday, reflecting <a href="History%20of%20Niue">the country's history</a> of observing Christian Sabbath tradition.

In <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> the closing laws restricting retail trade on Sundays have been abolished with effect from October 1, 2012. From then on retail trade is only restricted on public holidays (New Years Day, <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Maundy Thursday</a>, Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Easter Monday, Day of Prayer, Ascension Day, Whit Sunday, Whit Monday, Christmas Day and Boxing Day) and on Constitution Day, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve (on New Year's Eve from 3 pm only). On these days almost all shops will remain closed. Exempt are bakeries, DIYs, garden centres, gas stations and smaller supermarkets.

Prior to 1994, trading laws forbade sale of certain products on a Sunday; the distinction between those that could and could not be sold was increasingly seen as arbitrary, and the laws were inadequately enforced and widely flouted. For example, some supermarkets would treat the relatively modest fines arising as a business cost and open nonetheless.

The <a href="Sunday%20Trading%20Act%201994">Sunday Trading Act 1994</a> relaxed restrictions on Sunday trading. This produced vocal opposition from bodies such as the Keep Sunday Special campaign, and the <a href="Lord%27s%20Day%20Observance%20Society">Lord's Day Observance Society</a>: on religious grounds, on the grounds that it would increase consumerism, and that it would reduce shop assistants' weekend leisure time.

The legislation permits large shops (those with a relevant floor area in excess of 280 square metres) to open for up to six hours on Sunday between the hours of 10 am and 6 pm. Small shops, those with an area of below 280 square metres, are free to set their own Sunday trading times. Some large shops, such as off-licences, service stations and garages, are exempt from the restrictions.

Some very large shops (e.g. department stores) open for longer than 6 hours on a Sunday by allowing customers in to browse 30 minutes prior to allowing them to make a purchase, since the 6 hour restriction only applies to time during which the shop may make sales.

Christmas Day and Easter Sunday are non-trading days. This applies even to garden centres, which earlier had been trading over Easter, but not to small shops (those with an area of below 280 square metres).

Prior to 2008, <a href="Sunday%20football%20in%20Northern%20Ireland">no football was permitted to be played on Sundays</a> by clubs affiliated to the <a href="Irish%20Football%20Association">Irish Football Association</a> in Northern Ireland.

Shops with a floor area of over 280 square meters may only open from 1 to 6pm on Sundays.

In the United States, judges have defended blue laws "in terms of their secular benefit to workers", holding that "the laws were essential to social well-being". Chief Justice <a href="Stephen%20Johnson%20Field">Stephen Johnson Field</a>, with regard to Sunday blue laws, stated:
Many states prohibit selling <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcohol</a> for on and off-premises sales in one form or another on Sundays at some restricted time, under the idea that people should be in church on Sunday morning, or at least not drinking.

Another feature of <a href="blue%20laws%20in%20the%20United%20States">blue laws in the United States</a> restricts the purchase of particular items on Sundays. Some of these laws restrict the ability to buy cars, groceries, office supplies, and housewares among other things. Though most of these laws have been relaxed or repealed in most states, they are still enforced in some other states.

In Texas, for example, blue laws prohibited selling housewares such as pots, pans, and washing machines on Sunday until 1985. In <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, car dealerships continue to operate under blue-law prohibitions in which an automobile may not be purchased or traded on a Sunday. <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> permits Sunday automobile sales only in the counties of <a href="Charles%20County%2C%20Maryland">Charles</a>, <a href="Prince%20George%27s%20County%2C%20Maryland">Prince George's</a>, <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland">Montgomery</a>, and <a href="Howard%20County%2C%20Maryland">Howard</a>; similarly, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> restricts Sunday sales to only those counties with a population of less than 130,000. Texas and <a href="Utah">Utah</a> prohibit car dealerships from operating over consecutive weekend days. In some cases these laws were created or retained with the support of those whom they affected, to allow them a day off each week without fear of their competitors still being open.

Blue laws may also prohibit retail activity on days other than Sunday. In <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, and <a href="Maine">Maine</a> (which was previously part of Massachusetts), for example, blue laws prohibit most retail stores, including grocery stores, from opening on <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> and Christmas.

Research regarding the effect of the repeal of blue laws has been conducted, with Professor Elesha Coffman of <a href="Baylor%20University">Baylor University</a> writing:
Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, religious and ethno-cultural minorities arrested for violating state and local blue laws appealed their convictions to state supreme courts. In "Specht v. Commonwealth" (1848), for example, German Seventh Day Baptists in Pennsylvania employed attorney <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a> to challenge the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's Sunday law. As in cases in other states, litigants pointed to the provisions of state constitutions protecting religious liberty and maintained that Sunday laws were a blatant violation. Though typically unsuccessful (most state supreme courts upheld the constitutionality of Sunday laws), these constitutional challenges helped set a pattern by which subsequent moral minorities would seek to protect religious freedom and minority rights.

The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> held in its landmark case, "<a href="McGowan%20v.%20Maryland">McGowan v. Maryland</a>" (1961), that <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>'s blue laws violated neither the <a href="Free%20Exercise%20Clause">Free Exercise Clause</a> nor the <a href="Establishment%20Clause">Establishment Clause</a> of the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. It approved the state's blue law restricting commercial activities on Sunday, noting that while such laws originated to encourage <a href="church%20attendance">attendance at Christian churches</a>, the contemporary Maryland laws were intended to serve "to provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens" on a secular basis and to promote the secular values of "health, safety, recreation, and general well-being" through a common day of rest. That this day coincides with <a href="Christian%20Sabbath">Christian Sabbath</a> is not a bar to the state's secular goals; it neither reduces its effectiveness for secular purposes nor prevents adherents of other religions from observing their own holy days.

There were four landmark Sunday-law cases altogether in 1961. The other three were "<a href="Gallagher%20v.%20Crown%20Kosher%20Super%20Market%20of%20Mass.%2C%20Inc.">Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.</a>", 366 U.S. 617 (1961); "<a href="Braunfeld%20v.%20Brown">Braunfeld v. Brown</a>", 366 U.S. 599 (1961); "Two Guys from Harrison vs. McGinley", 366 U.S. 582 (1961). Chief Justice <a href="Earl%20Warren">Earl Warren</a> declared that "the State seeks to set one day apart from all others as a day of rest, repose, recreation and tranquility--a day which all members of the family and community have the opportunity to spend and enjoy together, a day on which there exists relative quiet and disassociation from the everyday intensity of commercial activities, a day on which people may visit friends and relative who are not available during working days."

In March 2006, Texas judges upheld the state blue law that requires car dealerships to close either Saturday or Sunday each weekend.

Beer

Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed <a href="alcoholic%20drink">alcoholic drink</a> in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after <a href="water">water</a> and <a href="tea">tea</a>. Beer is <a href="brewing">brewed</a> from <a href="cereal">cereal grains</a> — most commonly from <a href="malt">malt</a>ed <a href="barley">barley</a>, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, <a href="Brewing%23Fermenting">fermentation</a> of the <a href="starch">starch</a> <a href="sugar">sugar</a>s in the <a href="wort">wort</a> produces <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> and <a href="carbonation">carbonation</a> in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with <a href="hops">hops</a>, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural <a href="preservative">preservative</a> and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as <a href="gruit">gruit</a>, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural <a href="carbonation">carbonation</a> effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.

Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the <a href="Code%20of%20Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a> included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and "The Hymn to <a href="Ninkasi">Ninkasi</a>", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on <a href="Draught%20beer">draught</a>, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant <a href="Multinational%20corporation">multinational companies</a> and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from <a href="Microbrewery%23Brewpub">brewpubs</a> to <a href="regional%20brewery">regional breweries</a>. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% <a href="alcohol%20by%20volume">alcohol by volume</a> (abv), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above. Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as <a href="beer%20festival">beer festival</a>s as well as a rich <a href="Public%20house">pub culture</a> involving activities like <a href="pub%20crawl">pub crawl</a>ing and <a href="pub%20games">pub games</a> such as <a href="bar%20billiards">bar billiards</a>.

Various legal definitions of beer exist in different countries. Historically, the most famous of these was the "<a href="Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a>", which applied to parts of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must have less than 25% <a href="Alcohol%20by%20volume">ABV</a>, which means that it has to be 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, hops, and starches (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process. In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by volume concentration at 20 °C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like <a href="malt">malt</a>, sugars or its equivalent, and <a href="hops">hops</a> or other vegetables.

Beer is one of the world's oldest prepared beverages, possibly dating back to the <a href="Pre-Pottery%20Neolithic%20A">early Neolithic</a> or 9500 BC , when cereal was first <a href="History%20of%20agriculture">farmed</a>, and is recorded in the written history of <a href="Mesopotamia">ancient Iraq</a> and <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>. Archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations. Approximately 5000 years ago, workers in the city of <a href="Uruk">Uruk</a> (modern day Iraq) were paid by their employers in beer. During the building of the <a href="Giza%20pyramid%20complex">Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt</a>, each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer, which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids' construction.

The earliest known chemical evidence of <a href="barley">barley</a> beer dates to circa 3500–3100 BC from the site of <a href="Godin%20Tepe">Godin Tepe</a> in the <a href="Zagros%20Mountains">Zagros Mountains</a> of western Iran. Some of the earliest Sumerian writings contain references to beer; examples include a prayer to the goddess <a href="Ninkasi">Ninkasi</a>, known as "The Hymn to Ninkasi", which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people, and the ancient advice ("Fill your belly. Day and night make merry") to <a href="Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, recorded in the <a href="Epic%20of%20Gilgamesh">Epic of Gilgamesh</a>, by the ale-wife <a href="Siduri">Siduri</a> may, at least in part, have referred to the consumption of beer. The <a href="Ebla%20tablets">Ebla tablets</a>, discovered in 1974 in <a href="Ebla">Ebla</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC. A fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC. Unlike <a href="sake">sake</a>, mould was not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by <a href="mastication">mastication</a> or <a href="malting">malting</a>.

Almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. It is likely that many cultures, on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch, independently invented beer. Bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilisations.

<a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> noted that during his travels, Beer was being produced in <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>.

Beer was spread through Europe by <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> and <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> tribes as far back as 3000 BC, and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale. The product that the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today. Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers might contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as <a href="narcotic">narcotic</a> herbs. What they did not contain was <a href="hops">hops</a>, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot and again in 1067 by Abbess <a href="Hildegard%20of%20Bingen">Hildegard of Bingen</a>.

In 1516, <a href="William%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">William IV</a>, Duke of Bavaria, adopted the "<a href="Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a>" (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality regulation still in use in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, <a href="hops">hops</a> and barley-<a href="malt">malt</a>. Beer produced before the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European <a href="monasteries">monasteries</a>. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from <a href="artisan">artisan</a>al manufacture to <a href="Manufacturing">industrial manufacture</a>, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century. The development of <a href="hydrometer">hydrometer</a>s and <a href="thermometer">thermometer</a>s changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results.

As of 2007, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from <a href="brewpub">brewpub</a>s to <a href="regional%20brewery">regional breweries</a>. As of 2006, more than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons), the equivalent of a cube 510 metres on a side, of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion). In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectolitres (45 billion litres), or nearly twice that of the United States, but only 5 per cent sold were premium draught beers, compared with 50 per cent in France and Germany.

The process of making beer is known as brewing. A dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a <a href="brewing%20company">brewing company</a>. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as <a href="homebrewing">homebrewing</a> regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in <a href="developed%20countries">developed countries</a>, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.

The purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called <a href="wort">wort</a> and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by <a href="Brewer%27s%20yeast">yeast</a>.
The first step, where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, is known as "<a href="mashing">mashing</a>". Hot water (known as "liquor" in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as "<a href="grist">grist</a>") in a <a href="mash%20tun">mash tun</a>. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called "wort separation". The traditional process for wort separation is <a href="lautering">lautering</a>, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.

Most modern breweries use a continuous sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.

The sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle, or "copper" (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper), and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage. <a href="Hops">Hops</a> are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and aroma. Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.

After boiling, the hopped wort is now cooled, ready for the yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>, fine <a href="Suspended%20solids">particulate matter</a> suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.

Fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of <a href="Brewing%23Secondary%20fermentation">secondary fermentation</a>. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is <a href="%23Packaging">packaged</a> either into casks for <a href="cask%20ale">cask ale</a> or kegs, <a href="beverage%20can">aluminium cans</a>, or bottles for other sorts of beer.

The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as <a href="malt">malt</a>ed <a href="barley">barley</a>, able to be saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a <a href="brewer%27s%20yeast">brewer's yeast</a> to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as <a href="hops">hops</a>. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an <a href="adjunct%20%28beer%29">adjunct</a>, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley. Less widely used starch sources include <a href="millet">millet</a>, <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a> and <a href="cassava">cassava</a> root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and <a href="agave">agave</a> in Mexico, among others. The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the <a href="grain%20bill">grain bill</a>.

The Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations requires that the beer should be made by the alcoholic fermentation of yeast. Beer could be made using barley or wheat malt and hops or hop extract in water that is safe to drink. The end result should have the aroma and taste that is associated with beer.

Water is the main ingredient of beer, accounting for 93% of its weight. Though water itself is, ideally, flavorless, its level of dissolved minerals, specifically, bicarbonate ion, does influence beer's finished taste. Due to the <a href="mineral">mineral</a> properties of each <a href="region">region</a>'s water, specific areas were originally the sole producers of certain types of beer, each identifiable by regional characteristics.

Regional <a href="geology">geology</a> accords that <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>'s <a href="hard%20water">hard water</a> is well-suited to making <a href="stout">stout</a>, such as <a href="Guinness">Guinness</a>, while the <a href="Plze%C5%88%20Region">Plzeň Region</a>'s soft water is ideal for brewing <a href="Pilsner">Pilsner</a> (<a href="pale%20lager">pale lager</a>), such as <a href="Pilsner%20Urquell">Pilsner Urquell</a>. The waters of <a href="Burton%20Bridge%20Brewery">Burton</a> in England contain <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a>, which benefits making <a href="pale%20ale">pale ale</a> to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as <a href="Burtonisation">Burtonisation</a>.

The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin <a href="germination">germination</a>, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.

Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the <a href="Mashing">mash</a>, and act as a filter bed during <a href="lautering">lautering</a>, when sweet <a href="wort">wort</a> is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, <a href="oats">oats</a>, and <a href="rye">rye</a>, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced <a href="gluten-free%20beer">gluten-free beer</a>, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume <a href="gluten">gluten</a>-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.

Flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops. The flower of the <a href="Humulus%20lupulus">hop vine</a> is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. The flowers themselves are often called "hops".

The first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as <a href="Adalard%20of%20Corbie">Adalard of Corbie</a>, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, <a href="grains%20of%20paradise">grains of paradise</a> or "<a href="Glechoma%20hederacea%23Cultivation%20and%20uses">alehoof</a>". Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like <a href="Absinth%20Wormwood">wormwood</a> would be combined into a mixture known as <a href="gruit">gruit</a> and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.

Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the <a href="International%20Bitterness%20Units%20scale">International Bitterness Units scale</a>. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. Hops have an <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in "<a href="Head%20%28beer%29">head</a> retention", the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.

"<a href="Hops">Hop</a> extract" means an extract derived from hops by a process employing the solvent. The hop extract should not contain more than 2.2 per cent of the solvent used. The solvent listed on Canada’s Food and Drug Regulations website are <a href="hexane">hexane</a>, <a href="methanol">methanol</a>, or <a href="methylene%20chloride">methylene chloride</a>. Furthermore, carbon dioxide or <a href="ethyl%20alcohol">ethyl alcohol</a> should be kept in an amount consistent with good manufacturing practice.

"Pre-isomerized hop extract" means an extract derived from hops by one of <a href="hexane">hexane</a>, carbon dioxide, or <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> for solvent; and the subsequent isolation of the alpha acids and their conversion to isomerized alpha acids using diluted alkali and heat.

Yeast is the <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a> that is responsible for fermentation in beer. Yeast <a href="metabolism">metabolises</a> the sugars extracted from grains, which produces <a href="Ethanol">alcohol</a> and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, and thereby turns <a href="wort">wort</a> into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.

The dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the <a href="Top-fermenting%20yeast">top-fermenting</a> "<a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a>" and <a href="bottom-fermenting">bottom-fermenting</a> "<a href="Saccharomyces%20pastorianus">Saccharomyces pastorianus</a>". "<a href="Brettanomyces">Brettanomyces</a>" ferments <a href="lambic">lambic</a>s, and "<a href="Torulaspora%20delbrueckii">Torulaspora delbrueckii</a>" ferments Bavarian <a href="weissbier">weissbier</a>.

Before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts. A few styles such as <a href="lambics">lambics</a> rely on this method today, but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast <a href="Microbiological%20culture">cultures</a>.

Some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer, which typically <a href="precipitate">precipitate</a> (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear <a href="Bright%20beer">bright</a> and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as <a href="wheat%20beer">wheat beer</a>s.

Examples of clarifying agents include <a href="isinglass">isinglass</a>, obtained from <a href="swimbladder">swimbladder</a>s of fish; <a href="Chondrus%20crispus">Irish moss</a>, a seaweed; kappa <a href="carrageenan">carrageenan</a>, from the seaweed "<a href="Kappaphycus%20cottonii">Kappaphycus cottonii</a>"; <a href="Polyclar">Polyclar</a> (artificial); and <a href="gelatin">gelatin</a>. If a beer is marked "suitable for Vegans", it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents.

In South Korea, Additives allowed include Milk- related additives such as Milk, Milk Powder, Milk Cream, <a href="Casein">Casein</a>, Thickening Agents like <a href="Gum%20arabic">Arabic Gum</a>, <a href="Pectin">Pectin</a> and <a href="Sugar%20substitute">Sweeteners</a> such as <a href="Acesulfame%20potassium">Acesulfame K</a>, <a href="Erythritol">Erythritol</a>, <a href="Xylitol">Xylitol</a> etc. Designated uses and tolerance levels of each additive are established on a product-by-product basis regulated by the Korea Ministry of Food & Drug Safety (MFDS) and may differ from the international regulations.

In Singapore, there are strict regulations on the maximum amount of additives allowed in the table below.

The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant <a href="Multinational%20corporation">multinational companies</a> and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from <a href="brewpub">brewpub</a>s to <a href="regional%20brewery">regional breweries</a>. More than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) in 2006.

The history of breweries in the 21st century has been one of larger breweries absorbing smaller breweries in order to ensure economy of scale. In 2002 <a href="South%20African%20Breweries">South African Breweries</a> bought the North American <a href="Miller%20Brewing%20Company">Miller Brewing Company</a> to found <a href="SABMiller">SABMiller</a>, becoming the second largest brewery, after North American <a href="Anheuser-Bush">Anheuser-Bush</a>. In 2004 the Belgian <a href="Interbrew">Interbrew</a> was the third largest brewery by volume and the Brazilian <a href="AmBev">AmBev</a> was the fifth largest. They merged into <a href="InBev">InBev</a>, becoming the largest brewery. In 2007, <a href="SABMiller">SABMiller</a> surpassed InBev and Anheuser-Bush when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand <a href="Grolsch">Grolsch</a> in 2007. In 2008, when <a href="InBev">InBev</a> (the second-largest) bought <a href="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a> (the third largest), the new <a href="Anheuser-Busch%20InBev">Anheuser-Busch InBev</a> company became again the largest brewer in the world. AB InBev remains the largest brewery, with SABMiller second, and <a href="Heineken%20International">Heineken International</a> third.

A microbrewery, or craft brewery, produces a limited amount of beer. The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a <a href="public%20house">pub</a> or other <a href="bar%20%28establishment%29">eating establishment</a>. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>, especially in the district of <a href="Upper%20Franconia">Upper Franconia</a>, which has about 200 breweries. The <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> <a href="Weihenstephan">Weihenstephan</a> Brewery in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of <a href="Freising">Freising</a> in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.

<a href="homebrewing">Brewing at home</a> is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries. Restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the UK in 1963, Australia followed suit in 1972, and the US in 1978, though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production.

The word "ale" comes from <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "ealu" (plural "ealoþ"), in turn from <a href="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> "*alu" (plural "*aluþ"), ultimately from the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> base "*h₂elut-", which holds connotations of "sorcery, magic, possession, intoxication". The word "beer" comes from Old English "bēor", from Proto-Germanic "*beuzą", probably from Proto-Indo-European "*bʰeusóm", originally "<a href="brewer%27s%20yeast">brewer's yeast</a>, beer dregs", although other theories have been provided connecting the word with Old English "bēow", "barley", or Latin "bibere", "to drink". On the currency of two words for the same thing in the Germanic languages, the 12th-century <a href="Old%20Icelandic">Old Icelandic</a> poem "<a href="Alv%C3%ADssm%C3%A1l">Alvíssmál</a>" says, "Ale it is called among men, but among the gods, beer."

While there are many types of beer brewed, the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries. The traditional European brewing regions—<a href="German%20beer">Germany</a>, <a href="Belgian%20beer">Belgium</a>, <a href="Beer%20in%20England">England</a> and the <a href="Czech%20beer">Czech Republic</a>—have local varieties of beer.

English writer <a href="Michael%20Jackson%20%28writer%29">Michael Jackson</a>, in his 1977 book "The World Guide To Beer", categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names. <a href="Fred%20Eckhardt">Fred Eckhardt</a> furthered Jackson's work in "The Essentials of Beer Style" in 1989.

Top-fermented beers are most commonly produced with "<a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a>", a <a href="top-fermenting%20yeast">top-fermenting yeast</a> which <a href="Yeast%20flocculation">clumps</a> and rises to the surface, typically between . At these temperatures, yeast produces significant amounts of <a href="ester">ester</a>s and other secondary flavour and aroma products, and the result is often a beer with slightly "fruity" compounds resembling apple, pear, pineapple, <a href="Banana%20beer">banana</a>, plum, or prune, among others.

After the introduction of hops into England from Flanders in the 15th century, "ale" referred to an unhopped fermented beverage, "beer" being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops.

"<a href="Real%20ale">Real ale</a>" is the term coined by the <a href="Campaign%20for%20Real%20Ale">Campaign for Real Ale</a> (CAMRA) in 1973 for "beer brewed from traditional ingredients, matured by <a href="Brewing%23Secondary%20fermentation">secondary fermentation</a> in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of <a href="carbonation">extraneous carbon dioxide</a>". It is applied to <a href="bottle%20conditioned">bottle conditioned</a> and <a href="cask%20conditioned">cask conditioned</a> beers.

<a href="Pale%20ale">Pale ale</a> is a beer which uses a top-fermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt. It is one of the world's major beer styles.

<a href="Stout">Stout</a> and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley, and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast. There are a number of variations including Baltic porter, dry stout, and Imperial stout. The name "porter" was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river <a href="Porter%20%28carrier%29">porters</a> of London. This same beer later also became known as stout, though the word stout had been used as early as 1677. The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined.

<a href="Mild%20ale">Mild ale</a> has a predominantly malty palate. It is usually dark coloured with an <a href="Alcohol%20by%20volume">abv</a> of 3% to 3.6%, although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching 6% abv and higher.

<a href="Wheat%20beer">Wheat beer</a> is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of <a href="malted%20barley">malted barley</a>. Wheat beers are usually <a href="top-fermented">top-fermented</a> (in Germany they have to be by law). The flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.

<a href="Lambic">Lambic</a>, a beer of <a href="Belgian%20beers">Belgium</a>, is naturally fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many of these are not strains of brewer's yeast ("Saccharomyces cerevisiae") and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as "<a href="Brettanomyces%20bruxellensis">Brettanomyces bruxellensis</a>" and "<a href="Brettanomyces%20lambicus">Brettanomyces lambicus</a>" are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as "<a href="Lactobacillus">Lactobacillus</a>" bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.

<a href="Lager">Lager</a> is cool fermented beer. <a href="Pale%20lager">Pale lager</a>s are the most commonly consumed beers in the world. The name "lager" comes from the German "lagern" for "to store", as brewers around Bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months. These brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment, and to also clear of sediment, when stored in cool conditions.

Lager yeast is a cool bottom-fermenting yeast ("<a href="Saccharomyces%20pastorianus">Saccharomyces pastorianus</a>") and typically undergoes primary fermentation at (the fermentation phase), and then is given a long secondary fermentation at (the lagering phase). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of <a href="ester">ester</a>s and other byproducts, resulting in a "cleaner"-tasting beer.

Modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the <a href="Spaten%20Brewery">Spaten Brewery</a> in Bavaria, and <a href="Anton%20Dreher">Anton Dreher</a>, who began brewing a lager (now known as <a href="Vienna%20lager">Vienna lager</a>), probably of amber-red colour, in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> in 1840–1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage, typically 1–3 weeks.

Beer is measured and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived <a href="bitter%20%28taste%29">bitterness</a> is measured by the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Brewing%20Chemists">American Society of Brewing Chemists</a> and the <a href="European%20Brewery%20Convention">European Brewery Convention</a>. The international scale was a development of the European Bitterness Units scale, often abbreviated as EBU, and the bitterness values should be identical.

Beer colour is determined by the malt. The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. "Pale lager" and "pale ale" are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel <a href="Coke%20%28fuel%29">coke</a>. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, but it was not until around 1703 that the term "pale ale" was used.

In terms of sales volume, most of today's beer is based on the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of <a href="Plze%C5%88">Pilsen</a> in the present-day <a href="Czech%20beer">Czech Republic</a>. The modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical <a href="alcohol%20by%20volume">alcohol by volume</a> content of around 5%. The <a href="Pilsner%20Urquell">Pilsner Urquell</a>, <a href="Bitburger">Bitburger</a>, and <a href="Heineken%20Pilsener">Heineken</a> brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands <a href="Budweiser">Budweiser</a>, <a href="Coors%20Brewing%20Company">Coors</a>, and <a href="Miller%20Brewing%20Company">Miller</a>.

Dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as <a href="stout">stout</a>, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.

Beer ranges from less than 3% <a href="alcohol%20by%20volume">alcohol by volume</a> (abv) to around 14% abv, though this strength can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process. The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The <a href="pale%20lager">pale lager</a>s that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many <a href="session%20beer">session beer</a>s being around 4% abv. Some beers, such as <a href="Belgian%20beer%23Table%20beer">table beer</a> are of such low alcohol content (1%–4%) that they are served instead of <a href="soft%20drink">soft drink</a>s in some schools.

The alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily "light" beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.

The weakest beers are <a href="dealcoholized%20beer">dealcoholized beer</a>s, which typically have less than 0.05% alcohol (also called "near beer") and <a href="light%20beer">light beer</a>s, which usually have 4% alcohol.
The strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the 20th century. Vetter 33, a 10.5% abv (33 <a href="Plato%20scale">degrees Plato</a>, hence Vetter "33") <a href="doppelbock">doppelbock</a>, was listed in the 1994 "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness pageRank.Book of World Records</a>" as the strongest beer at that time, though <a href="Samichlaus">Samichlaus</a>, by the Swiss brewer Hürlimann, had also been listed by the "Guinness pageRank.Book of World Records" as the strongest at 14% abv. Since then, some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers. <a href="Samuel%20Adams%20%28beer%29">Samuel Adams</a> reached 20% abv with "Millennium", and then surpassed that amount to 25.6% abv with <a href="Utopias%20%28beer%29">Utopias</a>. The strongest beer brewed in Britain was Baz's Super Brew by Parish Brewery, a 23% abv beer. In September 2011, the Scottish brewery <a href="BrewDog">BrewDog</a> produced Ghost Deer, which, at 28%, they claim to be the world's strongest beer produced by fermentation alone.

The product claimed to be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 "Schorschbock 57" with 57,5%. It was preceded by "The End of History", a 55% <a href="Belgian%20ale">Belgian ale</a>, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had previously made "Sink The Bismarck!", a 41% abv <a href="India%20pale%20ale">IPA</a>, and "Tactical Nuclear Penguin", a 32% abv <a href="Imperial%20stout">Imperial stout</a>. Each of these beers are made using the <a href="eisbock">eisbock</a> method of <a href="fractional%20freezing">fractional freezing</a>, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as <a href="Distilled%20beverage">spirits</a> rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbräu's "Schorschbock", a 31% abv eisbock, and <a href="Hair%20of%20the%20Dog%20Brewing%20Company">Hair of the Dog</a>'s "Dave", a 29% abv <a href="barley%20wine">barley wine</a> made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv <a href="beer%20cocktail">blend of beer with whiskey</a> was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a <a href="Brouwerij%20%27t%20Koelschip">Dutch brewery</a> in July 2010.

Draught beer from a pressurised <a href="keg">keg</a> using a lever-style dispenser and a spout is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing <a href="beer%20tap">tap</a> or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. <a href="Nitrogen">Nitrogen</a> produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense <a href="Beer%20head">head</a> and a creamy <a href="mouthfeel">mouthfeel</a>. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called <a href="beer%20ball">beer ball</a>s. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.

In the 1980s, Guinness introduced the <a href="Widget%20%28beer%29">beer widget</a>, a nitrogen-pressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense, tight head, similar to beer served from a nitrogen system. The words "draft" and "draught" can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or <a href="beer%20bottle">bottled</a> beers containing a beer widget, or which are cold-filtered rather than pasteurised.

Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed "<a href="real%20ale">real ale</a>" by the <a href="Campaign%20for%20Real%20Ale">CAMRA</a> organisation. Typically, when a cask arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a "<a href="stillage">stillage</a>" which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between ), before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard <a href="spile">spile</a> or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to "drop" (clear) again, as well as to fully <a href="Brewing%23Conditioning">condition</a> — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being "gravity-fed" directly into the glass.

Draught beer's environmental impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, shows that the CO emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer is estimated to be 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption.

Most beers are cleared of yeast by <a href="filtered%20beer">filtering</a> when packaged in bottles and cans. However, <a href="bottle%20conditioning">bottle conditioned</a> beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with <a href="wheat%20beer">wheat beer</a>s. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.

Many beers are sold in cans, though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries. In Sweden in 2001, 63.9% of beer was sold in cans. People either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass. A technology developed by <a href="Crown%20Holdings">Crown Holdings</a> for the 2010 <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> is the 'full aperture' can, so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process, turning the can into a drinking cup. Cans protect the beer from light (thereby preventing <a href="Skunked%20beer">"skunked"</a> beer) and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles. Cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer, then became commonly associated with less expensive, mass-produced beers, even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles. Plastic (<a href="Polyethylene%20terephthalate">PET</a>) bottles are used by some breweries.

The temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinker's experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing. Most drinkers prefer <a href="pale%20lager">pale lager</a> to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength <a href="pale%20ale">pale ale</a> to be served cool, while a strong <a href="barley%20wine">barley wine</a> or <a href="imperial%20stout">imperial stout</a> to be served at room temperature.

Beer writer <a href="Michael%20Jackson%20%28writer%29">Michael Jackson</a> proposed a five-level scale for serving temperatures: well chilled () for "light" beers (pale lagers); chilled () for <a href="Berliner%20Weisse">Berliner Weisse</a> and other wheat beers; lightly chilled () for all dark lagers, <a href="altbier">altbier</a> and German wheat beers; cellar temperature () for regular British <a href="ale">ale</a>, <a href="stout">stout</a> and most <a href="Belgian%20beer">Belgian specialities</a>; and room temperature () for strong dark ales (especially <a href="trappist%20beer">trappist beer</a>) and <a href="barley%20wine">barley wine</a>.

Drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial <a href="refrigeration">refrigeration</a> and by the 1870s, was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager. Chilling beer makes it more refreshing, though below 15.5 °C the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness and reduces it significantly below . Beer served unchilled—either cool or at room temperature—reveal more of their flavours. <a href="Cask%20Marque">Cask Marque</a>, a non-profit UK beer organisation, has set a temperature standard range of 12°–14 °C (53°–57 °F) for cask ales to be served.

Beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels, such as a glass, a <a href="beer%20stein">beer stein</a>, a mug, a <a href="pewter">pewter</a> <a href="tankard">tankard</a>, a beer bottle or a can; or at <a href="music%20festival">music festival</a>s and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.

The pouring process has an influence on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the <a href="beer%20tap">tap</a> or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of <a href="carbonation">carbonation</a>.
A <a href="beer%20tower">beer tower</a> is a beer dispensing device, usually found in bars and pubs, that consists of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom. Beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel.

Beer contains <a href="ethyl%20alcohol">ethyl alcohol</a>, the same chemical that is present in <a href="wine">wine</a> and <a href="distilled%20spirits">distilled spirits</a> and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or <a href="street%20drugs">street drugs</a>, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a <a href="blood%20alcohol%20concentration">blood alcohol concentration</a> (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible <a href="euphoria">euphoria</a>, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a <a href="Alcohol%20flush%20reaction">flushed, red appearance in the face</a> and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes <a href="lethargy">lethargy</a>, <a href="sedation">sedation</a>, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes <a href="stupor">stupor</a>, unconsciousness, <a href="anterograde%20amnesia">anterograde amnesia</a>, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (<a href="pulmonary%20aspiration">pulmonary aspiration</a>) while unconscious) and <a href="respiratory%20depression">respiratory depression</a> (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a <a href="coma">coma</a> (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal <a href="alcohol%20poisoning">alcohol poisoning</a>. As with all alcoholic drinks, <a href="drinking%20and%20driving">drinking while driving</a>, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.

Alcohol acts as a <a href="Magnesium%20in%20biology">magnesium</a> <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a>, causes a prompt, vigorous increase in the urinary excretion of <a href="Magnesium%20in%20biology">magnesium</a> and other electrolytes.

The main active ingredient of beer is alcohol, and therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to beer. Consumption of small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a "decreased" risk of <a href="cardiac%20disease">cardiac disease</a>, <a href="stroke">stroke</a> and <a href="diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes mellitus</a>. The <a href="long-term%20effects%20of%20alcohol">long term health effects</a> of continuous, moderate or heavy alcohol consumption include the risk of developing <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a> and <a href="alcoholic%20liver%20disease">alcoholic liver disease</a>.

<a href="Alcoholism">Alcoholism</a>, also known as "alcohol use disorder", is a broad term for any drinking of <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a> that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: <a href="alcohol%20abuse">alcohol abuse</a> and <a href="alcohol%20dependence">alcohol dependence</a>. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, <a href="Alcohol%20withdrawal%20syndrome">withdrawal</a> occurs when stopping, and <a href="alcohol%20tolerance">alcohol tolerance</a> has occurred with use. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. A total of 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol.

Beers vary in their nutritional content. <a href="Brewer%27s%20yeast">Brewer's yeast</a> is known to be a rich source of nutrients; therefore, as expected, beer can contain significant amounts of nutrients, including <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="biotin">biotin</a>, <a href="chromium">chromium</a> and <a href="B%20vitamins">B vitamins</a>. Beer is sometimes referred to as "liquid <a href="bread">bread</a>".

It is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a <a href="beer%20belly">beer belly</a>, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between <a href="binge%20drinking">binge drinking</a> and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high <a href="glycemic%20index">glycemic index</a> of 110, the same as <a href="maltose">maltose</a>; however, the maltose in beer undergoes <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.

In many societies, beer is the most popular alcoholic drink. Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending <a href="beer%20festival">beer festival</a>s; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); visiting a <a href="pub%20crawl">series of pubs</a> in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or <a href="rating%20beer">rating beer</a>. <a href="Drinking%20game">Drinking game</a>s, such as <a href="beer%20pong">beer pong</a>, are also popular. A relatively new profession is that of the <a href="beer%20sommelier">beer sommelier</a>, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.

Beer is considered to be a social lubricant in many societies and is <a href="Beer%20consumption%20by%20country">consumed in countries</a> all over the world. There are breweries in Middle Eastern countries such as <a href="Beer%20in%20Syria">Syria</a>, and in some <a href="Beer%20in%20Africa">African countries</a>. Sales of beer are four times those of wine, which is the second most popular alcoholic drink.

A study published in the "Neuropsychopharmacology" journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the <a href="flavour">flavour</a> of beer alone could provoke <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a> activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">positron emission tomography</a> scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a <a href="sports%20drink">sports drink</a> onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a> release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.

Some breweries have developed beers to <a href="Foodpairing">pair with food</a>. Wine writer <a href="Malcolm%20Gluck">Malcolm Gluck</a> disputed the need to pair beer with food, while beer writers Roger Protz and Melissa Cole contested that claim.

Around the world, there are many traditional and ancient starch-based drinks classed as beer. In Africa, there are various ethnic beers made from <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a> or <a href="millet">millet</a>, such as <a href="Oshikundu">Oshikundu</a> in Namibia and <a href="Tella">Tella</a> in Ethiopia. <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> also has a beer made from millet; it is a low alcohol, somewhat porridge-like drink called "Bozo". <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, Nepal, <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a> and <a href="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> also use millet in <a href="Chhaang">Chhaang</a>, a popular semi-fermented rice/millet drink in the eastern <a href="Himalaya">Himalaya</a>s. Further east in China are found <a href="Huangjiu">Huangjiu</a> and <a href="Choujiu">Choujiu</a>—traditional rice-based beverages related to beer.

The <a href="Andes">Andes</a> in South America has <a href="Chicha">Chicha</a>, made from germinated maize (corn); while the <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Brazil">indigenous peoples in Brazil</a> have <a href="Cauim">Cauim</a>, a traditional beverage made since pre-Columbian times by chewing <a href="manioc">manioc</a> so that an enzyme (<a href="amylase">amylase</a>) present in human saliva can break down the starch into fermentable sugars; this is similar to Masato in <a href="Peru">Peru</a>.

Some beers which are made from bread, which is linked to the earliest forms of beer, are <a href="Sahti">Sahti</a> in Finland, <a href="Kvass">Kvass</a> in Russia and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and <a href="Bouza">Bouza</a> in Sudan.

Beer contains the phenolic acids <a href="4-hydroxyphenylacetic%20acid">4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid</a>, <a href="vanillic%20acid">vanillic acid</a>, <a href="caffeic%20acid">caffeic acid</a>, <a href="syringic%20acid">syringic acid</a>, <a href="p-coumaric%20acid">p-coumaric acid</a>, <a href="ferulic%20acid">ferulic acid</a> and <a href="sinapic%20acid">sinapic acid</a>. <a href="Alkaline%20hydrolysis">Alkaline hydrolysis</a> experiments show that most of the phenolic acids are present as bound forms and only a small portion can be detected as free compounds. <a href="Hops">Hops</a>, and beer made with it, contain <a href="8-prenylnaringenin">8-prenylnaringenin</a> which is a potent <a href="phytoestrogen">phytoestrogen</a>. Hop also contains <a href="myrcene">myrcene</a>, <a href="humulene">humulene</a>, <a href="xanthohumol">xanthohumol</a>, <a href="isoxanthohumol">isoxanthohumol</a>, <a href="myrcenol">myrcenol</a>, <a href="linalool">linalool</a>, tannins and <a href="resin">resin</a>. The alcohol <a href="2-Methyl-2-butanol">2M2B</a> is a component of hops brewing.

Barley, in the form of malt, brings the condensed <a href="tannin">tannin</a>s <a href="prodelphinidin%20B3">prodelphinidins B3</a>, <a href="Prodelphinidin%20B9">B9</a> and <a href="Prodelphinidin%20C2">C2</a> into beer. <a href="Tryptophol">Tryptophol</a>, <a href="tyrosol">tyrosol</a> and <a href="phenylethanol">phenylethanol</a> are aromatic higher alcohols found in beer as secondary products of <a href="alcoholic%20fermentation">alcoholic fermentation</a> (products also known as <a href="congener%20%28alcohol%29">congeners</a>) by "<a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a>".

Bit

The bit (a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of binary digit) is a <a href="Units%20of%20information">basic unit</a> of <a href="information">information</a> used in <a href="computing">computing</a> and digital <a href="communication">communication</a>s. A binary digit can have only one of two <a href="value%20%28computer%20science%29">values</a>, and may be physically represented with a two-state device. These state values are most commonly represented as either a .

The two values of a binary digit can also be interpreted as <a href="Truth%20value">logical values</a> (true/false, yes/no), algebraic <a href="signed%20number">signs</a> (+/−), activation states (on/off), or any other two-valued attribute. The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying <a href="Data%20storage%20device">storage</a> or <a href="computing%20device">device</a> is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or <a href="computer%20program">program</a>. The length of a binary number may be referred to as its <a href="bit-length">bit-length</a>.

In <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, one bit is typically defined as the uncertainty of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability, or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known.

In <a href="quantum%20computing">quantum computing</a>, a "quantum bit" or <a href="qubit">qubit</a> is a <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum system</a> that can exist in <a href="quantum%20superposition">superposition</a> of two <a href="classical%20mechanics">classical</a> (i.e., non-quantum) bit values.

The symbol for binary digit is either simply "bit" (recommended by the <a href="IEC%2080000-13">IEC 80000-13:2008</a> standard) or lowercase "b" (recommended by the <a href="IEEE%201541-2002">IEEE 1541-2002</a> standard). A group of eight binary digits is commonly called one <a href="byte">byte</a>, but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined.

As a <a href="unit%20of%20information">unit of information</a> in <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, the bit has alternatively been called a "<a href="shannon%20%28unit%29">shannon</a>", named after <a href="Claude%20Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, the founder of field of information theory. This usage distinguishes the quantity of information from the form of the state variables used to represent it. When the logical values are not equally probable or when a signal is not conveyed perfectly through a communication system, a binary digit in the representation of the information will convey less than one bit of information. However, the shannon unit terminology is uncommon in practice.

The encoding of data by discrete bits was used in the <a href="punched%20card">punched card</a>s invented by <a href="Basile%20Bouchon">Basile Bouchon</a> and <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Falcon">Jean-Baptiste Falcon</a> (1732), developed by <a href="Joseph%20Marie%20Jacquard">Joseph Marie Jacquard</a> (1804), and later adopted by <a href="Semen%20Korsakov">Semen Korsakov</a>, <a href="Charles%20Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>, <a href="Hermann%20Hollerith">Hermann Hollerith</a>, and early computer manufacturers like <a href="IBM">IBM</a>. Another variant of that idea was the perforated <a href="paper%20tape">paper tape</a>. In all those systems, the medium (card or tape) conceptually carried an array of hole positions; each position could be either punched through or not, thus carrying one bit of information. The encoding of text by bits was also used in <a href="Morse%20code">Morse code</a> (1844) and early digital communications machines such as <a href="teletype">teletype</a>s and <a href="stock%20ticker%20machine">stock ticker machine</a>s (1870).

<a href="Ralph%20Hartley">Ralph Hartley</a> suggested the use of a logarithmic measure of information in 1928. <a href="Claude%20E.%20Shannon">Claude E. Shannon</a> first used the word bit in his seminal 1948 paper "<a href="A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication">A Mathematical Theory of Communication</a>".
He attributed its origin to <a href="John%20W.%20Tukey">John W. Tukey</a>, who had written a Bell Labs memo on 9 January 1947 in which he contracted "binary information digit" to simply "bit". Interestingly, <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a> had written in 1936 of "bits of information" that could be stored on the <a href="punched%20card">punched card</a>s used in the mechanical computers of that time. The first programmable computer, built by <a href="Konrad%20Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a>, used binary notation for numbers.

A bit can be stored by a digital device or other physical system that exists in either of two possible distinct <a href="state%20%28computer%20science%29">states</a>. These may be the two stable states of a <a href="Flip-flop%20%28electronics%29">flip-flop</a>, two positions of an <a href="Switch">electrical switch</a>, two distinct <a href="voltage">voltage</a> or <a href="electric%20current">current</a> levels allowed by a <a href="electrical%20circuit">circuit</a>, two distinct levels of <a href="Irradiance">light intensity</a>, two directions of <a href="magnetism">magnetization</a> or <a href="electrical%20polarity">polarization</a>, the orientation of reversible double stranded <a href="DNA">DNA</a>, etc.

Bits can be implemented in several forms. In most modern computing devices, a bit is usually represented by an <a href="Electricity">electrical</a> <a href="voltage">voltage</a> or <a href="Electric%20current">current</a> pulse, or by the electrical state of a <a href="flip-flop%20%28electronics%29">flip-flop circuit</a>.

For devices using <a href="positive%20logic">positive logic</a>, a digit value of 1 (or a logical value of true) is represented by a more positive voltage relative to the representation of 0. The specific voltages are different for different logic families and variations are permitted to allow for component aging and noise immunity. For example, in <a href="transistor%E2%80%93transistor%20logic">transistor–transistor logic</a> (TTL) and compatible circuits, digit values 0 and 1 at the output of a device are represented by no higher than 0.4 volts and no lower than 2.6 volts, respectively; while TTL inputs are specified to recognize 0.8 volts or below as 0 and 2.2 volts or above as 1.

Bits are transmitted one at a time in <a href="serial%20transmission">serial transmission</a>, and by a multiple number of bits in <a href="parallel%20transmission">parallel transmission</a>. A <a href="bitwise%20operation">bitwise operation</a> optionally process bits one at a time. Data transfer rates are usually measured in decimal SI multiples of the unit <a href="bit%20per%20second">bit per second</a> (bit/s), such as kbit/s.

In the earliest non-electronic information processing devices, such as Jacquard's loom or Babbage's <a href="Analytical%20Engine">Analytical Engine</a>, a bit was often stored as the position of a mechanical lever or gear, or the presence or absence of a hole at a specific point of a <a href="Punched%20card">paper card</a> or <a href="Punched%20tape">tape</a>. The first electrical devices for discrete logic (such as <a href="elevator">elevator</a> and <a href="traffic%20light">traffic light</a> control circuits, <a href="telephone%20switches">telephone switches</a>, and Konrad Zuse's computer) represented bits as the states of <a href="electrical%20relay">electrical relay</a>s which could be either "open" or "closed". When relays were replaced by <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s, starting in the 1940s, computer builders experimented with a variety of storage methods, such as pressure pulses traveling down a <a href="mercury%20delay%20line">mercury delay line</a>, charges stored on the inside surface of a <a href="cathode-ray%20tube">cathode-ray tube</a>, or opaque spots printed on <a href="optical%20disc">glass discs</a> by <a href="photolithographic">photolithographic</a> techniques.

In the 1950s and 1960s, these methods were largely supplanted by <a href="magnetic%20storage">magnetic storage</a> devices such as <a href="magnetic%20core%20memory">magnetic core memory</a>, <a href="magnetic%20tape">magnetic tape</a>s, <a href="magnetic%20drum">drum</a>s, and <a href="Disk%20storage">disk</a>s, where a bit was represented by the polarity of <a href="magnetism">magnetization</a> of a certain area of a <a href="ferromagnetic">ferromagnetic</a> film, or by a change in polarity from one direction to the other. The same principle was later used in the <a href="magnetic%20bubble%20memory">magnetic bubble memory</a> developed in the 1980s, and is still found in various <a href="magnetic%20strip">magnetic strip</a> items such as <a href="Rapid%20transit">metro</a> tickets and some <a href="credit%20card">credit card</a>s.

In modern <a href="semiconductor%20memory">semiconductor memory</a>, such as <a href="dynamic%20random-access%20memory">dynamic random-access memory</a>, the two values of a bit may be represented by two levels of <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a> stored in a <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>. In certain types of <a href="programmable%20logic%20array">programmable logic array</a>s and <a href="read-only%20memory">read-only memory</a>, a bit may be represented by the presence or absence of a conducting path at a certain point of a circuit. In <a href="optical%20disc">optical disc</a>s, a bit is encoded as the presence or absence of a microscopic pit on a reflective surface. In one-dimensional <a href="bar%20code">bar code</a>s, bits are encoded as the thickness of alternating black and white lines.

The bit is not defined in the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI). However, the <a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">International Electrotechnical Commission</a> issued standard <a href="IEC%2060027">IEC 60027</a>, which specifies that the symbol for binary digit should be "bit", and this should be used in all multiples, such as "kbit", for kilobit. However, the lower-case letter b is widely used as well and was recommended by the <a href="IEEE%201541-2002">IEEE 1541 Standard (2002)</a>. In contrast, the upper case letter B is the standard and customary symbol for byte.

Multiple bits may be expressed and represented in several ways. For convenience of representing commonly reoccurring groups of bits in information technology, several <a href="units%20of%20information">units of information</a> have traditionally been used. The most common is the unit <a href="byte">byte</a>, coined by <a href="Werner%20Buchholz">Werner Buchholz</a> in June 1956, which historically was used to represent the group of bits used to encode a single <a href="character%20%28computing%29">character</a> of text (until <a href="UTF-8">UTF-8</a> multibyte encoding took over) in a computer and for this reason it was used as the basic <a href="address%20space">addressable</a> element in many <a href="computer%20architecture">computer architecture</a>s. The trend in hardware design converged on the most common implementation of using eight bits per byte, as it is widely used today. However, because of the ambiguity of relying on the underlying hardware design, the unit <a href="Octet%20%28computing%29">octet</a> was defined to explicitly denote a sequence of eight bits.

Computers usually manipulate bits in groups of a fixed size, conventionally named "<a href="Word%20%28computer%20architecture%29">word</a>s". Like the byte, the number of bits in a word also varies with the hardware design, and is typically between 8 and 80 bits, or even more in some specialized computers. In the 21st century, retail personal or server computers have a word size of 32 or 64 bits.

The <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> defines a series of decimal prefixes for multiples of standardized units which are commonly also used with the bit and the byte. The prefixes <a href="kilo-">kilo</a> (10) through <a href="yotta-">yotta</a> (10) increment by multiples of 1000, and the corresponding units are the <a href="kilobit">kilobit</a> (kbit) through the <a href="yottabit">yottabit</a> (Ybit).

When the information "capacity" of a storage system or a communication channel is presented in bits or bits per second, this often refers to binary digits, which is a <a href="computer%20hardware">computer hardware</a> capacity to store binary code (0 or 1, up or down, current or not, etc.). Information "capacity" of a storage system is only an upper bound to the actual "quantity of information" stored therein. If the two possible values of one bit of storage are not equally likely, that bit of storage will contain less than one bit of information. Indeed, if the value is completely predictable, then the reading of that value will provide no information at all (zero entropic bits, because no resolution of uncertainty and therefore no information). If a computer file that uses "n" bits of storage contains only "m" < "n" bits of information, then that information can in principle be encoded in about "m" bits, at least on the average. This principle is the basis of <a href="lossless%20data%20compression">data compression</a> technology. Using an analogy, the hardware binary digits refer to the amount of storage space available (like the number of buckets available to store things), and the information content the filling, which comes in different levels of granularity (fine or coarse, that is, compressed or uncompressed information). When the granularity is finer (when information is more compressed), the same bucket can hold more.

For example, it is estimated that the combined technological capacity of the world to store information provides 1,300 <a href="exabytes">exabytes</a> of hardware digits in 2007. However, when this storage space is filled and the corresponding content is optimally compressed, this only represents 295 <a href="exabytes">exabytes</a> of information. 
When optimally compressed, the resulting carrying capacity approaches <a href="Shannon%20information">Shannon information</a> or <a href="information%20entropy">information entropy</a>.

Certain <a href="bitwise%20operation">bitwise</a> computer <a href="central%20processing%20unit">processor</a> instructions (such as "bit set") operate at the level of manipulating bits rather than manipulating data interpreted as an aggregate of bits.

In the 1980s, when <a href="bitmap">bitmap</a>ped computer displays became popular, some computers provided specialized <a href="bitblt">bit block transfer</a> ("bitblt" or "blit") instructions to set or copy the bits that corresponded to a given rectangular area on the screen.

In most computers and programming languages, when a bit within a group of bits, such as a byte or word, is referred to, it is usually specified by a number from 0 upwards corresponding to its position within the byte or word. However, 0 can refer to either the <a href="most%20significant%20bit">most</a> or <a href="least%20significant%20bit">least significant bit</a> depending on the context.

Other units of information, sometimes used in information theory, include the "<a href="natural%20digit">natural digit</a>" also called a "<a href="nat%20%28unit%29">nat</a>" or "<a href="nit%20%28unit%20of%20information%29">nit</a>" and defined as <a href="logarithm">log</a> "e" (≈ 1.443) bits, where "e" is the <a href="e%20%28mathematical%20constant%29">base of the natural logarithms</a>; and the "<a href="dit%20%28unit%29">dit</a>", "<a href="ban%20%28unit%29">ban</a>", or "<a href="hartley%20%28unit%29">hartley</a>", defined as log 10 (≈ 3.322) bits. This value, slightly less than 10/3, may be understood because 10 = 1000 ≈ 1024 = 2: three decimal digits are slightly less information than ten binary digits, so one decimal digit is slightly less than 10/3 binary digits. Conversely, one bit of information corresponds to about <a href="natural%20logarithm">ln</a> 2 (≈ 0.693) nats, or log 2 (≈ 0.301) hartleys. As with the inverse ratio, this value, approximately 3/10, but slightly more, corresponds to the fact that 2 = 1024 ~ 1000 = 10: ten binary digits are slightly more information than three decimal digits, so one binary digit is slightly more than 3/10 decimal digits. Some authors also define a binit as an arbitrary information unit equivalent to some fixed but unspecified number of bits.

Byte

The byte () is a <a href="units%20of%20information">unit of digital information</a> that most commonly consists of eight <a href="bit">bit</a>s. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single <a href="character%20%28computing%29">character</a> of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest <a href="address%20space">addressable</a> unit of <a href="Computer%20memory">memory</a> in many <a href="computer%20architecture">computer architecture</a>s.
The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size – byte-sizes from 1 to 48 bits are known to have been used in the past. The modern <a href="de%20facto%20standard">"de-facto" standard</a> of eight bits, as documented in <a href="ISO/IEC%202382-1">ISO/IEC 2382-1</a>:1993, is a convenient <a href="power%20of%20two">power of two</a> permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte. The international standard <a href="IEC%2080000-13">IEC 80000-13</a> codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the eight-bit size but for FGPAs programming it may be nine bits or ten

The unit symbol for the byte was designated as the upper-case letter "B" by the <a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">International Electrotechnical Commission</a> (IEC) and <a href="Institute%20of%20Electrical%20and%20Electronics%20Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> (IEEE) in contrast to the bit, whose IEEE symbol is a lower-case "b". Internationally, the unit "<a href="Octet%20%28computing%29">octet</a>", symbol "o", explicitly denotes a sequence of eight bits, eliminating the ambiguity of the byte.

The term "byte" was coined by <a href="Werner%20Buchholz">Werner Buchholz</a> in June 1956, during the early design phase for the <a href="IBM%207030">IBM Stretch</a> computer, which had addressing to the bit and <a href="variable%20field%20length">variable field length</a> (VFL) instructions with a byte size encoded in the instruction.
It is a deliberate respelling of "<a href="bite">bite</a>" to avoid accidental mutation to "bit".

Another origin of "byte" for bit groups smaller than a machine's word size (and in particular groups of <a href="Nibble%20%28computing%29">four bits</a>) is on record by Louis G. Dooley, who claimed he coined the term while working with <a href="Jules%20Schwartz">Jules Schwartz</a> and Dick Beeler on an air defense system called <a href="Experimental%20SAGE%20Subsector">SAGE</a> at <a href="MIT%20Lincoln%20Laboratory">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a> in ca. 1956/1957, which was jointly developed by <a href="Rand%20Corporation">Rand</a>, MIT, and IBM. Later on, Schwartz's language <a href="JOVIAL">JOVIAL</a> actually used the term, but he recalled vaguely that it was derived from <a href="AN/FSQ-31">AN/FSQ-31</a>.

Early computers used a variety of four-bit <a href="binary%20coded%20decimal">binary coded decimal</a> (BCD) representations and the <a href="Sixbit">six-bit</a> codes for printable graphic patterns common in the <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> (<a href="FIELDATA">FIELDATA</a>) and Navy. These representations included alphanumeric characters and special graphical symbols. These sets were expanded in 1963 to seven bits of coding, called the <a href="American%20Standard%20Code%20for%20Information%20Interchange">American Standard Code for Information Interchange</a> (ASCII) as the <a href="Federal%20Information%20Processing%20Standard">Federal Information Processing Standard</a>, which replaced the incompatible teleprinter codes in use by different branches of the U.S. government and universities during the 1960s. ASCII included the distinction of upper- and lowercase alphabets and a set of <a href="control%20character">control character</a>s to facilitate the transmission of written language as well as printing device functions, such as page advance and line feed, and the physical or logical control of data flow over the transmission media. During the early 1960s, while also active in ASCII standardization, IBM simultaneously introduced in its product line of <a href="System/360">System/360</a> the eight-bit <a href="Extended%20Binary%20Coded%20Decimal%20Interchange%20Code">Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code</a> (EBCDIC), an expansion of their <a href="six-bit%20binary-coded%20decimal">six-bit binary-coded decimal</a> (BCDIC) representation used in earlier card punches.
The prominence of the System/360 led to the ubiquitous adoption of the eight-bit storage size, while in detail the EBCDIC and ASCII encoding schemes are different.

In the early 1960s, <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a> introduced <a href="digital%20telephony">digital telephony</a> first on long-distance <a href="trunk%20line">trunk line</a>s. These used the eight-bit <a href="%C2%B5-law%20algorithm">µ-law encoding</a>. This large investment promised to reduce transmission costs for eight-bit data.

The development of <a href="eight-bit">eight-bit</a> <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>s in the 1970s popularized this storage size. Microprocessors such as the <a href="Intel%208008">Intel 8008</a>, the direct predecessor of the <a href="Intel%208080">8080</a> and the <a href="Intel%208086">8086</a>, used in early personal computers, could also perform a small number of operations on the <a href="4bit">four-bit</a> pairs in a byte, such as the decimal-add-adjust (DAA) instruction. A four-bit quantity is often called a <a href="nibble">nibble</a>, also "nybble", which is conveniently represented by a single <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> digit.

The term "<a href="Octet%20%28computing%29">octet</a>" is used to unambiguously specify a size of eight bits. It is used extensively in <a href="Protocol%20%28computing%29">protocol</a> definitions.

Historically, the term "octad" or "octade" was used to denote eight bits as well at least in Western Europe; however, this usage is no longer common. The exact origin of the term is unclear, but it can be found in British, Dutch, and German sources of the 1960s and 1970s, and throughout the documentation of <a href="Philips">Philips</a> mainframe computers.

The unit symbol for the byte is specified in <a href="IEC%2080000-13">IEC 80000-13</a>, <a href="IEEE%201541">IEEE 1541</a> and the Metric Interchange Format as the upper-case character "B". In contrast, IEEE 1541 specifies the lower case character "b" as the symbol for the <a href="bit">bit</a>, however, IEC 80000-13 and Metric-Interchange-Format specify the symbol as "bit", providing disambiguation from B for byte.

In the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Quantities">International System of Quantities</a> (ISQ), B is the symbol of the "<a href="bel%20%28acoustics%29">bel</a>", a unit of logarithmic power ratios named after <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>, creating a conflict with the IEC specification. However, little danger of confusion exists, because the bel is a rarely used unit. It is used primarily in its decadic fraction, the <a href="decibel">decibel</a> (dB), for <a href="signal%20strength">signal strength</a> and <a href="sound%20pressure%20level">sound pressure level</a> measurements, while a unit for one tenth of a byte, the decibyte, and other fractions, are only used in derived units, such as transmission rates.

The lowercase letter o for <a href="Octet%20%28computing%29">octet</a> is defined as the symbol for octet in IEC 80000-13 and is commonly used in languages such as <a href="French%20language">French</a> and <a href="Romanian%20language">Romanian</a>, and is also combined with metric prefixes for multiples, for example ko and Mo.

The usage of the term "octad(e)" for eight bits is no longer common.

Despite standardization efforts, ambiguity still exists in the meanings of the <a href="SI%20prefix">SI (or metric) prefixes</a> used with the unit byte, especially concerning the prefixes "kilo" (k or K), "mega" (M), and "giga" (G). Computer memory has a binary architecture in which multiples are expressed in <a href="power%20of%20two">powers of 2</a>. In some fields of the software and computer hardware industries a <a href="binary%20prefix">binary prefix</a> is used for bytes and bits, while producers of computer storage devices practice adherence to decimal SI multiples. For example, a computer disk drive capacity of 100 gigabytes is specified when the disk contains 100 billion bytes (93 gibibytes) of storage space.

While the numerical difference between the decimal and binary interpretations is relatively small for the prefixes <a href="Kilo-">kilo</a> and <a href="Mega-">mega</a>, it grows to over 20% for prefix <a href="yotta">yotta</a>. The linear-log graph at right illustrates the difference versus storage size up to an <a href="exa">exa</a>byte.

Many <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>s defined the <a href="data%20type">data type</a> "byte".

The <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> and <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a> programming languages define "byte" as an ""addressable unit of data storage large enough to hold any member of the basic character set of the execution environment"" (clause 3.6 of the C standard). The C standard requires that the integral data type "unsigned char" must hold at least 256 different values, and is represented by at least eight bits (clause 5.2.4.2.1). Various implementations of C and C++ reserve 8, 9, 16, 32, or 36 bits for the storage of a byte. In addition, the C and C++ standards require that there are no "gaps" between two bytes. This means every bit in memory is part of a byte.

<a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java's</a> primitive codice_1 data type is always defined as consisting of 8 bits and being a signed data type, holding values from −128 to 127.

.NET programming languages, such as C#, define both an unsigned codice_1 and a signed codice_3, holding values from 0 to 255, and −128 to 127, respectively.

In data transmission systems, the byte is defined as a contiguous sequence of bits in a serial data stream representing the smallest distinguished unit of data. A transmission unit might include start bits, stop bits, or <a href="parity%20bit">parity bit</a>s, and thus could vary from 7 to 12 bits to contain a single 7-bit <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> code.

Boron nitride

Boron nitride is a heat- and chemically resistant <a href="refractory">refractory</a> compound of <a href="boron">boron</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> with the <a href="chemical%20formula">chemical formula</a> BN. It exists in various <a href="Polymorphism%20%28materials%20science%29">crystalline forms</a> that are <a href="isoelectronic">isoelectronic</a> to a similarly structured <a href="carbon">carbon</a> lattice. The <a href="Hexagonal%20crystal%20system">hexagonal form</a> corresponding to <a href="graphite">graphite</a> is the most stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (<a href="Zincblende%20%28crystal%20structure%29%23Zincblende%20structure">sphalerite structure</a>) variety analogous to <a href="diamond">diamond</a> is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare <a href="Wurtzite%20crystal%20structure">wurtzite</a> BN modification is similar to <a href="lonsdaleite">lonsdaleite</a> and may even be harder than the cubic form.

Because of excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure similar to that of <a href="carbon%20nanotube">carbon nanotube</a>s, i.e. <a href="graphene">graphene</a> (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, but the properties are very different.

Boron nitride exists in multiple forms that differ in the arrangement of the boron and nitrogen atoms, giving rise to varying bulk properties of the material.

The amorphous form of boron nitride (a-BN) is non-crystalline, lacking any long-distance regularity in the arrangement of its atoms. It is analogous to <a href="amorphous%20carbon">amorphous carbon</a>.

All other forms of boron nitride are crystalline.

The most stable crystalline form is the hexagonal one, also called h-BN, α-BN, g-BN, and "graphitic boron nitride". Hexagonal boron nitride (point group = D; space group = P6/mmc) has a layered structure similar to graphite. Within each layer, boron and nitrogen atoms are bound by strong <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a>s, whereas the layers are held together by weak <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20force">van der Waals force</a>s. The interlayer "registry" of these sheets differs, however, from the pattern seen for graphite, because the atoms are eclipsed, with boron atoms lying over and above nitrogen atoms. This registry reflects the polarity of the B–N bonds. Still, h-BN and graphite are very close neighbors and even the BCN hybrids have been synthesized where carbon substitutes for some B and N atoms.

Cubic boron nitride has a crystal structure analogous to that of <a href="diamond">diamond</a>. Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate between the two is negligible at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, the same as that of diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN.

The <a href="Wurtzite%20crystal%20structure">wurtzite</a> form of boron nitride (w-BN; point group = C; space group = P6mc) has the same structure as <a href="lonsdaleite">lonsdaleite</a>, a rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon. As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into <a href="tetrahedra">tetrahedra</a>, but in w-BN the angles between neighboring tetrahedra are different. As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into 6-membered rings; in the cubic form all rings are in the <a href="chair%20configuration">chair configuration</a>, in w-BN the rings between 'layers' are in <a href="boat%20configuration">boat configuration</a>.

"Sources: amorphous BN, crystalline BN, graphite, diamond".

The partly <a href="ionic%20bond">ionic</a> structure of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence of color and a large <a href="band%20gap">band gap</a>. Very different bonding – strong covalent within the <a href="basal%20plane">basal plane</a>s (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high <a href="anisotropy">anisotropy</a> of most properties of h-BN.

For example, the hardness, electrical and thermal conductivity are much higher within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, the properties of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous and isotropic.

Those materials are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even higher than that of diamond. Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10 nm is also reported to have <a href="Vickers%20hardness">Vickers hardness</a> comparable or higher than diamond. Because of much better stability to heat and transition metals, c-BN surpasses diamond in mechanical applications, such as machining steel. The thermal conductivity of BN is among the highest of all electric insulators (see table).

Boron nitride can be doped p-type with beryllium and n-type with boron, sulfur, silicon or if co-doped with carbon and nitrogen. Both hexagonal and cubic BN are wide-gap semiconductors with a band-gap energy corresponding to the UV region. If voltage is applied to h-BN or c-BN, then it emits UV light in the range 215–250 nm and therefore can potentially be used as <a href="light-emitting%20diode">light-emitting diode</a>s (LEDs) or lasers.

Little is known on melting behavior of boron nitride. It sublimates at 2973 °C at normal pressure releasing nitrogen gas and boron, but melts at elevated pressure.

Hexagonal and cubic (and probably w-BN) BN show remarkable chemical and thermal stabilities. For example, h-BN is stable to decomposition at temperatures up to 1000 °C in air, 1400 °C in vacuum, and 2800 °C in an inert atmosphere. The reactivity of h-BN and c-BN is relatively similar, and the data for c-BN are summarized in the table below. 

Thermal stability of c-BN can be summarized as follows:

Boron nitride is insoluble in the usual acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as <a href="Lithium%20hydroxide">LiOH</a>, <a href="Potassium%20hydroxide">KOH</a>, <a href="Sodium%20hydroxide">NaOH</a>-<a href="Sodium%20carbonate">NaCO</a>, <a href="Sodium%20nitrate">NaNO</a>, <a href="Lithium%20nitride">LiN</a>, <a href="Magnesium%20nitride">MgN</a>, <a href="Strontium%20nitride">SrN</a>, <a href="Barium%20nitride">BaN</a> or <a href="Lithium%20boron%20nitride">LiBN</a>, which are therefore used to etch BN.

The theoretical thermal conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), which has the same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for <a href="graphene">graphene</a>, and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons. Moreover, the thermal transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic. The thermal conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.

In 2009, a naturally occurring boron nitride mineral in the cubic form (c-BN) was reported in <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>, with a proposed name of "<a href="qingsongite">qingsongite</a>". The substance was found in dispersed <a href="micron">micron</a>-sized inclusions in chromium-rich rocks. In 2013, the International Mineralogical Association affirmed the mineral and the name.

Boron nitride is produced synthetically. Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by the reacting boron trioxide (BO) or boric acid (HBO) with <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> (NH) or <a href="urea">urea</a> (CO(NH)) in a nitrogen atmosphere:

The resulting disordered (<a href="amorphous">amorphous</a>) boron nitride contains 92–95% BN and 5–8% BO. The remaining BO can be evaporated in a second step at temperatures in order to achieve BN concentration >98%. Such annealing also crystallizes BN, the size of the crystallites increasing with the annealing temperature.

h-BN parts can be fabricated inexpensively by hot-pressing with subsequent machining. The parts are made from boron nitride powders adding boron oxide for better compressibility. Thin films of boron nitride can be obtained by <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a> from <a href="boron%20trichloride">boron trichloride</a> and nitrogen precursors. Combustion of boron powder in nitrogen <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> at 5500 °C yields <a href="Ultrafine%20particles">ultrafine</a> boron nitride used for lubricants and <a href="toner">toner</a>s.

Boron nitride reacts with <a href="iodine%20monofluoride">iodine fluoride</a> in <a href="trichlorofluoromethane">trichlorofluoromethane</a> at −30 °C to produce an extremely sensitive <a href="contact%20explosive">contact explosive</a>, NI, in low yield.
Boron nitride reacts with nitrides of alkali metals and lanthanides to form <a href="nitridoborate">nitridoborate</a> compounds. For example:

Similar to graphite, various molecules, such as NH or alkali metals, can be intercalated into hexagonal boron nitride, that is inserted between its layers. Both experiment and theory suggest the intercalation is much more difficult for BN than for graphite.

Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods as that of diamond: Cubic boron nitride is produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as <a href="synthetic%20diamond">synthetic diamond</a> is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18 GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230 °C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of a small amount of boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7 GPa and temperature to 1500 °C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>. The shock wave method is used to produce material called <a href="heterodiamond">heterodiamond</a>, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.

Low-pressure deposition of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, the major problem is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, <a href="boron%20trifluoride">boron trifluoride</a> is used for c-BN. <a href="Ion%20beam%20deposition">Ion beam deposition</a>, <a href="plasma-enhanced%20chemical%20vapor%20deposition">plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition</a>, <a href="pulsed%20laser%20deposition">pulsed laser deposition</a>, <a href="Sputter%20deposition">reactive sputtering</a>, and other <a href="physical%20vapor%20deposition">physical vapor deposition</a> methods are used as well.

Wurtzite BN can be obtained via static high-pressure or dynamic shock methods. The limits of its stability are not well defined. Both c-BN and w-BN are formed by compressing h-BN, but formation of w-BN occurs at much lower temperatures close to 1700 °C.

Whereas the production and consumption figures for the raw materials used for BN synthesis, namely boric acid and boron trioxide, are well known (see <a href="boron">boron</a>), the corresponding numbers for the boron nitride are not listed in statistical reports. An estimate for the 1999 world production is 300 to 350 metric tons. The major producers and consumers of BN are located in the United States, Japan, China and Germany. In 2000, prices varied from about $75/kg to $120/kg for standard industrial-quality h-BN and were about up to $200–$400/kg for high purity BN grades.

Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is the most widely used polymorph. It is a good lubricant at both low and high temperatures (up to 900 °C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in <a href="cosmetics">cosmetics</a>, <a href="paint">paint</a>s, <a href="dental%20cement">dental cement</a>s, and <a href="pencil">pencil</a> leads.

Hexagonal BN was first used in cosmetics around 1940 in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. However, because of its high price, h-BN was soon abandoned for this application. Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes, and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products for <a href="Foundation%20%28cosmetics%29">foundations</a>, <a href="make-up">make-up</a>, <a href="eye%20shadow">eye shadow</a>s, blushers, <a href="eye%20liner">kohl pencils</a>, <a href="lipstick">lipstick</a>s and other skincare products.

Because of its excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. <a href="Bearing%20%28mechanical%29">bearings</a> and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It can also be used as dielectric in resistive random access memories.

Hexagonal BN is used in <a href="Xerography">xerographic process</a> and <a href="laser%20printer">laser printer</a>s as a charge leakage barrier layer of the photo drum. In the automotive industry, h-BN mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing <a href="oxygen%20sensor">oxygen sensor</a>s, which provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow. The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.

Parts can be made by <a href="hot%20pressing">hot pressing</a> from four commercial grades of h-BN. Grade HBN contains a <a href="boron%20trioxide">boron oxide</a> <a href="binder%20%28material%29">binder</a>; it is usable up to 550–850 °C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600 °C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses a <a href="calcium%20borate">calcium borate</a> binder and is usable at 1600 °C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no binder and can be used up to 3000 °C.

<a href="Boron%20nitride%20nanosheet">Boron nitride nanosheet</a>s (h-BN) can be deposited by catalytic decomposition of <a href="borazine">borazine</a> at a temperature ~1100 °C in a <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a> setup, over areas up to about 10 cm. Owing to their hexagonal atomic structure, small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), and high uniformity they are used as substrates for graphene-based devices. BN nanosheets are also excellent <a href="proton%20conductor">proton conductor</a>s. Their high proton transport rate, combined with the high electrical resistance, may lead to applications in <a href="fuel%20cells">fuel cells</a> and <a href="water%20electrolysis">water electrolysis</a>.

h-BN has been used since the mid-2000s as a bullet and bore lubricant in precision target rifle applications as an alternative to <a href="molybdenum%20disulfide">molybdenum disulfide</a> coating, commonly referred to as "moly". It is claimed to increase effective barrel life, increase intervals between bore cleaning, and decrease the deviation in point of impact between clean bore first shots and subsequent shots.

Cubic boron nitride (CBN or c-BN) is widely used as an <a href="abrasive">abrasive</a>. Its usefulness arises from its insolubility in <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, and related <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s at high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides. Polycrystalline c-BN (PCBN) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a passivation layer of boron oxide. Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the <a href="tool%20bit">tool bit</a>s of <a href="cutting%20tool">cutting tool</a>s. For grinding applications, softer binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used. Ceramic binders can be used as well. Commercial products are known under names "<a href="Borazon">Borazon</a>" (by Diamond Innovations), and "Elbor" or "Cubonite" (by Russian vendors). 

Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets can be produced in a simple process (called sintering) of annealing c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature. This ability of c-BN and h-BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.

Similar to diamond, the combination in c-BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for <a href="heat%20spreader">heat spreader</a>s. 

As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically and mechanically, it is one of the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.

Layers of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) are used in some <a href="semiconductor%20device">semiconductor device</a>s, e.g. <a href="MISFET">MISFET</a>s. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of <a href="trichloroborazine">trichloro</a><a href="borazine">borazine</a> with <a href="caesium">caesium</a>, or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high temperatures, c-BN.

<a href="nanomesh">Boron nitride nanomesh</a> is a nanostructured two-dimensional material. It consists of a single BN layer, which forms by <a href="self-assembly">self-assembly</a> a highly regular mesh after high-temperature exposure of a clean <a href="rhodium">rhodium</a> or <a href="ruthenium">ruthenium</a> surface to <a href="borazine">borazine</a> under <a href="ultra-high%20vacuum">ultra-high vacuum</a>. The nanomesh looks like an assembly of hexagonal pores. The distance between two pore centers is 3.2 nm and the pore diameter is ~2 nm. Other terms for this material are boronitrene or white graphene.

The boron nitride nanomesh is not only stable to decomposition under vacuum, air and some liquids, but also up to temperatures of 800 °C. In addition, it shows the extraordinary ability to trap <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s and metallic <a href="cluster%20%28physics%29">clusters</a> which have similar sizes to the nanomesh pores, forming a well-ordered array. These characteristics promise interesting applications of the nanomesh in areas like catalysis, <a href="surface%20functionalisation">surface functionalisation</a>, <a href="spintronics">spintronics</a>, <a href="quantum%20computing">quantum computing</a> and data storage media like <a href="hard%20drive">hard drive</a>s.

Boron nitride nanotubes were predicted in 1994 and experimentally discovered in 1995. They can be imagined as a rolled up sheet of h-boron nitride. Structurally, it is a close analog of the <a href="carbon%20nanotube">carbon nanotube</a>, namely a long cylinder with diameter of several to hundred nanometers and length of many micrometers, except carbon atoms are alternately substituted by nitrogen and boron atoms. However, the properties of BN nanotubes are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a bandgap of ~5.5 eV, basically independent of tube chirality and morphology. In addition, a layered BN structure is much more thermally and chemically stable than a graphitic carbon structure.

Boron nitride aerogel is an <a href="aerogel">aerogel</a> made of highly porous BN. It typically consists of a mixture of deformed BN nanotubes and <a href="Boron%20nitride%20nanosheet">nanosheets</a>. It can have a density as low as 0.6 mg/cm and a specific surface area as high as 1050 m/g, and therefore has potential applications as an <a href="Absorption%20%28chemistry%29">absorbent</a>, catalyst support and gas storage medium. BN aerogels are highly <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> and can absorb up to 160 times their weight in oil. They are resistant to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1200 °C, and hence can be reused after the absorbed oil is burned out by flame. BN aerogels can be prepared by template-assisted <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a> using <a href="borazine">borazine</a> as the feed gas. 

Addition of boron nitride to <a href="silicon%20nitride">silicon nitride</a> ceramics improves the <a href="thermal%20shock">thermal shock</a> resistance of the resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-<a href="alumina">alumina</a> and <a href="titanium%20nitride">titanium nitride</a>-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and <a href="zirconia">zirconia</a>, <a href="borosilicate%20glass">borosilicate glass</a>es, <a href="glass%20ceramic">glass ceramic</a>s, <a href="vitreous%20enamel">enamels</a>, and composite ceramics with <a href="titanium%20boride">titanium boride</a>-boron nitride, titanium boride-<a href="aluminium%20nitride">aluminium nitride</a>-boron nitride, and <a href="silicon%20carbide">silicon carbide</a>-boron nitride composition.

Boron nitride (along with SiN, NbN, and BNC) is reported to show weak <a href="fibrogenic">fibrogenic</a> activity, and to cause <a href="pneumoconiosis">pneumoconiosis</a> when inhaled in particulate form. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10 mg/m for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.

Blood on the Tracks

Blood on the Tracks is the fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, released on January 20, 1975 by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. The album marked Dylan's return to <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> after a two-album stint with <a href="Asylum%20Records">Asylum Records</a>. Dylan commenced recording the album in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in September 1974. In December, shortly before Columbia was due to release the record, Dylan abruptly re-recorded much of the material in a studio in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>. The final album contains five tracks from New York and five from Minneapolis.

"Blood on the Tracks" was initially received with mixed reviews, but has subsequently been acclaimed as one of Dylan's greatest albums by critics and fans. The songs have been linked to tensions in Dylan's personal life, including estrangement from his then-wife <a href="Sara%20Dylan">Sara</a>. One of their children, <a href="Jakob%20Dylan">Jakob Dylan</a>, has described the songs as "my parents talking". The album has been viewed as an outstanding example of the confessional singer-songwriter's craft, and it has been called "the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape". In interviews, Dylan has denied that the songs on the album are autobiographical. In 2003, the album was ranked number 16 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of <a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">the 500 greatest albums of all time</a>, and in 2004, it was placed at number 5 on "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s.

The album reached #1 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> charts and #4 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. The single "<a href="Tangled%20Up%20in%20Blue">Tangled Up in Blue</a>" peaked at #31 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> singles chart. The album remains one of Dylan's best-selling studio releases, with a <a href="platinum%20record">double-platinum</a> US certification by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). In 2015, it was inducted into the <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Grammy Hall of Fame</a>.

At the conclusion of his <a href="Bob%20Dylan%20and%20The%20Band%201974%20Tour">1974 tour with the Band</a>, Dylan began a relationship with a Columbia Records employee, Ellen Bernstein, which Dylan biographer <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a> has described as the beginning of the end of Dylan's marriage to his wife <a href="Sara%20Dylan">Sara</a>. In spring 1974, Dylan was in New York for several weeks while he attended art classes with the painter <a href="Norman%20Raeben">Norman Raeben</a>. Dylan subsequently gave Raeben credit in interviews for transforming his understanding of time, and during the summer of 1974 Dylan began to write a series of songs in a red notebook which utilised his new knowledge: 
Dylan subsequently spent time with Bernstein on his farm in Minnesota and there he completed the 17 songs from which "Blood on the Tracks" was formed—songs which Heylin has described as "perhaps the finest collection of love songs of the twentieth century, songs filled with the full spectrum of emotions a marriage on the rocks can engender".

Prior to recording, Dylan previewed the songs that would constitute "Blood on the Tracks" for a number of friends in the music world, including <a href="David%20Crosby">David Crosby</a>, <a href="Graham%20Nash">Graham Nash</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Stills">Stephen Stills</a>, <a href="Tim%20Drummond">Tim Drummond</a>, and <a href="Peter%20Rowan">Peter Rowan</a>. Nash recalled that Stills disliked Dylan's private performance of his new songs; immediately after Dylan left the room, Stills remarked to Nash, "He's a good songwriter ... but he's no musician."

Initially, Dylan considered recording "Blood on the Tracks" with an electric backing group, and contacted <a href="Mike%20Bloomfield">Mike Bloomfield</a> who had played lead guitar on Dylan's "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>" album. When the two met, Dylan ran through the songs he was planning to record, but he played them too quickly for Bloomfield to learn. Bloomfield later recalled the experience: "They all began to sound the same to me; they were all in the same <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a>; they were all long. It was one of the strangest experiences of my life. He was sort of pissed off that I didn't pick it up." In the end, Dylan rejected the idea of recording the album with a band, and instead substituted stripped-down acoustic arrangements for all of his songs. On August 2, 1974, Dylan signed a contract with <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. After releasing his two previous albums, "<a href="Planet%20Waves">Planet Waves</a>" and "<a href="Before%20the%20Flood%20%28album%29">Before the Flood</a>", on <a href="Asylum%20Records">Asylum Records</a>, Dylan decided his new album would benefit from the commercial muscle of the record label that had made him famous, and his new contract gave him increased control over his own masters.

Dylan commenced recording at <a href="A%20%26amp%3B%20R%20Recording">A & R Recording Studios</a> in New York City on September 16, 1974. Bernstein has stated "the theme of returning ran through the sessions", so "it made a lot of sense to do it at A&R". <a href="A%20%26amp%3B%20R%20Recording">A & R Studios</a> was the former <a href="Columbia%20Recording%20Studio%23Recording%20studios">Columbia Records "Studio A"</a>, where Dylan had recorded six albums in the 1960s. The musicians quickly realized that Dylan was taking a "spontaneous" approach to recording. The session engineer, <a href="Phil%20Ramone">Phil Ramone</a>, later said that Dylan transitioned from one song to another as if they were part of a medley. Ramone noted:
<a href="Eric%20Weissberg">Eric Weissberg</a> and his band, Deliverance, originally recruited as session men, were rejected after two days of recording because they could not keep up with Dylan's pace. Dylan retained <a href="bass%20guitar">bassist</a> Tony Brown from the band, and soon added <a href="organ%20%28instrument%29">organist</a> <a href="Paul%20Griffin%20%28musician%29">Paul Griffin</a> (who had also worked on "Highway 61 Revisited") and <a href="steel%20guitar">steel guitar</a>ist <a href="Buddy%20Cage">Buddy Cage</a>. After ten days and four sessions with the current lineup, Dylan had finished recording and mixing, and, by November, had cut a <a href="acetate%20disc">test pressing</a> on the album. Columbia began to prepare to release the album before Christmas.

Dylan played the test pressing for his brother, David Zimmerman, who persuaded Dylan the album would not sell because the overall sound was too stark. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> also heard the early version of the album and called it "a sellout to the memory of Dylan's pre-electric period". At his brother's urging, Dylan agreed to re-record five of the album's songs in <a href="Sound%2080">Sound 80</a> in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, with backing musicians recruited by David. The new takes were accomplished in two days at the end of December 1974. "Blood on the Tracks" was released into stores on January 20, 1975.

The songs that constitute "Blood on the Tracks" have been described by many Dylan critics as stemming from his personal turmoil at the time, particularly his estrangement from his then-wife <a href="Sara%20Dylan">Sara Dylan</a>. One of Bob and Sara Dylan's children, <a href="Jakob%20Dylan">Jakob Dylan</a>, has said, "When I'm listening to "Blood On The Tracks", that's about my parents."

Dylan has denied this autobiographical interpretation, stating in a 1985 interview with Bill Flanagan, "A lot of people thought that album pertained to me. It didn't pertain to me ... I'm not going to make an album and lean on a marriage relationship." Informed of the album's popularity, Dylan told <a href="Mary%20Travers%20%28singer%29">Mary Travers</a> in a radio interview in April 1975: "A lot of people tell me they enjoy that album. It's hard for me to relate to that. I mean ... people enjoying that type of pain, you know?" Addressing whether the album described his own personal pain, Dylan replied that he didn't write "confessional songs".

According to Rolling Stone Magazine, in Dylan's lyric notebook, the working title of "Simple Twist of Fate" was " 4th Street Affair"; Dylan and Suze Rotolo lived at 161 W. 4th St. The narrator of the song memorizes an affair of ten years ago instead of singing about Dylan's marriage.

In his 2004 memoir, "<a href="Chronicles%2C%20Vol.%201">Chronicles, Vol. 1</a>", Dylan stated that the songs have nothing to do with his own personal life, and that they were inspired by the <a href="List%20of%20short%20stories%20by%20Anton%20Chekhov">short stories</a> of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a>.

Released in early 1975, "Blood on the Tracks" initially received mixed reviews from critics. "Rolling Stone" published two assessments. The first, by Jonathan Cott, called it "Dylan's magnificent new album". The second reviewer, <a href="Jon%20Landau">Jon Landau</a>, wrote that "the record has been made with typical shoddiness." In the "<a href="NME">NME</a>", <a href="Nick%20Kent">Nick Kent</a> described "the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes", while "<a href="Crawdaddy">Crawdaddy</a>" magazine's Jim Cusimano found the instrumentation incompetent.

An influential review of the album was written by Dylan critic <a href="Michael%20Gray%20%28author%29">Michael Gray</a> for the magazine "<a href="Let%20It%20Rock%20%28magazine%29">Let It Rock</a>". Gray argued that it transformed the cultural perception of Dylan, and that he was no longer defined as "the major artist of the sixties. Instead, Dylan has legitimized his claim to a creative prowess as vital now as then—a power not bounded by the one decade he so affected." This view was amplified by <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a>, who wrote: "Ten years after he turned the rock & roll brand of pop into rock ... [Dylan] renewed its legitimacy as a form capable of containing the work of a mature artist." In "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> wrote that although the lyrics occasionally evoke romantic naiveté and bitterness, "Blood on the Tracks" is altogether Dylan's "most mature and assured record".

Since its initial reception, "Blood on the Tracks" has been viewed by critics as one of Dylan's best albums. In <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a>, Wyman wrote: ""Blood on the Tracks" is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years." Bell, in his critical biography of Dylan, wrote that "Blood on the Tracks" was proof that "Dylan had won the argument over his refusal to argue about politics. In this, he began to seem prescient." Bell concluded the album "might well count as one of the best things Dylan ever did". Novelist <a href="Rick%20Moody">Rick Moody</a> called it "the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape".

A result of the acclaim surrounding "Blood on the Tracks" has been that when critics have praised one of Dylan's subsequent albums they have often described it as "his best since "Blood on the Tracks"". According to music journalist <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a>, "Blood on the Tracks" became a benchmark album for Dylan in the years that followed because it was "such a stunning comeback".

The album was also included in the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

Only one of the five New York acetate recordings that were subsequently replaced on the official album has been officially released: "<a href="You%27re%20a%20Big%20Girl%20Now">You're a Big Girl Now</a>", released on 1985's "<a href="Biograph%20%28album%29">Biograph</a>". Although alternate takes of "<a href="Tangled%20Up%20in%20Blue">Tangled Up in Blue</a>", "<a href="Idiot%20Wind">Idiot Wind</a>", and "<a href="If%20You%20See%20Her%2C%20Say%20Hello">If You See Her, Say Hello</a>" from those same sessions were released on "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Volumes%201%E2%80%933%20%28Rare%20%26amp%3B%20Unreleased%29%201961%E2%80%931991">The Bootleg Series, Vol. 1–3</a>", these were not the same takes that were initially slotted for inclusion on the official album. That collection also includes "Call Letter Blues", an outtake/early version of "<a href="Meet%20Me%20in%20the%20Morning">Meet Me in the Morning</a>" with alternate lyrics. "Up to Me", another outtake from these sessions, was also released on 1985's "<a href="Biograph%20%28album%29">Biograph</a>". An alternate take of the song "<a href="Shelter%20From%20the%20Storm">Shelter From the Storm</a>" is featured in the original soundtrack album for "<a href="Jerry%20Maguire">Jerry Maguire</a>" (1996). An alternate take of "<a href="Meet%20Me%20in%20the%20Morning">Meet Me in the Morning</a>" was released on the b-side of the Record Store Day 2012 release of "<a href="Duquesne%20Whistle">Duquesne Whistle</a>." "<a href="Lily%2C%20Rosemary%20and%20the%20Jack%20of%20Hearts">Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts</a>" is the only song from the New York sessions which has not been officially released in any form.

Love and Theft (Bob Dylan album)

"Love And Theft" (generally referred to as Love and Theft) is the thirty-first studio album by American singer-songwriter <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, released on September 11, 2001, by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. It featured backing by his touring band of the time, with keyboardist <a href="Augie%20Meyers">Augie Meyers</a> added for the <a href="recording%20session">sessions</a>. It peaked at #5 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, and has been certified <a href="gold%20album">Gold</a> by the <a href="RIAA">RIAA</a>. A limited edition release included two <a href="bonus%20tracks">bonus tracks</a> on a separate <a href="compact%20disc">disc</a> recorded in the early 1960s, and two years later, on September 16, 2003, this album was one of fifteen Dylan titles reissued and <a href="remastered">remastered</a> for <a href="Super%20Audio%20CD">SACD hybrid</a> playback.

The album continued Dylan's artistic comeback following 1997's "<a href="Time%20Out%20of%20Mind">Time Out of Mind</a>" and was given an even more enthusiastic reception. The title of the album was apparently inspired by historian <a href="Eric%20Lott">Eric Lott</a>'s book "Love & Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class," which was published in 1993. ""Love and Theft" becomes his "<a href="Fables%20of%20the%20Reconstruction">Fables of the Reconstruction</a>", to borrow an <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a> album title", writes Greg Kot in the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" (published September 11, 2001), "the myths, mysteries and folklore of the South as a backdrop for one of the finest <a href="roots%20rock">roots rock</a> albums ever made."

The opening track, "Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum", includes many references to parades in Mardi Gras in New Orleans, where participants are masked, and "determined to go all the way" of the parade route, in spite of being intoxicated. "It rolls in like a storm, drums galloping over the horizon into ear shot, guitar riffs slicing with terse dexterity while a tale about a pair of vagabonds unfolds," writes Kot. "It ends in death, and sets the stage for an album populated by rogues, con men, outcasts, gamblers, gunfighters and desperados, many of them with nothing to lose, some of them out of their minds, all of them quintessentially American.

Offered the song by Dylan, <a href="Sheryl%20Crow">Sheryl Crow</a> later recorded an up-tempo cover of "<a href="Mississippi%20%28Bob%20Dylan%20song%29">Mississippi</a>" for her "<a href="The%20Globe%20Sessions">The Globe Sessions</a>", released in 1998, before Dylan revisited it for "Love and Theft". Subsequently the <a href="Dixie%20Chicks">Dixie Chicks</a> made it a mainstay of their <a href="Top%20of%20the%20World%20Tour">Top of the World</a>, <a href="Vote%20for%20Change">Vote for Change</a>, and <a href="Accidents%20%26amp%3B%20Accusations%20Tour">Accidents & Accusations Tour</a>s.

As music critic <a href="Tim%20Riley%20%28music%20critic%29">Tim Riley</a> notes, "[Dylan's] singing [on "Love and Theft"] shifts artfully between humble and ironic...'I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound,' he sings in 'Floater,' which is either hilarious or horrifying, and probably a little of both."

""Love and Theft" is, as the title implies, a kind of homage," writes Kot, "[and] never more so than on 'High Water (for <a href="Charley%20Patton">Charley Patton</a>),' in which Dylan draws a sweeping portrait of the South's racial history, with the unsung blues singer as a symbol of the region's cultural richness and ingrained social cruelties. Rumbling drums and moaning backing vocals suggest that things are going from bad to worse. 'It's tough out there,' Dylan rasps. 'High water everywhere.' Death and dementia shadow the album, tempered by tenderness and wicked gallows humor."

"'Po Boy', scored for guitar with lounge chord jazz patterns, 'almost sounds as if it could have been recorded around 1920," says Riley. "He leaves you dangling at the end of each bridge, lets the band punctuate the trail of words he's squeezed into his lines, which gives it a reluctant soft-shoe charm."

In a critique, "A missed work of genius", Tony Attwood compares the lyrics of "Honest With Me" with Dylan's 1965 song "<a href="Just%20Like%20Tom%20Thumb%27s%20Blues">Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues</a>", concluding that the former song is "utter brilliance"

The album closes with "Sugar Baby", a lengthy, dirge-like ballad, noted for its evocative, apocalyptic imagery and sparse production drenched in echo. Praising it as "a finale to be proud of", Riley notes that "Sugar Baby" is "built on a disarmingly simple riff that turns foreboding."

This album has been incorrectly cited as being recorded digitally into <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a>. This album was recorded to a Studer A800 mkIII @ 30ips on BASF/Emtec 900 tape at +6/250 nanowebers per meter. Pro Tools was used solely for editing of specific tracks and was thus used very sparingly. Whatever work was done in Pro Tools was flown right back to the masters. It was mixed from the masters to an Ampex ATR-102 1-inch 2-track customized by Mark Spitz at ATR Services.

In an interview conducted by Alan Jackson for "The Times" Magazine in 2001, before the album was released, Dylan said "these so-called connoisseurs of Bob Dylan music... I don't feel they know a thing, or have any inkling of who I am and what I'm about. I know they think they do, and yet it's ludicrous, it's humorous, and sad. That such people have spent so much of their time thinking about who? Me? Get a life, please. It's not something any one person should do about another. You're not serving your own life well. You’re wasting your life."

In a glowing review for his "Consumer Guide" column published by "The Village Voice", Robert Christgau wrote: "If "<a href="Time%20Out%20of%20Mind">Time Out of Mind</a>" was his death album—it wasn't, but you know how people talk—this is his immortality album." Later, when "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" conducted its annual <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> Critics Poll, "Love and Theft" topped the list, the third Dylan album to accomplish this. It also topped "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s list. "<a href="Q%20magazine">Q</a>" listed "Love and Theft" as one of the best 50 albums of 2001. "<a href="Kludge%20%28magazine%29">Kludge</a>" ranked it at number eight on their list of best albums of 2001.

In 2012, the album was ranked #385 on <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>, while "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" magazine pronounced it the second best album of its decade. In 2009, <a href="http%3A//www.glidemagazine.com/">"Glide Magazine"</a> ranked it as the #1 Album of the Decade. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" put it on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "The predictably unpredictable rock poet greeted the new millennium with a folksy, bluesy instant classic."

The album won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Contemporary%20Folk%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album</a> at the <a href="44th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">44th Annual Grammy Awards</a>. It was nominated for Album of the Year and the track "Honest with Me" was nominated for <a href="Best%20Male%20Rock%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Male Rock Vocal Performance</a>.

"Love and Theft" generated controversy when some similarities between the album's lyrics and Japanese writer Junichi Saga's book "<a href="Confessions%20of%20a%20Yakuza">Confessions of a Yakuza</a>" were pointed out. Translated to English by <a href="John%20Bester">John Bester</a>, the book is a biography of one of the last traditional <a href="Yakuza">Yakuza</a> bosses in Japan. In the article published in the "Journal", a line from "Floater" ("I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound") was traced to a line in the book, which said "I'm not as cool or forgiving as I might have sounded." Another line from "Floater" is "My old man, he's like some feudal lord." On the first lines of the book is the line "My old man would sit there like a feudal lord." However, when informed of this, author Saga's reaction was one of having been honored rather than abused from Dylan's use of lines from his work.

The Beverly Hillbillies

The Beverly Hillbillies is an American <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> originally broadcast on <a href="CBS">CBS</a> for nine seasons, from September 26, 1962, to March 23, 1971. The show had an <a href="ensemble%20cast">ensemble cast</a> featuring <a href="Buddy%20Ebsen">Buddy Ebsen</a>, <a href="Irene%20Ryan">Irene Ryan</a>, <a href="Donna%20Douglas">Donna Douglas</a>, and <a href="Max%20Baer%20Jr.">Max Baer Jr.</a> as a poor backwoods family who move to <a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California">Beverly Hills, California</a>, after striking oil on their land. The show was produced by <a href="Filmways">Filmways</a> and was created by writer <a href="Paul%20Henning">Paul Henning</a>. It was followed by two other Henning-inspired country-cousin series on CBS: "<a href="Petticoat%20Junction">Petticoat Junction</a>", and its spin-off "<a href="Green%20Acres">Green Acres</a>", which reversed the rags-to-riches, country-to-city model of "The Beverly Hillbillies".

"The Beverly Hillbillies" ranked among the top 20 most-watched programs on television for eight of its nine seasons, twice ranking as the number one series of the year, with a number of episodes that remain among the most-watched television episodes in history. It accumulated seven Emmy nominations during its run. The series remains in syndication on <a href="MeTV">MeTV</a>, and its ongoing popularity spawned a <a href="The%20Beverly%20Hillbillies%20%28film%29">1993 film remake</a> by <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>.

The series starts as Jed Clampett, an impoverished mountaineer, is living alongside an oil-rich swamp with his daughter and mother-in-law. A surveyor for the OK Oil Company realizes the size of the oil field, and the company pays him a fortune for the right to drill on his land. Patriarch Jed's cousin Pearl Bodine prods him to move to California after being told his modest property could yield $25 million, and pressures him into taking her son Jethro along. The family moves into a mansion in wealthy Beverly Hills, California, next door to Jed's banker, Milburn Drysdale. The Clampetts bring a moral, unsophisticated, and minimalistic lifestyle to the swanky, sometimes self-obsessed and superficial community. <a href="Double%20entendre">Double entendre</a>s and cultural misconceptions are the core of the sitcom's humor. Plots often involve the outlandish efforts Drysdale makes to keep the Clampetts in Beverly Hills and their money in his bank. The family's periodic attempts to return to the mountains are often prompted by Granny's perceiving a slight from one of the "city folk".


Although he had received little formal education, Jed Clampett (<a href="Buddy%20Ebsen">Buddy Ebsen</a>) has a good deal of common sense. Jed is the son of Luke Clampett and his wife, and has a sister called Myrtle. A principal character of the show, Jed is a good-natured man; he is the apparent head of the family. Jed's wife (Elly May's mother) died, but is referred to in the episode "Duke Steals A Wife" as Rose Ellen. Jed is shown to be an expert marksman and is extremely loyal to his family and kinfolk. The huge oil pool in the swamp he owned was the beginning of his rags-to-riches journey to Beverly Hills. Although he longs for the old ways back in the hills, he makes the best of being in Beverly Hills. Whenever he has anything on his mind, he sits on the curbstone of his mansion and whittles until he comes up with the answer. His <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a> is, "Welllllll, doggies!" Jed was one of the three characters to appear in all 274 episodes of the series.

Daisy May Moses (<a href="Irene%20Ryan">Irene Ryan</a>), called "Granny" by all (relatives or not) is Jed's shotgun-toting mother-in-law and a true daughter of <a href="Dixie">Dixie</a>. Paul Henning, the show's creator/producer, quickly disposed of the idea of Granny being Jed's mother, which would have changed the show's dynamics, making Granny the matriarch and Jed subordinate to her. Granny can be aggressive, but is often overruled by Jed. She is a <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> to the core, defending President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, the <a href="Flags%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Stars and Bars</a>, and the simple life. Short-fused and easily angered, Granny fancies herself a <a href="Baptist%20church">Baptist</a> ("<a href="immersion%20baptism">dunked</a>, not <a href="aspersion">sprinkled</a>") Christian with forgiveness in her heart. She abhors "revenuers" and blue-coat Yankees. A self-styled "M.D." — "mountain doctor" — she claims to have an edge over expensive know-nothing city physicians. In lieu of conventional anesthesia, Granny uses her "<a href="moonshine">white lightning</a>" brew before commencing on painful treatments such as <a href="leech">leech</a> bleeding and yanking teeth with pliers.

Short and scrappy, Granny often wields a double-barreled, 12-gauge <a href="shotgun">shotgun</a> and fires it numerous times during the run of the show (in a first-season episode, she chases Milburn Drysdale with it when she finds out his mother's family had a feud with her family back in the hills). She fires it once at the front lawn when Jed is witching for water and several times on the skeet-shooting range. During the mock Indian invasion, she believed she was shooting live shells, though Milburn Drysdale had removed the buckshot to protect the actors portraying the Indians. She fires rock salt and bacon rind at a crow during the "Happy Valley" episode, and again at the back of an armored truck in which Milburn Drysdale was taking refuge. She fires at (and hits in the posterior) Milburn Drysdale with rock salt, believing he is the ghost of "Lady Clemintine" ending their second visit to "Clampett Castle" in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, England, which was filmed at <a href="Penshurst%20Place">Penshurst Place</a>.

Granny also fires "Lady Fingers" (which Elly had baked for Jethro to take to the Army Reserve) into the posterior of an actor portraying Gen. Ulysses S. Grant during "The Battle of Culpepper Plantation".

She is also able to tell the precise time by a sundial and the weather by a beetle ("Granny Versus the Weather Bureau"). Without her glasses, Granny is extremely nearsighted—once in a crossover with the "Petticoat Junction" show, Granny mistakes a dog for a baby child and a coffee pot for a telephone. Two of Granny's phobias are "Injuns" (she actually buys wigs so the Clampetts will not be "scalped") and the "cement pond" (swimming pool—she has a fear of water). In a long <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> in season nine, Elly May dates a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> <a href="frogman">frogman</a>, which confuses Granny: After seeing the frogman climb out of the pool in his skin-diving wear, she thinks that anyone who swims in the pool will be turned into a frog. She also has a peculiar way of retelling the <a href="War%20Between%20the%20States">War Between the States</a>, in which she thinks the South has won and <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> is the president, while calling <a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">Sherman's March</a> "Sherman's Retreat to the Sea". She even set Jethro straight on the subject of slavery: "We fought a war to make the Yankees stop that foolishness!" Any attempts to correct her meet with failure. She is also known for slicing off switches to use on Jethro, mainly whenever he goes too far with his idiotic schemes.

References are given to Granny growing up in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. From episode 9: "When I was a girl back in Tennessee, I set so many boys' hearts on fire that they took to calling that neck of the woods 'The Smoky Mountains'." In season 9, episode 23, she says she is from <a href="Limestone%2C%20Tennessee">Limestone, Tennessee</a>. Likewise in a <a href="Flatt%20and%20Scruggs">Flatt and Scruggs</a> guest episode, her favorite song is "My Little Girl of Tennessee".

Granny's full name, Daisy Moses, is allegedly an homage to the popular and dearly loved folk artist <a href="Anna%20Mary%20Robertson">Anna Mary Robertson</a>, known to the world as <a href="Grandma%20Moses">Grandma Moses</a>, who died in 1961, a year before "The Beverly Hillbillies" made its television debut. Granny is frequently referred to as "Granny Clampett" in a number of episodes, but technically she is a Moses. Granny appears in all 274 episodes.

Elly May (<a href="Donna%20Douglas">Donna Douglas</a> in all 274 episodes), the only child of Jed and Rose Ellen Clampett, is a mountain beauty with the body of a <a href="Pin-up%20girl">pinup girl</a> and the soul of a <a href="tomboy">tomboy</a>. She can throw a <a href="fastball">fastball</a> as well as "<a href="wrestling">rassle</a>" most men to a fall, and she can be as tender with her friends, animals, and family as she is tough with anyone she rassles. She said once that animals could be better companions than people, but as she grew older, she saw that, "fellas kin be more fun than critters." Elly is about by eager young <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> actors with stage names such as "Dash Riprock" and "Bolt Upright". Other boyfriends for Elly include Sonny Drysdale, Beau Short, accountant Fred Penrod, beatnik Sheldon Epps, and Mark Templeton, a Navy frogman.

Elly's most notable weakness, often mentioned when she is being "courted", is her total lack of kitchen skills. Family members cringe when, for plot reasons, Elly takes over the kitchen. Rock-like donuts and cookies, for example, are a plot function in an episode featuring <a href="Wally%20Cox">Wally Cox</a> as bird-watching Professor Biddle. On one of the family's visits back to the hills, a miller bought a cake at a fair, baked by Elly May, because he needed a new grindstone for his flour mill.

Elly is briefly considered for film stardom at the movie studio owned by Jed. In one episode, hearing <a href="Rock%20Hudson">Rock Hudson</a> and <a href="Cary%20Grant">Cary Grant</a> are both single, Granny asks that Elly be introduced to them.

During the final season, Elly May takes a job as a secretary at the Commerce Bank after Jed and Granny persuade her that it would be a good way to "meet a husband".

In addition to the family dog, Duke (an old <a href="Bloodhound">Bloodhound</a>), a number of animals lived on the Clampett estate thanks to animal-lover Elly. These animals were collectively known as her "critters". The most prominent pets were <a href="chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>s, but other animals (from typical dogs and cats to less-traditional house pets, such as deer, opossums, bobcats, bears, goats, raccoons, and kangaroos) were also occasionally featured.

In the 1981 TV movie of "The Beverly Hillbillies", Elly May is head of a zoo.

Jethro (<a href="Max%20Baer%20Jr.">Max Baer Jr.</a> in 272 episodes) is the son of Jed's cousin, Pearl Bodine (though he addresses Jed as "Uncle Jed"). He drove the Clampett family to their new home in California and stayed on with them to further his education. The whole family boasts of Jethro's "sixth-grade education", but nevertheless feels he is a bit of an idiot. Jethro is simply naive in the first season of the show, but becomes incredibly ignorant and pompous as the series progresses. He often shows off his cyphering abilities with multiplication and "goes-in-tas", as in "five goesinta five one time, five goesinta ten two times", etc. He was in the fifth grade when the show began, and in the second season he graduated from the sixth grade. He claims he was "highest in his class" (because he was so much taller than the other students). In a later episode, he decides to go to college. He manages to enroll late in the semester at a local secretarial school due to his financial backing and earns his diploma by the end of the day because he did not understand what was going on in class and was too disruptive. This was an ironic <a href="in-joke">in-joke</a> – in real life, Max Baer Jr. has a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Business%20Administration">bachelor's degree in business administration</a>, minoring in <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, from <a href="Santa%20Clara%20University">Santa Clara University</a>.

Many stories in the series involve Jethro's endless career search, which include such diverse vocations as a millwright, a <a href="neurosurgeon">brain surgeon</a>, street car conductor, <a href="James%20Bond">double-naught spy</a>, telephone lineman, <a href="soda%20jerk">soda jerk</a>, <a href="chauffeur">chauffeur</a>, short-order cook, sculptor, restaurant owner (with Granny's cooking), psychiatrist, and once as a <a href="bookkeeper">bookkeeper</a> for Milburn Drysdale's bank; a <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> agent for "cousin" Bessie and "Cousin Roy": (see below); Hollywood producer (a studio flunky remarks Jethro has the "right qualifications" for being a <a href="Film%20producer">producer</a>: a sixth-grade education and an uncle who owns the studio; this in-joke gag as a movie producer was replayed in the 1981 movie). More often than not, his overall goal in these endeavors is to obtain as many pretty girls as humanly possible. A <a href="running%20gag">running gag</a> is that as usual Jethro fails catching girls – for example, a girl he had known from the hills became a successful actress, yet when she tries to talk to Jethro, he always hangs up on her. The nearest Jethro ever succeeded at "anything" was when he was sworn in as member of the "Woodchucks" (a parody of <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a>) where out of 94 merit badges he did earn one-for lifesaving; not understanding what a <a href="ant%20farm">ant farm</a> is, Jethro tried to set up 10,000 ants amid toy farm buildings by the "cement pond" – the only result is that Miss Hathaway's female birdwatching society, Jethro, Jed Clampett and the Woodchuck scout ended up being almost overrun by the ants and they all had to dive into the pool to get rid of the unwelcome insects. Another storyline had Lester Flatt's wife auditioning for an actress screen test with Jethro as a "director" in which Mrs. Flatt "actually" passed! Unfortunately for Jethro, Mrs. Flatt decides to give up a Hollywood career, however Jethro decides to have another screen test candidate–who is none other than Miss Jane Hathaway–who actually "accepts" Jethro's idiotic proposal.

Of all the Clampett clan, he is the one who makes the most change from "country bumpkin" to "city boy". Another running gag is that Jethro is known as the "six-foot stomach" for his ability to eat: in one episode, he eats a jetliner's entire supply of steaks; in another, Jethro tries to set himself up as a Hollywood agent for cousin "Bessie" the chimpanzee – with a fee of 10,000 bananas for Bessie and 1,000 bananas for Jethro. At one time, Jed mentions Jethro was the only baby he knew born with a full set of teeth "just like a beaver". Jethro does not appear in the third- or second-to-last episodes, but Baer remains billed in the title credits.

With the January 2015 death of co-star Donna Douglas, Baer is the only surviving cast member.

Milburn (<a href="Raymond%20Bailey">Raymond Bailey</a> in 247 episodes), Margaret (<a href="Harriet%20E.%20MacGibbon">Harriet E. MacGibbon</a>; 55 episodes in 1962–69), and Sonny (<a href="Louis%20Nye">Louis Nye</a>): The Drysdales are the Clampetts' next-door neighbors. Milburn is the Commerce Bank's tightwad president and the friendly bumpkins' confidant. The haughty Mrs. Drysdale boasts of a heritage that traces back to the <a href="Mayflower%20%28ship%29">"Mayflower"</a>, but Milburn's concerns are strictly monetary. When suffering an anxiety attack, Milburn sniffs a stack of money and is quickly revived. Another time, Miss Hathaway discovered that whenever Jed Clampett took money out of his pocket, Drysdale's blood pressure would either go up or down depending on whether Jed was going to spend the money or not. Whenever Drysdale gets a taste of Granny's "Tennessee Tranquilizer" (<a href="moonshine">moonshine</a>), his face turns red. In the interest of keeping the Clampetts' account at all costs, Mr. Drysdale is prone to appease them, and says that anything they do is unquestionably right. He often forces others, especially his secretary, to placate the Clampetts by granting their unorthodox requests. A running gag is that Drysdale–as President of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills–is in a feud with a rival bank President (of the Merchant Bank of Beverly Hills) as to "who" will have custody of Jed Clampett's millions. In one hilarious storyline Drysdale actually dressed himself as a "gorilla" in order to fake a "sale" of the "gorilla" to the Clampetts–only to be "sold" to the Clampetts for $10,000!

Although wife Margaret, a blue-blooded <a href="Boston">Boston</a>ian, has obvious disdain for the "peasant" and "dreadful" hillbillies, she tacitly agrees to tolerate them (rather than Milburn lose their ever-growing account—which is $96,000,000 in 1969, equal to $ today). Margaret loathes all four "vagabonds", but her most heated rivalry is with Granny, with whom she occasionally has some "scraps". Margaret's aged father has gambled away most of their money. Mrs. Drysdale's son—and Milburn's stepson—is Sonny (played by <a href="Louis%20Nye">Louis Nye</a>), who is introduced as a 35-year-old collegian who does not believe in working up a sweat and is an insufferable <a href="mama%27s%20boy">mama's boy</a>. Finding Elly May a lovely, naive <a href="Pollyanna">Pollyanna</a>, he courts her until she literally tosses him. Sonny only appears in four episodes, three in 1962 and a final appearance in 1966.

Jane Hathaway (<a href="Nancy%20Kulp">Nancy Kulp</a> in 246 episodes), whom the Clampetts address as "Miss Jane", is Drysdale's loyal and efficient secretarial assistant. Though she always carries out his wishes, she is inherently decent and is frequently put off by her boss's greed. When she is annoyed with him, as is often the case, especially when one of Drysdale's schemes goes too far, she usually and forcefully says, "Chief!" Jane is genuinely fond of the family (to the Clampetts, she is considered family; even Granny, the one most dead-set against living in California, likes her very much); Jane actually harbors something of a crush on Jethro for most of the series' run. At first, she mistakes the Clampetts as servants until Drysdale told her who they really are (which almost costs her her job).

Miss Hathaway frequently has to "rescue" Drysdale from his idiotic schemes, receiving little or no thanks for her efforts. In one episode, Granny and she, disguised as "<a href="Geisha%23%26quot%3BGeisha%20girls%26quot%3B">geisha girl</a>s", finally have enough and "crown" Drysdale and Jethro, who have made one too many comments about women serving men. Jane is loyal to Drysdale, as well, despite her misgivings toward his avarice and greed. In one episode, the Clampetts, feeling money has corrupted them, give all of their money to Virginia "Ginny" Jennings (<a href="Sheila%20Kuehl">Sheila Kuehl</a>), a college student. While Drysdale moans the loss of the money, Jane immediately tells him to stop thinking about the Clampetts and start trying to get the Jennings account. Eventually, everyone discovered Jennings' real motives, and she was gone, with the Clampetts getting their money back, and things were as they were before. In one episode, it is established that Miss Jane sacrificed her job as the top secretary of the top executive of the top insurance company to join Mr. Drysdale at the Commerce Bank. Miss Jane was a <a href="Vassar%20College">Vassar</a> graduate. In 1999, "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" ranked Jane Hathaway number 38 on its "50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time" list.


The show's <a href="theme%20music">theme song</a>, "The Ballad of Jed Clampett", was written by producer and writer Paul Henning and originally performed by <a href="Bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a> artists <a href="Foggy%20Mountain%20Boys">Flatt and Scruggs</a>. The song is sung by Jerry Scoggins (backed by Flatt and Scruggs) over the opening and end credits of each episode. Flatt and Scruggs subsequently cut their own version of the theme (with Flatt singing) for <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>; released as a single, it reached number 44 on <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> pop music chart and number one on the <a href="Hot%20Country%20Songs">"Billboard" Hot Country</a> chart (the lone country chart-topper for the duo).

The six main cast members participated on a 1963 Columbia soundtrack album, which featured original song numbers in character. Additionally, Ebsen, Ryan, and Douglas each made a few solo recordings following the show's success, including Ryan's 1966 novelty single, "Granny's Miniskirt".

The series generally features no <a href="country%20music">country music</a> beyond the bluegrass banjo theme song, although country star Roy Clark and the team of Flatt and Scruggs occasionally play on the program. Pop singer <a href="Pat%20Boone">Pat Boone</a> appears in one episode as himself, under the premise that he hails from the same area of the country as the Clampetts, although Boone is a native of <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>.

The 1989 film "<a href="UHF%20%28film%29">UHF</a>" featured a <a href="%26quot%3BWeird%20Al%26quot%3B%20Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> parody music video, "<a href="Money%20for%20Nothing/Beverly%20Hillbillies%2A">Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*</a>", combining "<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20Jed%20Clampett">The Ballad of Jed Clampett</a>" and English rock band <a href="Dire%20Straits">Dire Straits</a>' 1985 hit song "<a href="Money%20for%20Nothing%20%28song%29">Money for Nothing</a>".

Season seven (1968–69) was packed with strategically placed, multi-episode crossover stories in which the fictional worlds of all three Paul Henning series overlap. The Clampett family makes several trips to Hooterville, Sam Drucker visits Beverly Hills, and Granny (Irene Ryan) does two guest appearances on "Petticoat Junction". In season eight (1969–70), the Clampett family visits Hooterville one last time for a two-part episode.


"The Beverly Hillbillies" received poor reviews from some contemporary critics. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called the show "strained and unfunny"; "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" called it "painful to sit through". Film professor <a href="Janet%20Staiger">Janet Staiger</a> writes that "the problem for these reviewers was that the show confronted the cultural elite's notions of quality entertainment." The show did receive a somewhat favorable review from noted critic <a href="Gilbert%20Seldes">Gilbert Seldes</a> in the December 15, 1962 "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>": "The whole notion on which "The Beverly Hillbillies" is founded is an encouragement to ignorance... But it "is" funny. What can I do?" 

Regardless of the poor reviews, the show shot to the top of the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> shortly after its premiere and stayed there for several seasons. During its first two seasons, it was the number one program in the U.S. During its second season, it earned some of the highest ratings ever recorded for a half-hour sitcom. The season-two episode "The Giant Jackrabbit" also became the most watched telecast up to the time of its airing, and remains the <a href="List%20of%20most%20watched%20television%20broadcasts%23Top%2045%20network%20primetime%20telecasts%20of%20all%20time%20%281964-Present%29">most-watched half-hour episode of a sitcom</a>, as well. The series enjoyed excellent ratings throughout its run, although it had fallen out of the top 20 most-watched shows during its final season.

In 1997, the season 3 episode "Hedda Hopper's Hollywood" was ranked Number 62 on "<a href="TV%20Guide%27s%20100%20Greatest%20Episodes%20of%20All%20Time">TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time</a>".

Season nine, during the 1970–71 TV season placed 33rd out of 96 shows. Despite the respectable ratings, the show was canceled in the spring of 1971 after 274 episodes. The CBS network, prompted by pressure from <a href="advertising">advertisers</a> seeking a more sophisticated <a href="urban%20culture">urban</a> audience, decided to refocus its schedule on several "hip" new urban-themed shows and, to make room for them, all of CBS's rural-themed comedies were simultaneously cancelled. This action came to be known as "the <a href="Rural%20purge">Rural Purge</a>". <a href="Pat%20Buttram">Pat Buttram</a>, who played Mr. Haney on <a href="Green%20Acres">Green Acres</a>, famously remarked, "It was the year CBS cancelled everything with a tree - including Lassie."

In 1981, "<a href="Return%20of%20the%20Beverly%20Hillbillies">Return of the Beverly Hillbillies</a>" television movie, written and produced by series creator Henning, was aired on the CBS network. Irene Ryan had died in 1973, and Raymond Bailey had died in 1980. The script acknowledged Granny's passing, but featured <a href="Imogene%20Coca">Imogene Coca</a> as Granny's mother. Max Baer decided against reprising the role that both started and stymied his career, so the character of Jethro Bodine was given to another actor, <a href="Ray%20Young%20%28actor%29">Ray Young</a>.

The film's plot had Jed back in his old homestead in Bug Tussle, having divided his massive fortune among Elly May and Jethro, both of whom stayed on the West Coast. Jane Hathaway had become a Department of Energy agent and was seeking Granny's "White Lightnin'" recipe to combat the <a href="1979%20energy%20crisis">energy crisis</a>. Since Granny had gone on to "her re-ward", it was up to Granny's centenarian "Maw" (<a href="Imogene%20Coca">Imogene Coca</a>) to divulge the secret brew's ingredients. Subplots included Jethro playing an egocentric, starlet-starved Hollywood producer, Jane and her boss (<a href="Werner%20Klemperer">Werner Klemperer</a>) having a romance, and Elly May owning a large petting zoo. The four main characters finally got together by the end of the story.

Having been filmed a mere decade after the final episode of the original series, viewer consensus was that the series' original spirit was lost to the film on many fronts, chief of which being the deaths of Ryan and Bailey and Baer's absence, which left only three of the six original cast members available to reprise their respective roles. Further subtracting from the familiarity was the fact that the legendary Clampett mansion was unavailable for a location shoot as the owners' lease was too expensive. Henning himself admitted sheer embarrassment when the finished product aired, blaming his inability to rewrite the script due to the 1981 <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild</a> strike.

In 1993, Ebsen, Douglas, and Baer reunited onscreen for the only time in the <a href="CBS-TV">CBS-TV</a> retrospective television special, "The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies", which ranked as the fourth-most watched television program of the week—a major surprise given the mediocre rating for the 1981 TV movie. It was a rare tribute from the "Tiffany network", which owed much of its success in the 1960s to the series, but has often seemed embarrassed by it in hindsight, often down-playing the show in retrospective television specials on the network's history and rarely inviting cast members to participate in such all-star broadcasts.

"The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies" special ignored several plot twists of the TV movie, notably Jethro was now not a film director, but a leading Los Angeles physician. Critter-loving Elly May was still in California with her animals, but Jed was back home in the Hills, having lost his fortune, stolen by the now-imprisoned banker Drysdale. Nancy Kulp had died in 1991 and was little referred to beyond the multitude of film clips that dotted the special. The special was released on VHS tape by <a href="CBS/Fox%20Video">CBS/Fox Video</a> in 1995 and as a bonus feature on the Official Third Season DVD Set in 2009.

"The Beverly Hillbillies" is still televised daily around the world in syndication. In the United States, the show is broadcast currently on <a href="MeTV">MeTV</a>, <a href="Retro%20Television%20Network">Retro TV</a>, <a href="MyFamily%20TV">MyFamily TV</a>, and was previously on <a href="Nick%20at%20Nite">Nick at Nite</a>, <a href="The%20Hallmark%20Channel">The Hallmark Channel</a>, and <a href="WGN%20America">WGN America</a>. A limited number of episodes from the earlier portions of the series run have turned up in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a> and as such are seen occasionally on many smaller networks.

<a href="MeTV">MeTV</a> Network airs The Beverly Hillbillies weekdays at 7am.

The show is distributed by <a href="CBS%20Television%20Distribution">CBS Television Distribution</a>, the syndication arm of <a href="CBS%20Television%20Studios">CBS Television Studios</a> and the CBS network. It was previously distributed by CBS Films, <a href="Viacom%20Enterprises">Viacom Enterprises</a>, <a href="Paramount%20Domestic%20Television">Paramount Domestic Television</a>, and <a href="CBS%20Paramount%20Domestic%20Television">CBS Paramount Domestic Television</a> (all through corporate changes involving TV distribution rights to the early CBS library). The repeats of the show that debuted on <a href="Columbia%20Broadcasting%20System">CBS Daytime</a> on September 5–9, 1966, as "Mornin' Beverly Hillbillies" through September 10, 1971 and on September 13–17, 1971 as "The Beverly Hillbillies" lasted up to winter 1971–72. It aired at 11:00–11:30 am Eastern/10:00-10:30 am Central through September 3, 1971, then moved to 10:30–11:00 am Eastern/9:30–10:00 am Central for the last season on CBS Daytime.

Fifty-five episodes of the series are in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a> (all 36 season-one episodes and 19 season-two episodes), because <a href="Orion%20Television">Orion Television</a>, successor to Filmways, neglected to renew their copyrights. As a result, these episodes have been released on home video and DVD on many low-budget labels and shown on low-power television stations and low-budget networks in prints. In many video prints of the public domain episodes, the original theme music has been replaced by generic music due to copyright issues.

Before his death, Paul Henning, whose estate now holds the original film elements to the public domain episodes, authorized <a href="MPI%20Home%20Video">MPI Home Video</a> to release the best of the first two seasons on DVD, the first "ultimate collection" of which was released in the fall of 2005. These collections include the original, uncut versions of the first season's episodes, complete with their original theme music and opening sponsor plugs. Volume 1 has, among its bonus features, the alternate, unaired version of the pilot film, "The Hillbillies Of Beverly Hills" (the version of the episode that sold the series to CBS), and the "cast commercials" (cast members pitching the products of the show's sponsors) originally shown at the end of each episode.

With the exception of the public domain episodes, the copyrights to the series were renewed by Orion Television. However, any new compilation of "Hillbillies" material will be copyrighted by either MPI Media Group or CBS, depending on the content of the material used.

For many years, <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20Home%20Entertainment">20th Century Fox</a>, through a joint venture with CBS called <a href="CBS/Fox%20Video">CBS/Fox Video</a>, released select episodes of "Hillbillies" on videocassette. After <a href="Viacom">Viacom</a> merged with CBS, <a href="Paramount%20home%20entertainment">Paramount Home Entertainment</a> (the video division of Paramount Pictures, which was acquired by Viacom in 1994) took over the video rights.

In 2006, Paramount announced plans to release the copyrighted episodes in boxed sets through <a href="CBS%20Home%20Entertainment">CBS DVD</a> later that year. The show's second season (consisting of the public domain episodes from that season) was released on DVD in Region 1 on October 7, 2008 as "...The Official Second Season". The third season was released on February 17, 2009. Both seasons are available to be purchased together from major online retailers. On October 1, 2013, season four was released on DVD as a Walmart exclusive. It was released as a full retail release on April 15, 2014. On April 26, 2016, CBS/Paramount released the complete first season on DVD for the very first time.

A three-act stage play based on the pilot was written by David Rogers in 1968.

<a href="Dell%20Comics">Dell Comics</a> adapted the series into a comic book series in 1962. The art work was provided by <a href="Henry%20Scarpelli">Henry Scarpelli</a>.

In 1993, a movie version of "<a href="The%20Beverly%20Hillbillies%20%28film%29">The Beverly Hillbillies</a>" was released starring <a href="Jim%20Varney">Jim Varney</a> as Jed Clampett and featuring <a href="Buddy%20Ebsen">Buddy Ebsen</a> in a cameo as <a href="Barnaby%20Jones">Barnaby Jones</a>, the lead character in his long-running post-"Hillbillies" television series.

Based on "The Beverly Hillbillies" movie, a PC computer adventure game for operating system MS-DOS was developed by Synergistic Software, Inc. and published in 1993 by Capstone Software.

Beryllium

Beryllium is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Be and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 4. It is a relatively rare element in the <a href="universe">universe</a>, usually occurring as a product of the <a href="spallation">spallation</a> of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a <a href="divalent">divalent</a> element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable <a href="gemstones">gemstones</a> which contain beryllium include <a href="beryl">beryl</a> (<a href="Aquamarine%20%28gemstone%29">aquamarine</a>, <a href="emerald">emerald</a>) and <a href="chrysoberyl">chrysoberyl</a>. As a free <a href="Chemical%20element">element</a> it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>.

Beryllium improves many physical properties when added as an <a href="alloy">alloy</a>ing element to <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a> (notably the alloy <a href="beryllium%20copper">beryllium copper</a>), <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="nickel">nickel</a>. Beryllium does not form oxides until it reaches very high temperatures. Tools made of <a href="beryllium%20copper">beryllium copper</a> <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high <a href="flexural%20rigidity">flexural rigidity</a>, <a href="thermal%20stability">thermal stability</a>, <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a> and low <a href="density">density</a> (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> material for aircraft components, <a href="missile">missile</a>s, <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a>, and <a href="satellites">satellites</a>. Because of its low density and <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a>, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of <a href="ionizing%20radiation">ionizing radiation</a>; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of <a href="particle%20detector">particle detector</a>s. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and <a href="beryllium%20oxide">beryllium oxide</a> have led to their use in thermal management applications.

The commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the <a href="toxicity">toxicity</a> of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease in some people called <a href="berylliosis">berylliosis</a>.

Beryllium is a steel gray and hard <a href="metal">metal</a> that is brittle at room temperature and has a close-packed hexagonal <a href="crystal%20structure">crystal structure</a>. It has exceptional <a href="stiffness">stiffness</a> (<a href="Young%27s%20modulus">Young's modulus</a> 287 GPa) and a reasonably high <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a>. The <a href="modulus%20of%20elasticity">modulus of elasticity</a> of beryllium is approximately 50% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast <a href="speed%20of%20sound">sound conduction speed</a> in beryllium – about 12.9 km/s at <a href="Standard%20conditions%20for%20temperature%20and%20pressure">ambient conditions</a>. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg·K) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m·K), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear <a href="thermal%20expansion">thermal expansion</a> (11.4×10 K), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.

Naturally occurring beryllium, save for slight contamination by the cosmogenic radioisotopes, is isotopically pure beryllium-9, which has a <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">nuclear spin</a> of . Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 <a href="barn%20%28unit%29">barns</a> for energies above approximately 10 keV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>, effectively slowing the neutrons to the <a href="neutron%20temperature">thermal energy</a> range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower – exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.

The single primordial beryllium isotope Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1.9 MeV, to produce Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for high-energy neutrons, beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This nuclear reaction is:

Neutrons are liberated when beryllium <a href="Atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> are struck by energetic <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s producing the nuclear reaction
Beryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope-powered <a href="nuclear%20reaction">nuclear reaction</a> <a href="neutron%20source">neutron source</a>s for the laboratory production of free neutrons.

Small amounts of tritium are liberated when nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in the three-step nuclear reaction
Note that has a half-life of only 0.8 seconds, β is an electron, and has a high neutron absorption cross-section. Tritium is a radioisotope of concern in nuclear reactor waste streams.

As a metal, beryllium is <a href="transparency%20and%20translucency">transparent</a> to most wavelengths of <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s and <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s, making it useful for the output windows of <a href="X-ray%20tube">X-ray tube</a>s and other such apparatus.

Both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when <a href="cosmic%20rays">cosmic rays</a> induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, Be, and therefore beryllium is a <a href="monoisotopic%20element">monoisotopic element</a>.
Radioactive <a href="cosmogenic">cosmogenic</a> Be is produced in the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere of the Earth</a> by the <a href="cosmic%20ray%20spallation">cosmic ray spallation</a> of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>. Be accumulates at the <a href="soil">soil</a> surface, where its relatively long <a href="half-life">half-life</a> (1.36 million years) permits a long <a href="residence%20time%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29">residence time</a> before decaying to <a href="boron">boron</a>-10. Thus, Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural <a href="soil%20erosion">soil erosion</a>, <a href="soil%20formation">soil formation</a> and the development of <a href="laterite">lateritic soils</a>, and as a <a href="Proxy%20%28climate%29">proxy</a> for measurement of the variations in <a href="solar%20variation">solar activity</a> and the age of <a href="ice%20core">ice core</a>s. The production of Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased <a href="solar%20wind">solar wind</a> during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of <a href="galactic%20cosmic%20ray">galactic cosmic ray</a>s that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at <a href="nuclear%20weapon%20test">nuclear weapon test</a> sites.
The isotope Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots, much like Be.

Be has a very short half-life of about 7 s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>. This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's <a href="nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a> phase to produce carbon by the fusion of He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available <a href="beryllium-8">beryllium-8</a>. The British <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> Sir <a href="Fred%20Hoyle">Fred Hoyle</a> first showed that the energy levels of Be and C allow carbon production by the so-called <a href="triple-alpha%20process">triple-alpha process</a> in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available. This process allows carbon to be produced in stars, but not in the Big Bang. Star-created carbon (the basis of <a href="carbon-based%20life">carbon-based life</a>) is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by <a href="AGB%20star">AGB star</a>s and <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e (see also <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>), as well as the creation of all other elements with <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>s larger than that of carbon.

The 2s electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when Be decays by L-<a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a>, it does so by taking electrons from its <a href="atomic%20orbital">atomic orbital</a>s that may be participating in bonding. This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings – a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.

The shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is Be which decays through <a href="neutron%20emission">neutron emission</a>. It has a half-life of 2.7 × 10 s. Be is also very short-lived with a half-life of 5.0 × 10 s. The exotic isotopes Be and Be are known to exhibit a <a href="Halo%20nucleus">nuclear halo</a>. This phenomenon can be understood as the nuclei of Be and Be have, respectively, 1 and 4 neutrons orbiting substantially outside the classical Fermi 'waterdrop' model of the nucleus.

The Sun has a concentration of 0.1 <a href="parts%20per%20billion">parts per billion</a> (ppb) of beryllium. Beryllium has a concentration of 2 to 6 <a href="parts%20per%20million">parts per million</a> (ppm) in the Earth's crust. It is most concentrated in the soils, 6 ppm. Trace amounts of Be are found in the Earth's atmosphere. The concentration of beryllium in sea water is 0.2–0.6 <a href="parts%20per%20trillion">parts per trillion</a>. In stream water, however, beryllium is more abundant with a concentration of 0.1 ppb.

Beryllium is found in over 100 minerals, but most are uncommon to rare. The more common beryllium containing minerals include: <a href="bertrandite">bertrandite</a> (BeSiO(OH)), <a href="beryl">beryl</a> (AlBeSiO), <a href="chrysoberyl">chrysoberyl</a> (AlBeO) and <a href="phenakite">phenakite</a> (BeSiO). Precious forms of beryl are <a href="aquamarine%20%28gemstone%29">aquamarine</a>, <a href="red%20beryl">red beryl</a> and <a href="emerald">emerald</a>. 
The green color in gem-quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium (about 2% for emerald).

The two main ores of beryllium, beryl and bertrandite, are found in Argentina, Brazil, India, Madagascar, Russia and the United States. Total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than 400,000 tonnes.

The extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. The United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale extraction of beryllium. Beryllium production technology is in early stages of development in Russia after a 20-year hiatus.

Beryllium is most commonly extracted from the mineral <a href="beryl">beryl</a>, which is either <a href="sintering">sintered</a> using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture. The sintering process involves mixing beryl with <a href="sodium%20fluorosilicate">sodium fluorosilicate</a> and soda at to form <a href="sodium%20fluoroberyllate">sodium fluoroberyllate</a>, <a href="aluminium%20oxide">aluminium oxide</a> and <a href="silicon%20dioxide">silicon dioxide</a>. <a href="Beryllium%20hydroxide">Beryllium hydroxide</a> is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a> in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to . The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated in concentrated <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>, mostly yielding <a href="beryllium%20sulfate">beryllium sulfate</a> and <a href="aluminium%20sulfate">aluminium sulfate</a>. Aqueous <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium hydroxide.

Beryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into <a href="beryllium%20fluoride">beryllium fluoride</a> or <a href="beryllium%20chloride">beryllium chloride</a>. To form the fluoride, aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate, which is heated to to form beryllium fluoride. Heating the fluoride to with <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> forms finely divided beryllium, and additional heating to creates the compact metal. Heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide, which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and chlorine. <a href="Electrolysis">Electrolysis</a> of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal.
Beryllium's chemical behavior is largely a result of its small <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic</a> and <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic</a> radii. It thus has very high <a href="ionization%20potential">ionization potential</a>s and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are <a href="Covalent%20bond">covalent</a>. It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.
An oxide layer forms around beryllium that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000 °C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming a mixture of <a href="beryllium%20oxide">beryllium oxide</a> and <a href="beryllium%20nitride">beryllium nitride</a>. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-<a href="oxidizing%20acid">oxidizing acid</a>s, such as HCl and diluted HSO, but not in <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.
The beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [He] 2s. The two valence electrons give beryllium a +2 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> and thus the ability to form two <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a>s; the only evidence of lower valence of beryllium is in the solubility of the metal in <a href="beryllium%20dichloride">BeCl</a>. Due to the <a href="octet%20rule">octet rule</a>, atoms tend to seek a valence of 8 in order to resemble a <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>. Beryllium tries to achieve a <a href="coordination%20number">coordination number</a> of 4 because its two covalent bonds fill half of this octet. Tetracoordination allows beryllium compounds, such as the fluoride or chloride, to form polymers.

This characteristic is employed in analytical techniques using <a href="EDTA">EDTA</a> as a ligand. EDTA preferentially forms <a href="Octahedral%20molecular%20geometry">octahedral complexes</a> – thus absorbing other cations such as Al which might interfere – for example, in the <a href="Liquid-liquid%20extraction">solvent extraction</a> of a complex formed between Be and <a href="acetylacetone">acetylacetone</a>. Beryllium(II) readily forms complexes with strong donating ligands such as phosphine oxides and arsine oxides. There have been extensive studies of these complexes which show the stability of the O-Be bond.

Solutions of beryllium salts, e.g. <a href="beryllium%20sulfate">beryllium sulfate</a> and <a href="beryllium%20nitrate">beryllium nitrate</a>, are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [Be(HO)] ion.
Other products of hydrolysis include the <a href="trimer%20%28chemistry%29">trimeric</a> ion [Be(OH)(HO)]. <a href="Beryllium%20hydroxide">Beryllium hydroxide</a>, Be(OH), is insoluble even in acidic solutions with pH less than 6, that is at biological pH. It is <a href="Amphoterism">amphoteric</a> and dissolves in strongly <a href="Alkalinity">alkaline</a> solutions.

Beryllium forms <a href="binary%20compound">binary compound</a>s with many non-metals. <a href="Anhydrous">Anhydrous</a> <a href="halide">halide</a>s are known for <a href="fluorine">F</a>, <a href="chlorine">Cl</a>, <a href="bromine">Br</a> and <a href="iodine">I</a>. <a href="beryllium%20fluoride">BeF</a> has a <a href="silica">silica</a>-like structure with corner-shared BeF tetrahedra. <a href="beryllium%20chloride">BeCl</a> and <a href="beryllium%20bromide">BeBr</a> have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. All beryllium halides have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase.

<a href="Beryllium%20difluoride">Beryllium difluoride</a>, BeF, is different than the other <a href="difluoride">difluoride</a>s. In general, beryllium has a tendency to bond covalently, much more so than the other <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earths</a> and its fluoride is partially covalent (although still more ionic than its other halides). BeF has many similarities to <a href="Silicon%20dioxide">SiO</a> (<a href="quartz">quartz</a>) a mostly covalently bonded <a href="network%20solid">network solid</a>. BeF has tetrahedrally coordinated metal and forms glasses (is difficult to crystallize). When crystalline, beryllium fluoride has the same room temperature crystal structure as quartz and shares many higher temperature structures also. Beryllium difluoride is very soluble in water, unlike the other alkaline earth difluorides. (Although they are strongly ionic, they do not dissolve because of the especially strong <a href="Madelung%20constant">lattice energy</a> of the fluorite structure.) However, BeF has much lower electrical conductivity when in solution or when molten than would be expected if it were fully ionic.

<a href="Beryllium%20oxide">Beryllium oxide</a>, BeO, is a white <a href="refractory">refractory</a> solid, which has the <a href="zinc%20sulfide">wurtzite</a> crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as in some metals. BeO is <a href="amphoteric">amphoteric</a>. Salts of beryllium can be produced by treating Be(OH) with acid. Beryllium <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a>, <a href="selenide">selenide</a> and <a href="telluride%20%28chemistry%29">telluride</a> are known, all having the <a href="Cubic%20crystal%20system%23Zincblende%20structure">zincblende structure</a>.

<a href="Beryllium%20nitride">Beryllium nitride</a>, BeN is a high-melting-point compound which is readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN is known and beryllium phosphide, BeP has a similar structure to BeN. Basic beryllium nitrate and <a href="basic%20beryllium%20acetate">basic beryllium acetate</a> have similar tetrahedral structures with four beryllium atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion. A number of beryllium <a href="boride">boride</a>s are known, such as BeB, BeB, BeB, BeB, BeB and BeB. <a href="Beryllium%20carbide">Beryllium carbide</a>, BeC, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give <a href="methane">methane</a>. No beryllium <a href="silicide">silicide</a> has been identified.

The mineral <a href="beryl">beryl</a>, which contains beryllium, has been used at least since the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a> of Egypt. In the first century <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a>, Roman naturalist <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> mentioned in his encyclopedia "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>" that beryl and <a href="emerald">emerald</a> ("smaragdus") were similar. The <a href="Papyrus%20Graecus%20Holmiensis">Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis</a>, written in the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.
Early analyses of emeralds and beryls by <a href="Martin%20Heinrich%20Klaproth">Martin Heinrich Klaproth</a>, <a href="Torbern%20Olof%20Bergman">Torbern Olof Bergman</a>, <a href="Franz%20Karl%20Achard">Franz Karl Achard</a>, and Johann Jakob Bindheim always yielded similar elements, leading to the fallacious conclusion that both substances are <a href="aluminium%20silicate">aluminium silicate</a>s. Mineralogist <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Just%20Ha%C3%BCy">René Just Haüy</a> discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical, and he asked chemist <a href="Louis-Nicolas%20Vauquelin">Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin</a> for a chemical analysis.

In a 1798 paper read before the <a href="Institut%20de%20France">Institut de France</a>, Vauquelin reported that he found a new "earth" by dissolving <a href="aluminium%20hydroxide">aluminium hydroxide</a> from emerald and beryl in an additional <a href="alkali">alkali</a>. The editors of the journal "Annales de Chimie et de Physique" named the new earth "glucine" for the sweet taste of some of its compounds. Klaproth preferred the name "beryllina" due to the fact that <a href="yttria">yttria</a> also formed sweet salts. The name "beryllium" was first used by Wöhler in 1828.
<a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Bussy">Antoine Bussy</a> independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by the <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a> of metallic <a href="potassium">potassium</a> with <a href="beryllium%20chloride">beryllium chloride</a>, as follows:
Using an alcohol lamp, Wöhler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster. The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.

The direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of <a href="beryllium%20fluoride">beryllium fluoride</a> and <a href="sodium%20fluoride">sodium fluoride</a> by <a href="Paul%20Lebeau">Paul Lebeau</a> in 1898 resulted in the first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of beryllium. The first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1932 by <a href="Alfred%20Stock">Alfred Stock</a> and <a href="Hans%20Goldschmidt">Hans Goldschmidt</a>. Their process involves the electrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluorides and <a href="barium">barium</a>, which causes molten beryllium to collect on a water-cooled iron <a href="cathode">cathode</a>.

A sample of beryllium was bombarded with <a href="alpha%20ray">alpha ray</a>s from the decay of <a href="radium">radium</a> in a 1932 experiment by <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> that uncovered the existence of the <a href="neutron">neutron</a>. This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory <a href="neutron%20source">neutron source</a>s that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.

Beryllium production saw a rapid increase during World War II, due to the rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and <a href="phosphor">phosphor</a>s for <a href="fluorescent%20light">fluorescent light</a>s. Most early fluorescent lamps used <a href="zinc%20orthosilicate">zinc orthosilicate</a> with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium <a href="tungstate">tungstate</a> improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.

Electrolysis of a mixture of <a href="beryllium%20fluoride">beryllium fluoride</a> and <a href="sodium%20fluoride">sodium fluoride</a> was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the <a href="alkali%20metals">alkali metals</a>. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of <a href="beryllium%20iodide">beryllium iodide</a> was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.

Pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as <a href="beryllium%20chloride">beryllium chloride</a> with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>. The price on the American market for <a href="Casting%20%28metalworking%29">vacuum-cast</a> beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.

Between 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s, of which 176 tonnes (88%) came from the United States.

Early precursors of the word "beryllium" can be traced to many languages, including <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "Beryllus"; French "Béry"; <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "βήρυλλος", "bērullos", "beryl"; <a href="Prakrit">Prakrit</a> "veruliya" (वॆरुलिय‌); <a href="P%C4%81li">Pāli</a> "veḷuriya" (वेलुरिय), "veḷiru" (भेलिरु) or "viḷar" (भिलर्) – "to become pale", in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl. The original source is probably the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word वैडूर्य ("vaidurya"), which is of <a href="Dravidian%20languages">South Indian</a> origin and could be related to the name of the modern city of <a href="Belur">Belur</a>. For about 160 years, beryllium was also known as glucinum or glucinium (with the accompanying chemical symbol "Gl", or "G" ), the name coming from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word for sweet: γλυκυς, due to the sweet taste of beryllium <a href="Salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a>.

Because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for <a href="X-ray%20tube">X-ray tube</a>s. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of <a href="synchrotron">synchrotron</a> radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., <a href="energy-dispersive%20X-ray%20spectroscopy">energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy</a>) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100 eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.

Low <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic <a href="Elementary%20particle">particles</a>. Therefore, it is used to build the <a href="beamline">beam pipe</a> around the collision region in <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the <a href="Large%20Hadron%20Collider">Large Hadron Collider</a> (<a href="A%20Large%20Ion%20Collider%20Experiment">ALICE</a>, <a href="ATLAS%20experiment">ATLAS</a>, <a href="Compact%20Muon%20Solenoid">CMS</a>, <a href="LHCb">LHCb</a>), the <a href="Tevatron">Tevatron</a> and the <a href="SLAC">SLAC</a>. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above <a href="absolute%20zero">absolute zero</a>, and its <a href="diamagnetic">diamagnetic</a> nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and <a href="strong%20focusing">focus</a> the <a href="particle%20beam">particle beam</a>s.

Because of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> industries in high-speed <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a>, <a href="guided%20missile">guided missile</a>s, <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a>, and <a href="satellite">satellite</a>s. Several <a href="liquid-fuel%20rocket">liquid-fuel rocket</a>s have used <a href="rocket%20engine%20nozzle">rocket nozzles</a> made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder was itself studied as a <a href="rocket%20fuel">rocket fuel</a>, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme high-end <a href="bicycle%20frame">bicycle frame</a>s have been built with beryllium. From 1998 to 2000, the <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a> <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> team used <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> engines with beryllium-aluminium-<a href="alloy">alloy</a> pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Scuderia Ferrari</a>.

Mixing about 2.0% beryllium into <a href="copper">copper</a> forms an <a href="alloy">alloy</a> called <a href="beryllium%20copper">beryllium copper</a> that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high <a href="electrical%20conductivity">electrical conductivity</a> and <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a>, high strength and <a href="hardness%20%28materials%20science%29">hardness</a>, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> and <a href="fatigue%20%28material%29">fatigue resistance</a>. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (<a href="beryllium%20nickel">beryllium nickel</a>), in <a href="spring%20%28device%29">springs</a> and membranes (beryllium nickel and <a href="beryllium%20iron">beryllium iron</a>) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> leads to a significant increase in oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.
The high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in <a href="inertial%20guidance">inertial guidance</a> systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems. Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in "Jason pistols", which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships.

Beryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance phonograph cartridge styli, where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be reduced to 1 gram, yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion.

An earlier major application of beryllium was in <a href="brake">brake</a>s for military <a href="airplane">airplane</a>s because of its hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to <a href="heat%20dissipation">dissipate heat</a>. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.

To reduce costs, beryllium can be <a href="alloy">alloy</a>ed with significant amounts of <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, resulting in the <a href="AlBeMet">AlBeMet</a> alloy (a trade name). This blend is cheaper than pure beryllium, while still retaining many desirable properties.

Beryllium <a href="mirror">mirror</a>s are of particular interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a <a href="honeycomb%20mirror">honeycomb support structure</a>, are used, for example, in <a href="meteorological%20satellite">meteorological satellite</a>s where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in <a href="control%20system">optical guidance</a> systems and in <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>s, e.g. in the German-made <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a> and <a href="Leopard%202">Leopard 2</a> <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a>s. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard <a href="electroless%20nickel%20plating">electroless nickel plating</a> which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to <a href="cryogenic">cryogenic</a> operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.

The <a href="James%20Webb%20Space%20Telescope">James Webb Space Telescope</a> will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures. For the same reason, the optics of the <a href="Spitzer%20Space%20Telescope">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> are entirely built of beryllium metal.

Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium-based materials are used by naval or military <a href="explosive%20ordnance%20disposal">explosive ordnance disposal</a> teams for work on or near <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s, since these mines commonly have <a href="fuze">magnetic fuzes</a>. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated. In the fields of <a href="radio%20communication">radio communication</a>s and powerful (usually military) <a href="radar">radar</a>s, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic <a href="klystron">klystron</a>s, <a href="magnetron">magnetron</a>s, <a href="traveling%20wave%20tube">traveling wave tube</a>s, etc., that are used for generating high levels of <a href="microwave">microwave</a> power in the <a href="transmitter">transmitter</a>s.

Thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in <a href="nuclear%20weapon%20design">nuclear weapon design</a>s as the very outer layer of the <a href="plutonium%20pit">plutonium pit</a>s in the primary stages of <a href="thermonuclear%20bomb">thermonuclear bomb</a>s, placed to surround the <a href="fissile">fissile</a> material. These layers of beryllium are good "pushers" for the <a href="implosion%20%28mechanical%20process%29">implosion</a> of the <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>, and they are good <a href="neutron%20reflector">neutron reflector</a>s, just as in beryllium-moderated <a href="nuclear%20reactors">nuclear reactors</a>.

Beryllium is also commonly used in some <a href="neutron%20source">neutron source</a>s in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor, or a <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>-powered <a href="neutron%20generator">neutron generator</a>). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a> such as <a href="polonium">polonium</a>-210, <a href="radium">radium</a>-226, <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>-238, or <a href="americium">americium</a>-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus is <a href="Nuclear%20transmutation">transmuted</a> into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> driven beryllium neutron sources, named <a href="Modulated%20neutron%20initiator">"urchin"</a> neutron initiators, were used in some early <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s. Neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s from a <a href="gamma%20decay">gamma decay</a> radioisotope, are also used to produce laboratory neutrons.
Beryllium is also used in fuel fabrication for <a href="CANDU">CANDU</a> reactors. The fuel elements have small appendages that are resistance brazed to the fuel cladding using an induction brazing process with Be as the braze filler material. Bearing pads are brazed on to prevent fuel bundle to pressure tube contact, and inter-element spacer pads are brazed on to prevent element to element contact.

Beryllium is also used at the <a href="Joint%20European%20Torus">Joint European Torus</a> <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear-fusion research laboratory</a>, and it will be used in the more advanced <a href="ITER">ITER</a> to condition the components which face the plasma. Beryllium has also been proposed as a <a href="Cladding%20%28nuclear%20fuel%29">cladding</a> material for <a href="nuclear%20fuel%20rod">nuclear fuel rod</a>s, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. <a href="Beryllium%20fluoride">Beryllium fluoride</a> is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture <a href="FLiBe">FLiBe</a>, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical <a href="molten%20salt%20reactor">molten salt reactor</a> designs, including the <a href="liquid%20fluoride%20thorium%20reactor">liquid fluoride thorium reactor</a> (LFTR).

The low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high-frequency <a href="speaker%20driver">speaker driver</a>s. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than <a href="titanium">titanium</a>), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium <a href="tweeter">tweeter</a>s are limited to high-end home, <a href="pro%20audio">pro audio</a>, and <a href="public%20address">public address</a> applications. Some high-fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed to be made of the material.

Some high-end <a href="Magnetic%20cartridge">phonograph cartridges</a> used beryllium cantilevers to improve tracking by reducing mass.

Beryllium is a <a href="p-type%20semiconductor">p-type</a> <a href="dopant">dopant</a> in <a href="List%20of%20semiconductor%20materials">III-V compound semiconductors</a>. It is widely used in materials such as <a href="gallium%20arsenide">GaAs</a>, <a href="AlGaAs">AlGaAs</a>, <a href="InGaAs">InGaAs</a> and <a href="InAlAs">InAlAs</a> grown by <a href="molecular%20beam%20epitaxy">molecular beam epitaxy</a> (MBE). Cross-rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for <a href="printed%20circuit%20board">printed circuit board</a>s in <a href="surface-mount%20technology">surface-mount technology</a>. In critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and <a href="heat%20sink">heat sink</a>. The application also requires a coefficient of <a href="thermal%20expansion">thermal expansion</a> that is well matched to the alumina and <a href="glass-reinforced%20plastic">polyimide-glass</a> <a href="Substrate%20%28materials%20science%29">substrates</a>. The beryllium-beryllium oxide <a href="metal%20matrix%20composite">composite</a> "<a href="E-Material">E-Material</a>s" have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials.

<a href="Beryllium%20oxide">Beryllium oxide</a> is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an <a href="electrical%20insulator">electrical insulator</a> and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in <a href="power%20semiconductor%20device">high-power</a> <a href="transistor">transistor</a>s in <a href="radio%20frequency">radio frequency</a> <a href="transmitter">transmitter</a>s for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a> of <a href="uranium%20dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> <a href="nuclear%20fuel">nuclear fuel</a> pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in <a href="fluorescent%20light">fluorescent light</a>ing tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease <a href="berylliosis">berylliosis</a> which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.

Beryllium is a component of several <a href="Dental%20material">dental alloys</a>.

Beryllium is a health and safety issue for workers. Exposure to beryllium in the workplace can lead to a sensitization immune response and can over time develop <a href="Berylliosis">chronic beryllium disease</a> (CBD). The <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing a better understanding of the work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.

Approximately 35 micrograms of beryllium is found in the average human body, an amount not considered harmful. Beryllium is chemically similar to <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> and therefore can displace it from <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s, which causes them to malfunction. Because Be is a highly charged and small ion, it can easily get into many tissues and cells, where it specifically targets cell nuclei, inhibiting many enzymes, including those used for synthesizing DNA. Its toxicity is exacerbated by the fact that the body has no means to control beryllium levels, and once inside the body the beryllium cannot be removed. Chronic <a href="berylliosis">berylliosis</a> is a <a href="pulmonary">pulmonary</a> and <a href="systemic%20circulation">systemic</a> <a href="granuloma">granuloma</a>tous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium; either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment. Symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop; about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled. The <a href="International%20Agency%20for%20Research%20on%20Cancer">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> (IARC) lists beryllium and beryllium compounds as <a href="List%20of%20IARC%20Group%201%20carcinogens">Category 1 carcinogens</a>. In the US, the <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) has designated a <a href="permissible%20exposure%20limit">permissible exposure limit</a> (PEL) in the workplace with a time-weighted average (TWA) 0.002 mg/m and a constant exposure limit of 0.005 mg/m over 30 minutes, with a maximum peak limit of 0.025 mg/m. The <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) has set a <a href="recommended%20exposure%20limit">recommended exposure limit</a> (REL) of constant 0.0005 mg/m. The <a href="IDLH">IDLH</a> (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 4 mg/m.

The toxicity of finely divided beryllium (dust or powder, mainly encountered in industrial settings where beryllium is produced or machined) is very well-documented. Solid beryllium metal does not carry the same hazards as airborne inhaled dust, but any hazard associated with physical contact is poorly documented. Workers handling finished beryllium pieces are routinely advised to handle them with gloves, both as a precaution and because many if not most applications of beryllium cannot tolerate residue of skin contact such as fingerprints.

Acute beryllium disease in the form of <a href="chemical%20pneumonitis">chemical pneumonitis</a> was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing <a href="fluorescent%20lamp">fluorescent lamp</a>s in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles <a href="sarcoidosis">sarcoidosis</a> in many respects, and the <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as <a href="Herbert%20L.%20Anderson">Herbert L. Anderson</a>.

Beryllium may be found in coal slag. When the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces, the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure.

Early researchers tasted beryllium and its various compounds for sweetness in order to verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt should be made to ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (<a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.

A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute <a href="ammonium%20bifluoride">ammonium bifluoride</a> for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).

Britney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, dancer, and actress. Born in <a href="McComb%2C%20Mississippi">McComb, Mississippi</a>, and raised in <a href="Kentwood%2C%20Louisiana">Kentwood, Louisiana</a>, she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with <a href="Jive%20Records">Jive Records</a> in 1997. Spears's first and second studio albums, "<a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28album%29">...Baby One More Time</a>" (1999) and "<a href="Oops%21...%20I%20Did%20It%20Again%20%28album%29">Oops!... I Did It Again</a>" (2000), became international successes, with the former becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. Title tracks "<a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28song%29">...Baby One More Time</a>" and "<a href="Oops%21...%20I%20Did%20It%20Again%20%28song%29">Oops!... I Did It Again</a>" broke international sales records. In 2001, Spears released her self-titled third studio album, "<a href="Britney%20%28album%29">Britney</a>", and played the starring role in the film "<a href="Crossroads%20%282002%20film%29">Crossroads</a>" (2002). She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, "<a href="In%20the%20Zone">In the Zone</a>" (2003), which yielded the worldwide success of the single "<a href="Toxic%20%28song%29">Toxic</a>".

In 2007, Spears's much-publicized personal issues sent her career into hiatus. Her fifth studio album, "<a href="Blackout%20%28Britney%20Spears%20album%29">Blackout</a>", was released later that year, and spawned singles such as "<a href="Gimme%20More">Gimme More</a>" and "<a href="Piece%20of%20Me">Piece of Me</a>". Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations continued through the following year, at which point she was placed under a still ongoing <a href="conservatorship">conservatorship</a>. Spears's sixth studio album, "<a href="Circus%20%28Britney%20Spears%20album%29">Circus</a>" (2008), included the international chart-topping single "<a href="Womanizer%20%28song%29">Womanizer</a>". Her seventh studio album, "<a href="Femme%20Fatale%20%28Britney%20Spears%20album%29">Femme Fatale</a>" (2011), became her first to yield three top-ten singles in the United States. She released her eighth studio album "<a href="Britney%20Jean">Britney Jean</a>" in 2013. Later that year, Spears began the four-year <a href="residency%20show">residency show</a>, "", at <a href="The%20AXIS">The AXIS</a> at <a href="Planet%20Hollywood%20Resort%20%26amp%3B%20Casino">Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino</a> in Las Vegas. In 2016, Spears released her ninth studio album, "<a href="Glory%20%28Britney%20Spears%20album%29">Glory</a>". In 2017, she announced that her residency show would develop into a world tour, "".

Spears is regarded as a <a href="pop%20icon">pop icon</a> and credited with influencing the revival of <a href="teen%20pop">teen pop</a> during the late 1990s. She became the best-selling teenage artist of all time and garnered honorific titles including the "<a href="Honorific%20nicknames%20in%20popular%20music">Princess of Pop</a>". Her work has earned her <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Britney%20Spears">numerous awards</a> and accolades, including a <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Award</a>, six <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">MTV Video Music Awards</a> including the <a href="Michael%20Jackson%20Video%20Vanguard%20Award">Lifetime Achievement Award</a>, seven <a href="Billboard%20Music%20Award">"Billboard" Music Awards</a> including the Millennium Award and a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>. In 2009, "Billboard" ranked her as the 8th overall Artist of the Decade, and also recognized her as the best-selling female artist of the 2000s, as well as the fifth overall. The <a href="RIAA%20certification">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) lists Spears as the eighth <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20music%20artists%20in%20the%20United%20States">top-selling female artist</a> in the United States, with 34 million <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified</a> albums. She has sold over 150 million records worldwide making her one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20music%20artists">best-selling music artists</a> of all time. According to "Billboard" Spears has sold about 22.38 million singles in digital downloads in US and is the fourth best-selling female artist since Nielsen SoundScan began.

"<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" recognized her instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments of all time, while <a href="VH1">VH1</a> ranked her eleventh on their "100 Greatest Women in Music" list in 2012, and "Billboard" named her the sexiest woman in music. "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of 2012, with earnings of $58 million, having last topped the list in 2002.

Spears was born in <a href="McComb%2C%20Mississippi">McComb, Mississippi</a>, the second child of <a href="Lynne%20Spears">Lynne Irene Bridges</a> and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was <a href="England">English</a> (born in <a href="London">London</a>), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was <a href="Malta">Maltese</a>. Her siblings are <a href="Bryan%20Spears">Bryan James</a> and <a href="Jamie%20Lynn%20Spears">Jamie Lynn</a>. At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of <a href="Kentwood%2C%20Louisiana">Kentwood, Louisiana</a>, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing "<a href="What%20Child%20Is%20This%3F">What Child Is This?</a>" at her <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a> graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".

At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> to audition for the 1990s revival of "<a href="The%20Mickey%20Mouse%20Club">The Mickey Mouse Club</a>". Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the <a href="Professional%20Performing%20Arts%20School">Professional Performing Arts School</a>; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical "<a href="Ruthless%21">Ruthless!</a>". She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show "<a href="Star%20Search">Star Search</a>" and was cast in a number of commercials. In December 1992, she was cast in "The Mickey Mouse Club" alongside <a href="Christina%20Aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a>, <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Gosling">Ryan Gosling</a>, and <a href="Keri%20Russell">Keri Russell</a>. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's <a href="Parklane%20Academy">Parklane Academy</a>. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in "<a href="Clueless%20%28film%29">Clueless</a>" with all the <a href="cliques">cliques</a>. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more."

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager <a href="Lou%20Pearlman">Lou Pearlman</a> to join the female pop group <a href="Innosense">Innosense</a>. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer <a href="Larry%20Rudolph">Larry Rudolph</a> for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a> karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of <a href="Toni%20Braxton">Toni Braxton</a>; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a <a href="Audio%20engineer">sound engineer</a>. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a> and the <a href="Spice%20Girls">Spice Girls</a>, and "there wasn't going to be another <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, another <a href="Debbie%20Gibson">Debbie Gibson</a>, or another <a href="Tiffany%20%28American%20singer%29">Tiffany</a>."

Two weeks later, executives from <a href="Jive%20Records">Jive Records</a> returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of <a href="Artists%20and%20repertoire">A&R</a> Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that "it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that." She then sang Houston's "<a href="I%20Have%20Nothing">I Have Nothing</a>" (1992) for the executives, and was signed to the label. They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney." After hearing the recorded material, president <a href="Clive%20Calder">Clive Calder</a> ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "<a href="Sheryl%20Crow">Sheryl Crow</a> music, but younger more adult contemporary" but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." She flew to <a href="Cheiron%20Studios">Cheiron Studios</a> in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers <a href="Max%20Martin">Max Martin</a>, <a href="Denniz%20Pop">Denniz Pop</a> and <a href="Rami%20Yacoub">Rami Yacoub</a>, among others.

After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for <a href="NSYNC">NSYNC</a>. Her debut studio album, "<a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28album%29">...Baby One More Time</a>", was released on January 12, 1999. It debuted at number one on the U.S. <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> and was certified two-times <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year. It became the biggest selling album ever by a teenage artist.

The <a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28song%29">title track</a> was released as the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final idea of a Catholic schoolgirl. The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million as of today, making it one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles">best-selling singles</a> of all time. "...Baby One More Time" later received a <a href="Grammy">Grammy</a> nomination for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Female Pop Vocal Performance</a>. The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies. It would later become the <a href="List%20of%20million-selling%20singles%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history</a>. Spears is also the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the country. "<a href="%28You%20Drive%20Me%29%20Crazy">(You Drive Me) Crazy</a>" was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and propelled "<a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28album%29">...Baby One More Time</a>" to sell even more. As of today, it has sold 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is also the best-selling first album by any artist ever.

The April 1999 cover of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" featured Spears lying on her bed, covered with a bra, shorts and an open top. The <a href="American%20Family%20Association">American Family Association</a> (AFA) referred to the shoot as "a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality" and called to "God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums." Spears responded to the outcry commenting, "What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this <a href="bubblegum%20pop">bubblegum pop</a> all the time." Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a <a href="virgin">virgin</a> until marriage. On June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining <a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20Tour">...Baby One More Time Tour</a> in North America, which was positively received by critics, but generated some controversy due to her racy outfits. An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.

"<a href="Oops%21...%20I%20Did%20It%20Again%20%28album%29">Oops!... I Did It Again</a>", her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the <a href="SoundScan">SoundScan</a> record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist. The album sold over 20 million copies worldwide to date, making one of the best-selling albums of all time. <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> of "Rolling Stone" said that "the great thing about "Oops!" – under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of <a href="rock%20%26amp%3B%20roll">rock & roll</a> tradition." The album's lead single, "<a href="Oops%21...%20I%20Did%20It%20Again%20%28song%29">Oops!... I Did It Again</a>", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations. The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Vocal%20Album">Best Pop Vocal Album</a> and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.

The same year, Spears embarked on the <a href="Oops%21...%20I%20Did%20It%20Again%20Tour">Oops!... I Did It Again Tour</a>, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, "<a href="Britney%20Spears%20products">Britney Spears' Heart to Heart</a>", co-written with her mother. On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the <a href="2000%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2000 MTV Video Music Awards</a>. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer. Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a>. She also bought a home in <a href="Destin%2C%20Florida">Destin, Florida</a>.

In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with <a href="Pepsi">Pepsi</a>, and released another book co-written with her mother, titled "A Mother's Gift". Her self-titled third studio album, "<a href="Britney%20%28album%29">Britney</a>", was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> and <a href="The%20Neptunes">The Neptunes</a> and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound. The album debuted at number one in the "Billboard" 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called "Britney" "the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet." The album was honored with two Grammy nominations—Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "<a href="Overprotected">Overprotected</a>"— and was listed in 2008 as one of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"'s "100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years". The album's first single, "<a href="I%27m%20a%20Slave%204%20U">I'm a Slave 4 U</a>", became a top-ten hit worldwide.

Spears's performance of the single at the <a href="2001%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2001 MTV Video Music Awards</a> featured a caged tiger and a large <a href="Burmese%20python">albino python</a> draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization <a href="People%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals">PETA</a>, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears. To support the album, Spears embarked on the <a href="Dream%20Within%20a%20Dream%20Tour">Dream Within a Dream Tour</a>. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the "<a href="pi%C3%A8ce%20de%20r%C3%A9sistance">pièce de résistance</a>" being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage. The tour grossed $43.7 million, becoming the second highest grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind <a href="Cher">Cher</a>'s . Her career success was highlighted by "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity. Spears also landed her first starring role in "<a href="Crossroads%20%282002%20film%29">Crossroads</a>", released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, critics praised Spears's acting and the film was a box office success. "Crossroads", which had a $12 million budget, went on to gross over $61.1 million worldwide.

In June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and "management's failure to keep her fully apprised". In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album. Spears's relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years.

As a response, Spears wrote the ballad "<a href="Everytime">Everytime</a>" with her backing vocalist and friend <a href="Annet%20Artani">Annet Artani</a>. The same year, <a href="Limp%20Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a> frontman <a href="Fred%20Durst">Fred Durst</a> said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims.

In July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer <a href="Kevin%20Federline">Kevin Federline</a>, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress <a href="Shar%20Jackson">Shar Jackson</a>, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time. The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show "". They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.

In February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son, Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part. The following month, she <a href="Guest%20appearance">guest-starred</a> on the "<a href="Will%20%26amp%3B%20Grace">Will & Grace</a>" episode "<a href="Buy%2C%20Buy%20Baby">Buy, Buy Baby</a>" as closeted <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> Amber Louise.

Spears was also sued by <a href="Louis%20Vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a> over her 2005 music video "Do Somethin'" for upholstering her <a href="Hummer">Hummer</a> interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.

On the decision, Gan stated, “who in our world did not grow up listening to her music?" In May 2016, Spears launched a <a href="Casual%20game">casual</a> <a href="Role-playing%20video%20game">role-play</a> gaming application titled "Britney Spears: American Dream". The app, created by <a href="Glu%20Mobile">Glu Mobile</a>, was made available through both <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Google%20Play">Google Play</a>.

Along with "Make Me...", Spears and G-Eazy also performed the latter's hit song "<a href="Me%2C%20Myself%20%26amp%3B%20I%20%28G-Eazy%20and%20Bebe%20Rexha%20song%29">Me, Myself & I</a>". 

Spears appeared on the cover of "<a href="Marie%20Claire">Marie Claire</a>" UK for the October 2016 issue. In the publication, Spears' revealed that she had suffered from crippling anxiety in the past, and that motherhood played a major role in helping her overcome it. "My boys don't care if everything isn't perfect. They don't judge me," Spears said in the issue. In November 2016, during an interview with Las Vegas Blog, Spears confirmed she had already begun work on her next album, stating: "I’m not sure what I want the next album to sound like. [...] I just know that I’m excited to get into the studio again and actually have already been back recording." In January 2017, Spears received four wins out of four nominations at the <a href="43rd%20People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">43rd People's Choice Awards</a>, including Favorite Pop Artist, Female Artist, Social Media celebrity as well as Comedic Collaboration for a skit with <a href="Ellen%20DeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a> for "<a href="The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>". In March 2017, Spears announced that her residency show would be performed abroad as a world tour, . The tour is scheduled to visit <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and the Philippines, with more dates expected to be announced in the future. This will be Spears's first time visiting Japan since her <a href="Dream%20Within%20a%20Dream%20Tour">Dream Within a Dream Tour</a> in 2002, and also her 1st time performing in the latter two countries. In April 2017, the <a href="Israeli%20Labor%20Party">Israeli Labor Party</a> announced that it would reschedule its July primary election to avoid conflict with Spears' sold-out Tel Aviv concert, citing traffic and security concerns. She later announced her debut performances in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>. In addition to that, Britney has also announced her return to the tiny city-state of <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> for her 1st ever concert performances, after having previously performed there at a closed-door event back in 1998. 

Spears's manager Larry Rudolph also announced the residency show would not be extended following her contract expiration with Caesars Entertainment at the end of 2017. Her last show is set for December 31, 2017. On April 29, 2017, Spears became the first-ever recipient of the Icon Award at the <a href="2017%20Radio%20Disney%20Music%20Awards">2017 Radio Disney Music Awards</a>.

Following her debut, Spears was credited with leading the revival of <a href="teen%20pop">teen pop</a> in the late 1990s. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Yomiuri">The Daily Yomiuri</a>" reported that "[m]usic critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>." Rob Sheffield of "Rolling Stone" wrote: "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene." Following the release of her debut album, Chuck Taylor of "Billboard" observed, "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice ... "<a href="%28You%20Drive%20Me%29%20Crazy">(You Drive Me) Crazy</a>", her third single ... demonstrates Spears's own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice." Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry."

"Oops!...I Did It Again" and subsequent albums saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers, leading to "a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and <a href="raga">raga</a>." Her third studio album, "Britney" derived from the teen pop niche, "[r]hythmically and melodically ... sharper, tougher than what came before. What used to be unabashedly frothy has some disco grit, underpinned by Spears' spunky self-determination that helps sell hooks that are already catchier, by and large, than those that populated her previous two albums."

Since "In the Zone", Spears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of <a href="electropop">electropop</a> and <a href="dance%20music">dance music</a> in her albums, as well as influences of <a href="urban%20contemporary">urban</a> and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a> which are most present in "In the Zone" and "Blackout". She has also experimented with genres such as <a href="dubstep">dubstep</a>, first on "Blackout"'s "Freakshow" and again on "Hold It Against Me" from "Femme Fatale".

Spears possesses a <a href="soprano">soprano</a> vocal range of three octaves and two notes. Prior to her breakthrough success, she is described as having sung "much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today", with Eric Foster White, who worked with Spears for her debut album "<a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28album%29">...Baby One More Time</a>", being cited as "[shaping] her voice over the course of a month" upon being signed to <a href="Jive%20Records">Jive Records</a> "to where it is today—distinctively, unmistakably Britney". Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, "I know from <a href="Denniz%20Pop">Denniz Pop</a> and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice."

Guy Blackman of "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" wrote that "[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence. [...] Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability." Producer <a href="William%20Orbit">William Orbit</a>, who collaborated with Spears on her album "<a href="Britney%20Jean">Britney Jean</a>", stated regarding her vocals: "[Britney] didn't get so big just because [she] put on great shows; [she] got to be that way because [her voice is] unique: you hear two words and you know who is singing".

Spears has cited her major influences in her career as being <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>, and <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a>, her "three favorite artists" as a child whom she would "sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room"; Houston's "<a href="I%20Have%20Nothing">I Have Nothing</a>" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records. Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Jackson in particular, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence. According to Spears: "I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was." In the 2002 book "Madonnastyle" by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: "I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna."

After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: "she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing." Madonna said of Spears in the documentary "": "I admire her talent as an artist [...] There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career". She has also named <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="Mariah%20Carey">Mariah Carey</a>, <a href="Sheryl%20Crow">Sheryl Crow</a>, <a href="Otis%20Redding">Otis Redding</a>, <a href="Shania%20Twain">Shania Twain</a>, <a href="Brandy%20Norwood">Brandy</a>, <a href="Natalie%20Imbruglia">Natalie Imbruglia</a>, <a href="Cher">Cher</a> and <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a> as sources of inspiration.

Spears became an international <a href="pop%20icon">pop culture icon</a> immediately after launching her recording career. "Rolling Stone" magazine wrote: "One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century," she "spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop ... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank". She is listed by the "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>" as having the "Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist" for her debut album "...Baby One More Time" which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States. Melissa Ruggieri of the "<a href="Richmond%20Times-Dispatch">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>" reported: "She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 37 million albums worldwide".

As of 2011, she has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20music%20artists">best-selling music artists</a> of all time based on album sales alone. She was also ranked as the fourth <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s "50 Greatest Women of the Video Era" show list, ahead of most of her contemporaries and only behind veterans Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Whitney Houston. Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female artist of the first decade of the 21st century, as well as the fifth overall. In December 2009, "Billboard" magazine ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.

Spears is known for her iconic performances and music videos. The music video for her debut single, "...Baby One More Time", was ranked number one on "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">TRL's</a>" Final Countdown of the most iconic music videos. At the <a href="2000%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2000 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, before performing "<a href="Oops%21...%20I%20Did%20It%20Again%20%28song%29">Oops!... I Did It Again</a>", the singer appeared behind a backlit screen, and descended a spiral staircase and started performing "<a href="%28I%20Can%27t%20Get%20No%29%20Satisfaction">(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction</a>", while wearing a <a href="tuxedo">tuxedo</a>. After performing a shortened version of the track, she tore the tuxedo off, revealing a skin-tight flesh-coloured outfit. The following year, Spears performed her single "I'm a Slave 4 U". Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized the performance, saying, "draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting – surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits – Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show."

She also duetted "<a href="The%20Way%20You%20Make%20Me%20Feel">The Way You Make Me Feel</a>" with pop singer <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> at his 30th anniversary concert a few days earlier. During the opening of the <a href="2003%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2003 MTV Video Music Awards</a> on August 28, 2003, Spears joined Madonna, Christina Aguilera, and Missy Elliott. Halfway through the performance, Madonna kissed Spears and Aguilera on the lips. The kiss between Spears and Madonna generated strong reaction from the media. This performance was listed by "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moments in the history of <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">MTV Video Music Awards</a>.

Barbara Ellen of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" wrote: "Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry".

In 2011, Adam Markovitz of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" commented on the cultural significance of Spears's voice and music: "We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer...we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. Musically, though, Spears will always have to measure up to her own gold standards of pop euphony: the operatic slither of 2004's 'Toxic' and the candied funk of 2000's 'Oops!...I Did It Again.' Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s yips or <a href="Eminem">Eminem</a>'s snarls." 'Britney Spears' was <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years. Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the "Guinness World Records" book edition 2007 and 2009. She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000–2009.

Spears has been cited as a musical inspiration by contemporary artists. <a href="Gwyneth%20Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>'s character in 2010 drama film "<a href="Country%20Strong">Country Strong</a>" was inspired by the singer's treatment by the media. According to film director Shana Fest, "that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again." <a href="Nicki%20Minaj">Nicki Minaj</a> has cited Spears as a major influence on her career, and commented, "the fact that she came back out with just so much fire inspires me, and it inspires young women and people all over the world. It just inspires you. A lot of my fans feel like they are the underdog and feel like they are the people who aren't ever accepted for themselves, or who are laughed at or poked fun at forever. It just goes to show that once you keep at whatever it is you're doing, people may not like you, people may not love you, but they will have to respect you at the end of the day. And that respect is all that matters."

<a href="Lana%20Del%20Rey">Lana Del Rey</a> said: "I'm not really interested in a ton of female musicians but there is something about Britney that compelled me – the way she sings and just the way she looks." Del Rey also said that the music video for "Toxic" inspires her. During the <a href="2011%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2011 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a> said that Spears "taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her." Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her "the most provocative performer of my time". <a href="Miley%20Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> credits Spears as one of her influences, and has referenced the singer in her hit song "<a href="Party%20in%20the%20U.S.A.">Party in the U.S.A.</a>" (2009). Spears's personal breakdown was inspired <a href="Barry%20Manilow">Barry Manilow</a>'s album "<a href="15%20Minutes%20%28Barry%20Manilow%20album%29">15 Minutes</a>".
Spears has also influenced many other contemporary artists, including <a href="Katy%20Perry">Katy Perry</a>, <a href="Meghan%20Trainor">Meghan Trainor</a>, <a href="Demi%20Lovato">Demi Lovato</a>, <a href="Kelly%20Key">Kelly Key</a>, <a href="Kristinia%20DeBarge">Kristinia DeBarge</a>, <a href="Little%20Boots">Little Boots</a>, <a href="Charli%20XCX">Charli XCX</a>, <a href="Marina%20and%20the%20Diamonds">Marina and the Diamonds</a>, <a href="Tegan%20and%20Sara">Tegan and Sara</a>, <a href="Pixie%20Lott">Pixie Lott</a>, <a href="Grimes%20%28musician%29">Grimes</a>, <a href="Selena%20Gomez">Selena Gomez</a>, <a href="Hailee%20Steinfeld">Hailee Steinfeld</a>, <a href="Tinashe">Tinashe</a>, <a href="Victoria%20Justice">Victoria Justice</a>, <a href="Cassie%20Ventura">Cassie</a>, and <a href="The%20Saturdays">The Saturdays</a>. <a href="Fergie%20%28singer%29">Fergie</a> of <a href="The%20Black%20Eyed%20Peas">The Black Eyed Peas</a> revealed to "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" that she was happy with Spears's return to the music industry, and continued, "It's amazing. For this many years being in the business, and everything she's been through, it's wonderful to see her make this huge of a comeback. Really, it's a beautiful thing." <a href="Simon%20Cowell">Simon Cowell</a> explained that he is "fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about – not just pop stars – but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. [...] She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that." <a href="Jessica%20Jung">Jessica Jung</a> and <a href="Hyoyeon">Hyoyeon</a> of the Korean girl group <a href="Girls%27%20Generation">Girls' Generation</a> have also been compared to Spears, due to their blonde hair and the latter's abilities as a dancer. Marina and the Diamonds named Spears as the main influence behind her album "<a href="Electra%20Heart">Electra Heart</a>".

Spears has had a direct influence on singer <a href="Porcelain%20Black">Porcelain Black</a>'s work after growing up around her music as a child.

Brazil

Brazil (; ), officially the Federative Republic of Brazil (, ), is the largest country in both <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. As the world's fifth-largest country by <a href="list%20of%20countries%20and%20outlying%20territories%20by%20total%20area">area</a> and sixth by <a href="list%20of%20countries%20by%20population">population</a>, it is the largest country to have <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> as an <a href="List%20of%20territorial%20entities%20where%20Portuguese%20is%20an%20official%20language">official language</a> and the only one in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a <a href="Coastline%20of%20Brazil">coastline</a> of It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its <a href="Amazon%20River%20basin">Amazon River basin</a> includes a <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">vast tropical forest</a>, home to diverse <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Brazil">wildlife</a>, a variety of <a href="Environment%20of%20Brazil">ecological system</a>s, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous <a href="protected%20areas%20of%20Brazil">protected habitats</a>. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 <a href="megadiverse%20countries">megadiverse countries</a>, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.

Brazil was inhabited by <a href="Indigenous%20Brazilian">numerous tribal nations</a> prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer <a href="Pedro%20%C3%81lvares%20Cabral">Pedro Álvares Cabral</a>, who claimed the area for the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a>. Brazil remained a <a href="Colonial%20Brazil">Portuguese colony</a> until 1808, when the capital of the empire was <a href="Transfer%20of%20the%20Portuguese%20Court%20to%20Brazil">transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro</a>. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Portugal%2C%20Brazil%20and%20the%20Algarves">United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves</a>. <a href="Brazilian%20Independence">Independence</a> was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a>, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">National Congress</a>. The country <a href="Proclamation%20of%20the%20Republic%20%28Brazil%29">became a presidential republic</a> in 1889 following a military <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>. An authoritarian <a href="Brazilian%20military%20dictatorship">military junta</a> came to power <a href="1964%20Brazilian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">in 1964</a> and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current <a href="Constitution%20of%20Brazil">constitution</a>, formulated in 1988, defines it as a <a href="Democracy">democratic</a> <a href="federal%20republic">federal republic</a>. The federation is composed of the union of the <a href="Federal%20District%20%28Brazil%29">Federal District</a>, the 26 <a href="States%20of%20Brazil">states</a>, and the 5,570 <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Brazil">municipalities</a>.

<a href="Economy%20of%20Brazil">Brazil's economy</a> is the world's ninth-<a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28nominal%29">largest by nominal GDP</a> and seventh-<a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28PPP%29">largest by GDP (PPP)</a> . A member of the <a href="BRICS">BRICS</a> group, Brazil until 2010 had one of the world's fastest growing major economies, with its economic reforms giving the country new international recognition and influence. Brazil's <a href="Brazilian%20Development%20Bank">national development bank</a> plays an important role for the country's economic growth. Brazil is a founding member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, the <a href="G-20%20major%20economies">G20</a>, <a href="BRICS">BRICS</a>, <a href="Union%20of%20South%20American%20Nations">Unasul</a>, <a href="Mercosur">Mercosul</a>, <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a>, <a href="Organization%20of%20Ibero-American%20States">Organization of Ibero-American States</a> and the <a href="Community%20of%20Portuguese%20Language%20Countries">CPLP</a>. Brazil is a <a href="regional%20power">regional power</a> in Latin America and a <a href="middle%20power">middle power</a> in international affairs, with some analysts identifying it as an <a href="Emerging%20power">emerging global power</a>. One of the world's major <a href="breadbasket">breadbasket</a>s, Brazil has been the largest <a href="Coffee%20production%20in%20Brazil">producer of coffee</a> for the last 150 years.

It is likely that the word "Brazil" comes from the Portuguese word for <a href="Caesalpinia%20echinata">brazilwood</a>, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast. In Portuguese, brazilwood is called "pau-brasil", with the word "brasil" commonly given the etymology "red like an ember", formed from Latin "brasa" ("ember") and the suffix "-il" (from "-iculum" or "-ilium"). As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil. Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Brazil">indigenous peoples</a> (mostly <a href="Tupi%20people">Tupi</a>) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods.

The official Portuguese name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the "Land of the Holy Cross" ("Terra da Santa Cruz"), but European sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the "Land of Brazil" ("Terra do Brasil") on account of the brazilwood trade. The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name. Some early sailors called it the "Land of Parrots".

In the <a href="Guarani%20language">Guarani language</a>, an official language of <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, Brazil is called "Pindorama". This was the name the indigenous population gave to the region, meaning "land of the palm trees".

Some of the earliest human remains found in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, <a href="Luzia%20Woman">Luzia Woman</a>, were found in the area of <a href="Pedro%20Leopoldo">Pedro Leopoldo</a>, <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a> and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years. The earliest <a href="pottery">pottery</a> ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the <a href="Amazon%20basin">Amazon basin</a> of Brazil and <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dated</a> to 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The pottery was found near <a href="Santar%C3%A9m%2C%20Par%C3%A1">Santarém</a> and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture.

Around the time of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people, mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The indigenous population of Brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g. the <a href="Tup%C3%AD%20people">Tupis</a>, <a href="Guaran%C3%AD%20people">Guaranis</a>, <a href="G%C3%AA%20peoples">Gês</a> and <a href="Arawak%20peoples">Arawaks</a>). The Tupí people were subdivided into the <a href="Tupiniquim%20people">Tupiniquins</a> and <a href="Tupinamb%C3%A1%20people">Tupinambás</a>, and there were also many subdivisions of the other groups.

Before the arrival of the Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs. These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with <a href="cannibalism">cannibalistic</a> rituals on <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. While heredity had some weight, leadership status was more subdued over time, than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions. <a href="Slavery">Slavery</a> among the Indians had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into <a href="kinship">kinship</a> relations.

The land now called Brazil was claimed for the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a> on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by <a href="Pedro%20%C3%81lvares%20Cabral">Pedro Álvares Cabral</a>. The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes, most of whom spoke languages of the <a href="Tupi%E2%80%93Guarani">Tupi–Guarani</a> family, and fought among themselves. Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King <a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> <a href="John%20III%20of%20Portugal">João III</a> of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous <a href="Captaincies%20of%20Brazil">Captaincy Colonies of Brazil</a>.

However, the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the <a href="Governorate%20General%20of%20Brazil">Governorate General of Brazil</a>, a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America. In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing <a href="opportunistic">opportunistic</a> alliances in order to gain advantages against each other. By the mid-16th century, <a href="Sugar%23Sugarcane">cane sugar</a> had become Brazil's most important exportation product, and slaves purchased in <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, in the <a href="Slavery%20in%20Africa%23Atlantic%20slave%20trade">slave market of Western Africa</a> (not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in <a href="Portuguese%20Angola">Angola</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20Mozambique">Mozambique</a>), had become its largest import, to cope with <a href="Plantation%20economy">plantations</a> of sugarcane, due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar.

By the end of the 17th century, sugarcane exports began to decline, and the discovery of gold by <a href="bandeirantes">bandeirantes</a> in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a <a href="Brazilian%20Gold%20Rush">Brazilian Gold Rush</a> which attracted thousands of new <a href="Settler%20colonialism">settlers</a> to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the world. This increased level of immigration in turn caused <a href="War%20of%20the%20Emboabas">some conflicts</a> between newcomers and old settlers.

Portuguese expeditions known as <a href="Bandeirantes">Bandeiras</a> gradually advanced the Portugal colonial <a href="Treaty%20of%20Tordesillas">original frontiers</a> in South America to approximately the current Brazilian borders. In this era other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French <a href="France%20Antarctique">in Rio during the 1560s</a>, <a href="Equinoctial%20France">in Maranhão during the 1610s</a>, and the <a href="Dutch%20Brazil">Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco</a>, during the <a href="Dutch%E2%80%93Portuguese%20War">Dutch–Portuguese War</a>, after the end of <a href="Iberian%20Union">Iberian Union</a>.

The Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the <a href="monopoly">monopoly</a> of Portugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of <a href="slave%20rebellion">slave rebellion</a> and resistance, such as the <a href="Palmares%20%28quilombo%29">Quilombo of Palmares</a>, and to repress all movements for <a href="Autonomous%20administrative%20division">autonomy</a> or <a href="independence">independence</a>, such as the <a href="Inconfid%C3%AAncia%20Mineira">Minas Conspiracy</a>.
In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of <a href="continental%20Portugal">continental Portugal</a>, causing <a href="John%20VI%20of%20Portugal">Prince Regent João</a>, in the name of <a href="Maria%20I%20of%20Portugal">Queen Maria I</a>, to move the royal court from <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> to <a href="Transfer%20of%20the%20Portuguese%20Court%20to%20Brazil">Brazil</a>. There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local <a href="stock%20exchange">stock exchange</a>s, and its <a href="Banco%20do%20Brasil">National Bank</a>, additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the <a href="Portuguese%20conquest%20of%20French%20Guiana">Portuguese conquest of French Guiana</a>.

With the end of the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, in order to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for the past six years, the Crown established the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Portugal%2C%20Brazil%2C%20and%20the%20Algarves">United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves</a>, thus creating a <a href="pluricontinental">pluricontinental</a> transatlantic monarchic state. However, such a ploy didn't last long, since the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to require the return of court to Lisbon (as postulated by the <a href="Liberal%20Revolution%20of%201820">Liberal Revolution of 1820</a>), and also groups of Brazilians, impatient for practical and real changes, still demanded independence and a republic, as demonstrated by the <a href="Pernambucan%20Revolt">1817 Pernambucan Revolt</a>.
In 1821, as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of <a href="Porto">Porto</a>, D. João VI was unable to hold out any longer, and departed for Lisbon. There he swore oath to the new constitution, leaving his son, <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Brazil">Prince Pedro de Alcântara</a>, as Regent of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Brazil">Kingdom of Brazil</a>.

Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased, and the <a href="Portuguese%20Cortes">Portuguese Cortes</a>, guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony. The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, <a href="Brazilian%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declaring the country's independence from Portugal</a> on 7 September 1822. A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Brazil">Pedro I</a>, resulting in the foundation of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a>.

The <a href="Brazilian%20War%20of%20Independence">Brazilian War of Independence</a>, which had already begun along this process, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province. With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824, Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825. On 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissensions with both liberal and conservative sides of politics, including an attempt of <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Equator">republican secession</a>, as well as unreconciled with the way that absolutists in Portugal had given to the succession of King John VI, Pedro I went to Portugal to <a href="Liberal%20Wars">reclaim his daughter's crown</a>, abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (who thus became the Empire's second monarch, with the royal title of Dom <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II</a>).
As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age, a <a href="Regency%20%28government%29">regency</a> was set up by the National Assembly. In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, during this period a series of localized rebellions took place, as the <a href="Cabanagem">Cabanagem</a>, the <a href="Mal%C3%AA%20Revolt">Malê Revolt</a>, the <a href="Balaiada">Balaiada</a>, the <a href="Sabinada">Sabinada</a>, and the <a href="Ragamuffin%20War">Ragamuffin War</a>, which emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast, slaveholding and newly independent <a href="nation%20state">nation state</a>. This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the <a href="Praieira%20revolt">Praieira revolt</a>, was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the <a href="Dom%20Pedro%20II%23Early%20coronation">premature coronation of Pedro II</a> in 1841.

During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery. The <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> was abandoned in 1850, as a result of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">British</a> <a href="Aberdeen%20Act">Aberdeen Act</a>, but only in <a href="Lei%20%C3%81urea">May 1888</a> after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of <a href="Slavery%20in%20Brazil">slavery in the country</a>, was the institution formally abolished.

The foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the <a href="Southern%20Cone">Southern Cone</a> with which Brazil has borders. Long after the <a href="Cisplatine%20War">Cisplatine War</a> that resulted in independence for <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro II. These were the <a href="Platine%20War">Platine War</a>, the <a href="Uruguayan%20War">Uruguayan War</a> and the devastating <a href="Paraguayan%20War">Paraguayan War</a>, the largest <a href="war%20effort">war effort</a> in Brazilian history.

On 15 November 1889, worn out by years of economic stagnation, in attrition with the majority of Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.

The "early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship, with army dominating affairs both at Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power". In 1894, following the unfoldings of two severe crises, <a href="encilhamento">an economic</a> along with <a href="Revolta%20da%20Armada">a military one</a>, the republican civilians rose to power.

If in relation to its foreign policy, the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries, only broken by the <a href="Acre%20War">Acre War</a> (1899–1902) and <a href="Brazil%20during%20World%20War%20I">its involvement</a> in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–1918), followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>; "Internally", from the "crisis of Encilhamento" and the Armada Revolts, a prolonged cycle of financial, political and social instability began Until the 1920s, keeping the country besieged by various rebellions, both civilian and military.

Little by little, <a href="Rebellions%20and%20revolutions%20in%20Brazil%231st%20Republican%20period%20%281889-1930%29">a cycle of general instability</a> sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent, that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate <a href="Get%C3%BAlio%20Vargas">Getúlio Vargas</a> supported by most of the military, successfully led the <a href="Brazilian%20Revolution%20of%201930">October 1930's Coup</a>. Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their own supporters.
In the 1930s, three failed attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power occurred. The first was the <a href="Constitutionalist%20Revolution">Constitutionalist Revolt</a> in 1932 led by the <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">Paulista</a> oligarchy, the second was a <a href="Brazilian%20uprising%20of%201935">Communist uprising</a> in November 1935, and the last one a "Putsch" attempt by the <a href="Brazilian%20Integralism">local fascists</a> in May 1938. The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the Congress transferred more power to the executive. The 1937 "coup d'état" resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election, installed Vargas as a dictator, and began the <a href="Estado%20Novo%20%28Brazil%29">Estado Novo</a> era, noted for government brutality and censorship of the press.

The foreign policy during Vargas years was marked by the antecedents and occurrence of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, having Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country entered on the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">allied side</a>, after suffering <a href="Submarine%20warfare%23Atlantic%20ocean">retaliations</a> undertaken by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29%23Fascism%20%281922%E2%80%931943%29">Fascist Italy</a>, in the context of the strategic dispute over the South Atlantic. In addition to <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic%23South%20Atlantic%20%28May%201942%20-%20September%201943%29">its participation in the battle of the Atlantic</a>, Brazil also sent an <a href="Brazilian%20Expeditionary%20Force">expeditionary force</a> to fight in the <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Italian campaign</a>.

With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with Democracy being "reinstated" by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years earlier. Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.

Several brief interim governments followed Vargas's suicide. <a href="Juscelino%20Kubitschek">Juscelino Kubitschek</a> became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the <a href="Opposition%20%28politics%29">political opposition</a> that allowed him to govern without major crises. The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably, but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a>, inaugurated in 1960. His successor, <a href="J%C3%A2nio%20Quadros">Jânio Quadros</a>, resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office. His vice-president, <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Goulart">João Goulart</a>, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition and was <a href="1964%20Brazilian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">deposed in April 1964</a> by a coup that resulted in a <a href="Brazilian%20military%20government">military regime</a>.

The new regime was intended to be transitory but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968. Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society, inside and outside the country through the infamous "<a href="Operation%20Condor">Operation Condor</a>". Despite its brutality, like other <a href="Totalitarianism">totalitarian regimes</a>, due to an economic boom, known as an "economic miracle", the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.

Slowly however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas, plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals <a href="Ernesto%20Geisel">Geisel</a> and <a href="Golbery%20do%20Couto%20e%20Silva">Golbery</a>. With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began its slow return to democracy, which was completed during the 1980s.

Civilians returned to power in 1985 when <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Sarney">José Sarney</a> assumed the presidency, becoming unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and <a href="hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> inherited from the military regime. Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the <a href="Brazilian%20presidential%20election%2C%201989">election in 1989</a> of the almost-unknown <a href="Fernando%20Collor%20de%20Mello">Fernando Collor</a>, subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.

Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, <a href="Itamar%20Franco">Itamar Franco</a>, who appointed <a href="Fernando%20Henrique%20Cardoso">Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a> Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful <a href="Plano%20Real">Plano Real</a>, that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally granted stability to the Brazilian economy, leading Cardoso to be <a href="Brazilian%20presidential%20election%2C%201994">elected that year</a>, and <a href="Brazilian%20presidential%20election%2C%201998">again in 1998</a>.

The peaceful transition of power from Cardoso to his main opposition leader, <a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> (<a href="Brazilian%20presidential%20election%2C%202002">elected in 2002</a> and <a href="Brazilian%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">re-elected in 2006</a>), was seen as proof that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving a long-sought political stability. However, sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades from corruption, <a href="police%20brutality">police brutality</a>, inefficiencies of the political <a href="The%20Establishment">establishment</a> and <a href="public%20service">public service</a>), <a href="2013%20protests%20in%20Brazil">numerous peaceful protests</a> erupted in Brazil from the middle of first term of <a href="Dilma%20Rousseff">Dilma Rousseff</a>, who succeeded Lula in the <a href="Brazilian%20presidential%20election%2C%202010">in 2010</a>). Enhanced by a political and economic crises with evidence of involvement by politicians from all the primary political parties in several <a href="bribery">bribery</a> and <a href="tax%20evasion">tax evasion</a> schemes, with <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20protests%20in%20Brazil">large street protests for and against her</a>, Rousseff <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Dilma%20Rousseff">was impeached</a> by the <a href="Brazilian%20Congress">Brazilian Congress</a> in 2016. In 2017, the Supreme Court has asked for the investigation of 71 Brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers in President <a href="Michel%20Temer">Michel Temer</a>'s cabinet allegedly linked to the <a href="Operation%20Car%20Wash">Petrobras corruption scandal</a>. President Temer is himself accused of <a href="Corruption%20in%20Brazil">corruption</a>.

Brazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent's interior, sharing land borders with <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> to the south; <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> to the southwest; <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="Peru">Peru</a> to the west; <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> to the northwest; and <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a> and <a href="France">France</a> (French overseas region of <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a>) to the north. It shares a border with every South American country except <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>. It also encompasses a number of oceanic <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>s, such as <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a>, <a href="Rocas%20Atoll">Rocas Atoll</a>, <a href="Saint%20Peter%20and%20Saint%20Paul%20Archipelago">Saint Peter and Paul Rocks</a>, and <a href="Trindade%20and%20Martim%20Vaz">Trindade and Martim Vaz</a>. Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse. Including its <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> islands, Brazil lies between latitudes <a href="6th%20parallel%20north">6°N</a> and <a href="34th%20parallel%20south">34°S</a>, and longitudes <a href="28th%20meridian%20west">28°</a> and <a href="74th%20meridian%20west">74°W</a>.

Brazil is the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20and%20outlying%20territories%20by%20total%20area">fifth largest</a> country in the world, and third largest in the Americas, with a total area of , including of water. It spans four <a href="time%20zone">time zone</a>s; from <a href="UTC-05">UTC−5</a> comprising the state of <a href="Acre%20%28state%29">Acre</a> and the westernmost portion of <a href="Amazonas%20%28Brazilian%20state%29">Amazonas</a>, to <a href="UTC%E2%88%9204">UTC−4</a> in the western states, to <a href="UTC%E2%88%9203">UTC−3</a> in the eastern states (the <a href="Time%20in%20Brazil">national time</a>) and <a href="UTC%E2%88%9202">UTC−2</a> in the <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20Brazil">Atlantic islands</a>.

Brazil is the only country in the world that has the <a href="equator">equator</a> and the <a href="Tropic%20of%20Capricorn">Tropic of Capricorn</a> running through it. It is also the only country to have contiguous territory both inside and outside the tropics.
Brazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills, mountains, plains, highlands, and scrublands. Much of the terrain lies between and in elevation. The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country. The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills.

The southeastern section is more rugged, with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to . These ranges include the <a href="Mantiqueira%20Mountains">Mantiqueira</a> and <a href="Espinha%C3%A7o%20Mountains">Espinhaço mountains</a> and the <a href="Serra%20do%20Mar">Serra do Mar</a>. In the north, the <a href="Guiana%20Shield">Guiana Highlands</a> form a major drainage divide, separating rivers that flow south into the <a href="Amazon%20Basin">Amazon Basin</a> from rivers that empty into the <a href="Orinoco">Orinoco River</a> system, in Venezuela, to the north. The highest point in Brazil is the <a href="Pico%20da%20Neblina">Pico da Neblina</a> at , and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean.

Brazil has a dense and complex system of rivers, one of the world's most extensive, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic. Major rivers include the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon</a> (the world's second-longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water), the <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20River">Paraná</a> and its major tributary the <a href="Iguazu%20River">Iguaçu</a> (which includes the <a href="Iguazu%20Falls">Iguazu Falls</a>), the <a href="Rio%20Negro%20%28Amazon%29">Negro</a>, <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Francisco%20River">São Francisco</a>, <a href="Xingu%20River">Xingu</a>, <a href="Madeira%20River">Madeira</a> and <a href="Tapaj%C3%B3s">Tapajós</a> rivers.

The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical. According to the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen system</a>, Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes: <a href="Desert%20climate">desert</a>, <a href="Tropical%20rainforest%20climate">equatorial</a>, <a href="tropical%20climate">tropical</a>, <a href="Semi-arid%20climate">semiarid</a>, <a href="Oceanic%20climate">oceanic</a> and <a href="Humid%20subtropical%20climate">subtropical</a>. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20moist%20broadleaf%20forests">equatorial rainforest</a>s in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to <a href="temperate%20coniferous%20forest">temperate coniferous forest</a>s in the south and <a href="tropical%20and%20subtropical%20grasslands%2C%20savannas%2C%20and%20shrublands">tropical savannas</a> in central Brazil. Many regions have starkly different <a href="microclimate">microclimate</a>s.

An equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil. There is no real <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>, but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls. Temperatures average , with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.

Over central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate. This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude. In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme. The semiarid climatic region generally receives less than of rain, most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year and occasionally less than this, creating long periods of drought. Brazil's 1877–78 "<a href="Grande%20Seca">Grande Seca</a>" (Great Drought), the worst in Brazil's history, caused approximately half a million deaths. A similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915.

South of Bahia, near the coasts, and more southerly most of the state of São Paulo, the distribution of rainfall changes, with rain falling throughout the year. The south enjoys subtropical conditions, with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding ; winter frosts and <a href="Snow%20in%20Brazil">snowfall</a> are not rare in the highest areas.

Brazil's large territory comprises different ecosystems, such as the <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a>, recognized as having the greatest <a href="Biodiversity">biological diversity</a> in the world, with the <a href="Atlantic%20Forest">Atlantic Forest</a> and the <a href="Cerrado">Cerrado</a>, sustaining the greatest biodiversity. In the south, the <a href="Araucaria">Araucaria</a> pine forest grows under temperate conditions. The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats. Scientists estimate that the total number of <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Brazil">plant</a> and <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Brazil">animal species</a> in Brazil could approach four million, mostly invertebrates.
Larger mammals include carnivores <a href="Cougar">pumas</a>, <a href="jaguar">jaguar</a>s, <a href="ocelot">ocelot</a>s, rare <a href="bush%20dog">bush dog</a>s, and <a href="fox">fox</a>es, and herbivores <a href="peccary">peccaries</a>, <a href="tapir">tapir</a>s, <a href="anteater">anteater</a>s, <a href="sloth">sloth</a>s, <a href="opossum">opossum</a>s, and <a href="armadillo">armadillo</a>s. <a href="Deer">Deer</a> are plentiful in the south, and many species of <a href="New%20World%20monkey">New World monkey</a>s are found in the northern <a href="Rainforest">rain forests</a>. Concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues. Brazil's Amazon Basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species, including the <a href="red-bellied%20piranha">red-bellied piranha</a>. Despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish, the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger. Biodiversity can contribute to <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chickens, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.

The natural heritage of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture, logging, mining, resettlement, oil and gas extraction, over-fishing, wildlife trade, dams and infrastructure, water pollution, climate change, fire, and invasive species. In many areas of the country, the natural environment is threatened by development. Construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement; dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats; and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape. At least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region, including the controversial <a href="Belo%20Monte%20Dam">Belo Monte</a> hydroelectric dam.

The form of government is that of a <a href="Democracy">democratic</a> <a href="Federation">federative</a> <a href="republic">republic</a>, with a <a href="presidential%20system">presidential system</a>. The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term, with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is <a href="Michel%20Temer">Michel Temer</a>, who replaced <a href="Dilma%20Rousseff">Dilma Rousseff</a> after her <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Dilma%20Rousseff">impeachment</a>. The President appoints the <a href="Minister%20of%20State">Ministers of State</a>, who assist in government. Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">National Congress</a> is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Brazil">Chamber of Deputies</a> and the <a href="Senate%20of%20Brazil">Federal Senate</a>. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively. Brazil is a <a href="democracy">democracy</a>, according to the <a href="Democracy%20Index">Democracy Index</a> 2010.

The Brazilian Federation is the "indissoluble union" of the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District. The Union, the states and the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the "spheres of government". The <a href="federation">federation</a> is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism. The classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution. The executive and legislative are organized <a href="Separation%20of%20powers">independently in all three spheres of government</a>, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state/Federal District spheres.
All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected. Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams. For most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, proportional representation. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.

Together with several smaller parties, four political parties stand out: <a href="Workers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29">Workers' Party</a> (PT), <a href="Brazilian%20Social%20Democracy%20Party">Brazilian Social Democracy Party</a> (PSDB), <a href="Brazilian%20Democratic%20Movement%20Party">Brazilian Democratic Movement Party</a> (PMDB) and <a href="Democrats%20%28Brazil%29">Democrats</a> (DEM). Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly. Almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the Executive.

Brazilian law is based on the <a href="Civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a> legal system and <a href="civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a> concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases.

The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, which was promulgated on 5 October 1988, and is the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules. , there have been 53 amendments. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution. Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" (), which act in a similar way to constitutions. Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms. Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Brazil">Federal Constitution</a> allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments. There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts. The highest court is the <a href="Supreme%20Federal%20Court">Supreme Federal Court</a>.

This system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings. Nevertheless, the Supreme Federal Tribunal was the first court in the world to transmit its sessions on television, and also via <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>. More recently, in December 2009, the Supreme Court adopted <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> to display items on the day planner of the ministers, to inform the daily actions of the Court and the most important decisions made by them.

The armed forces of Brazil are the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20number%20of%20military%20and%20paramilitary%20personnel">second largest</a> in Latin America by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment. It consists of the <a href="Brazilian%20Army">Brazilian Army</a> (including the <a href="Brazilian%20Army%20Aviation%20Command">Army Aviation Command</a>), the <a href="Brazilian%20Navy">Brazilian Navy</a> (including the <a href="Brazilian%20Marine%20Corps">Marine Corps</a> and <a href="Brazilian%20Naval%20Aviation">Naval Aviation</a>), and the <a href="Brazilian%20Air%20Force">Brazilian Air Force</a>. Brazil's <a href="conscription">conscription</a> policy gives it one of the world's largest military forces, estimated at more than 1.6 million <a href="Military%20Reserve">reservist</a> annually.

Numbering close to 236,000 active personnel, the Brazilian Army has the largest number of armored vehicles in <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, including armored transports and <a href="battle%20tank">tanks</a> It is also unique in Latin America for its large, elite forces specializing in unconventional missions, the <a href="Brazilian%20Special%20Operations%20Command">Brazilian Special Operations Command</a>, and the versatile Strategic Rapid Action Force, made up of highly mobilized and prepared (Special Operations Brigade, <a href="Parachute%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28Brazil%29">Infantry Brigade Parachutist</a>, 1st Jungle Infantry Battalion (Airmobile) and 12th Brigade Light Infantry (Airmobile) able to act anywhere in the country, on short notice, to counter external aggression. The states' <a href="Military%20Police%20%28Brazil%29">Military Police</a> and the <a href="Military%20Firefighters%20Corps">Military Firefighters Corps</a> are described as an ancillary forces of the Army by the constitution, but are under the control of each state's governor. 
The Navy once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s, which sparked a <a href="South%20American%20dreadnought%20race">South American dreadnought race</a> between Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. Today, it is a <a href="green-water%20navy">green water</a> force and has a group of specialized elite in retaking ships and naval facilities, <a href="GRUMEC">GRUMEC</a>, unit specially trained to protect Brazilian oil platforms along its coast. It's the only navy in Latin America that operates an <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>, <a href="Brazilian%20aircraft%20carrier%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28A12%29">NAe São Paulo</a>, and one of the ten navies of the world to operate this type of ship.

The Air Force, it is the largest in Latin America has about 700 manned aircraft in service and effective about 67,000 personnel.

Brazil has not been invaded since 1865 during the <a href="Paraguayan%20War">Paraguayan War</a>. Additionally, Brazil has no contested territorial disputes with any of its neighbours and neither does it have rivalries, like Chile and Bolivia have with each other. The Brazilian military has also three times intervened militarily to overthrow the <a href="Government%20of%20Brazil">Brazilian government</a>. It has built a tradition of participating in UN <a href="peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a> missions such as in <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> and <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a>.

Brazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Brazil">Federal Constitution</a>, which establishes <a href="Non-interventionism">non-intervention</a>, <a href="self-determination">self-determination</a>, <a href="Internationalism%20%28politics%29">international cooperation</a> and the <a href="Peacebuilding">peaceful settlement of conflicts</a> as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.

According to the Constitution, the <a href="President%20of%20Brazil">President</a> has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">Congress</a> is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and <a href="Treaty">international treaties</a>, as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.

Brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's unique position as a <a href="regional%20power">regional power</a> in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, a leader among <a href="developing%20countries">developing countries</a>, and an emerging <a href="world%20power">world power</a>. Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of <a href="multilateralism">multilateralism</a>, peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.

An increasingly well-developed tool of Brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries. Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels. Total aid is estimated to be around $1 billion per year that includes:


In addition, Brazil manages a peacekeeping mission in <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">Haiti</a> ($350 million) and makes in-kind contributions to the <a href="World%20Food%20Programme">World Food Programme</a> ($300 million). This is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies. The scale of this aid places it on par with China and India. The Brazilian South-South aid has been described as a "global model in waiting."

In Brazil, the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Brazil">Constitution</a> establishes five different police agencies for law enforcement: <a href="Federal%20Police%20Department">Federal Police Department</a>, <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Police">Federal Highway Police</a>, <a href="Federal%20Railroad%20Police">Federal Railroad Police</a>, <a href="Military%20Police%20%28Brazil%29">Military Police</a> and <a href="Civil%20Police%20%28Brazil%29">Civil Police</a>. Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities and the last two are subordinate to state governments. All police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or state powers. The <a href="National%20Public%20Security%20Force">National Public Security Force</a> also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.

The country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide. In 2012, the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20intentional%20homicide%20rate">highest rates of intentional homicide of the world</a>. The number considered tolerable by the WHO is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. However, there are differences between the crime rates in the <a href="States%20of%20Brazil">Brazilian states</a>. While in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">São Paulo</a> the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 10.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, in <a href="Alagoas">Alagoas</a> it was 64.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.

Brazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world (behind only <a href="China">China</a> and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>), with an estimated total of approximately 700,000 prisoners around the country (June 2014), an increase of about 300% compared to the index registered in 1992. The high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the Brazilian prison system, leading to a shortfall of about two hundred thousand accommodations.

Brazil is a federation composed of 26 <a href="Federated%20state">States</a>, one <a href="Federal%20District%20%28Brazil%29">Federal district</a> (which contains the capital city, <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a>) and <a href="Municipality">Municipalities</a>. States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.

The states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: <a href="Northern%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Northern</a>, <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Northeast</a>, <a href="Central-West%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Central-West</a>, <a href="Southeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Southeast</a> and <a href="Southern%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Southern</a>. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.

Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government. Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called "<a href="comarca">comarca</a>" (county).

Brazil is the largest national economy in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28nominal%29">world's ninth largest economy</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28PPP%29">eighth largest</a> in <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a> (PPP) according to the 2017 estimates. Brazil has a <a href="mixed%20economy">mixed economy</a> with abundant natural resources. After rapid growth in preceding decades, the country <a href="2014%E2%80%932016%20Brazilian%20economic%20recession">entered an ongoing recession in 2014</a> amid a political corruption scandal and nationwide protests.

Its GDP (PPP) per capita was $15,048 in 2016 putting Brazil in the 77th position according to IMF data. Active in <a href="agriculture">agricultural</a>, <a href="mining">mining</a>, <a href="manufacturing">manufacturing</a> and <a href="Tertiary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">service sector</a>s Brazil has a labor force of over a 107 million (ranking 6th worldwide) and unemployment of 6.2% (ranking 64th worldwide). The country has been expanding its presence in international financial and <a href="commodity%20market">commodities market</a>s, and is one of a group of four emerging economies called the <a href="BRIC">BRIC countries</a>. Brazil has been the world's largest <a href="Coffee%20production%20in%20Brazil">producer of coffee</a> for the last 150 years. 

Brazil has become the fourth largest car market in the world. Major export products include <a href="Fixed-wing%20aircraft">aircraft</a>, <a href="electrical%20equipment">electrical equipment</a>, <a href="automobile">automobile</a>s, <a href="ethanol%20fuel">ethanol</a>, <a href="textile">textile</a>s, <a href="footwear">footwear</a>, <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a>, <a href="steel">steel</a>, <a href="coffee">coffee</a>, <a href="orange%20juice">orange juice</a>, <a href="soybean">soybean</a>s and <a href="corned%20beef">corned beef</a>. In total, Brazil ranks 23rd worldwide in <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20exports">value of exports</a>.

Brazil pegged its currency, the <a href="Brazilian%20real">real</a>, to the U.S. dollar in 1994. However, after the <a href="1997%20Asian%20financial%20crisis">East Asian financial crisis</a>, the <a href="1998%20Russian%20financial%20crisis">Russian default</a> in 1998 and the series of adverse financial events that followed it, the <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20Brazil">Central Bank of Brazil</a> temporarily changed its <a href="monetary%20policy">monetary policy</a> to a managed-float scheme while undergoing a <a href="currency%20crisis">currency crisis</a>, until definitively changing the exchange regime to <a href="free-float">free-float</a> in January 1999.

Brazil received an International Monetary Fund rescue package in mid-2002 of $30.4 billion, then a record sum. Brazil's central bank paid back the IMF loan in 2005, although it was not due to be repaid until 2006. One of the issues the Central Bank of Brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country, which may have contributed to a fall in the value of the U.S. dollar against the real during that period. Nonetheless, <a href="foreign%20direct%20investment">foreign direct investment</a> (FDI), related to long-term, less speculative investment in production, is estimated to be $193.8 billion for 2007. Inflation monitoring and control currently plays a major part in the Central bank's role of setting out short-term <a href="interest%20rate">interest rate</a>s as a monetary policy measure.

Between 1993 and 2010, 7012 <a href="Mergers%20and%20acquisitions">mergers & acquisitions</a> with a total known value of $707 billion with the involvement of Brazilian firms have been announced. The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with 115 billion USD of transactions. The largest transaction with involvement of Brazilian companies has been: <a href="Vale%20%28mining%20company%29">Cia. Vale do Rio Doce</a> acquired <a href="Vale%20Inco">Inco</a> in a tender offer valued at US$18.9 billion.

Corruption costs Brazil almost $41 billion a year alone, with 69.9% of the country's firms identifying the issue as a major constraint in successfully penetrating the global market. Local government corruption is so prevalent that voters perceive it as a problem only if it surpasses certain levels, and only if a local media e.g. a radio station is present to divulge the findings of corruption charges. Initiatives, like this exposure, strengthen awareness which is indicated by the Transparency International's <a href="Corruption%20Perceptions%20Index">Corruption Perceptions Index</a>; ranking Brazil 69th out of 178 countries in 2012.
The <a href="purchasing%20power">purchasing power</a> in Brazil is eroded by the so-called <a href="Brazil%20cost">Brazil cost</a>.

Brazil's diversified economy includes agriculture, industry, and a wide range of services. <a href="Agriculture%20in%20Brazil">Agriculture</a> and allied sectors like <a href="forestry">forestry</a>, <a href="logging">logging</a> and <a href="fishing">fishing</a> accounted for 5.1% of the <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> in 2007. Brazil is one of the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20producing%20countries%20of%20agricultural%20commodities">largest producer</a> of oranges, coffee, sugar cane, cassava and sisal, soybeans and papayas.

The <a href="Industry%20in%20Brazil">industry</a> – from <a href="automobile">automobile</a>s, <a href="steel">steel</a> and <a href="petrochemical">petrochemical</a>s to <a href="computer">computer</a>s, <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a> and <a href="durable%20good">consumer durables</a> – accounted for 30.8% of the gross domestic product. Industry is highly concentrated in metropolitan São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, <a href="Campinas">Campinas</a>, <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>, and <a href="Belo%20Horizonte">Belo Horizonte</a>.

Brazil is the world's <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20total%20primary%20energy%20consumption%20and%20production">tenth largest</a> energy consumer with much of its energy coming from <a href="Renewable%20energy">renewable source</a>s, particularly <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a> and <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>; the <a href="Itaipu%20Dam">Itaipu Dam</a> is the world's largest <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectric plant</a> by energy generation. The first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005. Recent oil discoveries in the <a href="Pre-salt%20layer">Pre-salt layer</a> have opened the door for a large increase in oil production. The governmental agencies responsible for the energy policy are the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the National Council for Energy Policy, the <a href="National%20Agency%20of%20Petroleum%2C%20Natural%20Gas%20and%20Biofuels%20%28Brazil%29">National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels</a>, and the <a href="Brazilian%20Electricity%20Regulatory%20Agency">National Agency of Electricity</a>.

Tourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economy of several regions of the country. The country had 6.36 million visitors in 2015, ranking in terms of the international tourist arrivals as the main destination in <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and second in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> after <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Revenues from international tourists reached billion in 2010, showing a recovery from the <a href="Late-2000s%20recession">2008–2009 economic crisis</a>. Historical records of 5.4 million visitors and billion in receipts were reached in 2011.

Natural areas are its most popular tourism product, a combination of <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a> with <a href="leisure">leisure</a> and <a href="recreation">recreation</a>, mainly sun and beach, and <a href="adventure%20travel">adventure travel</a>, as well as <a href="cultural%20tourism">cultural tourism</a>. Among the most popular destinations are the <a href="Amazon%20Rainforest">Amazon Rainforest</a>, <a href="beach">beach</a>es and <a href="dune">dune</a>s in the <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Northeast Region</a>, the <a href="Pantanal">Pantanal</a> in the <a href="Center-West%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Center-West Region</a>, beaches at <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28state%29">Rio de Janeiro</a> and <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a>, cultural tourism in <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a> and business trips to <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a> city.

In terms of the 2015 <a href="Travel%20and%20Tourism%20Competitiveness%20Report">Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index</a> (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 28st place at the world's level, third in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, after <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

Brazil's main competitive advantages are its natural resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria out of all countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many <a href="World%20Heritage%20site">World Heritage site</a>s. The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges, as well as high prices and high taxation. Safety and security have improved significantly: 75th in 2011, up from 128th in 2008.

According to the <a href="World%20Tourism%20Organization">World Tourism Organization</a> (WTO), international travel to Brazil accelerated in 2000, particularly during 2004 and 2005. However, in 2006 a slow-down took place, and international arrivals had almost no growth in 2007–08. 

In spite of this trend, revenues from international tourism continued to rise, from <a href="USD">USD</a> 4 billion in 2005 to 5 billion in 2007, despite 330 000 fewer arrivals. This favorable trend is the result of the strong devaluation of the US dollar against the <a href="Brazilian%20Real">Brazilian Real</a>, which began in 2004, but which makes Brazil a more expensive international destination. This trend changed in 2009, when both visitors and revenues fell as a result of the <a href="Great%20Recession">Great Recession</a> of 2008–09. By 2010, the industry had recovered, and arrivals grew above 2006 levels to 5.2 million international visitors, and receipts from these visitors reached USD 6 billion. In 2011 the historical record was reached with 5.4 million visitors and billion in receipts.

Despite continuing record-breaking international tourism revenues, the number of Brazilian tourists travelling overseas has been growing steadily since 2003, resulting in a net negative <a href="Foreign%20exchange%20market">foreign exchange</a> balance, as more money is spent abroad by Brazilians than comes in as receipts from international tourists visiting Brazil. Tourism expenditures abroad grew from USD 5.8 billion in 2006, to USD 8.2 billion in 2007, a 42% increase, representing a net deficit of USD 3.3 billion in 2007, as compared to USD 1.5 billion in 2006, a 125% increase from the previous year. This trend is caused by Brazilians taking advantage of the stronger <a href="Brazilian%20real">Real</a> to travel and making relatively cheaper expenditures abroad. Brazilians traveling overseas in 2006 represented 4% of the country's population.

In 2005, tourism contributed with 3.2% of the country's revenues from exports of goods and services, and represented 7% of direct and indirect employment in the Brazilian economy. In 2006 direct employment in the sector reached 1.9 million people. Domestic tourism is a fundamental market segment for the industry, as 51 million people traveled throughout the country in 2005, and direct revenues from Brazilian tourists reached USD 22 billion, 5.6 times more receipts than international tourists in 2005.

In 2005, <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="Foz%20do%20Igua%C3%A7u">Foz do Iguaçu</a>, <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Florian%C3%B3polis">Florianópolis</a> and <a href="Salvador%2C%20Bahia">Salvador</a> were the most visited cities by international tourists for leisure trips. The most popular destinations for business trips were <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> and <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>. In 2006 Rio de Janeiro and <a href="Fortaleza">Fortaleza</a> were the most popular destinations for business trips.

Technological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public universities and research institutes, with the majority of funding for basic research coming from various government agencies. Brazil's most esteemed technological hubs are the <a href="Funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Oswaldo%20Cruz">Oswaldo Cruz Institute</a>, the <a href="Instituto%20Butantan">Butantan Institute</a>, the Air Force's <a href="Brazilian%20General%20Command%20for%20Aerospace%20Technology">Aerospace Technical Center</a>, the <a href="Empresa%20Brasileira%20de%20Pesquisa%20Agropecu%C3%A1ria">Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation</a> and the <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Space%20Research">INPE</a>. The <a href="Brazilian%20Space%20Agency">Brazilian Space Agency</a> has the most advanced space program in Latin America, with significant resources to launch vehicles, and manufacture of <a href="artificial%20satellite">satellite</a>. Owner of relative technological sophistication, the country develops <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s, aircraft, as well as being involved in space research, having a Vehicle Launch Center Light and being the only country in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> the integrate team building <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> (ISS).

The country is also a pioneer in the search for oil in deep water, from where extracts 73% of its reserves.
<a href="Uranium">Uranium</a> is enriched at the <a href="Resende%20Nuclear%20Fuel%20Factory">Resende Nuclear Fuel Factory</a>, mostly for research purposes (as Brazil obtains 88% from its electricity from <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a>) and the country's first nuclear submarine will be delivered in 2015 (by France). Brazil is one of the three countries in Latin America with an operational <a href="Synchrotron">Synchrotron</a> Laboratory, a research facility on physics, chemistry, material science and life sciences. And Brazil is the only Latin American country to have a <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> company with its own <a href="Semiconductor%20fabrication%20plant">fabrication plant</a>, the <a href="CEITEC">CEITEC</a>. According to the Global Information Technology Report 2009-2010 of the World Economic Forum, Brazil is the 61 world's largest developer of information technology.

Brazil also has a large number of outstanding scientific personalities. Among the most renowned Brazilian inventors are priests <a href="Bartolomeu%20de%20Gusm%C3%A3o">Bartolomeu de Gusmão</a>, <a href="Landell%20de%20Moura">Landell de Moura</a> and Francisco João de Azevedo, besides <a href="Alberto%20Santos-Dumont">Alberto Santos-Dumont</a>, <a href="Evaristo%20Conrado%20Engelberg">Evaristo Conrado Engelberg</a>, <a href="Manuel%20Dias%20de%20Abreu">Manuel Dias de Abreu</a>, <a href="Andreas%20Pavel">Andreas Pavel</a> e Nélio José Nicolai. Brazilian science is represented by the likes of <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Lattes">César Lattes</a> (Brazilian <a href="physicist">physicist</a> Pathfinder of "<a href="Pion">Pi Meson</a>"), <a href="M%C3%A1rio%20Schenberg">Mário Schenberg</a> (considered the greatest theoretical physicist of Brazil), <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Leite%20Lopes">José Leite Lopes</a> (only Brazilian physicist holder of "UNESCO Science Prize"), <a href="Artur%20%C3%81vila">Artur Ávila</a> (the first Latin American winner of <a href="Fields%20Medal">Fields Medal</a>) and <a href="Fritz%20M%C3%BCller">Fritz Müller</a> (pioneer in factual support the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin).

Brazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic. The road system totaled 1.98 million km (1.23 million mi) in 2002. The total of paved roads increased from (22,056 mi) in 1967 to (114,425 mi) in 2002.

The first investments in road infrastructure have given up in the 1920s, the government of <a href="Washington%20Luis">Washington Luis</a>, being pursued in the governments of <a href="Get%C3%BAlio%20Vargas">Getúlio Vargas</a> and <a href="Eurico%20Gaspar%20Dutra">Eurico Gaspar Dutra</a>. President <a href="Juscelino%20Kubitschek">Juscelino Kubitschek</a> (1956–61), who designed and built the capital <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a>, was another supporter of highways. Kubitschek was responsible for the installation of major car manufacturers in the country (<a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>, <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> and <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> arrived in Brazil during his rule) and one of the points used to attract them was, of course, support for the construction of highways. With the implementation of <a href="Fiat">Fiat</a> in 1976 ending an automobile market closed loop, from the end of the 1990s the country has received large foreign direct investments installing in its territory other major car manufacturers and utilities, such as <a href="Iveco">Iveco</a>, <a href="Renault">Renault</a>, <a href="Peugeot">Peugeot</a>, <a href="Citroen">Citroen</a>, <a href="Honda">Honda</a>, <a href="Mitsubishi">Mitsubishi</a>, <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a href="BMW">BMW</a>, <a href="Hyundai">Hyundai</a>, <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a> among others. Brazil is the seventh most important country in the <a href="auto%20industry">auto industry</a>.

Brazil's <a href="Rail%20transport">railway</a> system has been declining since 1945, when emphasis shifted to <a href="highway">highway</a> construction. The total length of railway track was in 2002, as compared with in 1970. Most of the railway system belonged to the Federal Railroad Corporation RFFSA, which was privatized in 2007. The <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Metro">São Paulo Metro</a> was the first underground transit system in Brazil. The other metro systems are in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>, <a href="Recife">Recife</a>, <a href="Belo%20Horizonte">Belo Horizonte</a>, <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a>, <a href="Teresina">Teresina</a> and <a href="Fortaleza">Fortaleza</a>.

The country has an extensive rail network of in length, the tenth largest network in the world. Currently, the Brazilian government, unlike the past, seeks to encourage this mode of transport; an example of this incentive is the project of the <a href="Rio%E2%80%93S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20high-speed%20rail">Rio–São Paulo high-speed rail</a>, that will connect the two main cities of the country to carry passengers.

There are about 2,500 <a href="airport">airport</a>s in Brazil, including landing fields: the second largest number in the world, after the United States. <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo-Guarulhos%20International%20Airport">São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport</a>, near São Paulo, is the largest and busiest airport with nearly 20 million passengers annually, while handling the vast majority of commercial traffic for the country.

For freight transport <a href="waterways">waterways</a> are of importance, e.g. the <a href="Free%20Economic%20Zone%20of%20Manaus">industrial zones of Manaus</a> can be reached only by means of the Solimões- Amazonas waterway ( with minimum depth). The country also has of waterways.

Coastal shipping links widely separated parts of the country. Bolivia and Paraguay have been given free <a href="port">port</a>s at <a href="Santos%2C%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">Santos</a>. Of the 36 deep-water ports, Santos, Itajaí, Rio Grande, Paranaguá, Rio de Janeiro, Sepetiba, Vitória, Suape, Manaus and São Francisco do Sul are the most important. Bulk carriers have to wait up to 18 days before being serviced, container ships 36,3 hours on average.

Among the achievements in the water supply and sanitation sector is an increase in access to water piped on premises
from 79% to 92% between 1990 and 2010; an increase in access to <a href="Improved%20sanitation">Improved sanitation</a> from 68% to 79% in the same period;
a functioning national system to finance water and sanitation
infrastructure; a high level of cost recovery compared to most other
developing countries; as well as a number of notable technical and
financial innovations such as <a href="Condominial%20sewerage">Condominial sewerage</a> and an output-based subsidy for treated wastewater called <a href="PRODES">PRODES</a>.

Among the challenges is the still high number of poor Brazilians living in urban slums (<a href="Favela">Favela</a>)
and in rural areas without access to piped water or sanitation; <a href="water%20scarcity">water scarcity</a> in the Northeast of Brazil; <a href="water%20pollution">water pollution</a>, especially in the
South-East of the country; the low share of collected <a href="Wastewater%20treatment">wastewater</a> that is
being treated (35% in 2000); and long-standing tensions between the
federal, state and municipal governments about their respective roles in
the sector.

The Brazilian <a href="public%20health">public health</a> system, the <a href="Sistema%20%C3%9Anico%20de%20Sa%C3%BAde">Unified Health System</a> (SUS), is managed and provided by all levels of government, being the largest type system in the world. On the other hand, <a href="private%20healthcare">private healthcare</a> systems play a complementary role. Public health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free. However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area. In 2009, the Brazilian territory had 1.72 doctors and 2.4 hospital beds for every 1,000 inhabitants.

Despite all the progress made since the creation of the universal health care system in 1988, there are still several public health problems in Brazil. In 2006, the main points to be solved were the high <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20infant%20mortality%20rate">infant</a> (2.51%) and maternal mortality rates (73.1 deaths per 1000 births). The number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases, such as <a href="cardiovascular%20diseases">cardiovascular diseases</a> (151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and <a href="cancer">cancer</a> (72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), also has a considerable impact on the health of the Brazilian population. Finally, external but preventable factors such as car accidents, violence and suicide caused 14.9% of all deaths in the country. The Brazilian health system was ranked 125th among the 191 countries evaluated by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) in 2000.

The <a href="Constitution">Federal Constitution</a> and the Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education determine that the <a href="Federal%20Government">Federal Government</a>, <a href="Federated%20state">State</a>s, <a href="Federal%20District">Federal District</a> and <a href="municipalities">municipalities</a> must manage and organize their respective education systems. Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources. The constitution reserves 25% of the state budget and 18% of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education.

According to the <a href="Brazilian%20Institute%20of%20Geography%20and%20Statistics">IBGE</a>, in 2011, the literacy rate of the population was 90.4%, meaning that 13 million (9.6% of population) people are still illiterate in the country; functional illiteracy has reached 21.6% of the population. Illiteracy is highest in the Northeast, where 19.9% of the population is illiterate.

Higher education starts with undergraduate or sequential <a href="course%20%28education%29">course</a>s, which may offer different options of specialization in academic or professional careers. Depending on the choice, students can improve their educational background with courses of post-graduate studies or broad sense. To attend a higher education institution is required, by Law of Guidelines and Bases of Education, completing all levels of education suited to the needs of all students of teaching <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a>, <a href="elementary%20school">elementary</a> and medium, provided the student does not hold any disability, whether physical, <a href="Mind">mental</a>, <a href="visual">visual</a> or <a href="hearing%20%28sense%29">hearing</a>.

The <a href="University%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">University of São Paulo</a> is the best <a href="university">university</a> in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, according to <a href="QS%20World%20University%20Rankings">QS World University Rankings</a>. Of the top 20 Latin Americans universities, eight are Brazilian. Most of them are <a href="Public%20university">public</a>.

The Brazilian press has its beginnings in 1808 with the arrival of the <a href="House%20of%20Braganza%23Realm%20in%20Brazil">Portuguese royal family</a> to Brazil, hitherto forbidden any activity of the press – was the publication of newspapers or books. The Brazilian press was officially born in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> on 13 May 1808, with the creation of the Royal Printing, National Press by the <a href="Prince%20Regent">Prince Regent</a> <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20VI%20of%20Portugal">Dom João</a>.

The "Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro", the first newspaper published in the country, began to circulate on 10 September 1808. The <a href="List%20of%20newspapers%20in%20the%20world%20by%20circulation">largest newspapers</a> nowadays are "<a href="Folha%20de%20S.Paulo">Folha de S.Paulo</a>" (from the state of São Paulo), "Super Notícia" (Minas Gerais 296.799), "<a href="O%20Globo">O Globo</a>" (RJ 277.876) and "<a href="O%20Estado%20de%20S.%20Paulo">O Estado de S. Paulo</a>" (SP 235.217).

Radio broadcasting began on 7 September 1922, with a speech by then President Pessoa, and was formalized on 20 April 1923 with the creation of "Radio Society of Rio de Janeiro."

Television in Brazil began officially on 18 September 1950, with the founding of <a href="TV%20Tupi">TV Tupi</a> by <a href="Assis%20Chateaubriand">Assis Chateaubriand</a>. Since then television has grown in the country, creating large public networks such as Globo, SBT, Record and Bandeirantes. Today it is the most important factor in popular culture of Brazilian society, indicated by research showing that as much as 67% of the general population follow the same daily <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> broadcast. Digital Television, using the <a href="SBTVD">SBTVD</a> standard (based on the Japanese standard <a href="ISDB-T">ISDB-T</a>), was adopted 29 June 2006 and launched on 2 November 2007. In May 2010, Brazil launched <a href="TV%20Brasil%20Internacional">TV Brasil Internacional</a>, an international <a href="television%20station">television station</a>, initially broadcasting to 49 countries.

The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million (), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 and 83.75% of the population defined as urban. The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8 million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5 million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1 million inhabitants.

The first census in Brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478. From 1880 to 1930, 4 million Europeans arrived. Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, because of a decline in the <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a>, even though the <a href="birth%20rate">birth rate</a> underwent a slight decline. In the 1940s the annual <a href="Population%20growth">population growth rate</a> was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years and to 72.6 years in 2007.
It has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of –0.29% by 2050 thus completing the <a href="demographic%20transition">demographic transition</a>.

In 2008, the illiteracy rate was 11.48% and among the <a href="youth%20in%20Brazil">youth</a> (ages 15–19) 1.74%. It was highest (20.30%) in the Northeast, which had a large proportion of rural poor. Illiteracy was high (24.18%) among the rural population and lower (9.05%) among the urban population.

According to the <a href="Brazilian%20Institute%20of%20Geography%20and%20Statistics">National Research by Household Sample</a> (PNAD) of 2008, 48.43% of the population (about 92 million) described themselves as <a href="White%20Brazilian">White</a>; 43.80% (about 83 million) as <a href="Brown%20%28racial%20classification%29%23Pardos%20in%20Brazil">Pardo</a> (<a href="brown%20people">brown</a>), 6.84% (about 13 million) as <a href="Black%20Brazilian">Black</a>; 0.58% (about 1.1 million) as <a href="Asian%20Brazilian">Asian</a>; and 0.28% (about 536 thousand) as <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Brazil">Amerindian</a> (officially called "indígena", Indigenous), while 0.07% (about 130 thousand) did not declare their race.

In 2007, the <a href="Funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Nacional%20do%20%C3%8Dndio">National Indian Foundation</a> estimated that Brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes, up from their estimate of 40 in 2005. Brazil is believed to have the largest number of <a href="uncontacted%20peoples">uncontacted peoples</a> in the world.

Since the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, considerable <a href="miscegenation">miscegenation</a> between Amerindians, Europeans, and Africans has taken place in all regions of the country (with European ancestry being dominant nationwide according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population, accounting for between 65% to 77%).
Brazilian society is more <a href="Social%20issues%20in%20Brazil">markedly divided by social class lines</a>, although a high <a href="Income%20inequality%20in%20Brazil">income disparity</a> is found <a href="Social%20apartheid%20in%20Brazil">between race groups</a>, so <a href="racism">racism</a> and <a href="Class%20discrimination">classism</a> can be conflated. Socially significant closeness to one racial group <a href="Race%20in%20Brazil">is taken in account</a> more in the basis of appearance (<a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>s) rather than ancestry, to the extent that full <a href="sibling">sibling</a>s can pertain to different "racial" groups. <a href="Socioeconomic%20status">Socioeconomic</a> factors are also significant, because a minority of "<a href="pardo">pardo</a>s" are likely to start declaring themselves White or Black if socially upward. Skin color and facial features do not line quite well with ancestry (usually, Afro-Brazilians are evenly mixed and European ancestry is dominant in Whites and "pardos" with a significant non-European contribution, but the individual variation is great).

The brown population (officially called "<a href="pardo">pardo</a>" in Portuguese, also colloquially "<a href="wikt%3Amoreno">moreno</a>") is a broad category that includes "<a href="caboclo">caboclo</a>s" (assimilated Amerindians in general, and descendants of Whites and Natives), "<a href="Mulatto">mulatos</a>" (descendants of primarily Whites and Afro-Brazilians) and "<a href="Zambo">cafuzo</a>s" (descendants of Afro-Brazilians and Natives). People of considerable Amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the Northern, Northeastern and Center-Western regions.

Higher percents of Blacks, mulattoes and tri-racials can be found in the eastern coast of the Northeastern region from Bahia to Paraíba and also in northern Maranhão, southern Minas Gerais and in eastern Rio de Janeiro. From the 19th century, Brazil opened its borders to <a href="Immigration%20to%20Brazil">immigration</a>. About five million people from over 60 countries migrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1972, most of them of <a href="Portuguese%20Brazilian">Portuguese</a>, <a href="Italian%20Brazilian">Italian</a>, <a href="Brazilians%20of%20Spanish%20descent">Spanish</a>, <a href="German%20Brazilian">German</a>, <a href="Ukrainian%20Brazilian">Ukrainian</a>, <a href="Polish%20Brazilian">Polish</a>, <a href="Jewish%20Brazilian">Jewish</a>, <a href="Russians%20in%20Brazil">Russian</a>, <a href="Chinese%20Brazilian">Chinese</a>, <a href="Japanese%20Brazilian">Japanese</a>, and <a href="Arab%20Brazilian">Arab</a> origin.

Religion in Brazil formed from the meeting of the Catholic Church with the religious traditions of enslaved African peoples and indigenous peoples. This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Catholic Church, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities, and in some instances, <a href="Allan%20Kardec">Allan Kardec</a>'s <a href="Spiritism">Spiritism</a> (a religion which incorporates elements of <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a> and Christianity). Religious pluralism increased during the 20th century, and the Protestant community has grown to include over 22% of the population. The most common Protestant denominations are <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> and <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> ones. Other Protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a>, <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventists</a>, <a href="Lutheranism">Lutherans</a> and the <a href="Calvinism">Reformed tradition</a>.

<a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> is the country's predominant faith. Brazil has the world's largest Catholic population. According to the 2000 Demographic Census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 73.57% of the population followed <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Brazil">Roman Catholicism</a>; 15.41% <a href="Protestantism%20in%20Brazil">Protestantism</a>; 1.33% Kardecist spiritism; 1.22% other Christian denominations; 0.31% Afro-Brazilian religions; 0.13% <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>; 0.05% <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>; 0.02% <a href="Islam%20in%20Brazil">Islam</a>; 0.01% Amerindian religions; 0.59% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 7.35% have no religion.

However, in the last ten years Protestantism, particularly Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, has spread in Brazil, while the proportion of Catholics has dropped significantly. After Protestantism, individuals professing no religion are also a significant group, exceeding 7% of the population as of the 2000 census. The cities of <a href="Boa%20Vista%2C%20Roraima">Boa Vista</a>, <a href="Salvador%2C%20Bahia">Salvador</a>, and <a href="Porto%20Velho">Porto Velho</a> have the greatest proportion of <a href="Irreligion">Irreligious</a> residents in Brazil. <a href="Teresina">Teresina</a>, <a href="Fortaleza">Fortaleza</a>, and <a href="Florian%C3%B3polis">Florianópolis</a> were the most Roman Catholic in the country. <a href="Greater%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Greater Rio de Janeiro</a>, not including the <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">city proper</a>, is the most irreligious and least Roman Catholic Brazilian periphery, while <a href="Greater%20Porto%20Alegre">Greater Porto Alegre</a> and Greater <a href="Fortaleza">Fortaleza</a> are on the opposite sides of the lists, respectively.

According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.
The largest urban agglomerations in Brazil are <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, and <a href="Belo%20Horizonte">Belo Horizonte</a> – all in the Southeastern Region – with 21.1, 12.3, and 5.1 million inhabitants respectively. The majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for <a href="Vit%C3%B3ria%2C%20Brazil">Vitória</a>, the capital of <a href="Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Espírito Santo</a>, and <a href="Florian%C3%B3polis">Florianópolis</a>, the capital of Santa Catarina.

The official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. The most famous exception to this is a strong <a href="recognition%20of%20sign%20languages">sign language law</a> that was passed by the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">National Congress of Brazil</a>. Legally recognized in 2002, the law was <a href="regulation">regulated</a> in 2005. The law mandates the use of the <a href="Brazilian%20Sign%20Language">Brazilian Sign Language</a>, more commonly known by its Portuguese <a href="acronym">acronym</a> LIBRAS, in education and government services. The language must be taught as a part of the <a href="school%20of%20education">education</a> and <a href="speech%20and%20language%20pathology">speech and language pathology</a> curricula. LIBRAS teachers, instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access ("<a href="inclusion%20%28education%29">inclusion</a>") to <a href="Deaf%20community">deaf people</a>.

<a href="Brazilian%20Portuguese">Brazilian Portuguese</a> has had its own development, mostly similar to 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese (despite a very substantial number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and <a href="Portuguese%20Brazilian">more recent immigrants</a>, coming from <a href="Northern%20Portugal">Northern regions</a>, and in minor degree Portuguese <a href="Macaronesia">Macaronesia</a>), with a few influences from the <a href="Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas">Amerindian</a> and <a href="Languages%20of%20Africa">African languages</a>, especially <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>n and <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu</a> restricted to the vocabulary only. As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of Portugal and other <a href="Portuguese-speaking%20countries">Portuguese-speaking countries</a> (the dialects of the other countries, partly because of the more recent end of <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese colonialism</a> in these regions, have a closer connection to contemporary <a href="European%20Portuguese">European Portuguese</a>). These differences are comparable to those between <a href="American%20English">American</a> and <a href="British%20English">British English</a>.

Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors.
In 1990, the <a href="Community%20of%20Portuguese%20Language%20Countries">Community of Portuguese Language Countries</a> (CPLP), which included representatives from all countries with Portuguese as the official language, reached an <a href="Portuguese%20Language%20Orthographic%20Agreement%20of%201990">agreement on the reform of the Portuguese orthography</a> to unify the two standards then in use by Brazil on one side and the remaining lusophone countries on the other. This spelling reform went into effect in Brazil on 1 January 2009. In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the President on 21 July 2008 allowing for a 6-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies will co-exist. The remaining CPLP countries are free to establish their own transition timetables.

Minority languages are spoken throughout the nation. One hundred and eighty <a href="Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas">Amerindian language</a>s are spoken in remote areas and a significant number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants. In the municipality of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Gabriel%20da%20Cachoeira">São Gabriel da Cachoeira</a>, <a href="Nheengatu%20language">Nheengatu</a> (a currently endangered South American <a href="creole%20language">creole language</a> – or an 'anti-creole', according to some linguists – with mostly Indigenous Brazilian languages lexicon and Portuguese-based grammar that, together with its southern relative <a href="l%C3%ADngua%20geral%20paulista">língua geral paulista</a>, once was a major <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> in Brazil, being replaced by Portuguese only after governmental prohibition led by <a href="Suppression%20of%20the%20Society%20of%20Jesus%23Portugal">major political changes</a>), <a href="Baniwa%20language">Baniwa</a> and Tucano languages had been granted co-official status with Portuguese.

There are significant communities of German (mostly the <a href="Riograndenser%20Hunsr%C3%BCckisch">Brazilian Hunsrückisch</a>, a High German language dialect) and Italian (mostly the <a href="Talian%20dialect">Talian</a>, a <a href="Venetian%20language">Venetian</a> dialect) origins in the Southern and Southeastern regions, whose ancestors' native languages were carried along to Brazil, and which, still alive there, are influenced by the Portuguese language. Talian is officially a historic patrimony of <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, and two German dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities.

Learning at least one second language (generally English or Spanish) is mandatory for all the 12 grades of the mandatory <a href="Education%20in%20Brazil">education system</a> (<a href="primary%20education">primary</a> and <a href="secondary%20education">secondary education</a>, there called "ensino fundamental" and "ensino médio" respectively). Brazil is the first country in South America to offer <a href="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> to secondary students.
The core culture of Brazil is derived from <a href="Culture%20of%20Portugal">Portuguese culture</a>, because of its strong colonial ties with the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese empire</a>. Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese language</a>, <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a> and <a href="Manueline">colonial architectural styles</a>. The culture was, however, also strongly influenced by <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20of%20Africa">African</a>, <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Brazil">indigenous</a> and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.

Some aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of <a href="Italian%20Brazilian">Italian</a>, <a href="German%20Brazilian">German</a> and other European as well <a href="Japanese%20Brazilian">Japanese</a>, <a href="Jewish%20Brazilian">Jewish</a> and <a href="Arab%20Brazilian">Arab</a> immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil during the 19th and 20th centuries. The indigenous Amerindians influenced Brazil's language and <a href="Brazilian%20cuisine">cuisine</a>; and the Africans influenced language, cuisine, <a href="Music%20of%20Brazil">music</a>, dance and religion.

<a href="Brazilian%20art">Brazilian art</a> has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from <a href="Baroque%20in%20Brazil">Baroque</a> (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century) to <a href="Brazilian%20academic%20art">Romanticism</a>, <a href="Modern%20art">Modernism</a>, <a href="Expressionism">Expressionism</a>, <a href="Cubism">Cubism</a>, <a href="Surrealism">Surrealism</a> and <a href="Abstract%20art">Abstractionism</a>. <a href="Cinema%20of%20Brazil">Brazilian cinema</a> dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s.

The architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal. It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time when <a href="Pedro%20%C3%81lvares%20Cabral">Pedro Cabral</a> discovered Brazil in 1500. <a href="Portuguese%20colonial%20architecture">Portuguese colonial architecture</a> was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil. It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries. In the 19th century during the time of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a>, Brazil followed European trends and adopted <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical</a> and <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival architecture</a>. Then in the 20th century especially in Brasilia, Brazil experimented with <a href="Modernist%20architecture">Modernist architecture</a>.

The colonial architecture of Brazil dates to the early 16th century when Brazil was first explored, conquered and settled by the Portuguese. The Portuguese built architecture familiar to them in Europe in their aim to colonise Brazil. They built Portuguese colonial architecture which included Churches, civic architecture including houses and forts in Brazilian cities and the countryside. During 19th Century Brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil such as Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of Brazilian architecture. In the 1950s the <a href="modernist%20architecture">modernist architecture</a> was introduced when <a href="Brasilia">Brasilia</a> was built as new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior. The architect <a href="Oscar%20Niemeyer">Oscar Niemeyer</a> idealized and built Government buildings, Churches and civic buildings was constructed in the modernist style.

The music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European and African elements. Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with influence of Viennese classicism. The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments that had a bigger role in the development of popular music and folk, flourishing especially in the twentieth century.

Popular music since the late eighteenth century began to show signs of forming a characteristically Brazilian sound, with <a href="samba">samba</a> considered the most typical and on the UNESCO cultural heritage list. <a href="Maracatu">Maracatu</a> and <a href="Afox%C3%AA">Afoxê</a> are two <a href="Afro-Brazilian">Afro-Brazilian</a> music traditions that have been popularized by their appearance in the annual <a href="Brazilian%20Carnival">Brazilian Carnival</a>s. The sport of <a href="capoeira">capoeira</a> is usually played with its own music referred to as <a href="capoeira%20music">capoeira music</a>, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music.

<a href="Choro">Choro</a> is a very popular music instrumental style. Its origins are in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro. In spite of the name, the style often has a fast and happy rhythm, characterized by virtuosity, improvisation, subtle <a href="Modulation%20%28music%29">modulations</a> and full of <a href="syncopation">syncopation</a> and <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>. <a href="Bossa%20nova">Bossa nova</a> is also a well-known style of Brazilian music developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. The phrase "bossa nova" means literally "new trend". A lyrical fusion of samba and <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, bossa nova acquired a large following starting in the 1960s.
<a href="Brazilian%20literature">Brazilian literature</a> dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as <a href="P%C3%AAro%20Vaz%20de%20Caminha">Pêro Vaz de Caminha</a>, filled with descriptions of <a href="fauna">fauna</a>, <a href="flora">flora</a> and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers.

Brazil produced significant works in <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> – novelists like <a href="Joaquim%20Manuel%20de%20Macedo">Joaquim Manuel de Macedo</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Alencar">José de Alencar</a> wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated indigenous people as heroes in the <a href="Indianism%20%28arts%29">Indigenist</a> novels "<a href="The%20Guarani">O Guarani</a>", "<a href="Iracema">Iracema</a>" and "<a href="Ubirajara">Ubirajara</a>". <a href="Machado%20de%20Assis">Machado de Assis</a>, one of his contemporaries, wrote in virtually all genres and continues to gain international prestige from critics worldwide.

The <a href="Brazilian%20literature%23Modernism">Brazilian Modernism</a>, evidenced by the <a href="Week%20of%20Modern%20Art">Week of Modern Art</a> in 1922, was concerned with a nationalist avant-garde literature, while <a href="Brazilian%20literature%23Post-Modernism">Post-Modernism</a> brought a generation of distinct poets like <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Cabral%20de%20Melo%20Neto">João Cabral de Melo Neto</a>, <a href="Carlos%20Drummond%20de%20Andrade">Carlos Drummond de Andrade</a>, <a href="Vinicius%20de%20Moraes">Vinicius de Moraes</a>, <a href="Cora%20Coralina">Cora Coralina</a>, <a href="Graciliano%20Ramos">Graciliano Ramos</a>, <a href="Cec%C3%ADlia%20Meireles">Cecília Meireles</a>, and internationally known writers dealing with universal and regional subjects like <a href="Jorge%20Amado">Jorge Amado</a>, <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Guimar%C3%A3es%20Rosa">João Guimarães Rosa</a>, <a href="Clarice%20Lispector">Clarice Lispector</a> and <a href="Manuel%20Bandeira">Manuel Bandeira</a>.

Brazilian cuisine varies greatly by region, reflecting the country's varying mix of indigenous and immigrant populations. This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences. Examples are <a href="Feijoada">Feijoada</a>, considered the country's national dish; and regional foods such as , , <a href="vatap%C3%A1">vatapá</a>, <a href="moqueca">moqueca</a>, <a href="polenta">polenta</a> (from Italian cuisine) and <a href="acaraj%C3%A9">acarajé</a> (from African cuisine).

The national beverage is <a href="coffee">coffee</a> and <a href="cacha%C3%A7a">cachaça</a> is Brazil's native <a href="Distilled%20beverage">liquor</a>. Cachaça is distilled from <a href="Sugarcane">sugar cane</a> and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, <a href="Caipirinha">Caipirinha</a>.

A typical meal consists mostly of <a href="rice%20and%20beans">rice and beans</a> with <a href="beef">beef</a>, <a href="salad">salad</a>, <a href="french%20fries">french fries</a> and a <a href="fried%20egg">fried egg</a>. Often, it's mixed with cassava flour (<a href="farofa">farofa</a>). Fried potatoes, fried cassava, fried banana, fried meat and fried cheese are very often eaten in lunch and served in most typical restaurants. Popular snacks are <a href="pastel%20%28food%29">pastel</a> (a fried pastry); <a href="coxinha">coxinha</a> (a variation of chicken croquete); <a href="p%C3%A3o%20de%20queijo">pão de queijo</a> (cheese bread and cassava flour / <a href="tapioca">tapioca</a>); <a href="pamonha">pamonha</a> (corn and milk paste); <a href="sfiha">esfirra</a> (a variation of Lebanese pastry); <a href="kibbeh">kibbeh</a> (from Arabic cuisine); <a href="empanada">empanada</a> (pastry) and <a href="empada">empada</a>, little salt pies filled with shrimps or heart of palm.

Brazil has a variety of desserts such as <a href="brigadeiro">brigadeiro</a>s (chocolate fudge balls), <a href="bolo%20de%20rolo">bolo de rolo</a> (roll cake with <a href="goiabada">goiabada</a>), <a href="cocada">cocada</a> (a coconut sweet), <a href="beijinho">beijinho</a>s (coconut truffles and clove) and romeu e julieta (cheese with goiabada). Peanuts are used to make <a href="pa%C3%A7oca">paçoca</a>, <a href="rapadura">rapadura</a> and <a href="p%C3%A9-de-moleque">pé-de-moleque</a>.

The Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the <a href="Belle%20%C3%89poque">Belle Époque</a>. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as "Rio the Magnificent" were made in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> to promote tourism in the city. The films "<a href="Limite">Limite</a>" (1931) and "<a href="Ganga%20Bruta">Ganga Bruta</a>" (1933), the latter being produced by <a href="Adhemar%20Gonzaga">Adhemar Gonzaga</a> through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time. The 1941 unfinished film "<a href="It%27s%20All%20True%20%28film%29">It's All True</a>" was divided in four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>; it was originally produced as part of the United States' <a href="Good%20Neighbor%20Policy">Good Neighbor Policy</a> during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo government.

During the 1960s the <a href="Cinema%20Novo">Cinema Novo</a> movement rose to prominence with directors such as <a href="Glauber%20Rocha">Glauber Rocha</a>, <a href="Nelson%20Pereira%20dos%20Santos">Nelson Pereira dos Santos</a>, <a href="Paulo%20Cesar%20Saraceni">Paulo Cesar Saraceni</a> and <a href="Arnaldo%20Jabor">Arnaldo Jabor</a>. Rocha's films "<a href="Deus%20e%20o%20Diabo%20na%20Terra%20do%20Sol">Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol</a>" (1964) and "<a href="Terra%20em%20Transe">Terra em Transe</a>" (1967) are considered to be some of the greatest and most influential in Brazilian film history.

During the 1990s Brazil saw a surge of critical and commercial success with films such as "<a href="O%20Quatrilho">O Quatrilho</a>" (<a href="F%C3%A1bio%20Barreto">Fábio Barreto</a>, 1995), "<a href="O%20Que%20%C3%89%20Isso%2C%20Companheiro%3F">O Que É Isso, Companheiro?</a>" (<a href="Bruno%20Barreto">Bruno Barreto</a>, 1997) and "<a href="Central%20Station%20%28film%29">Central do Brasil</a>" (<a href="Walter%20Salles">Walter Salles</a>, 1998), all of which were nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</a>, the latter receiving a <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> nomination for <a href="Fernanda%20Montenegro">Fernanda Montenegro</a>.

The theatre in Brazil has its origins in the period of Jesuit expansion when theater was used for the dissemination of Catholic doctrine in the 16th century. in the 17th and 18th centuries the first dramatists who appeared on the scene of European derivation was for court or private performances. During the 19th century, dramatic theater gained importance and thickness, whose first representative was <a href="Luis%20Carlos%20Martins%20Pena">Luis Carlos Martins Pena</a> (1813–1848), capable of describing contemporary reality. Always in this period the comedy of costume and comic production was imposed. Significant, also in the nineteenth century, was also the playwright <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20Gon%C3%A7alves%20Dias">Antônio Gonçalves Dias</a>. There were also numerous operas and orchestras. The Brazilian conductor <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20Carlos%20Gomes">Antônio Carlos Gomes</a> became internationally known with operas like "<a href="Il%20Guarany">Il Guarany</a>". At the end of century 19th century orchestrated dramaturgias became very popular and were accompanied of songs of famous artists like the conductress <a href="Chiquinha%20Gonzaga">Chiquinha Gonzaga</a>.

Already in the early 20th century there was the presence of theaters, entrepreneurs and actor companies, but paradoxically the quality of the products staggered, and only in 1940 the Brazilian theater received a boost of renewal thanks to the action of Paschoal Carlos Magno and his student's theater, the comedians group and the Italian actors <a href="Adolfo%20Celi">Adolfo Celi</a>, Ruggero Jacobbi and Aldo Calvo, founders of the "Teatro Brasileiro de Comedia". From the 1960s it was attended by a theater dedicated to social and religious issues and to the flourishing of schools of dramatic art. The most prominent authors at this stage were <a href="Jorge%20Andrade">Jorge Andrade</a> and <a href="Ariano%20Suassuna">Ariano Suassuna</a>.

Brazilian painting emerged in the late 16th century, influenced by <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a>, <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a>, <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassicism</a>, <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>, <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">Realism</a>, <a href="Modernism">Modernism</a>, <a href="Expressionism">Expressionism</a>, <a href="Surrealism">Surrealism</a>, <a href="Cubism">Cubism</a> and <a href="Abstract%20art">Abstracionism</a> making it a major <a href="Style%20%28visual%20arts%29">art style</a> called <a href="Brazilian%20academic%20art">Brazilian academic art</a>. The <a href="Miss%C3%A3o%20Art%C3%ADstica%20Francesa">Missão Artística Francesa</a> (French Artistic Mission) arrived in Brazil in 1816 proposing the creation of an art academy modeled after the respected Académie des Beaux-Arts, with graduation courses both for artists and craftsmen for activities such as modeling, decorating, carpentry and others and bringing artists like <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Debret">Jean-Baptiste Debret</a>.

Upon the creation of the <a href="Academia%20Imperial%20de%20Belas%20Artes">Imperial Academy of Fine Arts</a>, new artistic movements spread across te country during the 19th century and later the event called <a href="Week%20of%20Modern%20Art">Week of Modern Art</a> broke definitely with academic tradition in 1922 and started a nationalist trend which was influenced by modernist arts. Among the best-known Brazilian painters are <a href="Ricardo%20do%20Pilar">Ricardo do Pilar</a> and <a href="Manuel%20da%20Costa%20Ata%C3%ADde">Manuel da Costa Ataíde</a> (baroque and rococo), <a href="Victor%20Meirelles">Victor Meirelles</a>, <a href="Pedro%20Am%C3%A9rico">Pedro Américo</a> and <a href="Almeida%20Junior">Almeida Junior</a> (romanticism and realism), <a href="Anita%20Malfatti">Anita Malfatti</a>, <a href="Ismael%20Nery">Ismael Nery</a>, <a href="Lasar%20Segall">Lasar Segall</a>, <a href="Emiliano%20di%20Cavalcanti">Emiliano di Cavalcanti</a>, <a href="Vicente%20do%20Rego%20Monteiro">Vicente do Rego Monteiro</a>, and <a href="Tarsila%20do%20Amaral">Tarsila do Amaral</a> (expressionism, surrealism and cubism), <a href="Aldo%20Bonadei">Aldo Bonadei</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Pancetti">José Pancetti</a> and <a href="C%C3%A2ndido%20Portinari">Cândido Portinari</a> (modernism).

The most popular sport in Brazil is <a href="association%20football">football</a>. The <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazilian men's national team</a> is ranked among the best in the world according to the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Rankings">FIFA World Rankings</a>, and has won the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> tournament a record five times.

<a href="Volleyball">Volleyball</a>, <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, <a href="auto%20racing">auto racing</a>, and <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a> also attract large audiences.

Black Forest

The Black Forest (, ) is a large <a href="forest">forest</a>ed <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a> in the state of <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a> in south-west of <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. It is bounded by the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> valley to the west and south. Its highest peak is the <a href="Feldberg%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Feldberg</a> with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898 ft). The region is roughly oblong in shape with a length of and breadth of up to . 

The Black Forest stretches from the <a href="High%20Rhine">High Rhine</a> in the south to the in the north. In the west it is bounded by the <a href="Upper%20Rhine%20Plain">Upper Rhine Plain</a> (which, from a natural region perspective, also includes the low chain of foothills); in the east it transitions to the , and hill country west of the . The Black Forest is the highest part of the <a href="South%20German%20Scarplands">South German Scarplands</a> and much of it is densely <a href="forest">wooded</a>, a fragment of the <a href="Hercynian%20Forest">Hercynian Forest</a> of Antiquity. It lies upon rocks of the <a href="crystalline%20basement">crystalline basement</a> and <a href="Bunter%20Sandstone">Bunter Sandstone</a>, and its natural boundary with the surrounding landscapes is formed by the emergence of , which is absent from the Black Forest bedrock. Thanks to the fertility of the soil which is dependent on the underlying rock, this line is both a vegetation boundary as well as the border between the ("old settlement land") and the Black Forest, which was not permanently settled until the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a>. From north to south the Black Forest extends for over , attaining a width of up to 50 kilometres in the south, and up to 30 kilometres in the north (). <a href="Tectonically">Tectonically</a> the range forms a lifted <a href="fault%20block">fault block</a>, which rises prominently in the west from the Upper Rhine Plain, whilst seen from the east it has the appearance of a heavily forested plateau.

The <a href="natural%20region">natural region</a>s of the Black Forest are separated by various features:

<a href="Geomorphologically">Geomorphologically</a>, the main division is between the gentle eastern slopes with their mostly rounded hills and broad plateaux (so-called <a href="Danube">Danubian</a> <a href="relief%20%28geology%29">relief</a>, especially prominent in the north and east on the Bunter Sandstone) and the deeply incised, steeply falling terrain in the west that drops into the <a href="Upper%20Rhine%20Graben">Upper Rhine Graben</a>; the so-called Valley Black Forest ("") with its <a href="Rhine">Rhenanian</a> relief. It is here, in the west, where the highest mountains and the greatest local differences in height (of up to 1000 metres) are found. The valleys are often narrow and ravine-like; but rarely basin-shaped. The summits are rounded and there are also the remnants of plateaux and -like landforms.

Geologically the clearest division is also between east and west. Large areas of the eastern Black Forest, the lowest layer of the <a href="Swabian-Franconian%20Scarpland">South German Scarplands</a> composed of <a href="Bunter%20Sandstone">Bunter Sandstone</a>, are covered by seemingly endless coniferous forest with their island clearings. The exposed <a href="basement%20%28geology%29">basement</a> in the west, predominantly made up of <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a>s and <a href="granite">granite</a>s, was, despite its rugged topography, easier to settle and appears much more open and inviting today with its varied meadow valleys.
The most common way of dividing the regions of the Black Forest is, however, from north to south. Until the 1930s, the Black Forest was divided into the Northern and Southern Black Forest, the boundary being the <a href="Kinzig%20%28Rhine%29">line of the valley</a>. Later the Black Forest was divided into the heavily forested <a href="Northern%20Black%20Forest">Northern Black Forest</a>, the lower, central section, predominantly used for agriculture in the valleys, was the <a href="Central%20Black%20Forest">Central Black Forest</a> and the much higher <a href="Southern%20Black%20Forest">Southern Black Forest</a> with its distinctive highland economy and <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a> glacial relief. The term <a href="High%20Black%20Forest">High Black Forest</a> referred to the highest areas of the South and southern Central Black Forest.

The boundaries drawn were, however, quite varied. In 1931, called the Central Black Forest the catchment area of the and in the west the section up to the lower and tributary of the . A pragmatic division, which is oriented not just on natural and cultural regions, uses the most important transverse valleys. Based on that, the Central Black Forest is bounded by the in the north and the line from to in the south, corresponding to the zone and the course of the present day <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%2031">B 31</a>.

In 1959, combined the earlier divisions and proposed a modified tripartite division himself, which combined natural and cultural regional approaches and was widely used. His Central Black Forest is bounded in the north by the <a href="drainage%20divide">watershed</a> between the and and subsequently between the and or and , in the south by the zone, which restricts the Black Forest in the east as does the further north by its transition into the Northern Black Forest.

The <a href="Handbook%20of%20the%20Natural%20Region%20Divisions%20of%20Germany">Handbook of the Natural Region Divisions of Germany</a> published by the Federal Office of Regional Geography ("") since the early 1950s names the Black Forest as one of six tertiary level major landscape regions within the secondary level region of the <a href="South%20German%20Scarplands">South German Scarplands</a> and, at the same time, one of nine new major landscape unit groups. It is divided into six so-called major units (level 4 landscapes). This division was refined and modified in several, successor publications (1:200,000 individual map sheets) up to 1967, each covering individual sections of the map. The mountain range was also divided into three regions. The northern boundary of the Central Black Forest in this classification runs south of the Valley and the to near . Its southern boundary varied with each edition.

In 1998 the State Department for Environmental Protection (today the State Department for the Environment, Survey and Nature Conservation) published a reworked Natural Region Division of . It is restricted to the level of the natural regional major units and has been used since for the state's administration of nature conservation:

The Black Forest Foothills (', 150) geomorphologically form plateaux on the north and northeast periphery of the mountain range that descend to the in the north and the landscapes in the east. They are incised by valleys, especially those of the <a href="Nagold%20%28river%29">Nagold</a> river system, into individual <a href="interfluve">interfluve</a>s; a narrow northwestern finger extends to beyond the near and also borders the middle reaches of the to the west as far as a point immediately above . To the southwest it is adjoined by the Black Forest ' and Hills (', 151), along the upper reaches of the and , forming the heart of the Northern Black Forest. The west of the Northern Black Forest is formed by the Northern Black Forest Valleys (', 152) with the middle reaches of the around , the middle course of the to , the middle reaches of the above and the upper reaches of the around . Their exit valleys from the mountain range are all oriented towards the northwest.
The Central Black Forest (153) is mainly restricted to the <a href="drainage%20basin">catchment area</a> of the River above as well as the and the low hills north of the .

The Southeastern Black Forest (', 154) consists mainly of the catchment areas of the upper reaches of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> headstreams, the and as well as the left side valleys of the north of – and thus draining from the northeast of the Southern Black Forest. To the south and west it is adjoined by the High Black Forest (', 155) with the highest summits in the whole range around the and the . Its eastern part, the Southern Black Forest Plateau, is oriented towards the Danube, but drained over the and the into the Rhine. The southern crest of the Black Forest in the west is deeply incised by the Rhine into numerous ridges. Immediately right of the above rises the relatively small Bunter Sandstone- table of the Uplands ("") in the extreme southwest of the Black Forest; morphologically, geologically and climatically it is separate from the other parts of the Southern Black Forest and, in this classification, is also counted as part of the High Black Forest.

At the in the Southern Black Forest is the range's highest summit. Also in the same area are the () and the ().

In general the mountains of the Southern or High Black Forest are higher than those in the Northern Black Forest. The highest Black Forest peak north of the line is the (). Like the highest point of the Northern Black Forest, the (), or the Southern Black Forest lookout mountains, the () and () it lies near the western rim of the range.

Rivers in the Black Forest include the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> (which originates in the Black Forest as the confluence of the and rivers), the , the , the , the , the , the , and the . The Black Forest occupies part of the <a href="continental%20divide">continental divide</a> between the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a> (drained by the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>) and the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> drainage basin (drained by the Danube).

The longest Black Forest rivers are (length includes stretches outside the Black Forest):

Important lakes of natural, <a href="glacial">glacial</a> origin in the Black Forest include the , the and the . Especially in the Northern Black Forest are a number of other, smaller <a href="tarn%20%28lake%29">tarns</a>. Numerous <a href="reservoir">reservoir</a>s like the — formerly natural but much smaller — with the other lakes of the "<a href="Schluchseewerk">Schluchseewerk</a>", the <a href="Schwarzenbach%20Reservoir">Reservoir</a>, the <a href="Kleine%20Kinzig%20Reservoir">Reservoir</a> or the <a href="Nagold%20Reservoir">Reservoir</a> are used for <a href="electricity%20generation">electricity generation</a>, <a href="flood%20protection">flood protection</a> or <a href="drinking%20water">drinking water</a> supply.

The Black Forest consists of a cover of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> on top of a core of <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a> and <a href="granite">granite</a>s. Formerly it shared tectonic evolution with the nearby <a href="Vosges%20Mountains">Vosges Mountains</a>. Later during the Middle <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> a <a href="rifting">rifting</a> period affected the area and caused formation of the <a href="Rhine%20graben">Rhine</a>. During the last <a href="glacial%20period">glacial period</a> of the <a href="W%C3%BCrm%20glaciation">glaciation</a>, the Black Forest was covered by glaciers; several <a href="tarn%20%28lake%29">tarns (or lakes)</a> such as the are remains of this period.

Since the downfaulting of the <a href="Upper%20Rhine%20Graben">Upper Rhine Graben</a> during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> epoch, the two shoulders on either side have been uplifted: the Black Forest to the east and the <a href="Vosges">Vosges</a> to the west. In the centre lies the <a href="Kaiserstuhl%20%28Baden%29">volcano</a> which dates to the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>. In the times that followed, the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> <a href="platform%20%28geology%29">platform</a> on the uplands was largely eroded, apart from remains of <a href="bunter%20sandstone">bunter sandstone</a> and , but it has survived within the itself. During the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> a pronounced, but uneven bulge occurred which especially affected the southern Black Forest, including the . As a result, the upper surface of the <a href="basement%20%28geology%29">basement</a> in the northern part of the forest around the is considerably lower. In the central Black Forest, the tectonic <a href="syncline">syncline</a> of the and emerged.

The geological foundation of the Black Forest is formed by the crystalline bedrock of the <a href="Variscan%20Orogeny">Variscan</a> basement. This is covered in the east and northeast by bunter sandstone slabs, the so-called platforms. On the western edge a descending, <a href="step-fault">step-fault</a>-like, foothill zone borders the Upper Rhine consisting of rocks of the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> and <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> periods.

The dominant rocks of the basement are <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a> (ortho- and paragneisses, in the south also <a href="migmatite">migmatite</a>s and <a href="diatexite">diatexite</a>s, for example on the and ). These gneisses were penetrated by a number of granitic bodies during the <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> period. Among the bigger ones are the Granite and the <a href="Forbach%20Granite">Granite</a>, the youngest is the Granite. In the south lies the zone of , in which Palaeozoic rocks have been preserved (volcanite and sedimentary rocks), which are interpreted as the intercalated remains of a <a href="microcontinent">microcontinent</a>al collision. Still further in the southeast (around ) is a range of exotic inclusions: <a href="gabbro">gabbro</a> from , <a href="serpentinite">serpentinite</a>s and <a href="pyroxenite">pyroxenite</a>s near , <a href="norite">norite</a> near ), which are possibly the remnants of an <a href="accretionary%20wedge">accretionary wedge</a> from a continental collision. Also noteworthy are the basins in the , for example the or the Basin, with, in places thick, quartz-porphyry and <a href="tuff">tuff</a> plates (exposed, for example, on the rock massif of near ). Thick rock, covered by bunter, also occurs in the north of the block (several hundred metres thick in the Basel <a href="geothermal%20gradient">geothermal</a> borehole). Even further to the southeast, under the Jura, lies the North Swiss Permocarboniferous Basin.

Above the crystalline basement of the Northern Black Forest and the adjacent parts of the Central Black Forest the bunter sandstone platforms rise in prominent steps. The most resistant surface strata on the stepped terrain of the "" uplands and the heights around the upper reaches of the , which have been heavily eroded by the tributaries of the , is the silicified main conglomerate (Middle Bunter). To the east and north are the <a href="nappe">nappe</a>s of the Upper Bunter (platten sandstones and red clays). South of the the bunter sandstone zone narrows to a fringe in the east of the mountain range.

It is considered proven that the Black Forest was heavily glaciated during the peak periods of at least the <a href="Riss%20glaciation">Riss</a> and <a href="W%C3%BCrm%20glaciation">glaciations</a>. (up to about 10,000 years ago). This glacial geomorphology characterizes almost all of the High Black Forest as well as the main ridge of the Northern Black Forest. Apart from that, it is only discernible from a large number of <a href="cirque">cirque</a>s mainly facing northeast. Especially in this direction snow accumulated on the shaded and leeward slopes of the summit plateau to form short cirque glaciers that made the sides of these funnel-shaped depressions. There are still <a href="tarn%20%28lake%29">tarns</a> in some of these old cirques, partly a result of the <a href="wikt%3Aanthropogenic">anthropogenic</a> elevation of the low-side lip of the cirque, such as the , , , , , and . The formed as <a href="glacial%20lake">glacial lake</a> behind a glacial <a href="moraine">moraine</a>.

Climatically the mountain range differs from its surrounding countryside in having lower temperatures and higher rainfall. The highlands of the Black Forest are characterized by regular rainfall throughout the year. However, temperatures do not fall evenly with increasing elevation, nor does the rainfall increase uniformly. Rather, the precipitation rises quickly even in the lower regions and is disproportionately heavy on the rainier western side of the mountains.

The wettest areas are the highlands around the Hornisgrinde in the north and around the Belchen and Feldberg in the south, where annual rainfall reaches 1,800-2,100 mm. Moisture-laden Atlantic westerlies dump about as much rain in the Northern Black Forest, despite its lower elevation, than in the higher area of the Southern Black Forest. There, the Vosges act as a rain shield in the face of the prevailing winds. On the exposed east side of the Central Black Forest, it is much drier again. Thus, the annual rainfall here is only about 750 l/m² in places.

Thermally, the higher elevations of the Black Forest are characterized by relatively small annual fluctuations and steamed extreme values. This is due to the frequent light winds and greater cloud cover in summer. During the winter months, frequent high pressure means that the summits are often bathed in sunshine, while the valleys disappear under a thick blanket of fog as a result of pockets of cold air (<a href="temperature%20inversion">temperature inversion</a>).

In ancient times, the Black Forest was known as "<a href="Abnoba%20mons">Abnoba mons</a>", after the Celtic deity, <a href="Abnoba">Abnoba</a>. In Roman times (<a href="Late%20Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a>), it was given the name "Marciana Silva" ("Marcynian Forest", from the Germanic word "marka" = "border"). The Black Forest probably represented the border area of the <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a> ("border people") who were settled east of the Roman "<a href="limes">limes</a>". They, in turn, were part of the Germanic tribe of <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>, who subsequently gave their name to the historic state of <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>. With the exception of Roman settlements on the perimeter (e.g. the baths in Badenweiler, and mines near Badenweiler and Sulzburg) and the construction of the Roman road of <a href="Kinzig%20%28Rhine%29">Kinzigtalstraße</a>, the colonization of the Black Forest was not carried out by the Romans, but by the <a href="Alemanni">Alemanni</a>. They settled and first colonized the valleys, crossing the old <a href="settlement%20boundary">settlement boundary</a>, the so-called "red sandstone border", for example, from the region of <a href="Baar%20%28region%29">Baar</a>. Soon afterwards, increasingly higher areas and adjacent forests were colonized, so that by the end of the 10th century, the first settlements could be found in the red (bunter) sandstone region. These include, for example, <a href="R%C3%B6tenbach%20%28Friedenweiler%29">Rötenbach</a>, which was first mentioned in 819.

Some of the uprisings (including the <a href="Bundschuh%20movement">Bundschuh movement</a>) that preceded the <a href="German%20Peasants%27%20War">German Peasants' War</a>, originated in the 16th century from the Black Forest. Further peasant unrest, in the shape of the <a href="saltpetre">saltpetre</a> uprisings, took place over the next two centuries in <a href="Hotzenwald">Hotzenwald</a>.

Remnants of military fortifications dating from the 17th and 18th centuries can be found in the Black Forest, especially on the mountain passes. Examples include the multiple baroque fieldworks of Margrave <a href="Louis%20William%20of%20Baden-Baden">Louis William of Baden-Baden</a> or individual defensive positions such as Alexander's Redoubt, the "Röschenschanze" and the Swedish Redoubt ("Schwedenschanze").

Originally, the Black Forest was a mixed forest of deciduous trees and firs - see the <a href="history%20of%20the%20forest%20in%20Central%20Europe">history of the forest in Central Europe</a>. At the higher elevations <a href="spruce">spruce</a> also grew. In the middle of the 19th century, the Black Forest was almost completely deforested by intensive forestry and was subsequently replanted, mostly with spruce <a href="monoculture">monoculture</a>s.

In 1990, extensive damage to the forest was caused by Hurricanes <a href="Vivian%20%28hurricane%29">Vivian</a> and <a href="Wiebke%20%28hurricane%29">Wiebke</a>. On 26 December 1999, <a href="Cyclone%20Lothar%20and%20Martin">Hurricane Lothar</a> raged across the Black Forest and caused even greater damage, especially to the spruce monocultures. As had happened following the 1990 storms, large quantities of fallen logs were kept in provisional wet storage areas for years. The effects of the storm are demonstrated by the <a href="Lothar%20Path">Lothar Path</a>, a forest educational and adventure trail at the nature centre in <a href="Ruhestein">Ruhestein</a> on a highland timber forest of about 10 hectares that was destroyed by a hurricane.

Several areas of storm damage, both large and small, were left to nature and have developed today into a natural mixed forest again.

Mining developed in the Black Forest due to its ore deposits, which were often lode-shaped. The formation of these deposits (<a href="Schauinsland%20Pit">Schauinsland Pit</a>: <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, about 700–1000 g <a href="silver">silver</a>/ton of lead; <a href="baryte">baryte</a>, <a href="fluorite">fluorite</a>, less lead and zinc in the Kinzig valley; <a href="BiCoNi%20Formation">BiCoNi</a> ores near <a href="Wittichen">Wittichen</a>, <a href="uranium">uranium</a> discovered in the <a href="Krunkelbach%20Pit">Krunkelbach valley</a> near <a href="Menzenschwand">Menzenschwand</a> but never officially mined) often used to be linked to the intrusion of Carboniferous granite in the para- and orthogneisses. More recent research has revealed that most of these lode fillings are much younger (<a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> to <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a>). Economic deposits of other minerals included: fluorite in the Northern Black Forest near <a href="Pforzheim">Pforzheim</a>, baryte in the central region near <a href="Freudenstadt">Freudenstadt</a>, fluorite along with lead and silver near Wildschapbach, baryte and fluorite in the Rankach valley and near Ohlsbach, in the Southern Black Forest near <a href="Todtnau">Todtnau</a>, <a href="Wieden%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Wieden</a> and Urberg.

Small liquid magmatic deposits of nickel-magnetite gravel in <a href="norite">norite</a> were mined or prospected in the Hotzenwald forest near Horbach and <a href="Todtmoos">Todtmoos</a>. Strata-bound deposits include iron ores in the Dogger layer of the foothill zone and uranium near Müllenbach/Baden-Baden. <a href="Stone%20coal">Stone coal</a> is only found near <a href="Berghaupten">Berghaupten</a> and <a href="Hohberg">Diersburg</a>, but was always only of local importance.

Chronology: <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> mining of <a href="haematite">haematite</a> (as red pigment) near <a href="Sulzburg">Sulzburg</a>. By the 5th and 6th centuries B.C. <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> was being mined by the <a href="Celts">Celts</a> in the Northern Black Forest (for example in <a href="Neuenb%C3%BCrg">Neuenbürg</a>). Especially in the Middle Black Forest, but also in the south (for example in the <a href="M%C3%BCnstertal/Schwarzwald">Münster valley</a>) ore mining was already probably taking place in Roman times (<a href="mining">mining</a> of silver and lead ore; evidence of this at Sulzburg and possibly <a href="Badenweiler">Badenweiler</a>). Until the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a> the High Black Forest was practically unsettled. In the course of inland colonisation in the Late High Middle Ages even the highlands were cultivated by settlers from the abbeys (<a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Abbey%2C%20Black%20Forest">St. Peter's</a>, <a href="St.%20M%C3%A4rgen%27s%20Abbey">St. Märgen's</a>). In the Late High Middle Ages (from about 1100) mining experienced another boom, especially around Todtnau, in the Münster and Suggen valleys and, later, on the <a href="Schauinsland">Schauinsland</a> too. It is believed that around 800–1,000 miners lived and worked in the Münster valley until the end of the Middle Ages. After the Plague, which afflicted the valley in 1516, the <a href="German%20Peasants%27%20War">German Peasants' War</a> (1524–26) and the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>, mining in the region declined until just a few pits remained.

An important mining area was the <a href="Kinzig%20%28Rhine%29">Kinzig valley</a> and its side valleys. The small mining settlement of <a href="Wittichen%20Abbey">Wittichen</a> near <a href="Schenkenzell">Schenkenzell</a> in the upper Kinzig valley had many pits in which in <a href="baryte">baryte</a>, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> and <a href="silver">silver</a> of many kinds were mined. A circular, geological footpath runs today past the old pits and <a href="tip%20%28mining%29">tips</a>.

Another boom began in the early 18th century after the loss of the <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> to France. It lasted until the 19th century. May pits from this period may be visited today as <a href="show%20mine">show mine</a>s; for example the Teufelsgrund Pit (<a href="M%C3%BCnstertal/Schwarzwald">Münstertal</a>), the <a href="Finstergrund">Finstergrund</a> Pit near Wieden, the Hoffnungsstollen ("Hope Gallery") at Todtmoos, the mine in the <a href="Schauinsland">Schauinsland</a>, the formerly especially silver-rich <a href="Wenzel%20Pit">Wenzel Pit</a> in <a href="Oberwolfach">Oberwolfach</a> and Gr. <a href="Segen%20Gottes%20Show%20Mine">Segen Gottes</a> ("God's Great Blessing") in <a href="Haslach%20im%20Kinzigtal">Haslach</a>-Schnellingen.

Non-ferrous metal mining in the Black Forest continued until the middle of the 20th century near <a href="Bad%20Rippoldsau-Schapbach">Wildschapbach</a> and on the Schauinsland (to 1954); fluorite and baryte are still mined today at the <a href="Clara%20Pit">Clara Pit</a> in the Rankach valley in <a href="Oberwolfach">Oberwolfach</a>. Iron ores of the Dogger formation was worked until the 1970s near <a href="Ringsheim">Ringsheim</a> and was smelted in <a href="Kehl">Kehl</a>.

Compared with the <a href="Harz">Harz</a> and <a href="Ore%20Mountains">Ore Mountains</a> the quantities of silver extracted in the Black Forest were rather modest and reached only about 10 per cent of that produced in the other silver-mining regions.

There are many <a href="show%20mine">show mine</a>s in the Black Forest. These include:
the Frischglück Pit near <a href="Neuenb%C3%BCrg">Neuenbürg</a>, the Hella Glück Pit near <a href="Neubulach">Neubulach</a>, the Silbergründle Pit near <a href="Seebach%20%28Baden%29">Seebach</a>, the Himmlich Heer Pit near <a href="Hallwangen">Hallwangen</a>, the Heilige Drei Könige Pit near <a href="Freudenstadt">Freudenstadt</a>, the <a href="Segen%20Gottes%20Pit">Segen Gottes Pit</a> near <a href="Haslach%20im%20Kinzigtal">Haslach</a>, the Wenzel Pit near <a href="Oberwolfach">Oberwolfach</a>, the <a href="Caroline%20Pit">Caroline Pit</a> near <a href="Sexau">Sexau</a>, the Suggental Silver Mine near <a href="Waldkirch">Waldkirch</a>, the Schauinsland Pit near <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg</a>, the Teufelsgrund Pit near <a href="M%C3%BCnstertal/Schwarzwald">Münstertal</a>, the Finstergrund Pit near <a href="Wieden%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Wieden</a> and the Hoffnungsstollen Pit near <a href="Todtmoos">Todtmoos</a>.

For several centuries logs from the Black Forest were rafted down the <a href="Enz">Enz</a>, <a href="Kinzig%20%28Rhine%29">Kinzig</a>, <a href="Murg%20%28Northern%20Black%20Forest%29">Murg</a>, <a href="Nagold%20%28river%29">Nagold</a> and <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> rivers for use in the <a href="ship">ship</a>ping industry, as construction <a href="timber">timber</a> and for other purposes. This branch of industry boomed in the 18th century and led to large-scale clearances. As most of the long, straight pine logs were transported downriver for shipbuilding in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, they were referred to as "Dutchmen". The logs were used in the Netherlands, above all, as <a href="Pile%20%28type%20of%20foundation%29">piles</a> for house construction in the sandy and wet ground. Even today in Amsterdam large numbers of historic building are built on these posts and the reforestation of the Black Forest with spruce <a href="monoculture">monoculture</a>s testifies to the destruction of the original <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed forest</a>. With the expansion of the railway and road network as alternative transportation, rafting largely came to an end in the late 19th century.

Today, fir trees, especially those which are very tall and branchless to a great height, are shipped mainly to Japan. The global advertising impact of <a href="Expo%202000">Expo 2000</a> fuelled a resurgence of timber exports. The importance of the timber resources of the Black Forest has also increased sharply recently due to the increasing demand for <a href="wood%20pellet">wood pellet</a>s for heating.

The timber resources of the Black Forest provided the basis for other sectors of the economy that have now largely disappeared. <a href="Charcoal%20burner">Charcoal burner</a>s ("Köhler") built their wood piles ("Meiler") in the woods and produced charcoal which, like the products of the <a href="potash">potash</a> boilers - further processed "inter alia" for the <a href="glassmaking">glassmaking</a> industry. The Black Forest supplied raw materials and energy for the manufacture of <a href="forest%20glass">forest glass</a>. This is evinced today by a number of <a href="glassblowing">glassblowing</a> houses e.g. in the Hoellental in Todtnau and <a href="Wolfach">Wolfach</a> and the Forest Glass Centre in <a href="Gersbach%20%28Schopfheim%29">Gersbach (Schopfheim)</a>, which is open to visitors.

In the relatively inaccessible Black Forest valleys <a href="industrialization">industrialization</a> did not arrive until late in the day. In winter, many <a href="farmer">farmer</a>s made wooden <a href="cuckoo%20clock">cuckoo clock</a>s to supplement their income. This developed in the 19th century into the <a href="precision%20engineering">precision engineering</a> and watch industry, which boomed with the arrival of the railway in many of the Black Forest valleys. The initial disadvantage of their remote location, which led to the development of precision-engineered wooden handicrafts, became a competitive advantage because of their access to raw materials: timber from the forest and metal from the mines. As part of a structural support programme the Baden State Government founded the first clockmaking school in 1850 in <a href="Furtwangen">Furtwangen</a> to ensure that small artisans were given good training and thus better sales opportunities. Due to the increasing demand for mechanical devices, large companies such as <a href="Junghans">Junghans</a> and <a href="Kienzle%20Uhren">Kienzle</a> became established. In the 20th century, the production of consumer electronics was developed by companies such as <a href="SABA%20%28electronics%20manufacturer%29">SABA</a>, <a href="Dual%20%28brand%29">Dual</a> and <a href="Harman%20Becker%20Automotive%20Systems">Becker</a>. In the 1970s, the industry declined due to Far Eastern competition. Nevertheless, the Black Forest remains a centre for the metalworking industry and is home to many high-tech companies.

Since the start of industrialisation there have been numerous firms in <a href="Pforzheim">Pforzheim</a> that manufacture jewellery and work with precious metals and stones. There is also a <a href="goldsmith">goldsmith</a>'s school in Pforzheim.

Due to the large amounts of precipitation and elevation changes the Black Forest has significant <a href="hydropower">hydropower</a> potential. This was used until the 19th century especially for operating numerous <a href="water%20mill">mills</a>, including <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a>s and <a href="hammer%20mill">hammer mill</a>s and was one of the local factors in the industrialization of some Black Forest valleys.

Since the 20th century, the Black Forest has seen the large scale generation of electrical power using <a href="run-of-the-river%20power%20plant">run-of-the-river power plant</a>s and <a href="pumped%20storage%20power%20station">pumped storage power station</a>s. From 1914 to 1926, the Rudolf Fettweis Company was established in the Murg valley in the Northern Black Forest with the construction of the <a href="Schwarzenbach%20Dam">Schwarzenbach Dam</a>. In 1932, the <a href="Schluchsee">Schluchsee</a> reservoir, with its new dam, became the upper basin of a pumped storage power plant. In 2013 the association of the Southern Black Forest's "Schluchseewerk" owned five power plants with 14 storage tanks. At the <a href="Hornberg%20Basin">Hornberg Basin</a> topographical conditions allow an average head of water of 625 m to drive the turbines before it flows into the <a href="Wehra%20Reservoir">Wehra Reservoir</a>.

In the 21st century, in the wake of the <a href="German%20Renewable%20Energy%20Sources%20Act">Renewable Energy Sources Act</a>, numerous smaller run-of-the-river power stations were re-opened or newly constructed.

Administratively, the Black Forest belongs completely to the state of <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a> and comprises the cities of <a href="Pforzheim">Pforzheim</a>, <a href="Baden-Baden">Baden-Baden</a> and <a href="Freiburg">Freiburg</a> as well as the following districts ("<a href="Districts%20of%20Germany">Kreise</a>"). In the north: <a href="Enz%20%28district%29">Enz</a>, <a href="Rastatt%20%28district%29">Rastatt</a> and <a href="Calw%20%28district%29">Calw</a>; in the middle: <a href="Freudenstadt%20%28district%29">Freudenstadt</a>, <a href="Ortenaukreis">Ortenaukreis</a> and <a href="Rottweil%20%28district%29">Rottweil</a>; in the south: <a href="Emmendingen%20%28district%29">Emmendingen</a>, <a href="Schwarzwald-Baar">Schwarzwald-Baar</a>, <a href="Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald">Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald</a>, <a href="L%C3%B6rrach%20%28district%29">Lörrach</a> and <a href="Waldshut%20%28district%29">Waldshut</a>.

The main industry of the Black Forest is <a href="tourism">tourism</a>. Black Forest Tourism ("Schwarzwald Tourismus") assesses that there are around 140,000 direct full-time jobs in the tourist sector and around 34.8 million tourist overnight stays in 2009.

In spring, summer and autumn an extensive network of hiking trails and mountain bike routes enable different groups of people to use the natural region. In winter, of course, it is the various types of winter sport that come to the fore. There are facilities for both <a href="downhill%20skiing">downhill</a> and <a href="Nordic%20skiing">Nordic skiing</a> in many places.

The most heavily frequented tourist destinations and resorts in the Black Forest are the <a href="Titisee%20%28lake%29">Titisee</a> and the <a href="Schluchsee">Schluchsee</a>. Both lakes offer opportunities for <a href="water%20sport">water sport</a>s like <a href="diving">diving</a> and <a href="windsurfing">windsurfing</a>. From <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg</a> these lakes may be reached on the <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%2031">B 31</a> through the <a href="H%C3%B6llental%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Höllental</a>, via the <a href="Hirschsprung%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Hirschsprung monument</a> located at the narrowest point in the valley, and the <a href="Sankt%20Oswald%20im%20H%C3%B6llental">Oswald Chapel</a> below the Ravenna Gorge.

One oft-visited town is <a href="Baden-Baden">Baden-Baden</a> with its thermal baths and festival hall. Other thermal baths are found in the spa resorts of <a href="Badenweiler">Badenweiler</a>, <a href="Bad%20Herrenalb">Bad Herrenalb</a>, <a href="Bad%20Wildbad">Bad Wildbad</a>, <a href="Bad%20Krozingen">Bad Krozingen</a>, <a href="Bad%20Liebenzell">Bad Liebenzell</a> and <a href="Bad%20Bellingen">Bad Bellingen</a>.

Other popular tourist destinations are the old imperial town of <a href="Gengenbach">Gengenbach</a>, the former county towns of <a href="Wolfach">Wolfach</a>, <a href="Schiltach">Schiltach</a> and <a href="Haslach%20im%20Kinzigtal">Haslach im Kinzigtal</a> (both on the <a href="German%20Timber-Frame%20Road">German Timber-Frame Road</a>) and the flower and wine village of <a href="Sasbachwalden">Sasbachwalden</a> at the foot of the Hornisgrinde. Picturesque old towns may be visited in <a href="Altensteig">Altensteig</a>, <a href="Dornstetten">Dornstetten</a>, <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg im Breisgau</a>, <a href="Gernsbach">Gernsbach</a>, <a href="Villingen-Schwenningen">Villingen</a> and <a href="Zell%20am%20Harmersbach">Zell am Harmersbach</a>. <a href="Baiersbronn">Baiersbronn</a> is a centre of gastronomic excellence, <a href="Freudenstadt">Freudenstadt</a> is built around the largest market place in Germany. <a href="Gersbach%20%28Schopfheim%29">Gersbach</a>'s floral displays have won awards as the German Golden Village of 2004 and the <a href="Entente%20Florale">European Golden Village</a> of 2007.

Noted for their fine interiors are the former monastery of <a href="St.%20Blaise%20Abbey%2C%20Black%20Forest">St. Blasien</a> as well as the abbeys of <a href="M%C3%BCnstertal%2C%20Black%20Forest">Sankt Trudpert</a>, <a href="Sankt%20Peter%2C%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">St. Peter</a> and <a href="St.%20M%C3%A4rgen">St. Märgen</a>.
<a href="Alpirsbach%20Abbey">Alpirsbach Abbey</a> and the ruined <a href="Hirsau%20Abbey">Hirsau Abbey</a> were built of red sandstone in the Hirsau style. Another idyllic rural edifice is <a href="Wittichen%20Abbey">Wittichen Abbey</a> near <a href="Schenkenzell">Schenkenzell</a>.

The <a href="Murg%20%28Northern%20Black%20Forest%29">Murg valley</a>, the <a href="Kinzig%20%28Rhine%29">Kinzig valley</a>, the <a href="Triberg%20Waterfalls">Triberg Waterfalls</a> and the <a href="Black%20Forest%20Open%20Air%20Museum%2C%20Vogtsbauernhof">Open Air Museum at Vogtsbauernhof</a> are also very popular.

Lookout mountains include the <a href="Feldberg%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Feldberg</a>, the <a href="Belchen%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Belchen</a>, the <a href="Kandel%20%28mountain%29">Kandel</a> and the <a href="Schauinsland">Schauinsland</a> in the Southern Black Forest; and the <a href="Hornisgrinde">Hornisgrinde</a>, the <a href="Schliffkopf">Schliffkopf</a>, the <a href="Hohloh">Hohloh</a>, the <a href="Merkur%20%28Baden-Baden%29">Merkur</a> and the <a href="Teufelsm%C3%BChle%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Teufelsmühle</a> in the Northern Black Forest.

There are well known winter sports areas around the Feldberg, near <a href="Todtnau">Todtnau</a> with its <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20Ski">FIS</a> downhill ski run of "Fahler Loch" and in <a href="Hinterzarten">Hinterzarten</a>, a centre and talent forge for German ski jumpers. In the Northern Black Forest the winter sports areas are concentrated along the <a href="Black%20Forest%20High%20Road">Black Forest High Road</a> and on the ridge between the Murg and Enz rivers around <a href="Kaltenbronn%20%28Gernsbach%29">Kaltenbronn</a>.

The height differences in the mountains are used in many places for <a href="hang%20gliding">hang gliding</a> and <a href="paragliding">paragliding</a>.

The Black Forest has a great number of very varied trails; some of pan-regional significance. The <a href="European%20long-distance%20path">European long-distance path</a> <a href="European%20walking%20route%20E1">E1</a> crosses the Black Forest following the routes of some of the local long-distance paths. Their framework is a network of long distance paths with main routes and side branches, many of which were laid out in the early 20th century by the <a href="Black%20Forest%20Club">Black Forest Club</a> ("<a href="Schwarzwaldverein">Schwarzwaldverein</a>"). The best known of these is the challenging West Way ("Westweg") with its many steep inclines. After 1950, circular walks were constructed to meet the changing demand, initially from the relatively dense railway network and, later, mainly from locally established hiking car parks. Currently, special, more experience-oriented themed paths are being laid out, such as the Dornstetten Barefoot Park ("Barfußpark Dornstetten"), the Park of All Senses ("Park mit allen Sinnen") in Gutach (Black Forest Railway), as well as those designed to bring the walker more directly in contact with nature (e.g. the "Schluchtensteig"). Roads and wide forest tracks are thus less often used than hitherto.

There are numerous shorter paths suitable for day walks, as well as <a href="mountain%20biking">mountain biking</a> and <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country skiing</a> trails. The total network of tracks amounts to around , and is maintained and overseen by volunteers of the Black Forest Club, which has around 90,000 members (figures from Bremke, 1999, p. 9).


The <a href="Black%20Forest%20Open%20Air%20Museum">Black Forest Open Air Museum</a> at "Vogtsbauernhof" farm in <a href="Gutach%20%28Schwarzwaldbahn%29">Gutach</a> has original <a href="Black%20Forest%20house">Black Forest house</a>s that offer insights into farming life of the 16th and 17th centuries. The buildings were dismantled at their original sites, the individual pieces numbered and then re-erected to exactly the same plan in the museum. The <a href="German%20Clock%20Museum">German Clock Museum</a> in <a href="Furtwangen%20im%20Schwarzwald">Furtwangen</a> gives a comprehensive cross-section of the history of the <a href="watchmaking">watchmaking</a> and <a href="clockmaking">clockmaking</a> industries. From this early precision engineering a formerly important phonographic industry developed in the 20th century; the history of leisure electronics is presented in the <a href="German%20Phono%20Museum">German Phono Museum</a> in <a href="St.%20Georgen%20im%20Schwarzwald">St. Georgen</a>. The <a href="Sch%C3%BCttes%C3%A4ge%20Museum">Schüttesäge Museum</a> in <a href="Schiltach">Schiltach</a> has information and living history demonstrations covering the themes of <a href="lumbering">lumbering</a> and <a href="timber%20rafting">timber rafting</a> in the Kinzig valley as well as <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tanning</a>. The <a href="Black%20Forest%20Costume%20Museum">Black Forest Costume Museum</a> in <a href="Haslach%20im%20Kinzigtal">Haslach im Kinzigtal</a> offers an overview of the traditional costume of the whole of the Black Forest and its peripheral regions. Also in Haslach is the Hansjakob Museum and the Hansjakob Archive with numerous works of the writer, priest, politician, historian and chronicler, <a href="Heinrich%20Hansjakob">Heinrich Hansjakob</a>. The <a href="MiMa%20Mineralogy%20and%20Mathematics%20Museum">MiMa Mineralogy and Mathematics Museum</a> in <a href="Oberwolfach">Oberwolfach</a> houses minerals and mining exhibits from the whole of the Black Forest and links them to mathematical explanations.

Several tourist routes run through the Black Forest. Well known <a href="holiday%20route">holiday route</a>s are the <a href="Black%20Forest%20High%20Road">Black Forest High Road</a> (<a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%20500">B 500</a>) and the <a href="German%20Clock%20Road">German Clock Road</a>.

Thanks to its winding country roads, the Black Forest is a popular destination for <a href="motorcyclist">motorcyclist</a>s. This arm of tourism 
is viewed as controversial due to the high number of accidents and the wide-ranging noise pollution and has been restricted through the introduction of speed limits and by placing certain roads out of bounds. For example, since 1984, motorcyclists have been banned from using the <a href="ADAC%20Schauinsland%20Races">mountain racing route</a> on the <a href="Schauinsland">Schauinsland</a> during summer weekends.

The whole of the Black Forest was once linked by the <a href="railway">railway</a>. In the eastern part of the Northern Black Forest by the <a href="Enz%20Valley%20Railway">Enz Valley Railway</a> from <a href="Pforzheim">Pforzheim</a> to <a href="Bad%20Wildbad">Bad Wildbad</a>, by the <a href="Nagold%20Valley%20Railway">Nagold Valley Railway</a> from Pforzheim via <a href="Calw">Calw</a> and <a href="Nagold%20%28town%29">Nagold</a> to <a href="Horb%20am%20Neckar">Horb am Neckar</a>, by the <a href="Black%20Forest%20Railway%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Württemberg Black Forest Railway</a> from <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> to Calw and the Gäu Railway from Stuttgart to Freudenstadt or its present-day <a href="G%C3%A4u%20Railway%20%28Eutingen%E2%80%93Freudenstadt%29">section from Eutingen to Freudenstadt</a>.

Most of these routes are still busy today, whilst some are extremely popular <a href="heritage%20line">heritage line</a>s.

Since January 2006 the Black Forest Tourist organisation, " Schwarzwald Tourismus", whose head office is in <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg</a>, has been responsible for the administration of tourism in the 320 municipalities of the region. Hitherto there had been four separate tourist associations.

There are many historic towns in the Black Forest. Popular tourist destinations include <a href="Baden-Baden">Baden-Baden</a>, <a href="Freiburg">Freiburg</a>, <a href="Calw">Calw</a> (the birth town of <a href="Hermann%20Hesse">Hermann Hesse</a>), <a href="Gengenbach">Gengenbach</a>, <a href="Staufen%2C%20Germany">Staufen</a>, <a href="Schiltach">Schiltach</a>, <a href="Haslach%20im%20Kinzigtal">Haslach</a> and <a href="Altensteig">Altensteig</a>. Other popular destinations include such mountains as the Feldberg, the <a href="Belchen%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Belchen</a>, the <a href="Kandel%20%28Black%20Forest%29">Kandel</a>, and the Schauinsland; the <a href="Titisee">Titisee</a> and <a href="Schluchsee">Schluchsee</a> lakes; the <a href="All%20Saints%20Waterfalls">All Saints Waterfalls</a>; the <a href="Triberg%20Waterfalls">Triberg Waterfalls</a>, not the highest, but the most famous waterfalls in Germany; and the <a href="canyon">gorge</a> of the River <a href="Wutach%20%28river%29">Wutach</a>.

The <a href="Black%20Forest%20Open%20Air%20Museum">Black Forest Open Air Museum</a> shows the life of 16th or 17th century farmers in the region, featuring a number of reconstructed Black Forest farms. The <a href="German%20Clock%20Museum">German Clock Museum</a> in <a href="Furtwangen%20im%20Schwarzwald">Furtwangen</a> portrays the history of the <a href="clock">clock</a> industry and of <a href="watch">watch</a>makers.

For drivers, the main route through the region is the fast <a href="Bundesautobahn%205">A 5</a> (E35) motorway, but a variety of signposted scenic routes such as the <a href="Schwarzwaldhochstra%C3%9Fe">Schwarzwaldhochstraße</a> (, <a href="Baden-Baden">Baden-Baden</a> to <a href="Freudenstadt">Freudenstadt</a>), Schwarzwald Tälerstraße (, the <a href="Murg%20%28Northern%20Black%20Forest%29">Murg</a> and <a href="Kinzig%20%28Rhine%29">Kinzig</a> valleys) or Badische Weinstraße (Baden Wine Street, , a wine route from <a href="Baden-Baden">Baden-Baden</a> to <a href="Weil%20am%20Rhein">Weil am Rhein</a>) offers calmer driving along high roads. The last is a picturesque trip starting in the south of the Black Forest going north and includes numerous old wineries and tiny villages. Another, more specialized route is the <a href="German%20Clock%20Route">German Clock Route</a>, a circular route which traces the <a href="horology">horological</a> history of the region.
Due to the rich mining history dating from medieval times (the Black Forest was one of the most important mining regions of Europe circa 1100) there are many mines re-opened to the public. Such mines may be visited in the Kinzig valley, the Suggental, the Muenster valley, and around Todtmoos.

The Black Forest was visited on several occasions by Count <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> during his years as Prussian and later German chancellor (1862–1890). Allegedly, he especially was interested in the <a href="Triberg%20Waterfalls">Triberg Waterfalls</a>. There is now a monument in Triberg dedicated to Bismarck, who apparently enjoyed the tranquility of the region as an escape from his day-to-day political duties in Berlin.

The Black Forest featured in the philosophical development of <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a>. Heidegger wrote and edited some of his philosophical works in a small hut in the Black Forest, and would receive visitors there for walks, including his former pupil <a href="Hannah%20Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a>. This hut features explicitly in his essay "Building, Dwelling, Thinking". His walks in the Black Forest are supposed to have inspired the title of his collection of essays " Holzewege ", translated as "Off The Beaten Track ".

The <a href="Black%20Forest%20National%20Park">Black Forest National Park</a>, established in 2014, was the first <a href="national%20park">national park</a> in Baden-Württemberg. It covers an area of 10,062 <a href="hectare">hectare</a>s and lies on the main crest of the Northern Black Forest between Baiersbronn and Baden-Baden.

There are two <a href="nature%20park">nature park</a>s named after the Black Forest that cover the region: the <a href="Central/North%20Black%20Forest%20Nature%20Park">Central/North Black Forest Nature Park</a> ("Naturpark Schwarzwald Mitte/Nord") and the <a href="Southern%20Black%20Forest%20Nature%20Park">Southern Black Forest Nature Park</a> ("Naturpark Südschwarzwald"). Their aim is to preserve the countryside as a cultural landscape, to market local produce more effectively and to make the area more suitable for tourism. The 370,000 <a href="hectare">ha</a> Southern Black Forest Nature Park, which is the second largest in Germany, encloses the southern part of the Central Black Forest, the Southern Black Forest and adjacent areas. The Central/North Black Forest Nature Park covers 375,000 ha and is thus the largest in Germany. It begins in the southern part of the Central Black Forest, bordering on the Southern Black Forest Nature Park and covers the rest of the Black Forest to the north.

In addition there are numerous <a href="Naturschutzgebiet">nature reserves</a>, <a href="protected%20areas">protected areas</a>, <a href="forest%20reserve">forest reserve</a>s and <a href="bird%20reserve">bird reserve</a>s.

In addition to the expected kinds of wildlife to be found in a European forest area, the following types of animals may be observed in the Black Forest.


The Black Forest is mainly rural and comprises many scattered villages and a few large towns. <a href="Tradition">Tradition</a> and custom are celebrated in many places.

The forest is best known for its <a href="Black%20Forest%20house">typical farmhouses</a> with their sweeping <a href="hip%20roof">half-hipped roofs</a>, its <a href="Black%20Forest%20g%C3%A2teau">Black Forest gâteau</a>s, <a href="Black%20Forest%20ham">Black Forest ham</a>, Black Forest <a href="gnome">gnome</a>s, <a href="Kirschwasser">Kirschwasser</a> and the <a href="cuckoo%20clock">cuckoo clock</a>.

The main dialects spoken in the Black Forest area are <a href="Alemannic%20German">Alemannic</a> and <a href="Swabian%20German">Swabian</a>.

Traditional costume or "Trachten" is still sometimes worn today, usually at festive occasions. The appearance of such costume varies from region to region, sometimes very markedly. One of the best known Black Forest costumes is that of the villages of <a href="Kirnbach%20%28Wolfach%29">Kirnbach</a>, <a href="Reichenbach%20%28Hornberg%29">Reichenbach</a> and <a href="Gutach%20%28Schwarzwaldbahn%29">Gutach im Kinzigtal</a> with the characteristic "<a href="Bollenhut">Bollenhut</a>" headdress. Unmarried women wear the hats with red bobbles or "Bollen", married women wear black. Engaged women sometimes wear a <a href="bridal%20crown">bridal crown</a> before and on the day of their wedding, the so-called "Schäppel", whose largest examples from the town of <a href="St.%20Georgen%20im%20Schwarzwald">St. Georgen</a> weigh up to 5 kilogrammes.

Its rural beauty as well as the sense of tradition of its inhabitants had already attracted many artists in the 19th and early 20th centuries, whose works made the Black Forest famous the world over. Especially notable were <a href="Hans%20Thoma%20%28artist%29">Hans Thoma</a> from <a href="Bernau%20im%20Schwarzwald">Bernau</a> and his fellow student, Rudolf Epp, who was sponsored by the Grand Duke of Baden, <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Baden">Frederick I</a>. Both artists painted motifs from the Black Forest throughout their lives. The artist, <a href="J.%20Metzler">J. Metzler</a>, from Düsseldorf travelled through the Black Forest to paint his landscapes. The works of the Gutach artist colony around <a href="Wilhelm%20Hasemann">Wilhelm Hasemann</a> were widely admire, their landscape and genre motifs capturing the character of the Black Forest. Like local author, Heinrich Hansjakob, they were part of a Baden folk costume movement.

In the field of handicrafts, <a href="wood%20carving">wood carving</a> plays an important role, than not only produces folk art like the <a href="Longinus%20cross">Longinus cross</a>es, but also famous sculptors like Matthias Faller.

<a href="Wood-carving">Wood-carving</a> is a traditional cottage industry in the region and carved ornaments now are produced in substantial numbers as souvenirs for tourists. <a href="Cuckoo%20clock">Cuckoo clock</a>s are a popular example; they have been made in the region since the mid-18th century and much of their development occurred there.

In the past <a href="singing%20bird%20box">singing bird box</a>es were produced as well. It is believed in the late Middle Ages, mechanical roosters were first created in some clocks to crow the hours. These clocks may have preceded the Cuckoo Clock. Interestingly, new scientific evidence suggests a mechanized planetarium, created by Archimedes in Syracuse before the birth of Christ, may have sparked production of mechanical clocks in Europe. It is believed the ancient Greek knowledge of gearing came into Europe in the 13th century.

<a href="Black%20Forest%20ham">Black Forest ham</a> originated from this region, and so, by name and reputation at least, did the <a href="Black%20Forest%20g%C3%A2teau">Black Forest gâteau</a>. It is also known as "Black Forest Cherry Cake" or "Black Forest Cake" and is made with chocolate cake, cream, sour cherries and <a href="Kirsch">Kirsch</a>. The Black Forest variety of "<a href="Tarte%20flamb%C3%A9e">Flammkuchen</a>" is a Baden specialty made with ham, cheese and cream. "<a href="Pancake">Pfannkuchen</a>", a <a href="cr%C3%AApe">crêpe</a> or <a href="Drop-scone">crêpe-like</a> ("" or "<a href="Palatschinken">Palatschinken</a>") pastry, is also common. 
The Black Forest is also known for its long tradition in gourmet cuisine. No fewer than 17 <a href="Michelin%20star">Michelin star</a>red restaurants are located in the region, among them two restaurants with 3 stars (Restaurants Bareiss and Schwarzwaldstube in <a href="Baiersbronn">Baiersbronn</a>) as well as the only restaurant in Germany that has been awarded a Michelin star every year since 1966. At Schwarzwald Hotel Adler in Häusern, three generations of chefs from the same family have defended the award from the first year the "<a href="Michelin%20Guide">Michelin Guide</a>" selected restaurants in Germany until today.

The German holiday of <a href="Fastnacht">Fastnacht</a>, or "Fasnet", as it is known in the Black Forest region, occurs in the time leading up to <a href="Lent">Lent</a>. On "Fasnetmendig", or the Monday before <a href="Ash%20Wednesday">Ash Wednesday</a>, crowds of people line the streets, wearing wooden, mostly hand-carved masks. One prominent style of mask is called the Black Forest Style, originating from the Black Forest Region.

Black Sea

The Black Sea is a <a href="body%20of%20water">body of water</a> and <a href="marginal%20sea">marginal sea</a> of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> between <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> and <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a>. It is <a href="Inflow%20%28hydrology%29">supplied by</a> a number of major rivers, such as the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, <a href="Dnieper%20River">Dnieper</a>, <a href="Rioni%20River">Rioni</a>, <a href="Southern%20Bug">Southern Bug</a>, and <a href="Dniester">Dniester</a>. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the <a href="Sea%20of%20Azov">Sea of Azov</a>), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the <a href="Pontic%20Mountains">Pontic Mountains</a> to the south and by the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a> to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .

Important cities along the coast include <a href="Batumi">Batumi</a>, <a href="Burgas">Burgas</a>, <a href="Constan%C8%9Ba">Constanța</a>, <a href="Giresun">Giresun</a>, <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="Kerch">Kerch</a>, <a href="Novorossiysk">Novorossiysk</a>, <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a>, <a href="Ordu">Ordu</a>, <a href="Poti">Poti</a>, <a href="Rize">Rize</a>, <a href="Samsun">Samsun</a>, <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a>, <a href="Sochi">Sochi</a>, <a href="Sukhumi">Sukhumi</a>, <a href="Trabzon">Trabzon</a>, <a href="Varna">Varna</a>, <a href="Yalta">Yalta</a>, and <a href="Zonguldak">Zonguldak</a>.

The Black Sea has a positive <a href="water%20balance">water balance</a>; that is, a net outflow of water per year through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea as part of a two-way hydrological exchange. The Black Sea outflow is cooler and less <a href="saline%20water">saline</a>, and floats over the warm, more saline Mediterranean inflow – as a result of differences in density caused by differences in salinity – leading to a significant <a href="Anoxic%20waters">anoxic</a> layer well below the surface waters. The Black Sea drains into the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and then the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, via the Aegean Sea and various <a href="strait">strait</a>s. The <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> Strait connects it to the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>, and the Strait of the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> connects that sea to the Aegean Sea region of the Mediterranean. These waters separate <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> and Western Asia. The Black Sea is also connected to the <a href="Sea%20of%20Azov">Sea of Azov</a> by the <a href="Strait%20of%20Kerch">Strait of Kerch</a>.

The water level has varied significantly. Due to these variations in the water level in the basin, the surrounding shelf and associated aprons have sometimes been land. At certain critical water levels it is possible for connections with surrounding water bodies to become established. It is through the most active of these connective routes, the <a href="Turkish%20Straits">Turkish Straits</a>, that the Black Sea joins the <a href="world%20ocean">world ocean</a>. When this hydrological link is not present, the Black Sea is an <a href="endorheic%20basin">endorheic basin</a>, operating independently of the global ocean system, like the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> for example. Currently the Black Sea water level is relatively high, thus water is being exchanged with the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>. The Turkish Straits connect the Black Sea with the Aegean Sea, and comprise the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles.

The <a href="International%20Hydrographic%20Organization">International Hydrographic Organization</a> defines the limits of the Black Sea as follows:

Current names of the sea are usually equivalents of the English name "Black Sea", including these given in the countries bordering the sea:

Such names have not yet been shown conclusively to predate the 13th century, but there are indications that they may be considerably older.

In <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, the historical name "Euxine Sea", which holds a different meaning (see below), is still widely used:


The Black Sea is one of four seas named in English after common <a href="colour%20term">colour term</a>s—the others being the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, the <a href="White%20Sea">White Sea</a> and the <a href="Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a>.

The principal <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> name "Póntos Áxeinos" itself is generally accepted to be a rendering of <a href="Iranian%20languages">Iranian</a> "*axšaina-" (“dark colored”), <a href="cf.">cf.</a> <a href="Avestan%20language">Avestan</a> "axšaēna-" (“dark colored”), <a href="Old%20Persian%20language">Old Persian</a> "axšaina-" (color of <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a>), <a href="Middle%20Persian%20language">Middle Persian</a> "axšēn/xašēn" ("blue"), and <a href="New%20Persian%20language">New Persian</a> "xašīn" ("blue"), as well as <a href="Ossetic%20language">Ossetic</a> "œxsīn" (“dark gray"). The ancient Greeks subsequently adopted the name, reportedly in all likelihood those who lived to the north of the Black Sea, and altered it into "á-xe(i)nos". Thereafter, Greek tradition refers to the Black Sea as the "Inhospitable Sea", , first attested in <a href="Pindar">Pindar</a> (<a href="circa">c.</a> 475 BC). The name, considered to be "ominous", was then later changed into the <a href="euphemism">euphemism</a> "Hospitable sea", , which was also for the first time attested in Pindar. This became the commonly used designation in Greek for the sea. In contexts related to mythology, the older form "Póntos Áxeinos" remained favored.

Previously, it was erroneously suggested that the name had to be derived from the color of the water, or at least were to be related to climatic particulars. Black (or dark), in this context however, referred to a system in which colors represented the various "<a href="cardinal%20points">cardinal points</a>" of the known world. Black, or dark represented the north, red the south, white for the west, and green or light blue for the east. This symbolism based on cardinal points was used in a plethora of different occasions, and is therefore widely attested. For example, the "Red Sea", a body of water reported since the time of <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> ( 484– 425 BC) in fact designated the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, together with bodies of water known as the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> and the "actual" <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>. According to the same explanation and reasoning, it is therefore considered to be impossible for the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> (who principally roamed in what is present-day <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a>) to have given the designation as they lived to the north of the sea, and it would be therefore a southern antipodal body of water for them. As the name could have only been given by a people that were well aware of both the northern "black/dark" and southern "red" seas, it is therefore considered probable that it was given its name by the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid</a>s (550–330 BC).

<a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>'s "<a href="Geographica">Geographica</a>" (1.2.10) reports that in antiquity, the Black Sea was often just called "the Sea" ( ). He also thought that the Black Sea was called "inhospitable" before Greek colonization because it was difficult to navigate, and because its shores were inhabited by savage tribes.(7.3.6) The name was changed to "hospitable" after the <a href="Milesians%20%28Greek%29">Milesians</a> had colonized the southern shoreline, the <a href="Pontus%20%28region%29">Pontus</a>, making it part of Greek civilization.

In <a href="Bundahishn">Greater Bundahishn</a>, a sacred <a href="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrian</a> text written in <a href="Middle%20Persian">Middle Persian</a> the Black Sea is called "Siyābun".

A map of Asia dating to 1570, entitled "Asiae Nova Descriptio", from <a href="Abraham%20Ortelius">Abraham Ortelius</a>'s "<a href="Theatrum%20Orbis%20Terrarum">Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</a>", labels the sea "Mar Maggior" ("Great Sea", cf. Latin ).

English-language writers of the 18th century often used the name "Euxine Sea" ( or ) to refer to the Black Sea. <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>, for instance, calls the sea by this name throughout "<a href="The%20History%20of%20the%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</a>". During the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> period, the Black Sea was called either "Bahr-e Siyah" or "Karadeniz", both meaning "the Black Sea" in the <a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish</a>.

It is worthy to note, that in the tenth-century geography book <a href="Hudud%20al-%27Alam">Hudud al-'Alam</a>, written in the Persian language by an unknown author, the Black Sea is called "Georgian Sea", "Sea of Georgians" ("daryä-yi Gurziyan").

Old <a href="Georgian%20language">Georgian</a> sources of 9th–14th centuries (""<a href="The%20Georgian%20Chronicles">The Georgian Chronicles</a>"") were using the name "Speris Zğua" (სპერის ზღუა), which means "The Sea of Speri", after the name of <a href="Kartvelian%20peoples">Kartvelian</a> tribe Speris or <a href="Saspers">Saspers</a>, now in Turkey.

The modern names of the Black Sea ("Chyornoye more", "Karadeniz", etc.), stretch only back to the 13th century.

The geological origins of the basin can be traced back to two distinct relict <a href="back-arc%20basin">back-arc basin</a>s which were initiated by the splitting of an <a href="Albian">Albian</a> <a href="volcanic%20arc">volcanic arc</a> and the <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of both the <a href="Paleo-Tethys%20Ocean">Paleo</a>- and Neo-<a href="Tethys%20Ocean">Tethys</a> Oceans, but the timings of these events remain controversial. Since its initiation, compressional tectonic environments led to <a href="subsidence">subsidence</a> in the basin, interspersed with extensional phases resulting in large-scale <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a> and numerous <a href="orogeny">orogenies</a>, causing the uplift of the <a href="Greater%20Caucasus">Greater Caucasus</a>, <a href="Pontides">Pontides</a>, Southern <a href="Crimea">Crimean Peninsula</a> and <a href="Balkan">Balkan</a>ides mountain ranges.

The ongoing collision between the <a href="Eurasian%20Plate">Eurasian</a> and <a href="African%20Plate">African</a> plates and westward escape of the <a href="Anatolian%20Plate">Anatolian</a> block along the <a href="North%20Anatolian%20Fault">North Anatolian Fault</a> and <a href="East%20Anatolian%20Fault">East Anatolian Fault</a>s dictates the current tectonic regime, which features enhanced subsidence in the Black Sea basin and significant volcanic activity in the Anatolian region. It is these geological mechanisms which, in the long term, have caused the periodic isolations of the Black Sea from the rest of the global ocean system.

The modern basin is divided into two sub-basins by a convexity extending south from the <a href="Crimea">Crimean Peninsula</a>. The large shelf to the north of the basin is up to wide, and features a shallow apron with gradients between 1:40 and 1:1000. The southern edge around Turkey and the eastern edge around <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>, however, are typified by a narrow shelf that rarely exceeds in width and a steep apron that is typically 1:40 gradient with numerous submarine canyons and channel extensions. The <a href="Euxine%20abyssal%20plain">Euxine abyssal plain</a> in the centre of the Black Sea reaches a maximum depth of just south of <a href="Yalta">Yalta</a> on the <a href="Crimea">Crimean Peninsula</a>.

The <a href="littoral%20zone">littoral zone</a> of the Black Sea is often referred to as the Pontic littoral or Pontic zone.

The area surrounding the Black Sea is commonly referred to as the "Black Sea Region". Its northern part lies within the "<a href="Chernozem">Chernozem</a> belt" (black soil belt) which goes from eastern Croatia (<a href="Slavonia">Slavonia</a>), along the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> (northern Serbia, northern Bulgaria (<a href="Danubian%20Plain%20%28Bulgaria%29">Danubian Plain</a>) and southern Romania (<a href="Wallachian%20Plain">Wallachian Plain</a>)) to northeast Ukraine and further across the <a href="Central%20Black%20Earth%20Region">Central Black Earth Region</a> and southern Russia into <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>.

The Black Sea is a <a href="marginal%20sea">marginal sea</a> and is the world's largest body of water with a <a href="meromictic">meromictic</a> basin. The deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume is <a href="Anoxic%20waters">anoxic</a> water. The Black Sea's circulation patterns are primarily controlled by basin topography and <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> inputs, which result in a strongly stratified vertical structure. Because of the extreme stratification, it is classified as a <a href="estuary%23Salt%20wedge">salt wedge estuary</a>.

The Black Sea only experiences water transfer with the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, so all inflow and outflow occurs in the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> and <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>. Inflow from the Mediterranean has a higher salinity and density than the outflow, creating the classical estuarine circulation. This means that inflow of dense water from Mediterranean occurs at the bottom of the basin while outflow of fresher Black Sea surface-water into the <a href="Marmara%20Sea">Marmara Sea</a> occurs near the surface. Fresher surface water is the product of the fluvial inputs, and this makes the Black Sea a positive sea. The net input of freshwater creates an outflow volume about twice that of the inflow. Evaporation and precipitation are roughly equal at about .

Because of the narrowness and shallowness of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles (their respective depths are only 33 and 70 meters), inflow and outflow current speeds are high and there is significant vertical shear. This allows for turbulent mixing of the two layers. Surface water leaves the Black Sea with a salinity of 17 <a href="Practical%20salinity%20unit">psu</a> and reaches the Mediterranean with a salinity of 34 psu. Likewise, inflow of the Mediterranean with salinity 38.5 psu experiences a decrease to about 34 psu.

Mean surface circulation is <a href="Cyclonic%20rotation">cyclonic</a> and waters around the perimeter of the Black Sea circulate in a basin-wide shelfbreak <a href="gyre">gyre</a> known as the Rim Current. The Rim Current has a maximum velocity of about 50–100 cm/s. Within this feature, two smaller cyclonic gyres operate, occupying the eastern and western sectors of the basin. The Eastern and Western Gyres are well-organized systems in the winter but dissipate into a series of interconnected <a href="eddy%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29">eddies</a> in the summer and autumn. Mesoscale activity in the peripheral flow becomes more pronounced during these warmer seasons and is subject to interannual variability.

Outside of the Rim Current, numerous quasi-permanent coastal eddies are formed as a result of upwelling around the coastal apron and "wind curl" mechanisms. The intra-annual strength of these features is controlled by seasonal atmospheric and fluvial variations. During the spring, the Batumi eddy forms in the southeastern corner of the sea.

Beneath the surface waters—from about 50–100 meters—there exists a <a href="halocline">halocline</a> that stops at the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL). This layer is composed of cool, salty surface waters, which are the result of localized atmospheric cooling and decreased fluvial input during the winter months. It is the remnant of the winter surface mixed layer. The base of the CIL is marked by a major <a href="pycnocline">pycnocline</a> at about and this density disparity is the major mechanism for isolation of the deep water.

Below the pycnocline is the Deep Water mass, where salinity increases to 22.3 psu and temperatures rise to around 8.9 °C. The hydrochemical environment shifts from oxygenated to anoxic, as bacterial decomposition of sunken biomass utilizes all of the free oxygen. Weak <a href="geothermal%20heating">geothermal heating</a> and long <a href="Residence%20time%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29">residence time</a> create a very thick convective bottom layer.

Because of the anoxic water at depth, organic matter, including <a href="human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">anthropogenic</a> artifacts such as boat hulls, are well preserved. During periods of high surface productivity, short-lived <a href="algae">algal</a> blooms form organic rich layers known as <a href="sapropel">sapropel</a>s. Scientists have reported an annual <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> bloom that can be seen in many NASA images of the region. As a result of these characteristics the Black Sea has gained interest from the field of <a href="marine%20archaeology">marine archaeology</a> as ancient shipwrecks in excellent states of preservation have been discovered, such as the <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> wreck <a href="Sinop%20D">Sinop D</a>, located in the anoxic layer off the coast of <a href="Sinop%2C%20Turkey">Sinop, Turkey</a>.

Modelling shows the release of the <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> clouds in the event of an <a href="asteroid%20impact">asteroid impact</a> into the Black Sea would pose a threat to health—or even life—for people living on the Black Sea coast.

There have been isolated reports of flares on the Black Sea occurring during thunderstorms, possibly caused by lightning igniting combustible gas seeping up from the sea depths.

The Black Sea supports an active and dynamic marine ecosystem, dominated by species suited to the <a href="brackish">brackish</a>, nutrient-rich, conditions. As with all marine food webs, the Black Sea features a range of <a href="Trophic%20level">trophic</a> groups, with <a href="autotrophic">autotrophic</a> algae, including <a href="diatoms">diatoms</a> and <a href="dinoflagellates">dinoflagellates</a>, acting as primary producers. The fluvial systems draining Eurasia and central Europe introduce large volumes of sediment and dissolved nutrients into the Black Sea, but distribution of these nutrients is controlled by the degree of physiochemical stratification, which is, in turn, dictated by seasonal physiographic development.

During winter, strong wind promotes convective overturning and upwelling of nutrients, while high summer temperatures result in a marked vertical stratification and a warm, shallow mixed layer. Day length and <a href="insolation">insolation</a> intensity also controls the extent of the <a href="photic%20zone">photic zone</a>. Subsurface productivity is limited by nutrient availability, as the anoxic bottom waters act as a sink for reduced nitrate, in the form of ammonia. The <a href="benthic">benthic</a> zone also plays an important role in Black Sea nutrient cycling, as chemosynthetic organisms and anoxic geochemical pathways recycle nutrients which can be upwelled to the photic zone, enhancing productivity.

In total, Black Sea's biodiversity contains around one-third of Mediterranean's, and is experiencing natural and artificial invasions or Mediterranizations.

The main phytoplankton groups present in the Black Sea are <a href="dinoflagellates">dinoflagellates</a>, <a href="diatoms">diatoms</a>, <a href="coccolithophores">coccolithophores</a> and <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>. Generally, the annual cycle of phytoplankton development comprises significant diatom and dinoflagellate-dominated spring production, followed by a weaker mixed assemblage of community development below the seasonal thermocline during summer months and a surface-intensified autumn production. This pattern of productivity is also augmented by an "<a href="Emiliania%20huxleyi">Emiliania huxleyi</a>" bloom during the late spring and summer months.



Since the 1960s, rapid industrial expansion along the Black Sea coast line and the construction of a major dam has significantly increased annual variability in the N:P:Si ratio in the basin. In coastal areas, the biological effect of these changes has been an increase in the frequency of monospecific phytoplankton blooms, with diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 2.5 and non-diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 6. The non-diatoms, such as the prymnesiophytes (coccolithophore), sp., and the Euglenophyte are able to out-compete diatom species because of the limited availability of Si, a necessary constituent of diatom frustules. As a consequence of these blooms, benthic macrophyte populations were deprived of light, while anoxia caused mass mortality in marine animals.

The decline in macrophytes was further compounded by overfishing during the 1970s, while the invasive ctenophore "Mnemiopsis" reduced the biomass of copepods and other zooplankton in the late 1980s. Additionally, an alien species—the <a href="warty%20comb%20jelly">warty comb jelly</a> ()—was able to establish itself in the basin, exploding from a few individuals to an estimated biomass of one billion metric tons. The change in species composition in Black Sea waters also has consequences for hydrochemistry, as Ca-producing coccolithophores influence salinity and pH, although these ramifications have yet to be fully quantified. In central Black Sea waters, Si levels were also significantly reduced, due to a decrease in the flux of Si associated with advection across isopycnal surfaces. This phenomenon demonstrates the potential for localised alterations in Black Sea nutrient input to have basin-wide effects.

Pollution reduction and regulation efforts have led to a partial recovery of the Black Sea ecosystem during the 1990s, and an EU monitoring exercise, 'EROS21', revealed decreased N and P values, relative to the 1989 peak. Recently, scientists have noted signs of ecological recovery, in part due to the construction of new sewage treatment plants in Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria in connection with membership in the European Union. populations have been checked with the arrival of another alien species which feeds on them.

In the past, the range of the <a href="Asiatic%20lion">Asiatic lion</a> extended from <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a> to the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, possibly up to the Danube. Places like Turkey and the <a href="Trans-Caucasus">Trans-Caucasus</a> were in this range. The <a href="Caspian%20tiger">Caspian tiger</a> occurred in <a href="Eastern%20Anatolia%20Region">eastern Turkey</a> and the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, at least. The "<a href="Tiger%20versus%20lion%23Asiatic%20lions%20and%20Caspian%20tigers">lyuti zver</a>" (<a href="Old%20Russian%20language">Old Russian</a> for "fierce animal") that was encountered by <a href="Vladimir%20II%20Monomakh">Vladimir II Monomakh</a>, <a href="Velikiy%20Kniaz">Velikiy Kniaz</a> of <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a> (which ranged to the Black Sea in the south), may have been a tiger or <a href="leopard">leopard</a>, rather than a <a href="Steppe%20wolf">wolf</a> or <a href="Eurasian%20lynx">lynx</a>, due to the way it behaved towards him and his <a href="horse">horse</a>.

Short-term climatic variation in the Black Sea region is significantly influenced by the operation of the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20oscillation">North Atlantic oscillation</a>, the climatic mechanisms resulting from the interaction between the north Atlantic and mid-latitude air masses. While the exact mechanisms causing the North Atlantic Oscillation remain unclear, it is thought the climate conditions established in western Europe mediate the heat and precipitation fluxes reaching Central Europe and Eurasia, regulating the formation of winter <a href="cyclones">cyclones</a>, which are largely responsible for regional <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> inputs and influence Mediterranean Sea Surface Temperatures (SST's).

The relative strength of these systems also limits the amount of cold air arriving from northern regions during winter. Other influencing factors include the regional <a href="topography">topography</a>, as depressions and storms systems arriving from the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> are funneled through the low land around the Bosphorus, <a href="Pontic%20Mountains">Pontic</a> and <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus</a> mountain ranges acting as wave guides, limiting the speed and paths of cyclones passing through the region.

The Black Sea is connected to the <a href="World%20Ocean">World Ocean</a> by a chain of two shallow straits, the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> and the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a>. The Dardanelles is deep and the Bosphorus is as shallow as . By comparison, at the height of the last <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">ice age</a>, sea levels were more than lower than they are now.

There is also evidence that water levels in the Black Sea were considerably lower at some point during the post-glacial period. Some researchers theorize that the Black Sea had been a landlocked freshwater lake (at least in upper layers) during the last glaciation and for some time after.

In the aftermath of the last glacial period, water levels in the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea rose independently until they were high enough to exchange water. The exact timeline of this development is still subject to debate. One possibility is that the Black Sea filled first, with excess fresh water flowing over the Bosphorus sill and eventually into the Mediterranean Sea. There are also catastrophic scenarios, such as the "<a href="Black%20Sea%20deluge%20theory">Black Sea deluge theory</a>" put forward by <a href="William%20Ryan%20%28geologist%29">William Ryan</a>, <a href="Walter%20Pitman%20%28geologist%29">Walter Pitman</a> and .

The Black Sea deluge is a hypothesized catastrophic rise in the level of the Black Sea circa 5600 BC due to waters from the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> breaching a sill in the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a> Strait. The hypothesis was headlined when "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" published it in December 1996, shortly before it was published in an <a href="academic%20journal">academic journal</a>. While it is agreed that the sequence of events described did occur, there is debate over the suddenness, dating and magnitude of the events. Relevant to the hypothesis is that its description has led some to connect this catastrophe with prehistoric <a href="Deluge%20%28mythology%29">flood myths</a>.

The Black Sea was a busy waterway on the crossroads of the ancient world: the Balkans to the west, the Eurasian <a href="steppe">steppe</a>s to the north, Caucasus and Central Asia to the east, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia to the south, and Greece to the south-west.

The oldest processed gold in the world was found in Varna, and the Black Sea was supposedly sailed by the <a href="Argonauts">Argonauts</a>. The land at the eastern end of the Black Sea, <a href="Colchis">Colchis</a>, (now <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>), marked for the Greeks the edge of the known world.

The steppes to the north of the Black Sea have been suggested as the original homeland () of the speakers of the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European language</a>, (PIE) the progenitor of the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European language</a> family, by some scholars such as <a href="Marija%20Gimbutas">Marija Gimbutas</a>; others move the heartland further east towards the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, yet others to <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>.

The Black Sea became an <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a> lake within five years of <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> losing the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimea</a> in 1479, after which the only Western merchant vessels to sail its waters were those of <a href="Venice">Venice</a>'s old rival <a href="Republic%20of%20Ragusa">Ragusa</a>. This restriction was gradually changed by the <a href="Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a> from 1783 until the relaxation of export controls in 1789 because of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>.

The Black Sea was a significant naval theatre of <a href="Naval%20warfare%20of%20World%20War%20I%23Black%20Sea">World War I</a> and saw both naval and land battles during <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">World War II</a>.

Ancient trade routes in the region are currently being extensively studied by scientists, as the Black Sea was sailed by <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a>, <a href="Carians">Carians</a>, <a href="Colchis">Colchians</a>, <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greeks">Greeks</a>, <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persians</a>, <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a>, <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, <a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Byzantines</a>, <a href="Goths">Goths</a>, <a href="Huns">Huns</a>, <a href="Avars%20%28Carpathians%29">Avars</a>, <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a>, <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a>, <a href="Varangians">Varangians</a>, <a href="Crusaders">Crusaders</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetians</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoese</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Lithuanians</a>, <a href="Colchis">Georgians</a>, <a href="Crown%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland">Poles</a>, <a href="Tatars">Tatars</a>, <a href="Ottomans">Ottomans</a>, and <a href="Russians">Russians</a>.

Perhaps the most promising areas in deepwater archaeology are the quest for submerged prehistoric settlements in the continental shelf and for ancient shipwrecks in the anoxic zone, which are expected to be exceptionally well preserved due to the absence of oxygen. This concentration of <a href="historical%20powers">historical powers</a>, combined with the preservative qualities of the deep <a href="anoxic%20waters">anoxic waters</a> of the Black Sea, has attracted increased interest from <a href="marine%20archaeology">marine archaeologists</a> who have begun to discover a large number of <a href="Ancient%20Black%20Sea%20shipwrecks">ancient ships and organic remains</a> in a high state of preservation.

According to NATO, the Black sea is a strategic corridor that provides smuggling channels for moving legal and illegal goods including drugs, radioactive materials, and counterfeit goods that can be used to finance terrorism.

According to the <a href="International%20Transport%20Workers%27%20Federation">International Transport Workers' Federation</a> 2013 study, there were at least 30 operating merchant <a href="seaport">seaport</a>s in the Black Sea (including at least 12 in <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>).

According to the International Transport Workers' Federation 2013 study, there were around 2,400 commercial vessels operating in the Black Sea.

<a href="European%20anchovy">Anchovy</a>: the Turkish commercial fishing fleet catches around 300,000 tons per year on average, and fishery carried out mainly in winter and the highest portion of the stock is caught between November and December.

Since the 1980s, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> started <a href="offshore%20drilling">offshore drilling</a> for <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> in the sea's western portion (adjoining <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>'s coast). The independent Ukraine continued and intensified that effort within its <a href="exclusive%20economic%20zone">exclusive economic zone</a>, inviting major international oil companies for exploration. Discovery of the new, massive oilfields in the area stimulated an influx of foreign investments. It also provoked a short-term peaceful <a href="territorial%20dispute">territorial dispute</a> with <a href="Romania">Romania</a> which was resolved in 2011 by an international court redefining the exclusive economic zones between the two countries.

In the years following the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the popularity of the Black Sea as a <a href="tourism">tourist</a> destination steadily increased. Tourism at Black Sea resorts became one of the region's growth industries. The following is a list of notable Black Sea <a href="resort">resort</a> towns:

The <a href="Montreux%20Convention%20Regarding%20the%20Regime%20of%20the%20Turkish%20Straits">1936 Montreux Convention</a> provides for a free passage of civilian ships between the international waters of the Black and the Mediterranean Seas. However, a single country (Turkey) has a complete control over the straits connecting the two seas. The 1982 amendments to the Montreux Convention allow Turkey to close the Straits at its discretion in both wartime and peacetime.

The 1936 Montreux Convention governs the passage of vessels between the Black and the Mediterranean Seas and the presence of military vessels belonging to non-<a href="littoral">littoral</a> states in the Black Sea waters.

The Bible (from <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a> τὰ βιβλία, "tà <a href="bibl%C3%ADa">biblía</a>", "the books") is a collection of <a href="sacred%20texts">sacred texts</a> or scriptures that <a href="Jews">Jews</a> and <a href="Christian">Christian</a>s consider to be a <a href="Biblical%20inspiration">product of divine inspiration</a> and a record of the relationship between <a href="God%20in%20Abrahamic%20religions">God</a> and humans.

Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as <a href="Biblical%20canon">canonical</a> text differs depending on traditions and groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> overlaps with the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and the Greek <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>; the Hebrew Bible is known in <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> as the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>. The <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> is a collection of writings by <a href="early%20Christians">early Christians</a>, believed to be mostly <a href="Jewish%20Christian">Jewish disciples of Christ</a>, written in first-century <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a>. These early Christian Greek writings consist of narratives, <a href="epistle">letters</a>, and <a href="Apocalyptic%20literature">apocalyptic writings</a>. Among <a href="Christian%20denomination">Christian denomination</a>s there is some disagreement about the contents of the canon, primarily the <a href="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.

Attitudes towards the Bible also differ amongst Christian groups. <a href="Roman%20Catholics">Roman Catholics</a>, <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicans</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> Christians stress the harmony and importance of the Bible and <a href="sacred%20tradition">sacred tradition</a>, while <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> churches focus on the idea of "<a href="sola%20scriptura">sola scriptura</a>", or scripture alone. This concept arose during the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, and many denominations today support the use of the Bible as the only source of Christian teaching.

With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time. It sells approximately 100 million copies annually, and has been a major influence on literature and history, especially in <a href="Western%20world">the West</a>, where the <a href="Gutenberg%20Bible">Gutenberg Bible</a> was the first book printed using <a href="movable%20type">movable type</a>.
The English word "<a href="%3Awikt%3ABible">Bible</a>" is from the Latin "biblia", from the same word in <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> and <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> and ultimately from <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a> "ta biblia" "the books" (singular "biblion").

<a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> "biblia" is short for "biblia sacra" "holy book", while "biblia" in Greek and Late Latin is neuter plural (gen. "bibliorum"). It gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun ("biblia", gen. "bibliae") in medieval Latin, and so the word was loaned as a singular into the vernaculars of Western Europe.
Latin "biblia sacra" "holy books" translates Greek "ta biblia ta hagia", "the holy books".

The word itself had the literal meaning of "paper" or "scroll" and came to be used as the ordinary word for "book".
It is the diminutive of "byblos", "Egyptian papyrus", possibly so called from the name of the <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n sea port <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> (also known as Gebal) from whence Egyptian <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a> was exported to Greece.
The Greek "ta biblia" (lit. "little papyrus books") was "an expression <a href="Hellenistic%20Jews">Hellenistic Jews</a> used to describe their sacred books (the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>). Christian use of the term can be traced to c. 223 CE. The biblical scholar <a href="F.F.%20Bruce">F.F. Bruce</a> notes that <a href="Chrysostom">Chrysostom</a> appears to be the first writer (in his "Homilies on Matthew", delivered between 386 and 388) to use the Greek phrase "ta biblia" ("the books") to describe both the Old and New Testaments together.
By the 2nd century <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>, Jewish groups began calling the books of the Bible the "scriptures" and they referred to them as "holy", or in Hebrew כִּתְבֵי הַקֹּדֶשׁ (Kitvei hakkodesh), and Christians now commonly call the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible "The Holy Bible" (in Greek , "tà biblía tà ágia") or "the Holy Scriptures" (, "e Agía Graphḗ"). The Bible was <a href="Chapters%20and%20verses%20of%20the%20Bible">divided into chapters</a> in the 13th century by <a href="Stephen%20Langton">Stephen Langton</a> and it was divided into verses in the 16th century by French printer <a href="Robert%20Estienne">Robert Estienne</a> and is now usually <a href="Citation">cited</a> by book, chapter, and verse. The division of the Hebrew Bible into verses is based on the "<a href="sof%20passuk">sof passuk</a>" <a href="cantillation">cantillation</a> mark used by the 10th-century <a href="Masoretes">Masoretes</a> to record the verse divisions used in earlier oral traditions.

The oldest extant copy of a complete Bible is an early 4th-century parchment book preserved in the <a href="Vatican%20Library">Vatican Library</a>, and it is known as the <a href="Codex%20Vaticanus">Codex Vaticanus</a>. The oldest copy of the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> in Hebrew and Aramaic dates from the 10th century CE. The oldest copy of a complete Latin (<a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>) Bible is the <a href="Codex%20Amiatinus">Codex Amiatinus</a>, dating from the 8th century.

Professor John K. Riches, <a href="Professor%20of%20Divinity%20and%20Biblical%20Criticism">Professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism</a> at the University of Glasgow, says that "the biblical texts themselves are the result of a creative dialogue between ancient traditions and different communities through the ages", and "the biblical texts were produced over a period in which the living conditions of the writers – political, cultural, economic, and ecological – varied enormously". Timothy H. Lim, a professor of Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism at the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>, says that the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> is "a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and editing." He states that it is not a magical book, nor was it literally written by <a href="God%20in%20Judaism">God</a> and passed to mankind.
Parallel to the solidification of the Hebrew canon (c. 3rd century BCE), only the Torah first and then the Tanakh began to be translated into Greek and expanded, now referred to as the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> or the Greek Old Testament.

In Christian Bibles, the New Testament Gospels were derived from oral traditions in the second half of the first century CE. Riches says that:

Scholars have attempted to reconstruct something of the history of the oral traditions behind the Gospels, but the results have not been too encouraging. The period of transmission is short: less than 40 years passed between the death of Jesus and the writing of Mark's Gospel. This means that there was little time for oral traditions to assume fixed form.

The Bible was later translated into Latin and other languages. John Riches states that:

The translation of the Bible into Latin marks the beginning of a parting of the ways between Western Latin-speaking Christianity and Eastern Christianity, which spoke Greek, Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and other languages. The Bibles of the Eastern Churches vary considerably: the Ethiopic Orthodox canon includes 81 books and contains many apocalyptic texts, such as were found at Qumran and subsequently excluded from the Jewish canon. As a general rule, one can say that the Orthodox Churches generally follow the Septuagint in including more books in their Old Testaments than are in the Jewish canon.

The <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a> is the authoritative <a href="Biblical%20Hebrew">Hebrew</a> text of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, or <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>. It defines the books of the Jewish canon, and also the precise letter-text of these biblical books, with their <a href="niqqud">vocalization</a> and <a href="cantillation">accentuation</a>.

The oldest extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century CE, and the <a href="Aleppo%20Codex">Aleppo Codex</a> (once the oldest complete copy of the Masoretic Text, but now missing its <a href="Torah">Torah</a> section) dates from the 10th century.

The name <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> (<a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>: ) reflects the threefold division of the Hebrew Scriptures, <a href="Torah">Torah</a> ("Teaching"), <a href="Nevi%27im">Nevi'im</a> ("Prophets") and <a href="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a> ("Writings").

The Torah (תּוֹרָה) is also known as the "Five Books of <a href="Moses">Moses</a>" or the <a href="Pentateuch">Pentateuch</a>, meaning "five scroll-cases". 

The Hebrew names of the books are derived from the <a href="Incipit">first words</a> in the respective texts. The Torah consists of the following five books:

The first eleven chapters of Genesis provide accounts of the <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">creation</a> (or ordering) of the world and the history of God's early relationship with humanity. The remaining thirty-nine chapters of Genesis provide an account of God's <a href="Biblical%20covenant">covenant</a> with the <a href="Patriarchs%20%28Bible%29">Biblical patriarchs</a> <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, <a href="Isaac">Isaac</a> and <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a> (also called <a href="Israel%20%28name%29">Israel</a>) and Jacob's children, the "<a href="Children%20of%20Israel">Children of Israel</a>", especially <a href="Joseph%20%28Hebrew%20Bible%29">Joseph</a>. It tells of how God commanded Abraham to leave his family and home in the city of <a href="Ur%20of%20the%20Chaldees">Ur</a>, eventually to settle in the land of <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, and how the Children of Israel later moved to Egypt. The remaining four books of the Torah tell the story of <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs. He leads the Children of Israel from slavery in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> to the renewal of their covenant with God at <a href="Biblical%20Mount%20Sinai">Mount Sinai</a> and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation was ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses.

The Torah contains the commandments of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate among traditional scholars as to whether these were all written down at one time, or over a period of time during the 40 years of the wanderings in the desert, while several modern Jewish movements reject the idea of a literal revelation, and critical scholars believe that many of these laws developed later in Jewish history). These commandments provide the basis for <a href="Halakha">Jewish religious law</a>. Tradition states that there are <a href="613%20commandments">613 commandments</a> ("taryag mitzvot").

"Nevi'im" (, "Prophets") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the "Torah" and "Ketuvim." It contains two sub-groups, the Former Prophets (, the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (, the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">Twelve Minor Prophets</a>).

The Nevi'im tell the story of the rise of the Hebrew monarchy and its division into two kingdoms, <a href="ancient%20Israel%20and%20Judah">ancient Israel and Judah</a>, focusing on conflicts between the Israelites and other nations, and conflicts among Israelites, specifically, struggles between believers in "the God" and believers in foreign gods, and the criticism of unethical and unjust behaviour of Israelite elites and rulers; in which prophets played a crucial and leading role. It ends with the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians followed by the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.

The Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the <a href="Promised%20Land">Promised Land</a>, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last <a href="king%20of%20Judah">king of Judah</a>. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:

The Latter Prophets are divided into two groups, the "major" prophets, <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>, <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Daniel">Daniel</a>, and the <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">Twelve Minor Prophets</a>, collected into a single book. The collection is broken up to form twelve individual books in the Christian <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, one for each of the prophets:


"Ketuvim" or "Kəṯûḇîm" (in "writings") is the third and final section of the Tanakh. The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the <a href="Ruach%20HaKodesh">Ruach HaKodesh</a> (the Holy Spirit) but with one level less authority than that of <a href="prophecy">prophecy</a>.

In <a href="Masoretic">Masoretic</a> manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stichs in the verses, which are a function of their <a href="Biblical%20poetry">poetry</a>. Collectively, these three books are known as "Sifrei Emet" (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, איוב, משלי, תהלים yields "Emet" אמ"ת, which is also the Hebrew for "truth").

These three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of <a href="cantillation">cantillation</a> notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.

The five relatively short books of <a href="Song%20of%20Songs">Song of Songs</a>, <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ruth">pageRank.Book of Ruth</a>, the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Lamentations">pageRank.Book of Lamentations</a>, <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> and <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Esther">pageRank.Book of Esther</a> are collectively known as the "Hamesh Megillot" (<a href="Five%20Megillot">Five Megillot</a>). These are the latest books collected and designated as "authoritative" in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the 2nd century CE.

Besides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Daniel">Daniel</a>, <a href="Ezra%E2%80%93Nehemiah">Ezra–Nehemiah</a> and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:

The following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of "Sifrei Emet" and "Hamesh Megillot".

The Three Poetic Books ("Sifrei Emet")
The <a href="Five%20Megillot">Five Megillot</a> ("Hamesh Megillot")
Other books

The Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The <a href="Talmud">Babylonian Talmud</a> (<a href="Bava%20Batra">Bava Batra</a> 14b–15a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.

In Tiberian <a href="Masoretic">Masoretic</a> codices, including the <a href="Aleppo%20Codex">Aleppo Codex</a> and the <a href="Leningrad%20Codex">Leningrad Codex</a>, and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Esther, Daniel, Ezra.

The Ketuvim is the last of the three portions of the Tanakh to have been accepted as <a href="biblical%20canon">biblical canon</a>. While the Torah may have been considered canon by Israel as early as the 5th century BCE and the <a href="Former%20Prophets">Former</a> and <a href="Latter%20Prophets">Latter Prophets</a> were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century of the <a href="Common%20Era">Common Era</a>.

Evidence suggests, however, that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets. As early as 132 BCE references suggest that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, although it lacked a formal title. References in the four <a href="Gospels">Gospels</a> as well as other books of <a href="the%20New%20Testament">the New Testament</a> indicate that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st century CE.

Many scholars believe that the limits of the Ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the <a href="Council%20of%20Jamnia">Council of Jamnia</a> c. 90 CE. "<a href="Against%20Apion">Against Apion</a>", the writing of <a href="Flavius%20Josephus">Josephus</a> in 95 CE, treated the text of the Hebrew Bible as a closed canon to which "... no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable..." For a long time following this date the divine inspiration of Esther, <a href="the%20Song%20of%20Songs">the Song of Songs</a>, and <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> was often under scrutiny.

The Tanakh was mainly written in <a href="biblical%20Hebrew">biblical Hebrew</a>, with some small portions ( and , , ) written in <a href="biblical%20Aramaic">biblical Aramaic</a>, a sister language which became the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" for much of the Semitic world.

The <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, or the LXX, is a translation of the Hebrew Scriptures and some related texts into <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a>, begun in the late 3rd century BCE and completed by 132 BCE, initially in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, but in time it was completed elsewhere as well. It is not altogether clear which was translated when, or where; some may even have been translated twice, into different versions, and then revised.

As the work of translation progressed, the canon of the Greek Bible expanded. The Torah always maintained its pre-eminence as the basis of the canon but the collection of prophetic writings, based on the "Nevi'im", had various <a href="hagiographa">hagiographical</a> works incorporated into it. In addition, some newer books were included in the Septuagint, among these are the <a href="Books%20of%20the%20Maccabees">Maccabees</a> and the <a href="Wisdom%20of%20Sirach">Wisdom of Sirach</a>. However, the book of <a href="Sirach">Sirach</a>, is now known to have existed in a Hebrew version, since ancient Hebrew manuscripts of it were rediscovered in modern times. The Septuagint version of some Biblical books, like <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Daniel">Daniel</a> and <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Esther">Esther</a>, are longer than those in the Jewish canon. Some of these <a href="deuterocanonical%20books">deuterocanonical books</a> (e.g. the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Wisdom">Wisdom of Solomon</a>, and the <a href="2%20Maccabees">second book of Maccabees</a>) were not translated, but composed directly in Greek.

Since <a href="Late%20Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a>, once attributed to a hypothetical late 1st-century <a href="Council%20of%20Jamnia%23Developments%20attributed%20to%20Jamnia">Council of Jamnia</a>, mainstream <a href="Rabbinic%20Judaism">Rabbinic Judaism</a> rejected the Septuagint as valid Jewish scriptural texts. Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were claimed. Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis. Third, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity.
Finally, the rabbis claimed a divine authority for the Hebrew language, in contrast to Aramaic or Greek – even though these languages were the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of Jews during this period (and Aramaic would eventually be given a holy language status comparable to Hebrew).

The Septuagint is the basis for the <a href="Vetus%20Latina">Old Latin</a>, <a href="Old%20Church%20Slavonic%20language">Slavonic</a>, <a href="Syro-hexaplar%20version">Syriac</a>, Old <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a>, Old <a href="Georgian%20language">Georgian</a> and <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a> versions of the Christian <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. The <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> Churches use most of the books of the Septuagint, while <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> churches usually do not. After the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, many Protestant Bibles began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts, which came to be called <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">Biblical apocrypha</a>. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the <a href="Authorized%20King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> of the Bible, the basis for the <a href="Revised%20Standard%20Version">Revised Standard Version</a>.

In most ancient copies of the Bible which contain the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Daniel">pageRank.Book of Daniel</a> is not the original Septuagint version, but instead is a copy of <a href="Theodotion">Theodotion</a>'s translation from the Hebrew, which more closely resembles the Masoretic Text. The Septuagint version was discarded in favour of Theodotion's version in the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE. In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century. History does not record the reason for this, and St. <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> reports, in the preface to the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> version of Daniel, "This thing 'just' happened." One of two Old Greek texts of the pageRank.Book of Daniel has been recently rediscovered and work is ongoing in reconstructing the original form of the book.

The canonical <a href="Ezra%E2%80%93Nehemiah">Ezra–Nehemiah</a> is known in the Septuagint as "Esdras B", and 1 Esdras is "Esdras A". 1 Esdras is a very similar text to the books of Ezra–Nehemiah, and the two are widely thought by scholars to be derived from the same original text. It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that "Esdras B" – the canonical Ezra–Nehemiah – is Theodotion's version of this material, and "Esdras A" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own.

Some texts are found in the Septuagint but are not present in the Hebrew. These additional books are <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Tobit">Tobit</a>, <a href="Judith">Judith</a>, <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Wisdom">Wisdom of Solomon</a>, <a href="Sirach">Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach</a>, <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Baruch">Baruch</a>, the <a href="Letter%20of%20Jeremiah">Letter of Jeremiah</a> (which later became chapter 6 of Baruch in the Vulgate), <a href="additions%20to%20Daniel">additions to Daniel</a> (<a href="The%20Prayer%20of%20Azariah">The Prayer of Azarias</a>, the <a href="The%20Prayer%20of%20Azariah%20and%20Song%20of%20the%20Three%20Holy%20Children">Song of the Three Children</a>, <a href="Susanna%20%28Book%20of%20Daniel%29">Susanna</a> and <a href="Bel%20and%20the%20Dragon">Bel and the Dragon</a>), additions to <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Esther">Esther</a>, <a href="1%20Maccabees">1 Maccabees</a>, <a href="2%20Maccabees">2 Maccabees</a>, <a href="3%20Maccabees">3 Maccabees</a>, <a href="4%20Maccabees">4 Maccabees</a>, <a href="1%20Esdras">1 Esdras</a>, <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Odes%20%28Bible%29">Odes</a>, including the <a href="Prayer%20of%20Manasseh">Prayer of Manasseh</a>, the <a href="Psalms%20of%20Solomon">Psalms of Solomon</a>, and <a href="Psalm%20151">Psalm 151</a>.

Some books that are set apart in the Masoretic Text are grouped together. For example, the <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">Books of Samuel</a> and the <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Books of Kings</a> are in the LXX one book in four parts called Βασιλειῶν ("Of Reigns"). In LXX, the <a href="Books%20of%20Chronicles">Books of Chronicles</a> supplement Reigns and it is called "Paralipomenon" (Παραλειπομένων – things left out). The Septuagint organizes the <a href="minor%20prophets">minor prophets</a> as twelve parts of one pageRank.Book of Twelve.

A Christian Bible is a set of books that a <a href="Christian%20denomination">Christian denomination</a> regards as <a href="Biblical%20inspiration">divinely inspired</a> and thus constituting <a href="Religious%20text">scripture</a>. Although the <a href="Early%20Christianity">Early Church</a> primarily used the Septuagint or the <a href="Targum">Targum</a>s among <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> speakers, the <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">apostles</a> did not leave a defined set of new scriptures; instead the canon of the New Testament <a href="Development%20of%20the%20New%20Testament%20canon">developed over time</a>. Groups within Christianity include differing books as part of their sacred writings, most prominent among which are the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books.

Significant versions of the English Christian Bible include the <a href="Douay-Rheims%20Bible">Douay-Rheims Bible</a>, the <a href="Authorized%20King%20James%20Version">Authorized King James Version</a>, the <a href="English%20Revised%20Version">English Revised Version</a>, the <a href="American%20Standard%20Version">American Standard Version</a>, the <a href="Revised%20Standard%20Version">Revised Standard Version</a>, the <a href="New%20American%20Standard%20Version">New American Standard Version</a>, the <a href="New%20King%20James%20Version">New King James Version</a>, the <a href="New%20International%20Version">New International Version</a>, and the <a href="English%20Standard%20Version">English Standard Version</a>.

The books which make up the Christian Old Testament differ between the Catholic (see <a href="Catholic%20Bible">Catholic Bible</a>), Orthodox, and Protestant (see <a href="Protestant%20Bible">Protestant Bible</a>) churches, with the Protestant movement accepting only those books contained in the Hebrew Bible, while Catholics and Orthodox have wider canons. A few groups consider particular translations to be divinely inspired, notably the Greek Septuagint and the Aramaic <a href="Peshitta">Peshitta</a>.

In <a href="Eastern%20Christianity">Eastern Christianity</a>, translations based on the Septuagint still prevail. The Septuagint was generally abandoned in favour of the 10th-century Masoretic Text as the basis for translations of the Old Testament into <a href="Western%20world">Western</a> languages. Some modern Western translations since the <a href="Wycliffe%27s%20Bible">14th century</a> make use of the Septuagint to clarify passages in the Masoretic Text, where the Septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the Hebrew text. They also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts, e.g., those discovered among the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>.

A number of books which are part of the <a href="Syriac%20versions%20of%20the%20Bible">Peshitta</a> or the Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible (i.e., among the protocanonical books) are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e., deutero) canon, that canon as fixed definitively by the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a> 1545–1563. It includes 46 books for the Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one) and 27 for the New.

Most Protestants term these books as <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">apocrypha</a>. Modern <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles included them in Apocrypha sections until the 1820s. However, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.

The Roman Catholic Church recognizes:

In addition to those, the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek</a> and <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>es recognize the following: 

Russian and Georgian Orthodox Churches include:

There is also <a href="4%20Maccabees">4 Maccabees</a> which is only accepted as canonical in the <a href="Georgian%20Orthodox%20Church">Georgian Church</a>, but was included by <a href="St.%20Jerome">St. Jerome</a> in an appendix to the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, and is an appendix to the Greek Orthodox Bible, and it is therefore sometimes included in collections of the Apocrypha.

The <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox tradition</a> includes:

The <a href="Ethiopian%20Biblical%20canon">Ethiopian Biblical canon</a> includes:
and some other books.

The <a href="Anglican%20Church">Anglican Church</a> uses some of the <a href="Deuterocanonical%20books">Apocryphal books</a> liturgically. Therefore, editions of the Bible intended for use in the Anglican Church include the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church, plus <a href="1%20Esdras">1 Esdras</a>, <a href="2%20Esdras">2 Esdras</a> and the <a href="Prayer%20of%20Manasseh">Prayer of Manasseh</a>, which were in the Vulgate appendix. 

The term Pseudepigrapha commonly describes numerous works of Jewish religious literature written from about 300 BCE to 300 CE. Not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical. It also refers to books of the New Testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented. The "Old Testament" Pseudepigraphal works include the following:


Notable pseudepigraphal works include the Books of Enoch (such as <a href="1%20Enoch">1 Enoch</a>, <a href="Second%20Book%20of%20Enoch">2 Enoch</a>, surviving only in <a href="Old%20Church%20Slavonic">Old Slavonic</a>, and <a href="3%20Enoch">3 Enoch</a>, surviving in <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, c. 5th to 6th century CE). These are ancient <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet <a href="Enoch%20%28Biblical%20figure%29">Enoch</a>, the great-grandfather of the patriarch <a href="Noah">Noah</a>. They are not part of the <a href="biblical%20canon">biblical canon</a> used by <a href="Jews">Jews</a>, apart from <a href="Beta%20Israel">Beta Israel</a>. Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest or significance. It has been observed that part of the pageRank.Book of Enoch is quoted in the <a href="Epistle%20of%20Jude">Epistle of Jude</a> (part of the New Testament) but Christian denominations generally regard the Books of Enoch as non-canonical or non-inspired. However, the Enoch books are treated as canonical by the <a href="Ethiopian%20Orthodox%20Tewahedo%20Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a> and <a href="Eritrean%20Orthodox%20Tewahedo%20Church">Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a>.

The older sections (mainly in the pageRank.Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300 BC, and the latest part (pageRank.Book of Parables) probably was composed at the end of the 1st century BCE.

There arose in some Protestant biblical scholarship an extended use of the term "pseudepigrapha" for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the biblical canon, because of the authorship ascribed to them, but which stood outside both the <a href="biblical%20canon">biblical canon</a>s recognized by Protestants and Catholics. These works were also outside the particular set of books that Roman Catholics called "deuterocanonical" and to which Protestants had generally applied the term Apocryphal. Accordingly, the term "pseudepigraphical", as now used often among both Protestants and Roman Catholics (allegedly for the clarity it brings to the discussion), may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with a lay audience. To confuse the matter even more, Eastern Orthodox Christians accept books as canonical that Roman Catholics and most Protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority. There exist also churches that reject some of the books that Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants accept. The same is true of some <a href="Jewish%20denominations">Jewish sects</a>. Many works that are "apocryphal" are otherwise considered genuine.

The Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar <a href="N.T.%20Wright">N.T. Wright</a> says "Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures." He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the "holy writings" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), and as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the "<a href="new%20covenant">new covenant</a>" prophesied by <a href="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>.

The New Testament is the name given to the second and final portion of the Christian Bible. <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> is its central figure.

The term "New Testament" came into use in the second century during a controversy among Christians over whether or not the Hebrew Bible should be included with the Christian writings as sacred scripture. The New Testament presupposes the inspiration of the Old Testament. Some other works which were widely read by early churches were excluded from the New Testament and relegated to the collections known as the <a href="Apostolic%20Fathers">Apostolic Fathers</a> (generally considered orthodox) and the New Testament <a href="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a> (including both orthodox and heretical works). Most Christians consider the New Testament to be an infallible source of doctrine, while others go even farther to affirm that it is also inerrant, or completely correct in historical and factual details as well as theologically. In recent times, however, the authority of the New Testament books has been challenged. The school of historical criticism has exposed various apparent contradictions within the texts, as well as questions of authorship and dating.

The New Testament is a collection of 27 books of 4 different <a href="genres">genres</a> of Christian literature (<a href="Gospels">Gospels</a>, one account of the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, <a href="Epistles">Epistles</a> and an <a href="Apocalyptic%20literature">Apocalypse</a>). These books can be grouped into:

<a href="Gospel">The Gospels</a>
<a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles%20%28genre%29">Narrative literature</a>, account and history of the Apostolic age

<a href="Pauline%20Epistles">Pauline Epistles</a>
<a href="Pastoral%20epistles">Pastoral epistles</a>

<a href="General%20epistles">General epistles</a>, also called catholic epistles

<a href="Apocalyptic%20literature">Apocalyptic literature</a>, also called Prophetical
The New Testament books are ordered differently in the Catholic/Orthodox/Protestant tradition, the <a href="Slavonic%20translations%20of%20the%20Bible">Slavonic tradition</a>, the <a href="Syriac%20versions%20of%20the%20Bible">Syriac</a> tradition and the Ethiopian tradition.

The mainstream consensus is that the New Testament was written in a form of <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a>, which was the <a href="lingua%20franca">common language</a> of the <a href="Eastern%20Mediterranean">Eastern Mediterranean</a> from the <a href="Conquests%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">Conquests of Alexander the Great</a> (335–323 BCE) until the evolution of <a href="Byzantine%20Greek">Byzantine Greek</a> (c. 600).

The original <a href="autograph">autograph</a>s, that is, the original Greek writings and <a href="Biblical%20manuscript">manuscripts</a> written by the original authors of the New Testament, have not survived. But historically "copies" exist of those original autographs, transmitted and preserved in a number of <a href="Bible%20manuscript%23Textual%20criticism">manuscript traditions</a>. There have been some minor variations, additions or omissions, in some of the texts. When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they sometimes wrote notes on the margins of the page ("<a href="Glosses%20to%20the%20Bible%23Glosses%20as%20marginal%20notes">marginal glosses</a>") to correct their text – especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line – and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions and additions.

The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the <a href="Alexandrian%20text-type">Alexandrian text-type</a> (generally minimalist), the <a href="Byzantine%20text-type">Byzantine text-type</a> (generally maximalist), and the <a href="Western%20text-type">Western text-type</a> (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.

The Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of <a href="synod">synod</a>s produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46, 51, or 54-book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the <a href="Synod%20of%20Hippo">Synod of Hippo</a> in 393 CE. Also "c". 400, <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.

The Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon – the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division – while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognize 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognizes a longer canon. The term "Hebrew Scriptures" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants (as well as Greek Orthodox) have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.

The New Testament writers assumed the inspiration of the Old Testament, probably earliest stated in , "All scripture is given by inspiration of God".

The Canon of the <a href="Ethiopian%20Orthodox%20Tewahedo%20Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a> is wider than the canons used by most other Christian churches. There are 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. The Ethiopian Old Testament Canon includes the books found in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> accepted by other Orthodox Christians, in addition to <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Enoch">Enoch</a> and <a href="Jubilees">Jubilees</a> which are ancient Jewish books that only survived in <a href="Ge%27ez%20language">Ge'ez</a> but are quoted in the New Testament, also Greek Ezra <a href="1%20Esdras">First</a> and the <a href="Jewish%20Apocalypse%20of%20Ezra">Apocalypse of Ezra</a>, 3 books of <a href="Meqabyan">Meqabyan</a>, and <a href="Psalm%20151">Psalm 151</a> at the end of the Psalter. The three books of Meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of Maccabees. The order of the other books is somewhat different from other groups', as well. The Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order.

The Second Epistle to Timothy says that "all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness". () Various related but distinguishable views on divine inspiration include:


Within these broad beliefs many schools of hermeneutics operate. "Bible scholars claim that discussions about the Bible must be put into its context within church history and then into the context of contemporary culture." <a href="Christian%20fundamentalism">Fundamentalist Christians</a> are associated with the doctrine of biblical literalism, where the Bible is not only inerrant, but the meaning of the text is clear to the average reader.

Jewish antiquity attests to belief in sacred texts, and a similar belief emerges in the earliest of Christian writings. Various texts of the Bible mention divine agency in relation to its writings. In their book "A General Introduction to the Bible", <a href="Norman%20Geisler">Norman Geisler</a> and William Nix write: "The process of inspiration is a mystery of the providence of God, but the result of this process is a verbal, plenary, inerrant, and authoritative record." Most evangelical biblical scholars associate inspiration with only the original text; for example some American Protestants adhere to the 1978 <a href="Chicago%20Statement%20on%20Biblical%20Inerrancy">Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy</a> which asserted that inspiration applied only to the <a href="autograph">autograph</a>ic text of Scripture. Among adherents of Biblical literalism, a minority, such as followers of the <a href="King-James-Only%20Movement">King-James-Only Movement</a>, extend the claim of inerrancy only to a particular translation.

The original texts of the Tanakh were mainly in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic. In addition to the authoritative Masoretic Text, Jews still refer to the Septuagint, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and the <a href="Targum%20Onkelos">Targum Onkelos</a>, an Aramaic version of the Bible. There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as Aleppo Codex. Even in this version there are words which are traditionally read differently from written, because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one, and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the generations.

The primary biblical text for early Christians was the Septuagint. In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages. Translations were made into Syriac, <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a>, <a href="Ge%27ez%20language">Ethiopic</a>, and Latin, among other languages. The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.

The earliest Latin translation was the <a href="Old%20Latin">Old Latin</a> text, or "<a href="Vetus%20Latina">Vetus Latina</a>", which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time. It was based on the Septuagint, and thus included books not in the Hebrew Bible.

According to the Latin <a href="Decretum%20Gelasianum">Decretum Gelasianum</a> (also known as the Gelasian Decree), thought to be of a 6th-century document of uncertain authorship and of pseudepigraphal papal authority (variously ascribed to <a href="Pope%20Gelasius%20I">Pope Gelasius I</a>, <a href="Pope%20Damasus%20I">Pope Damasus I</a>, or <a href="Pope%20Hormisdas">Pope Hormisdas</a>) but reflecting the views of the Roman Church by that period, the <a href="Council%20of%20Rome">Council of Rome</a> in 382 AD under Pope Damasus I (366–383) assembled a list of books of the Bible. Damasus commissioned Saint <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> to produce a reliable and consistent text by translating the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin. This translation became known as the <a href="Vulgate">Latin Vulgate Bible</a>, in the fourth century AD (although Jerome expressed in his prologues to most <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">"deuterocanonical"</a> books that they were non-<a href="Biblical%20canon">canonical</a>). In 1546, at the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a>, Jerome's Vulgate translation was declared by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only authentic and official Bible in the <a href="Latin%20Church">Latin Church</a>.

Since the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, <a href="Bible%20translations">Bible translations</a> for many languages have been made. The Bible continues to be translated to new languages, largely by Christian organizations such as <a href="Wycliffe%20Bible%20Translators">Wycliffe Bible Translators</a>, <a href="New%20Tribes%20Mission">New Tribes Mission</a> and <a href="Bible%20society">Bible societies</a>.

John Riches, professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow, provides the following view of the diverse historical influences of the Bible:

It has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art; it has equally fuelled some of the worst excesses of human savagery, self-interest, and narrow-mindedness. It has inspired men and women to acts of great service and courage, to fight for liberation and human development; and it has provided the ideological fuel for societies which have enslaved their fellow human beings and reduced them to abject poverty. ... It has, perhaps above all, provided a source of religious and moral norms which have enabled communities to hold together, to care for, and to protect one another; yet precisely this strong sense of belonging has in turn fuelled ethnic, racial, and international tension and conflict.

In <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, the Bible is held to reflect true unfolding <a href="revelation">revelation</a> from <a href="God%20in%20Islam">God</a>; but revelation which had been corrupted or distorted (in Arabic: "<a href="tahrif">tahrif</a>"); which necessitated the giving of the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> to the <a href="Prophets%20of%20Islam">Islamic prophet</a>, <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, to correct this deviation.

Members of other religions may also seek inspiration from the Bible. For example, <a href="Rastafari">Rastafari</a>s view the Bible as essential to their religion and <a href="Unitarian%20Universalism">Unitarian Universalists</a> view it as "one of many important religious texts".

<a href="Biblical%20criticism">Biblical criticism</a> refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as <a href="criticism%20of%20the%20Bible">criticism of the Bible</a>, which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, or observations that the Bible may have <a href="translation">translation</a> errors.

In the 17th century <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> collected the current evidence to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a> published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was "clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses . . ."

Biblical archaeology is the <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a> that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures (or the "New Testament"). It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times. There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archaeology. One broad division includes <a href="biblical%20maximalism">biblical maximalism</a> which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered to be the opposite of <a href="Biblical%20Minimalism">biblical minimalism</a> which considers the Bible to be a purely <a href="post-exilic">post-exilic</a> (5th century BCE and later) composition. Even among those scholars who adhere to biblical minimalism, the Bible is a historical document containing first-hand information on the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> and <a href="Roman%20era">Roman era</a>s, and there is universal scholarly consensus that the events of the 6th century BCE <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">Babylonian captivity</a> have a basis in history.

The historicity of the biblical account of the <a href="history%20of%20ancient%20Israel%20and%20Judah">history of ancient Israel and Judah</a> of the 10th to 7th centuries BCE is disputed in scholarship. The biblical account of the 8th to 7th centuries BCE is widely, but not universally, accepted as historical, while the verdict on the earliest period of the <a href="United%20Monarchy">United Monarchy</a> (10th century BCE) and the <a href="historicity%20of%20David">historicity of David</a> is unclear. Archaeological evidence providing information on this period, such as the <a href="Tel%20Dan%20Stele">Tel Dan Stele</a>, can potentially be decisive. The biblical account of events of the <a href="Exodus%20from%20Egypt">Exodus from Egypt</a> in the <a href="Torah">Torah</a>, and the migration to the <a href="Promised%20Land">Promised Land</a> and the period of <a href="Biblical%20judges">Judges</a> are not considered historical in scholarship.

Most old Bibles were illuminated, they were <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>s in which the <a href="Writing">text</a> is supplemented by the addition of decoration, such as decorated <a href="initial">initial</a>s, borders (<a href="marginalia">marginalia</a>) and <a href="Miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">miniature illustrations</a>.
Up to the twelfth century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a <a href="Commission%20%28art%29">commission</a> from a wealthy patron. Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the <a href="monks">monks</a> who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a <a href="scriptorium">scriptorium</a>, where "separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk."
By the fourteenth century, the <a href="cloisters">cloisters</a> of monks writing in the scriptorium started to employ laybrothers from the urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands.
Demand for manuscripts grew to an extent that the Monastic libraries were unable to meet with the demand, and began employing secular scribes and illuminators. These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in certain instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day.

The manuscript was "sent to the <a href="rubricator">rubricator</a>, who added (in red or other colours) the titles, <a href="headlines">headlines</a>, the initials of chapters and sections, the notes and so on; and then – if the book was to be illustrated – it was sent to the illuminator." In the case of manuscripts that were sold commercially, the writing would "undoubtedly have been discussed initially between the patron and the scribe (or the scribe's agent,) but by the time that the written gathering were sent off to the illuminator there was no longer any scope for innovation."

British Columbia

British Columbia is the westernmost <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">province</a> of <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, with a population of more than four and a half million people. It is located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. British Columbia is also a component of the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> and the <a href="Cascadia%20%28bioregion%29">Cascadia bioregion</a>, along with <a href="U.S.%20state">American states</a> <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a> (western portion), <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>.

The first British settlement in the area was <a href="Fort%20Victoria%20%28British%20Columbia%29">Fort Victoria</a>, established in 1843, which gave rise to the city of <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria</a>, at first the capital of the separate <a href="Colony%20of%20Vancouver%20Island">Colony of Vancouver Island</a>. Subsequently, on the mainland, the <a href="Colony%20of%20British%20Columbia%20%281858%E2%80%9366%29">Colony of British Columbia (1858–66)</a> was founded by <a href="Richard%20Clement%20Moody">Richard Clement Moody</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Engineers%2C%20Columbia%20Detachment">Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment</a>, in response to the <a href="Fraser%20Canyon%20Gold%20Rush">Fraser Canyon Gold Rush</a>. Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first <a href="Lieutenant-Governor%20of%20British%20Columbia">Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia</a>: he was hand-picked by the <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a> in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire's "bulwark in the farthest west", and "to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific". Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia, <a href="New%20Westminster">New Westminster</a>, established the <a href="Cariboo%20Road">Cariboo Road</a> and <a href="Stanley%20Park">Stanley Park</a>, and designed the first version of the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20British%20Columbia">Coat of arms of British Columbia</a>. <a href="Port%20Moody">Port Moody</a> is named after him.

In 1866, Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia, and Victoria became the united colony's capital. In 1871, British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada. Its <a href="Latin">Latin</a> motto is "Splendor sine occasu" ("Splendour without Diminishment").

The capital of British Columbia remains <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20the%20100%20largest%20metropolitan%20areas%20in%20Canada">fifteenth-largest metropolitan region</a> in Canada, named for the <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen</a> who created the original European colonies. The largest city is <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, the third-largest <a href="metropolitan%20area">metropolitan area</a> in Canada, the largest in <a href="Western%20Canada">Western Canada</a>, and the third-largest in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>. In October 2013, British Columbia had an estimated population of 4,606,371 (about 2.5 million of whom were in <a href="Greater%20Vancouver">Greater Vancouver</a>). The province is currently governed by the <a href="British%20Columbia%20New%20Democratic%20Party">British Columbia New Democratic Party</a> in a minority government supported by the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Green%20Party">British Columbia Green Party</a>, led by <a href="John%20Horgan%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">John Horgan</a>, who became <a href="Premier%20%28Canada%29">premier</a> as a result of a no-confidence motion on June 29, 2017. 

British Columbia evolved from British possessions that were established in what is now British Columbia by 1871. <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a>, the original inhabitants of the land, have a history of at least 10,000 years in the area. Today there are few treaties and the question of Aboriginal Title, long ignored, has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions. Notably, the <a href="Tsilhqot%27in">Tsilhqot'in</a> Nation has established Aboriginal title to a portion of their territory, as a result of the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision (William [Tsilhqot'in Nation] v. British Columbia).

BC's economy is diverse, with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the province's GDP. It is the terminus of two transcontinental railways, and the site of 27 major marine cargo and passenger terminals. Though less than 5% of its vast land is <a href="arable%20land">arable</a>, the province is agriculturally rich (particularly in the <a href="Fraser%20Valley">Fraser</a> and <a href="Okanagan">Okanagan</a> valleys), because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys. Its climate encourages <a href="outdoor%20recreation">outdoor recreation</a> and <a href="tourism">tourism</a>, though its economic mainstay has long been <a href="resource%20extraction">resource extraction</a>, principally logging, farming, and mining. Vancouver, the province's largest city, serves as the headquarters of many western-based natural resource companies. It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average. While the coast of British Columbia and some valleys in the south-central part of the province have mild weather, the majority of its land mass experiences a cold-winter-temperate climate similar to that of the rest of Canada. The <a href="Interior%20of%20British%20Columbia">Northern Interior</a> region has a <a href="subarctic%20climate">subarctic climate</a> with very cold winters. The climate of Vancouver is by far the mildest winter climate of the major Canadian cities, with nighttime January temperatures averaging above the freezing point.

The province's name was chosen by <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, when the <a href="Colony%20of%20British%20Columbia%20%281858%E2%80%9366%29">Colony of British Columbia (1858–66)</a>, i.e., "the Mainland", became a British colony in 1858. It refers to the <a href="Columbia%20District">Columbia District</a>, the British name for the territory drained by the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, in southeastern British Columbia, which was the namesake of the pre-<a href="Oregon%20Treaty">Oregon Treaty</a> <a href="Columbia%20Department">Columbia Department</a> of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>. Queen Victoria chose "British" Columbia to distinguish what was the British sector of the Columbia District from that of the United States ("American Columbia" or "Southern Columbia"), which became the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a> on August 8, 1848, as a result of the treaty.

Ultimately, the "Columbia" in the name "British Columbia" is derived from the name of the "<a href="Columbia%20Rediviva">Columbia Rediviva</a>", an American ship which lent its name to the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> and later the wider region; the "Columbia" in the name "<a href="Columbia%20Rediviva">Columbia Rediviva</a>" came from <a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">the name "Columbia" for the New World or parts thereof</a>, a reference to <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>.

British Columbia is bordered to the west by the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and the American state of <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, to the north by <a href="Yukon">Yukon Territory</a> and the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a>, to the east by the province of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, and to the south by the American states of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, and <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. The current <a href="Definitions%20of%20Canadian%20borders%23British%20Columbia">southern border of British Columbia</a> was established by the 1846 Oregon Treaty, although its history is tied with lands as far south as <a href="California">California</a>. British Columbia's land area is . <a href="British%20Columbia%20Coast">British Columbia's rugged coastline</a> stretches for more than , and includes deep, mountainous fjords and about 6,000 islands, most of which are uninhabited. It is the only province in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> that borders the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>.

British Columbia's capital is <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria</a>, located at the southeastern tip of <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a>. Only a narrow strip of Vancouver Island, from <a href="Campbell%20River%2C%20British%20Columbia">Campbell River</a> to Victoria, is significantly populated. Much of the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by <a href="temperate%20rainforest">temperate rainforest</a>.
The province's most populous city is Vancouver, which is located at the confluence of the <a href="Fraser%20River">Fraser River</a> and <a href="Georgia%20Strait">Georgia Strait</a>, in the southwest corner of the mainland (an area often called the <a href="Lower%20Mainland">Lower Mainland</a>). By land area, <a href="Abbotsford%2C%20British%20Columbia">Abbotsford</a> is the largest city. <a href="Vanderhoof%2C%20British%20Columbia">Vanderhoof</a> is near the geographic centre of the province.

The <a href="Coast%20Mountains">Coast Mountains</a> and the <a href="Inside%20Passage">Inside Passage</a>'s many <a href="fjord">inlets</a> provide some of British Columbia's renowned and spectacular scenery, which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a> industry. Seventy-five percent of the province is mountainous (more than <a href="above%20mean%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>); 60% is forested; and only about 5% is arable.

The province's mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the Pacific Ocean. Terrain ranges from dry inland forests and <a href="Semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid</a> valleys, to the range and canyon districts of the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Interior">Central and Southern Interior</a>, to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Interior">Northern Interior</a>.

The <a href="Okanagan%20area%20%28wine%29">Okanagan area</a>, extending from <a href="Vernon%2C%20British%20Columbia">Vernon</a> to <a href="Osoyoos%2C%20British%20Columbia">Osoyoos</a> at the United States border, is one of several wine and <a href="cider">cider</a>-producing regions in Canada. Other wine regions in British Columbia include the <a href="Cowichan%20Valley">Cowichan Valley</a> on Vancouver Island and the <a href="Fraser%20Valley">Fraser Valley</a>.

The Southern Interior cities of <a href="Kamloops">Kamloops</a> and <a href="Penticton">Penticton</a> have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in Canada, although their temperatures are often exceeded north of the <a href="Fraser%20Canyon">Fraser Canyon</a>, close to the confluence of the Fraser and <a href="Thompson%20River">Thompson</a> rivers, where the terrain is rugged and covered with desert-type flora. Semi-desert grassland is found in large areas of the <a href="Interior%20Plateau">Interior Plateau</a>, with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones.

The northern, mostly mountainous two-thirds of the province are largely unpopulated and undeveloped, except for the area east of the <a href="Canadian%20Rockies">Rockies</a>, where the <a href="Peace%20River%20Country">Peace River Country</a> contains BC's portion of the <a href="Canadian%20Prairies">Canadian Prairies</a>, centered at the city of <a href="Dawson%20Creek%2C%20British%20Columbia">Dawson Creek</a>.

Coastal southern British Columbia has a mild, rainy oceanic climate, some far southern parts of which are warm-summer Mediterranean, influenced by the <a href="North%20Pacific%20Current">North Pacific Current</a>, which has its origins in the <a href="Kuroshio%20Current">Kuroshio Current</a>. Due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges, the climate of the interior of the province is semi-arid with certain locations receiving less than 250 mm (10") in annual precipitation. The annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to , the mildest anywhere in Canada.

The valleys of the Southern Interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow, while those in the <a href="Cariboo">Cariboo</a>, in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Interior%23Central%20Interior">Central Interior</a>, are colder because of increased altitude and latitude, but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in Canada. For example, the average daily low in <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince George</a> (roughly located in the middle of the province) in January is . Heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central British Columbia.

Winters are generally severe in the Northern Interior, but even there milder air can penetrate far inland. The coldest temperature in British Columbia was recorded in <a href="Smith%20River%2C%20British%20Columbia">Smith River</a>, where it dropped to on January 31, 1947, one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in North America. <a href="Atlin%2C%20British%20Columbia">Atlin</a> in the province's far northwest, along with the adjoining Southern Lakes region of <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a>, get midwinter thaws caused by the <a href="Chinook%20%28wind%29">Chinook</a> effect, which is also common (and much warmer) in more southerly parts of the Interior.

During winter, on the coast, rainfall, sometimes relentless heavy rain, dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic low-pressure systems from the North Pacific. Average snowfall on the coast during an average winter is between , but on occasion (and not every winter) heavy snowfalls with more than and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas, typically for short periods, and can take temperatures below even at sea level and arctic outflow winds can make wind chill temperatures at or even below for a couple of mornings. While winters are very wet, coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anti-cyclonic high pressure. Southern Interior valleys are hot in summer; for example in <a href="Osoyoos%2C%20British%20Columbia">Osoyoos</a> the July maximum temperature averages the hottest month of any place in Canada, this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province. Temperatures often exceed in the lower elevations of valleys in the Interior during mid-summer, with the record high of being held in <a href="Lytton%2C%20British%20Columbia">Lytton</a> on July 16, 1941.

The extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires, from dry-lightning or man-made causes. Many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months, in contrast to abundant summer sunshine. Annual sunshine hours vary from 2200 near Cranbrook and Victoria to less than 1300 in <a href="Prince%20Rupert%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince Rupert</a>, located on the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Coast%23North%20Coast">North Coast</a> just south of <a href="Southeast%20Alaska">Southeast Alaska</a>.

The exception to British Columbia's wet and cloudy winters is El Niño. During this phase, the jet stream is much further south across North America, therefore winters are milder and drier than normal. Winters are much wetter and cooler under the opposite phase, La Niña.

There are 14 designations of parks and protected areas in the province that reflect the different administration and creation of these areas in a modern context. There are 141 ecological Reserves, 35 provincial marine parks, 7 Provincial Heritage Sites, 6 <a href="National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada">National Historic Sites of Canada</a>, 4 <a href="National%20park">National Parks</a> and 3 National Park Reserves. 12.5% () of British Columbia is currently considered protected under one of the 14 different designations that includes over 800 distinct areas.

British Columbia contains seven of <a href="National%20Parks%20of%20Canada">Canada's national parks</a>and National Park Reserves:

British Columbia contains a large number of <a href="provincial%20park">provincial park</a>s, run by BC Parks under the aegis of the Ministry of Environment. British Columbia's provincial parks system is the second largest parks system in Canada, the largest being Canada's National Parks system).

Another tier of parks in British Columbia are <a href="regional%20park">regional park</a>s, which are maintained and run by <a href="regional%20districts">regional districts</a>. Forest Recreation Sites are operated by the Ministry of Forests.

In addition to these areas, over of <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> are protected by the <a href="Agricultural%20Land%20Reserve">Agricultural Land Reserve</a>.

Much of the province is undeveloped, so that populations of many mammalian species that have become rare in much of the United States still flourish in British Columbia. Watching animals of various sorts, including a very wide range of birds, has long been popular. Bears (<a href="Grizzly%20bear">grizzly</a>, <a href="American%20black%20bear">black</a>&mdashincluding the <a href="Kermode%20bear">Kermode bear</a> or spirit bear) live here, as do <a href="deer">deer</a>, <a href="elk">elk</a>, <a href="moose">moose</a>, <a href="Caribou%20%28North%20America%29">caribou</a>, <a href="Bighorn%20sheep">big-horn sheep</a>, <a href="mountain%20goat">mountain goat</a>s, <a href="marmot">marmot</a>s, <a href="beaver">beaver</a>s, <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s, <a href="Gray%20wolf">wolves</a>, <a href="mustelidae">mustelids</a> (such as <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>s, <a href="badger">badger</a>s and <a href="fisher%20%28animal%29">fishers</a>), <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s, <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s, <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="Canada%20goose">Canada geese</a>, <a href="swan">swan</a>s, <a href="loon">loon</a>s, <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s, <a href="owl">owl</a>s, <a href="raven">raven</a>s, <a href="harlequin%20duck">harlequin duck</a>s, and many other sorts of ducks. Smaller birds (<a href="American%20robin">robins</a>, <a href="jay">jay</a>s, <a href="grosbeak">grosbeak</a>s, <a href="Tit%20%28bird%29">chickadees</a>, and so on) also abound.
Murrelets are known from Frederick Island, a small islands off the coast of Queen Charlotte's Islands.

Many healthy populations of fish are present, including <a href="salmonidae">salmonids</a> such as several species of <a href="salmon">salmon</a>, <a href="trout">trout</a>, <a href="Salvelinus">char</a>. Besides salmon and trout, sport-fishers in BC also catch <a href="halibut">halibut</a>, <a href="Rainbow%20trout">steelhead</a>, <a href="bass%20%28fish%29">bass</a>, and <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a>. On the coast, <a href="harbour%20seal">harbour seal</a>s and <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">river otters</a> are common. <a href="Cetacea">Cetacea</a>n species native to the coast include the <a href="Killer%20whale">orca</a>, <a href="grey%20whale">grey whale</a>, <a href="harbour%20porpoise">harbour porpoise</a>, <a href="Dall%27s%20Porpoise">Dall's Porpoise</a>, <a href="Pacific%20white-sided%20dolphin">Pacific white-sided dolphin</a> and <a href="minke%20whale">minke whale</a>.
British Columbian introduced species include: common <a href="Taraxacum">dandelion</a>, <a href="Common%20pheasant">ring-necked pheasant</a>, <a href="Pacific%20oyster">Pacific oyster</a>, <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a>, <a href="black%20slug">black slug</a>, <a href="European%20starling">European starling</a>, <a href="cowbird">cowbird</a>, <a href="Centaurea">knapweed</a>, <a href="American%20bullfrog">bullfrog</a>, <a href="Lythrum%20salicaria">purple loosestrife</a>, <a href="Cytisus%20scoparius">Scotch broom</a>, <a href="Rubus%20armeniacus">Himalayan blackberry</a>, <a href="Forficula%20auricularia">European earwig</a>, <a href="tent%20caterpillar">tent caterpillar</a>, <a href="Woodlouse">sowbug</a>, grey <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>, Asian <a href="longhorn%20beetle">longhorn beetle</a>, <a href="Hedera%20helix">English ivy</a>, <a href="fallow%20deer">fallow deer</a>, <a href="thistle">thistle</a>, <a href="gorse">gorse</a>, <a href="Norway%20rat">Norway rat</a>, <a href="crested%20myna">crested myna</a>h, and Asian or European <a href="gypsy%20moth">gypsy moth</a>.

As of 2001

White spruce or <a href="Picea%20engelmannii">Engelmann spruce</a> and their hybrids occur in 12 of the 14 <a href="biogeoclimatic%20zones%20of%20British%20Columbia">biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia</a> (Coates et al. 1994).
Common types of trees present in BC's forests include pine, <a href="Western%20Redcedar">Western Redcedar</a>, birch, hemlock, maple and spruce.

Plant foods traditionally contributed only a part of the total food intake of coastal <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> peoples of British Columbia, though they contributed to most of the material good produced. Among the plant foods used, berries, some roots (for example the Camas Lily – part of the <a href="Camassia">Camassia</a> family), cambium noodles (inner bark of <a href="Tsuga">hemlock</a>), and seaweeds were (and to an extent still are) important. Animal products were traditionally far more important than plant foods in terms of quantity consumed; however, the huge nutritional diversity provided by native plants of BC largely contributes to the health of First Nations peoples of British Columbia. (Before <a href="colonization">colonization</a>, British Columbia had the densest aboriginal population of any region in what is now called Canada.)

<a href="Environment%20Canada">Environment Canada</a> subdivides British Columbia into six <a href="Ecozones%20of%20Canada">ecozones</a>:

The area now known as British Columbia is home to First Nations groups that have a deep history with a significant number of indigenous languages. There are more than 200 First Nations in BC. Prior to contact (with non-Aboriginal people), human history is known from oral histories of First Nations groups, archaeological investigations, and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period.

The arrival of <a href="Paleoindians">Paleoindians</a> from <a href="Beringia">Beringia</a> took place between 20,000 and 12,000 years ago. <a href="Hunter-gatherer">Hunter-gatherer</a> families were the main social structure from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago. The nomadic population lived in non-permanent structures foraging for nuts, berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs. Around 5,000 years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally. Thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more <a href="sedentary%20lifestyle">sedentary lifestyle</a>. These indigenous populations evolved over the next 5,000 years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs.

To the northwest of the province are the peoples of the <a href="Na-Dene%20languages">Na-Dene languages</a>, which include the <a href="Athapaskan%20languages">Athapaskan-speaking peoples</a> and the <a href="Tlingit%20people">Tlingit</a>, who lived on the islands of southern Alaska and northern British Columbia. The Na-Dene language group is believed to be linked to the <a href="Yeniseian%20languages">Yeniseian languages</a> of Siberia. The <a href="Dene">Dene</a> of the western Arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from Asia to North America. The <a href="British%20Columbia%20Interior">Interior of British Columbia</a> was home to the <a href="Salishan%20languages">Salishan language</a> groups such as the <a href="Secwepemc">Shuswap (Secwepemc)</a>, <a href="Okanagan%20people">Okanagan</a> and Athabaskan language groups, primarily the <a href="Dakelh">Dakelh</a> (Carrier) and the <a href="Chilcotin%20people">Tsilhqot'in</a>. The inlets and valleys of the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Coast">British Columbia Coast</a> sheltered large, distinctive populations, such as the <a href="Haida%20people">Haida</a>, <a href="Kwakwaka%27wakw">Kwakwaka'wakw</a> and <a href="Nuu-chah-nulth%20people">Nuu-chah-nulth</a>, sustained by the region's abundant salmon and shellfish. These peoples developed <a href="Complex%20society">complex cultures</a> dependent on the <a href="western%20red%20cedar">western red cedar</a> that included wooden houses, seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved <a href="potlatch">potlatch</a> items and <a href="totem%20poles">totem poles</a>.

Contact with Europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from Europe that the people had no immunity to. The result was a dramatic population collapse, culminating in the 1862 Smallpox outbreak in Victoria that spread throughout the coast. European settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of British Columbia. Colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the First Nations people, and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists. To ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land, natives were relocated onto reserves, which were often too small to support their way of life. By the 1930s, over 1500 reserves were located within British Columbia.

The British, during the colonial period, spread across the world claiming territories and building the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. Lands now known as British Columbia were added to the empire during the 19th century. Originally established under the auspices of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>, colonies were established (Vancouver Island, the mainland) that were amalgamated, then entered Confederation as British Columbia in 1871 as part of the Dominion of Canada.

During the 1770s, <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> killed at least 30% of the Pacific Northwest <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a>. This devastating epidemic was the first in a series; the Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1862 killed 50% of the native population.
The arrival of Europeans began around the mid-18th century, as <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>rs entered the area to harvest <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a>s. While it is thought that <a href="Francis%20Drake">Sir Francis Drake</a> may have explored the British Columbian coast in 1579, it was <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20P%C3%A9rez%20Hern%C3%A1ndez">Juan Pérez</a> who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1774. <a href="Juan%20Francisco%20de%20la%20Bodega%20y%20Quadra">Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra</a> explored the coast in 1775. In doing so, Pérez and Quadra reasserted the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a> claim for the <a href="Pacific%20coast">Pacific coast</a>, first made by <a href="Vasco%20N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez%20de%20Balboa">Vasco Núñez de Balboa</a> in 1513.

The explorations of <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> in 1778 and <a href="George%20Vancouver">George Vancouver</a> in 1792–93 established British jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the Columbia River. In 1793, <a href="Sir%20Alexander%20Mackenzie">Sir Alexander Mackenzie</a> was the first European to journey across North America overland to the Pacific Ocean, inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of <a href="Dean%20Channel">Dean Channel</a> near <a href="Bella%20Coola%2C%20British%20Columbia">Bella Coola</a>. His expedition theoretically established British sovereignty inland, and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the Canadian Prairies and the Pacific. Mackenzie and other explorers—notably <a href="John%20Finlay%20%28fur%20trader%29">John Finlay</a>, <a href="Simon%20Fraser%20%28explorer%29">Simon Fraser</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Black">Samuel Black</a>, and <a href="David%20Thompson%20%28explorer%29">David Thompson</a>—were primarily concerned with extending the <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>, rather than political considerations. In 1794, by the third of a series of agreements known as the <a href="Nootka%20Convention">Nootka Convention</a>s, <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spain</a> conceded its claims of exclusivity in the Pacific. This opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers, including Britain, but because of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, there was little British action on its claims in the region until later.

The establishment of <a href="trading%20post">trading post</a>s under the auspices of the <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a> and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), effectively established a permanent British presence in the region. The Columbia District was broadly defined as being south of 54°40 north latitude, (the southern limit of <a href="Russian%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Russian America</a>), north of Mexican-controlled California, and west of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. It was, by the <a href="Treaty%20of%201818">Anglo-American Convention of 1818</a>, under the "joint occupancy and use" of citizens of the United States and subjects of Britain (which is to say, the fur companies). This co-occupancy was ended with the <a href="Oregon%20Treaty">Oregon Treaty</a> of 1846.

The major supply route was the <a href="York%20Factory%20Express">York Factory Express</a> between <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a> and <a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a>. Some of the early outposts grew into settlements, communities, and cities. Among the places in British Columbia that began as fur trading posts are Fort St. John (established 1794); <a href="Hudson%27s%20Hope%2C%20British%20Columbia">Hudson's Hope</a> (1805); <a href="Fort%20Nelson%2C%20British%20Columbia">Fort Nelson</a> (1805); <a href="Fort%20St.%20James%2C%20British%20Columbia">Fort St. James</a> (1806); <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince George</a> (1807); Kamloops (1812); <a href="Fort%20Langley%2C%20British%20Columbia">Fort Langley</a> (1827); <a href="Fort%20Victoria%20%28British%20Columbia%29">Fort Victoria</a> (1843); <a href="Yale%2C%20British%20Columbia">Yale</a> (1848); and Nanaimo (1853). Fur company posts that became cities in what is now the United States include <a href="Vancouver%2C%20Washington">Vancouver, Washington</a> (<a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a>), formerly the "capital" of Hudson's Bay operations in the Columbia District, <a href="Colville%2C%20Washington">Colville, Washington</a> and <a href="Walla%20Walla%2C%20Washington">Walla Walla, Washington</a> (old <a href="Fort%20Nez%20Perc%C3%A9s">Fort Nez Percés</a>).

With the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in 1821, the region now comprising British Columbia existed in three fur trading departments. The bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the <a href="New%20Caledonia%20%28Canada%29">New Caledonia</a> district, administered from Fort St. James. The interior south of the <a href="Thompson%20River">Thompson River</a> <a href="drainage%20basin">watershed</a> and north of the Columbia was organized into the Columbia District, administered from Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River. The northeast corner of the province east of the Rockies, known as the Peace River Block, was attached to the much larger <a href="District%20of%20Athabasca">Athabasca District</a>, headquartered in <a href="Fort%20Chipewyan%2C%20Alberta">Fort Chipewyan</a>, in present-day Alberta.

Until 1849, these districts were a wholly unorganized area of <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a> under the <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> jurisdiction of HBC administrators. Unlike <a href="Rupert%27s%20Land">Rupert's Land</a> to the north and east, however, the territory was not a concession to the company. Rather, it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the First Nations inhabitants. All that was changed with the westward extension of American exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty, especially in the southern <a href="Columbia%20Basin">Columbia Basin</a> (within present day Washington and <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>). In 1846, the Oregon Treaty divided the territory along the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel</a> to the <a href="Strait%20of%20Georgia">Strait of Georgia</a>, with the area south of this boundary (excluding Vancouver Island and the <a href="Gulf%20Islands">Gulf Islands</a>) transferred to sole American sovereignty. The <a href="Colony%20of%20Vancouver%20Island">Colony of Vancouver Island</a> was created in 1849, with Victoria designated as the capital. New Caledonia, as the whole of the mainland rather than just its north-central Interior came to be called, continued to be an unorganized territory of British North America, "administered" by individual HBC trading post managers.

With the <a href="Fraser%20Canyon%20Gold%20Rush">Fraser Canyon Gold Rush</a> in 1858, an influx of Americans into New Caledonia prompted the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">colonial office</a> to designate the mainland as the Colony of British Columbia. When news of the <a href="Fraser%20Canyon%20Gold%20Rush">Fraser Canyon Gold Rush</a> reached London, Richard Clement Moody was hand-picked by the <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a>, under <a href="Sir%20Edward%20Bulwer-Lytton">Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton</a>, to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia into the British Empire's "bulwark in the farthest west" and "found a second England on the shores of the Pacific". Lytton desired to send to the colony "representatives of the best of British culture, not just a police force": he sought men who possessed "courtesy, high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world" and he decided to send Moody, whom the Government considered to be the "English gentleman and British Officer" at the head of the <a href="Royal%20Engineers%2C%20Columbia%20Detachment">Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment</a>.

Moody and his family arrived in British Columbia in December 1858, commanding the <a href="Royal%20Engineers%2C%20Columbia%20Detachment">Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment</a>. He was sworn in as the first <a href="Lieutenant-Governor%20of%20British%20Columbia">Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia</a> and appointed Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia. On the advice of Lytton, Moody hired <a href="Robert%20Burnaby">Robert Burnaby</a> as his personal secretary.

In British Columbia, Moody "wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness" and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, "styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe". Subsequent to the enactment of the Pre-emption Act of 1860, Moody settled the <a href="Lower%20Mainland">Lower Mainland</a>. He selected the site and founded the new capital, <a href="New%20Westminster">New Westminster</a>. He selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port. He was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site, writing in his letter to Blackwood,

Moody designed the first <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20British%20Columbia">Coat of arms of British Columbia</a>.

However, Lord Lytton "forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town" and the efforts of Moody's Engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds, which, together with the continuous opposition of <a href="James%20Douglas%20%28governor%29">Douglas</a>, "made it impossible for Moody’s design to be fulfilled".

Moody and the Royal Engineers also built an extensive road network, including what would become <a href="Kingsway%20%28Vancouver%29">Kingsway</a>, connecting New Westminster to <a href="False%20Creek">False Creek</a>, the North Road between <a href="Port%20Moody">Port Moody</a> and New Westminster, and the <a href="Cariboo%20Road">Cariboo Road</a> and <a href="Stanley%20Park">Stanley Park</a>. He named <a href="Burnaby%20Lake">Burnaby Lake</a> after his private secretary <a href="Robert%20Burnaby">Robert Burnaby</a> and named Port Coquitlam’s 400-foot "Mary Hill" after his wife. As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated "government reserves", which included <a href="Stanley%20Park">Stanley Park</a> as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The Pre-emption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for <a href="land%20grabbing">land grabbing</a>.<a href="Port%20Moody">Port Moody</a> is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US.

By 1862, the <a href="Cariboo%20Gold%20Rush">Cariboo Gold Rush</a>, attracting an additional 5000 miners, was underway, and Douglas hastened construction of the Great North Road (commonly known now as the <a href="Cariboo%20Wagon%20Road">Cariboo Wagon Road</a>) up the <a href="Fraser%20Canyon">Fraser Canyon</a> to the prospecting region around <a href="Barkerville">Barkerville</a>. By the time of this gold rush, the character of the colony was changing, as a more stable population of British colonists settled in the region, establishing businesses, opening <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a>s, and engaging in <a href="fishery">fishing</a> and agriculture. With this increased stability, objections to the colony's absentee governor and the lack of <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a> began to be vocalised, led by the influential editor of the <a href="New%20Westminster">New Westminster</a> "British Columbian" and future <a href="premier%20of%20British%20Columbia">Premier</a>, <a href="John%20Robson%20%28politician%29">John Robson</a>. A series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by Douglas and the colonial office until Douglas was eased out of office in 1864. Finally, the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor.

A series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed, the largest being the <a href="Cariboo%20Gold%20Rush">Cariboo Gold Rush</a> in 1862, forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of far-flung boom communities like <a href="Barkerville%2C%20British%20Columbia">Barkerville</a> and <a href="Lillooet">Lillooet</a>, which sprang up overnight. The Vancouver Island colony was facing financial crises of its own, and pressure to merge the two eventually <a href="Colony%20of%20British%20Columbia%20%281866%E2%80%9371%29">succeeded in 1866</a>, when the colony of British Columbia was amalgamated with the <a href="Colony%20of%20Vancouver%20Island">Colony of Vancouver Island</a> to form the <a href="Colony%20of%20British%20Columbia%20%281866%E2%80%9371%29">Colony of British Columbia (1866–71)</a>, which was, in turn, succeeded by the present day province of British Columbia following the <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Canadian Confederation</a> of 1871.

The Confederation League, including such figures as <a href="Amor%20De%20Cosmos">Amor De Cosmos</a>, <a href="John%20Robson%20%28politician%29">John Robson</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Beaven">Robert Beaven</a>, led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada, which had been created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the <a href="Province%20of%20Canada">Province of Canada</a>, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> and <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>). Several factors motivated this agitation, including the fear of annexation to the United States, the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush.
With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Confederation</a> on July 20, 1871. The borders of the province were not completely settled. The Treaty of Washington sent the <a href="Pig%20War%20%281859%29">Pig War</a> San Juan Islands Border dispute to arbitration in 1871 and in 1903, the province's territory shrank again after the <a href="Alaska%20boundary%20dispute">Alaska boundary dispute</a> settled the vague boundary of the <a href="Alaska%20Panhandle">Alaska Panhandle</a>.

Population in British Columbia continued to expand as the province's <a href="mining">mining</a>, <a href="forestry">forestry</a>, <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, and <a href="fishery">fishing</a> sectors were developed. Mining activity was particularly notable throughout the Mainland, particularly in the <a href="Boundary%20Country">Boundary Country</a>, in the <a href="Slocan%20Valley">Slocan</a>, in the <a href="Kootenays">West Kootenay</a> around <a href="Trail%2C%20British%20Columbia">Trail</a>, the East Kootenay (the southeast corner of the province), the Fraser Canyon, the <a href="Cariboo%20District">Cariboo</a>, the <a href="Omineca%20Country">Omineca</a> and the <a href="Cassiar%20Country">Cassiar</a>, so much so a common epithet for the Mainland, even after provincehood, was "the Gold Colony". Agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile Fraser Valley, and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the Thompson River area, the Cariboo, the <a href="Chilcotin%20District">Chilcotin</a>, and the Okanagan. Forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast, which was also the locus of a growing fishery.

The completion of the railway in 1885 was a huge boost to the province's economy, facilitating the transportation of the region's considerable resources to the east. The milltown of Granville, known as <a href="Gastown">Gastown</a>, near the mouth of the <a href="Burrard%20Inlet">Burrard Inlet</a> was selected as the terminus of the railway, prompting the incorporation of the City as Vancouver in 1886. The completion of the <a href="Port%20of%20Vancouver">Port of Vancouver</a> spurred rapid growth, and in less than fifty years the city surpassed <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, as the largest in <a href="Western%20Canada">Western Canada</a>. The early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically, its settlement and development—were paramount. This included expropriation from First Nations people of their land, control over its resources, as well as the ability to trade in some resources (such as the fishery).

Establishing a <a href="labor%20force">labour force</a> to develop the province was problematic from the start, and British Columbia was the locus of immigration from <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. The influx of a non-<a href="Caucasian%20race">Caucasian</a> population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups, resulting in agitation (much of it successful) to restrict the ability of <a href="Asian%20people">Asian people</a> to immigrate to British Columbia through the imposition of a <a href="Tax%20per%20head">head tax</a>. This resentment culminated in mob attacks against Chinese and Japanese immigrants in Vancouver in 1887 and 1907. By 1923, almost all <a href="Chinese%20Immigration%20Act%2C%201923">Chinese immigration had been blocked</a> except for merchants, professionals, students and investors.

Meanwhile, the province continued to grow. In 1914, the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line, the <a href="Grand%20Trunk%20Pacific%20Railway">Grand Trunk Pacific</a>, linking north-central British Columbia from the <a href="Yellowhead%20Pass">Yellowhead Pass</a> through Prince George to <a href="Prince%20Rupert%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince Rupert</a> was driven at <a href="Fort%20Fraser%2C%20British%20Columbia">Fort Fraser</a>. This opened up the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Coast">North Coast</a> and the <a href="Bulkley%20Valley">Bulkley Valley</a> region to new economic opportunities. What had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry, farming, and mining.

In <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the province responded strongly to the call to assist the British Empire against its German foes in French and Belgian battlefields. About 55,570 of the 400,000 British Columbian residents, the highest per-capita rate in Canada, responded to the military needs. Horseriders from the province's Interior region and First Nations soldiers made contributions to Vimy Ridge and other battles. About 6,225 men from the province died in combat.

When the men returned from <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the <a href="Prohibition%20in%20Canada">prohibition</a> of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hard-core drinking that Vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war. Because of pressure from veterans, prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the "soldier and the working man" could enjoy a drink, but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by European immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of "soldier parties" to represent their interests, variously named Soldier-Farmer, Soldier-Labour, and <a href="Labour%20candidates%20and%20parties%20in%20Canada">Farmer-Labour</a> Parties. These formed the basis of the fractured labour-political spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties, including those who would eventually form the <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth</a> and the early <a href="British%20Columbia%20Social%20Credit%20Party">Social Credit</a> splinter groups.
The advent of <a href="prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition in the United States</a> created new opportunities, and many found employment or at least profit in cross-border liquor smuggling. Much of Vancouver's prosperity and opulence in the 1920s results from this "pirate economy", although growth in forestry, fishing and mining continued. The end of US prohibition, combined with the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, plunged the province into economic destitution. Compounding the already dire local economic situation, tens of thousands of men from colder parts of Canada swarmed into Vancouver, creating huge <a href="hobo">hobo</a> jungles around <a href="False%20Creek">False Creek</a> and the Burrard Inlet <a href="Classification%20yard">rail yards</a>, including the old Canadian Pacific Railway mainline <a href="Right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> through the heart of the <a href="Downtown%20Vancouver">city's downtown</a> (at Hastings and Carrall). Increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts, an occupation of the main Post Office at <a href="Granville%20Street">Granville</a> and <a href="Hastings%20Street%20%28Vancouver%29">Hastings</a> which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> on the docks for almost three years. A Vancouver contingent for the <a href="On-to-Ottawa%20Trek">On-to-Ottawa Trek</a> was organized and seized a train, which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a> straddling the tracks at <a href="Mission%2C%20British%20Columbia">Mission</a>; the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the Depression.

There were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the 1930s, but it was the onset of World War II which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the Depression. Because of the war effort, women entered the workforce as never before.

British Columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the Pacific Ocean to have close relations with <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>. However, this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward Asian immigrants. This was most manifest during the Second World War when many people of <a href="Japanese%20Canadian%20internment">Japanese descent were relocated</a> or interned in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Interior">Interior</a> of the province.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> the mainstream <a href="British%20Columbia%20Liberal%20Party">BC Liberal</a> and <a href="British%20Columbia%20Conservative%20Party">BC Conservative</a> Parties of British Columbia united in a formal <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a> under new Liberal leader <a href="John%20Hart%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">John Hart</a>, who replaced <a href="Thomas%20Dufferin%20Pattullo">Duff Pattullo</a> when the latter failed to win a majority in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20general%20election%2C%201941">1941 election</a>. While the Liberals won the most number of seats, they actually received fewer votes than the socialist <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20British%20Columbia">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a> (CCF). Pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival Conservatives led by <a href="Royal%20Maitland">Royal Maitland</a> and was replaced by Hart, who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five Liberal and three Conservative ministers. The CCF was invited to join the coalition but refused.

The pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of World War II was to prevent the CCF, which had won a surprise victory in <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> in 1944, from ever coming to power in British Columbia. The CCF's popular vote was high enough in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 election</a> that they were likely to have won three-way contests and could have formed government. However, the coalition prevented that by uniting the anti-<a href="socialism">socialist</a> vote. In the post-war environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects, notably the completion of <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%2097">Highway 97</a> north of Prince George to the Peace River Block, a section called the John Hart Highway and also public hospital insurance.

In 1947 the reins of the Coalition were taken over by <a href="Byron%20Ingemar%20Johnson">Byron Ingemar Johnson</a>. The Conservatives had wanted their new leader <a href="Herbert%20Anscomb">Herbert Anscomb</a> to be premier, but the Liberals in the Coalition refused. Johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in British Columbia history (61%) in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20general%20election%2C%201949">1949 election</a>. This victory was attributable to the popularity of his government's spending programmes, despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power. During his tenure, major infrastructures continued to expand, such as the agreement with <a href="Rio%20Tinto%20Alcan">Alcan Aluminum</a> to build the town of <a href="Kitimat%2C%20British%20Columbia">Kitimat</a> with an aluminum smelter and the large <a href="Kemano%20Generating%20Station">Kemano Hydro Project</a>. Johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the 1948 flooding of the Fraser Valley, which was a major blow to that region and to the province's economy.

Increasing tension between the Liberal and Conservative coalition partners led the Liberal Party executive to vote to instruct Johnson to terminate the arrangement. Johnson ended the coalition and dropped his Conservative cabinet ministers, including <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister">Deputy Premier</a> and <a href="Finance%20minister">Finance minister</a> Herbert Anscomb, precipitating the <a href="British%20Columbia%20general%20election%2C%201952">general election of 1952</a>. A referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot (similar to a <a href="Ranked%20voting%20systems">preferential ballot</a>), where voters could select second and third choices. The intent of the ballot, as campaigned for by Liberals and Conservatives, was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the CCF, but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties, including the CCF, voted for the fringe British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socreds), who wound up with the largest number of seats in the House (19), only one seat ahead of the CCF, despite the CCF having 34.3% of the vote to Social Credit's 30.18%.

The Social Credit Party, led by rebel former Conservative MLA <a href="W.%20A.%20C.%20Bennett">W. A. C. Bennett</a>, formed a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> backed by the Liberals and Conservatives (with 6 and 4 seats respectively). Bennett began a series of fiscal reforms, preaching a new variety of <a href="populism">populism</a> as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development, laying the ground for a <a href="British%20Columbia%20general%20election%2C%201953">second election in 1953</a> in which the new Bennett regime secured a majority of seats, with 38% of the vote. Secure with that majority, Bennett returned the province to the first-past-the-post system thereafter, which is still in use today.

With the election of the Social Credit Party, British Columbia embarked on a phase of rapid <a href="economic%20development">economic development</a>. Bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years, during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development, fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry, mining, and energy sectors.

During these two decades, the government <a href="Nationalization">nationalized</a> British Columbia Electric and the British Columbia Power Company, as well as smaller electric companies, renaming the entity <a href="BC%20Hydro">BC Hydro</a>. <a href="West%20Kootenay%20Power%20and%20Light">West Kootenay Power and Light</a> remained independent of BC Hydro, being owned and operated by <a href="Cominco">Cominco</a>, though tied into the regional power grid. By the end of the 1960s, several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the <a href="Peace%20River%20%28Canada%29">Peace</a>, Columbia, and <a href="Nechako%20River">Nechako River</a> watersheds (the Nechako Diversion to <a href="Kemano">Kemano</a>, was to supply power to the <a href="Alcan%20Inc.">Alcan Inc.</a> aluminum smelter at <a href="Kitimat">Kitimat</a>, and was not part of the provincial power grid but <a href="Independent%20Power%20Producers%20in%20British%20Columbia">privately owned</a>). Major transmission deals were concluded, most notably the <a href="Columbia%20River%20Treaty">Columbia River Treaty</a> between Canada and the United States. The province's economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector, as well as oil and gas development in the province's northeast.

The 1950s and 1960s were also marked by development in the province's transportation infrastructure. In 1960, the government established <a href="BC%20Ferries">BC Ferries</a> as a <a href="Crown%20corporations%20of%20Canada">crown corporation</a>, to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system, also supported by federal grants as being part of the <a href="Trans-Canada%20Highway">Trans-Canada Highway</a> system. That system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges, and paving of existing highways and provincial roads.

Vancouver and Victoria became cultural centres as poets, authors, artists, musicians, as well as dancers, actors, and "haute cuisine" chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures, with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many <a href="Draft%20dodgers">Draft dodgers</a> from the United States. Similarly, these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics, commentators, and creative thinkers. Tourism also began to play an important role in the economy. The rise of Japan and other Pacific economies was a great boost to British Columbia's economy, primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees.

Politically and socially, the 1960s brought a period of significant social ferment. The divide between the <a href="Left-wing%20politics">political left</a> and right, which had prevailed in the province since the Depression and the rise of the <a href="labour%20movement">labour movement</a>, sharpened as so-called <a href="Capitalism">free enterprise</a> parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by Social Credit—in opposition to the <a href="social%20democracy">social democratic</a> <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Canada%29">New Democratic Party</a>, the successor to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. As the province's economy blossomed, so did labour-management tensions. Tensions emerged, also, from the counterculture movement of the late 1960s, of which Vancouver and Nanaimo were centres. The conflict between <a href="hippie">hippie</a>s and <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Vancouver">Vancouver mayor</a> <a href="Tom%20Campbell%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Tom Campbell</a> was particularly legendary, culminating in the so-called <a href="Gastown%20Riots">Gastown Riots</a> of 1971. By the end of the decade, with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the <a href="status%20quo">status quo</a> rising, the Bennett government's achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity.

On August 27, 1969, the Social Credit Party was re-elected in a general election for what would be Bennett's final term in power. At the start of the 1970s, the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector. However, BC Hydro reported its first loss, which was the beginning of the end for Bennett and the Social Credit Party.

The Socreds were forced from power in the August 1972 election, paving the way for a provincial New Democratic Party (NDP) government under <a href="Dave%20Barrett">Dave Barrett</a>. Under Barrett, the large provincial surplus soon became a deficit, although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous Social Credit regime and its "<a href="two%20sets%20of%20books">two sets of books</a>", as WAC Bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management. The brief three-year ("Thousand Days") period of NDP governance brought several lasting changes to the province, most notably the creation of the Agricultural Land Reserve, intended to protect farmland from redevelopment, and the <a href="Insurance%20Corporation%20of%20British%20Columbia">Insurance Corporation of British Columbia</a>, a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing single-payer basic automobile insurance.

Perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too far-reaching, coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the NDP in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20general%20election%2C%201975">1975 general election</a>. Social Credit, under W.A.C. Bennett's son, <a href="Bill%20Bennett">Bill Bennett</a>, was returned to office. Under the younger Bennett's government, 85% of the province's land base was transferred from Government Reserve to management by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Forests">Ministry of Forests</a>, reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the Premier's Office, and NDP-instigated social programs were rolled back, with then-Human Resources Minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy, although the new-era Socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the NDP—notably the creation of the <a href="Whistler%2C%20British%20Columbia">Resort Municipality of Whistler</a>, whose special status including Sunday drinking, then an anomaly in BC.

Also during the "MiniWac" regime (a reference to his father's acronym, WAC) certain money-losing Crown-owned assets were "privatized" in a mass giveaway of shares in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Resources%20Investment%20Corporation">British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation</a>, "BCRIC", with the "Brick shares" soon becoming near-worthless. Towards the end of his tenure in power, Bennett oversaw the completion of several <a href="megaproject">megaproject</a>s meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most right-wing parties, British Columbia's Social Credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy. Most notable of these was the winning of a world's fair for Vancouver, which came in the form of <a href="Expo%2086">Expo 86</a>, to which was tied the construction of the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%205">Coquihalla Highway</a> and Vancouver's <a href="SkyTrain%20%28Vancouver%29">SkyTrain</a> system. The Coquihalla Highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premier's brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public, and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project. Both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal, the <a href="Doman%20Scandal">Doman Scandal</a>, in which the Premier and millionaire backer Herb Doman were investigated for insider-trading and <a href="securities%20fraud">securities fraud</a>. Nonetheless, the Socreds were re-elected in 1979 under Bennett, who led the party until 1986.

As the province entered a sustained <a href="recession">recession</a>, Bennett's popularity and media image were in decline. On April 1, 1983, Premier Bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government, and the <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20British%20Columbia">Lieutenant-Governor</a>, <a href="Henry%20Pybus%20Bell-Irving">Henry Pybus Bell-Irving</a>, was forced to call Bennett to <a href="Government%20House%20%28British%20Columbia%29">Government House</a> to resolve the impasse, and an election was called for April 30, while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the <a href="Executive%20Council%20of%20British%20Columbia">Executive Council</a> no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis. Campaigning on a platform of moderation, Bennett won an unexpected majority.

After several weeks of silence in the aftermath, a sitting of the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20British%20Columbia">House</a> was finally called and in the <a href="speech%20from%20the%20throne">speech from the throne</a> the Socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed "restraint", which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign. The programme included cuts to "motherhood" issues of the left, including the human rights branch, the offices of the Ombudsman and Rentalsman, women's programs, environmental and cultural programs, while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate British Columbia. This sparked a backlash, with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech, and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to 100,000 people.

This became known as the 1983 <a href="Solidarity%20Crisis">Solidarity Crisis</a>, from the name of the <a href="Solidarity%20Coalition">Solidarity Coalition</a>, a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized, consisting of organized labour and community groups, with the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Federation%20of%20Labour">British Columbia Federation of Labour</a> forming a separate organization of unions, <a href="Operation%20Solidarity">Operation Solidarity</a>, under the direction of <a href="Jack%20Munro">Jack Munro</a>, then-President of the <a href="International%20Woodworkers%20of%20America">International Woodworkers of America</a> (IWA), the most powerful of the province's resource unions. Tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the NDP and the left. Just as a strike at <a href="Pacific%20Press%20Publishing%20Association">Pacific Press</a> ended, which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the province's major papers, the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and IWA president, Jack Munro and Premier Bennett.

A tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued, as among the new laws were those enabling non-union labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues, with companies from Alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with union-scale British Columbia companies. Despite the tension, Bennett's last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with Expo, and Bennett was to end his career by hosting <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a> and <a href="Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">Lady Diana</a> on their visit to open Expo 86. His retirement being announced, a Social Credit convention was scheduled for the Whistler Resort, which came down to a three-way shooting match between Bud Smith, the Premier's right-hand man but an unelected official, Social Credit party <a href="grande%20dame">grande dame</a> <a href="Grace%20McCarthy">Grace McCarthy</a>, and the charismatic but eccentric <a href="Bill%20Vander%20Zalm">Bill Vander Zalm</a>.

Bill Vander Zalm became the new Socred leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, and led the party to victory in the election later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> scandal following the sale of <a href="Fantasy%20Gardens">Fantasy Gardens</a>, a <a href="Christian">Christian</a> and <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Dutch culture</a> <a href="Amusement%20park">theme park</a> built by the Premier, to <a href="Tan%20Yu">Tan Yu</a>, a <a href="Filipino%20Chinese">Filipino Chinese</a> gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor <a href="Faye%20Leung">Faye Leung</a> of a party in the "Howard Hughes Suite" on the top two floors of the <a href="Bayshore%20Inn">Bayshore Inn</a>, where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a <a href="bag%20of%20money">bag of money</a> in a brown paper bag passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and <a href="Rita%20Johnston">Rita Johnston</a> became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which led to the reducing of the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor <a href="Mike%20Harcourt">Mike Harcourt</a>.

In 1988, <a href="David%20Lam%20%28real%20estate%20entrepreneur%29">David Lam</a> was appointed as British Columbia’s twenty-fifth Lieutenant-Governor, and was the Province's first Lieutenant-Governor of Chinese origin.

Johnston lost the <a href="British%20Columbia%20general%20election%2C%201991">1991 general election</a> to the NDP, under the leadership of Mike Harcourt, a former mayor of Vancouver. The NDP's unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular and helped boost the province's growing <a href="tourism">tourism</a> sector. However, the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy. Housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade, despite political turmoil. Harcourt ended up resigning over "<a href="Bingogate">Bingogate</a>"—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings. Harcourt was not implicated, but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside. <a href="Glen%20Clark">Glen Clark</a>, a former president of the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Federation%20of%20Labour">BC Federation of Labour</a>, was chosen the new leader of the NDP, which won a second term in 1996. More scandals dogged the party, most notably the <a href="Fast%20Ferry%20Scandal">Fast Ferry Scandal</a> involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in British Columbia. An allegation (never substantiated) that the Premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to Clark's resignation as Premier. He was succeeded on an interim basis by <a href="Dan%20Miller%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Dan Miller</a> who was in turn followed by <a href="Ujjal%20Dosanjh">Ujjal Dosanjh</a> following a leadership convention.

In the 2001 general election <a href="Gordon%20Campbell%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Gordon Campbell</a>'s BC Liberals defeated the NDP, gaining 77 out of 79 total seats in the provincial legislature. Campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the NDP's policies including scrapping the "fast ferries" project, lowering income taxes, and the controversial sale of <a href="BC%20Rail">BC Rail</a> to CN Rail. Campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for <a href="driving%20under%20the%20influence">driving under the influence</a> during a vacation in Hawaii. However, Campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the 2005 general election, against a substantially strengthened NDP opposition. Campbell won a third term in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20general%20election%2C%202009">British Columbia general election, 2009</a>, marking the first time in 23 years that a premier has been elected to a third term.

The province won a bid to host the <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a> in Vancouver and Whistler. As promised in his 2002 re-election campaign, Vancouver Mayor Larry Campbell staged a non-binding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the Olympics. In February 2003, Vancouver's residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid. Sixty-four percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games.

After the Olympic joy had faded, Campbell's popularity started to fall. His management style, the implementation of the <a href="Harmonized%20Sales%20Tax">Harmonized Sales Tax</a> (HST) against election promises and the cancelling of the <a href="BC%20Legislature%20Raids">BC Rail corruption trial</a> lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support. He would resign in November 2010 and call on the party to elect a new leader.

In early 2011, <a href="Christy%20Clark">Christy Clark</a>, former Deputy Premier, would become leader of the Liberal Party. Though she was not currently a sitting MLA, she would go on to win the seat left vacant by Campbell and form a government. For the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of Campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election. Among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage, created the new holiday of Family Day and pushed the development of BC's <a href="liquified%20natural%20gas">liquified natural gas</a>. In the 2013 election, the Liberals lagged behind the NDP with a double-digit gap in the polls, but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority, making Clark the first elected female premier in BC history. While Clark lost her seat to NDP candidate <a href="David%20Eby">David Eby</a>, she later won a by-election in the riding of <a href="Westside-Kelowna">Westside-Kelowna</a>. Her government would go on to balance the budget, implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed <a href="Enbridge%20Northern%20Gateway%20Pipelines">Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines</a>.

Then, in the 2017 election, the NDP would form a minority government with the support from the Green Party, with just a slight edge over the Liberal Party, 44-43 in the legislature. Then, on July 18, the leader of the BC NDP, John Horgan, would officially be sworn in as premier of British Columbia, with BC Green Party leader Andrew Weaver by his side.

British Columbia has also been significantly affected by demographic changes within Canada and around the world. Vancouver (and to a lesser extent some other parts of British Columbia) was a major destination for many of the immigrants from <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> who left the former UK colony (either temporarily or permanently) in the years immediately prior to its <a href="Transfer%20of%20sovereignty%20of%20Hong%20Kong">handover</a> to the <a href="China">People's Republic of China</a>. British Columbia has also been a significant destination for internal Canadian migrants. This has been the case throughout recent decades, because of its image of natural beauty, mild climate and relaxed lifestyle, but is particularly true during periods of economic growth. As a result, British Columbia has moved from approximately 10% of Canada's population in 1971 to approximately 13% in 2006. Trends of urbanization mean that the <a href="Greater%20Vancouver">Greater Vancouver</a> area now includes 51% of the Province's population, followed in second place by <a href="Greater%20Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Greater Victoria</a> with 8%. These two metropolitan regions have traditionally dominated the demographics of BC.

The net number of people coming to BC from other <a href="province">province</a>s has grown almost four times larger since 2012. BC was the largest net recipient of interprovincial migrants in Canada in the first quarter of 2016 with half of the 5,000 people coming from <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>.

The largest denominations by number of adherents according to the <a href="Canada%202001%20Census">2001 census</a> were none (atheist, agnostic, and so on.) with 1,388,300 (35.9%); <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> with 1,213,295 (31.4%); the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> with 675,320 (17%); the <a href="United%20Church%20of%20Canada">United Church of Canada</a> with 361,840 (9%); and the <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Canada">Anglican Church of Canada</a> with 298,375 (8%).

The following statistics represent both single (for example, "German") and multiple (for example, "Chinese-Canadian") responses to the 2006 Census, and thus do not add up to 100%. All items are self-identified.

Though just 1.8% refer to their origins as being "British", a majority (57.3%) of the population of British Columbia claim their ethnic origin as being from one of the three main British nations (England, Scotland or Wales). Migration was primarily from <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a> and <a href="Northern%20England">Northern England</a>, especially <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a> – out of the 54 of Metro Vancouver's 100 most common names that are British in origin, 29 are of Scottish or Northern English origin, 9 are Welsh, and only four are native to England's south. Another 15.2% refer to their ethnicity as "Irish", though not distinguishing between <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>.

Of the provinces, British Columbia had the highest proportion of <a href="visible%20minority">visible minorities</a>, representing 24.8% of its population. <a href="Asian%20people">Asians</a> at 20.2% of the total population, are by far the largest visible minority demographic, with many of the Lower Mainland's large cities having sizeable Chinese, <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>n, Japanese, <a href="Philippines">Filipino</a>, and Korean communities.

Also present in large numbers relative to other regions of Canada (except <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>), and ever since the province was first settled (unlike Toronto), are many European ethnicities of the first and second generation, notably <a href="Canadians%20of%20German%20ethnicity">Germans</a>, <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>ns, <a href="Demographics%20of%20SFR%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavs</a>, <a href="Italian%20Canadians">Italians</a> and <a href="Spanish%20Canadians">Spaniards</a>. Third-generation Europeans are generally of mixed lineage, and traditionally intermarried with other European-derived ethnic groups more than in any other Canadian province. First-generation <a href="British%20people">Britons</a> remain a strong component of local society despite limitations on <a href="immigration">immigration</a> from Britain since the ending of special status for British subjects in the 1960s.

Of the 4,113,847 population counted by the 2006 census, 4,074,385 people completed the section about language. Of these 4,022,045 gave singular responses to the question regarding <a href="First%20language">mother tongue</a>. The languages most commonly reported were the following:

Numerous other languages were also counted, but only languages with more than 2,000 native speakers are shown.Figures shown are for the number of single language responses and the percentage of total single-language responses.

Half of all British Columbians live in the Metro Vancouver area, which includes Vancouver, <a href="Surrey%2C%20British%20Columbia">Surrey</a>, <a href="New%20Westminster">New Westminster</a>, <a href="West%20Vancouver">West Vancouver</a>, <a href="North%20Vancouver%20%28city%29">North Vancouver (city)</a>, <a href="North%20Vancouver%20%28district%20municipality%29">North Vancouver (district municipality)</a>, <a href="Burnaby">Burnaby</a>, <a href="Coquitlam">Coquitlam</a>, <a href="Port%20Coquitlam">Port Coquitlam</a>, <a href="Maple%20Ridge%2C%20British%20Columbia">Maple Ridge</a>, <a href="Langley%2C%20British%20Columbia%20%28city%29">Langley (city)</a>, <a href="Langley%2C%20British%20Columbia%20%28district%20municipality%29">Langley (district municipality)</a>, <a href="Delta%2C%20British%20Columbia">Delta</a>, <a href="Pitt%20Meadows">Pitt Meadows</a>, <a href="White%20Rock%2C%20British%20Columbia">White Rock</a>, <a href="Richmond%2C%20British%20Columbia">Richmond</a>, <a href="Port%20Moody">Port Moody</a>, <a href="Anmore">Anmore</a>, <a href="Belcarra">Belcarra</a>, <a href="Lions%20Bay%2C%20British%20Columbia">Lions Bay</a> and <a href="Bowen%20Island">Bowen Island</a>, with adjacent unincorporated areas (including the <a href="University%20Endowment%20Lands">University Endowment Lands</a>) represented in the regional district as the <a href="List%20of%20regional%20district%20electoral%20areas%20in%20British%20Columbia">electoral area</a> known as <a href="Greater%20Vancouver%20Electoral%20Area%20A%2C%20British%20Columbia">Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A</a>. <a href="List%20of%20First%20Nations%20governments%20in%20British%20Columbia">Seventeen Indian reserves</a> are located in the metropolitan area but are outside the jurisdiction of the regional district and not represented in its government.

The second largest concentration of British Columbia population is located at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, which is made up of the 13 municipalities of Greater Victoria, <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria</a>, <a href="Saanich%2C%20British%20Columbia">Saanich</a>, <a href="Esquimalt%2C%20British%20Columbia">Esquimalt</a>, <a href="Oak%20Bay%2C%20British%20Columbia">Oak Bay</a>, <a href="View%20Royal%2C%20British%20Columbia">View Royal</a>, <a href="Highlands%2C%20British%20Columbia">Highlands</a>, <a href="Colwood%2C%20British%20Columbia">Colwood</a>, <a href="Langford%2C%20British%20Columbia">Langford</a>, <a href="Central%20Saanich%2C%20British%20Columbia">Central Saanich</a>/<a href="Saanichton%2C%20British%20Columbia">Saanichton</a>, <a href="North%20Saanich%2C%20British%20Columbia">North Saanich</a>, <a href="Sidney%2C%20British%20Columbia">Sidney</a>, <a href="Metchosin%2C%20British%20Columbia">Metchosin</a>, <a href="Sooke%2C%20British%20Columbia">Sooke</a>, which are part of the <a href="Capital%20Regional%20District">Capital Regional District</a>. The metropolitan area also includes several <a href="Indian%20reserve">Indian reserve</a>s (the governments of which are not part of the regional district). Almost half of the Vancouver Island population is located in Greater Victoria.

British Columbia has a history of being a resource dominated economy, centred on the forestry industry but also with fluctuating importance in mining. Employment in the resource sector has fallen steadily as a percentage of employment, and new jobs are mostly in the construction and retail/service sectors. It now has the highest percentage of service industry jobs in the west, comprising 72% of industry (compared to 60% Western Canadian average). The largest section of this employment is in finance, insurance, real estate and corporate management. Many areas outside of metropolitan areas, however, are still heavily reliant on resource extraction. With its film industry known as <a href="Hollywood%20North">Hollywood North</a>, the Vancouver region is the third-largest feature film production location in North America, after <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

The economic history of British Columbia is replete with tales of <a href="Business%20cycle">dramatic upswings and downswings</a>, and this <a href="boom%20and%20bust">boom and bust</a> pattern has influenced the politics, culture and business climate of the province. Economic activity related to mining in particular has widely fluctuated with changes in commodity prices over time, with documented costs to community health.

British Columbia's GDP is the fourth largest in Canada at C$219.99 billion in 2012. GDP per capita was $45,430. British Columbia's <a href="debt-to-GDP%20ratio">debt-to-GDP ratio</a> is projected to reach 15.7% in <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> 2019–2020.

The Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, <a href="Judith%20Guichon">Judith Guichon</a>, is the Queen of Canada's representative in the Province of British Columbia. During the absence of the <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor">Lieutenant-Governor</a>, the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Canada">Governor General in Council</a> may appoint an administrator to execute the duties of the office. In practice, this is usually the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Court%20of%20Appeal">Chief Justice of British Columbia</a>.

British Columbia has an 87-member elected Legislative Assembly, elected by the <a href="plurality%20voting%20system">plurality voting system</a>, though in recent years there has been significant debate about switching to a <a href="BC-STV">single transferable vote</a> system. The government of the day appoints ministers for various portfolios, what are officially part of the <a href="Executive%20Council%20of%20British%20Columbia">Executive Council of British Columbia (cabinet)</a>, of whom the premier is chair.

The province is currently governed by the <a href="British%20Columbia%20New%20Democratic%20Party">British Columbia New Democratic Party</a> (BC NDP) under Premier-designate <a href="John%20Horgan%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">John Horgan</a>. The 2017 provincial election saw the Liberal Party take 43 seats, the NDP take 41, and the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Green%20Party">British Columbia Green Party</a> take 3. No party met the minimum of 44 seats for a majority, therefore leading to the first minority government since 1953. Following the election, the Greens entered into negotiations with both the Liberals and NDP, eventually announcing that they would support the current NDP minority. Previously, the right-of-centre <a href="British%20Columbia%20Liberal%20Party">British Columbia Liberal Party</a> governed the province for sixteen years between 2001 and 2017, and won the largest landslide election in British Columbia history in 2001, with 77 of 79 seats. The legislature became more evenly divided, however, between the Liberals and NDP following the 2005 (46 Liberal seats of 79) and 2009 (49 Liberal seats of 85) provincial elections. The NDP and its predecessor the <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">CCF</a> have been the main opposition force to right-wing parties since the 1930s and have ruled with majority governments in 1972–1975 and 1991–2001. The Green Party plays a larger role in the politics of British Columbia than Green parties do in most other jurisdictions in Canada. After a breakthrough election in 2001 (12.39%), the party's vote share declined (2005 – 9.17%, 2009 – 8.09%, 2013 - 8.13%) before increasing again to a record high of 16.84% at the 2017 election. 

The British Columbia Liberal Party is not related to the federal Liberal Party and does not share the same ideology. Instead, the BC Liberal party is a rather diverse coalition, made up of the remnants of the Social Credit Party, many <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">federal Liberals</a>, federal Conservatives, and those who would otherwise support right-of-centre or free enterprise parties. Historically, there have commonly been <a href="third%20party%20%28politics%29">third parties</a> present in the legislature (including the Liberals themselves from 1952 to 1975); the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20British%20Columbia">BC Green Party</a> are the current third party in British Columbia, with three seats in the legislature.

Prior to the rise of the Liberal Party, British Columbia's main political party was the British Columbia Social Credit Party which ruled British Columbia for 20 continuous years. While sharing some ideology with the current Liberal government, they were more right-wing although undertook nationalization of various important monopolies, notably BC Hydro and BC Ferries.
British Columbia is known for having politically active labour <a href="trade%20union">unions</a> who have traditionally supported the NDP or its predecessor, the CCF.

British Columbia's political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters, beginning with various colonial-era land scandals and abuses of power by early officials (such as those that led to <a href="McGowan%27s%20War">McGowan's War</a> in 1858–59). Notable scandals in Social Credit years included the <a href="Robert%20Bonner%20%28politician%29">Robert Bonner</a> Affair and the <a href="Fantasy%20Gardens">Fantasy Gardens</a> scandal which forced Premier Bill Vander Zalm to resign and ended the Social Credit era. NDP scandals included Bingogate, which brought down NDP Premier Mike Harcourt, and the alleged scandal named Casinogate which drove NDP Premier Glen Clark to resign. A variety of scandals plagued the 2001-2017 Liberal government, including Premier Gordon Campbell's arrest for drunk driving in Maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflict-of-interest allegations. A Christmas Eve <a href="BC%20Legislature%20Raids">raid on the Parliament Buildings</a> in Victoria, including the Premier's Office, has resulted in charges only for ministerial aides, although key cabinet members from the time have since resigned. The case, currently in preliminary hearings in the courts and relating to the sale of BC Rail to CN Rail, may not reach trial because of the mass of evidence and various procedural problems. Campbell eventually resigned in late 2010 due to opposition to his government's plan to introduce a <a href="Harmonized%20Sales%20Tax">Harmonized Sales Tax</a> (HST) and was replaced by <a href="Christy%20Clark">Christy Clark</a> as Premier in a 2011 BC Liberal leadership election.

British Columbia is underrepresented in the <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Senate of Canada</a>, leading Premier Christy Clark to refuse to cooperate with the federal government's new reforms for senate appointments to be made based on the recommendations of a new advisory board that would use non-partisan criteria. Hours after that plan was unveiled in Ottawa on December 3, 2015, Clark issued a statement that it did "not address what’s been wrong with the Senate since the beginning".

The imbalance in representation in that House is apparent when considering population size. The six senators from BC constitute only one for every 775,000 people vs. one for every 75,000 in P.E.I. which has four senators. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have much smaller populations than BC, yet each has ten Senators according to a Global News summary. Correcting this imbalance would require a constitutional amendment, but that is unlikely to be supported by the Atlantic Provinces.
The government of British Columbia has designated several <a href="Symbols%20of%20British%20Columbia">official symbols</a>:

The flag of British Columbia is not protected and is in the public domain. However, the coat of arms of British Columbia is protected by law; no one may "without the permission of the minister, assume, display or use the Coat of Arms of British Columbia or a design so closely resembling it as to be likely to deceive."

British Columbia was the second Canadian jurisdiction (after <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>) to legalize <a href="same-sex%20marriage%20in%20Canada">same-sex marriage</a>.

<a href="Affordable%20housing%20in%20Canada">Housing affordability</a> is of concern to British Columbians.

In April 2016 the government of British Columbia declared a public health emergency due to overdoses on the illicit opioid <a href="Fentanyl">Fentanyl</a>. As of November 2016, there had been 755 cases of Fentanyl overdose.

Transportation played a huge role in British Columbia's history. The Rocky Mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1885. The Peace River Canyon through the Rocky Mountains was the route that the earliest explorers and fur traders used. Fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to British Columbia through the mountains. Travel from the rest of Canada before 1885 meant the difficulty of overland travel via the United States, around <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> or overseas from Asia. Nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the Pacific Ocean, primarily through the ports of Victoria and New Westminster.

Until the 1930s, rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of Canada; travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the United States. With the construction of the Inter-Provincial Highway in 1932 (now known as the <a href="Crowsnest%20Highway">Crowsnest Pass Highway</a>), and later the <a href="Trans-Canada%20Highway">Trans-Canada Highway</a>, road transportation evolved into the preferred mode of overland travel to and from the rest of the country.

Because of its size and rugged, varying topography, British Columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities. British Columbia's roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated programme of improvement was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s. There are now <a href="controlled-access%20highway">freeways</a> in Greater Victoria, the Lower Mainland, and Central Interior of the province. Much of the rest of the province, where traffic volumes are generally low, is accessible by well-maintained generally high-mobility two-lane <a href="arterial%20road">arterial highways</a> with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stop-controlled intersections outside the main urban areas.
A couple of busy intercity corridors outside Greater Vancouver feature more heavily signalized limited-mobility arterial highways that are mostly four-lane and often divided by portable median <a href="traffic%20barrier">traffic barrier</a>s. <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%201">Highway 1</a> on <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a> and Highway 97 through the <a href="Okanagan%20Valley">Okanagan Valley</a> are medium- to high-volume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from 50 km/h to maximums just slightly lower than the principal <a href="grade-separated">grade-separated</a> highways. Numerous <a href="traffic%20light">traffic light</a>s operate in place of <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">interchanges</a> on both arterials as long-term cost-cutting measures. Signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along inter-urban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways, but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of high-mobility alternative routes or bypasses. The building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Ministry%20of%20Transportation">British Columbia Ministry of Transportation</a> and Infrastructure.

There are only five major routes to the rest of Canada. From south to north they are: <a href="British%20Columbia%20provincial%20highway%203">BC Highway 3</a> through the <a href="Crowsnest%20Pass">Crowsnest Pass</a>, the <a href="Vermilion%20Pass">Vermilion Pass</a> (Highway 93 in both <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%2093">British Columbia</a> and <a href="Alberta%20Highway%2093">Alberta</a>), the <a href="Kicking%20Horse%20Pass">Kicking Horse Pass</a>, the latter being used by the Trans-Canada Highway entering Alberta through <a href="Banff%20National%20Park">Banff National Park</a>, the <a href="Yellowhead%20Highway">Yellowhead Highway</a> (16) through <a href="Jasper%20National%20Park">Jasper National Park</a>, and <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%202">Highway 2</a> through <a href="Dawson%20Creek">Dawson Creek</a>. There are also several highway crossings to the adjoining American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The longest highway is Highway 97, running from the British Columbia-Washington border at <a href="Osoyoos%2C%20British%20Columbia">Osoyoos</a> north to <a href="Watson%20Lake%2C%20Yukon">Watson Lake, Yukon</a> and which includes the British Columbia portion of the <a href="Alaska%20Highway">Alaska Highway</a>.

Prior to 1979, surface <a href="public%20transport">public transit</a> was administered by BC Hydro, the provincially owned electricity utility. Subsequently, the province established <a href="BC%20Transit">BC Transit</a> to oversee and operate all municipal transportation systems. In 1998, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority (<a href="TransLink%20%28British%20Columbia%29">TransLink</a>) (now South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority), a separate authority for routes within the Greater Vancouver Regional District was established.

Public transit in British Columbia consists mainly of diesel buses, although Vancouver is also serviced by a fleet of <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a>es. Several experimental buses are being tested such as <a href="hybrid%20electric%20vehicle">hybrid</a> buses that have both gasoline and electric engines. Additionally, there are CNG-fueled buses being tested and used in Nanaimo and Kamloops systems. British Columbia also tested a fleet of Hydrogen-fueled buses for the Vancouver-Whistler Winter Olympics in 2010. TransLink operates <a href="SkyTrain%20%28Vancouver%29">SkyTrain</a>, an automated <a href="rapid%20transit">metro</a> system serving the cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, North Surrey and Richmond. In 2009, the Canada Line SkyTrain was completed, linking Vancouver International Airport and the city of Richmond to downtown Vancouver bringing the total to three operating metro lines.

A new line to Coquitlam and <a href="Port%20Moody">Port Moody</a> (the <a href="Evergreen%20Line%20%28TransLink%29">Evergreen Line</a>) was completed in December 2016. There is planning for an extension of the Millennium Line through Vancouver City to the <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a>. Turnstiles have been added to all existing stations in the system. In the past, SkyTrain used a proof of payment honour system. In the capital city of Victoria BC Transit and the provincial government's infrastructure ministry are working together to create a bus rapid transit from the Westshore communities to downtown Victoria. In <a href="Kamloops">Kamloops</a> there is a rapid transit/ bus GPS trail underway to see how bus rapid transit effects smaller cities, rather than larger (Victoria and Vancouver).

Rail development expanded greatly in the decades after the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> was completed, in 1885, and was the chief mode of long-distance surface transportation until the expansion and improvement of the provincial highways system began in the 1950s. Two major routes through the <a href="Yellowhead%20Pass">Yellowhead Pass</a> competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway—the <a href="Grand%20Trunk%20Pacific">Grand Trunk Pacific</a>, terminating at <a href="Prince%20Rupert">Prince Rupert</a>, and the <a href="Canadian%20Northern%20Railway">Canadian Northern Railway</a>, terminating at Vancouver.

The <a href="Pacific%20Great%20Eastern">Pacific Great Eastern</a> line supplemented this service, providing a north–south route between interior resource communities and the coast. The Pacific Great Eastern (later known as British Columbia Railway and now owned by Canadian National Railway) connects Fort St James, Fort Nelson, and <a href="Tumbler%20Ridge%2C%20British%20Columbia">Tumbler Ridge</a> with <a href="North%20Vancouver%20%28city%29">North Vancouver</a>. The E&N Railway, rebranded as <a href="Southern%20Railway%20of%20Vancouver%20Island">Southern Railway of Vancouver Island</a>, serves the commercial and passenger train markets of Vancouver Island by owning the physical rail lines.

<a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> runs international passenger service between Vancouver and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>.

The <a href="White%20Pass%20and%20Yukon%20Route">White Pass and Yukon Route</a> runs between <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a>, via British Columbia.

<a href="BC%20Ferries">BC Ferries</a> was established as a provincial crown corporation in 1960 to provide passenger and vehicle ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland as a cheaper and more reliable alternative to the service operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway. It now operates 25 routes among the <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20British%20Columbia">islands of British Columbia</a>, as well as between the islands and the mainland. Ferry service to Washington is offered by the <a href="Washington%20State%20Ferries">Washington State Ferries</a> (between <a href="Sidney%2C%20British%20Columbia">Sidney</a> and <a href="Anacortes%2C%20Washington">Anacortes</a>) and <a href="MV%20Coho">Black Ball Transport</a> (between Victoria and <a href="Port%20Angeles%2C%20Washington">Port Angeles, Washington</a>). Ferry service over inland lakes and rivers is provided by the provincial government.

Commercial ocean transport is of vital importance. Major ports are located at Vancouver, <a href="Roberts%20Bank">Roberts Bank</a> (near <a href="Tsawwassen%2C%20British%20Columbia">Tsawwassen</a>), <a href="Prince%20Rupert%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince Rupert</a>, and Victoria.
Of these, the <a href="Port%20of%20Vancouver">Port of Vancouver</a> is the most important, being the largest in Canada and the most diversified in North America.

Vancouver, Victoria, and Prince Rupert are also major ports of call for <a href="cruise%20ship">cruise ship</a>s. In 2007, a large maritime <a href="Containerization">container port</a> was opened in <a href="Prince%20Rupert%20Port%20Authority">Prince Rupert</a> with an inland sorting port located in Prince George.

There are over 200 airports located throughout British Columbia, the major ones being the <a href="Vancouver%20International%20Airport">Vancouver International Airport</a>, the <a href="Victoria%20International%20Airport">Victoria International Airport</a>, the <a href="Kelowna%20International%20Airport">Kelowna International Airport</a>, and the <a href="Abbotsford%20International%20Airport">Abbotsford International Airport</a>, the first three of which each served over 1,000,000 passengers in 2005. , Vancouver International Airport is the <a href="List%20of%20the%20busiest%20airports%20in%20Canada">2nd busiest airport</a> in the country and the second biggest International Gateway on the west coast (after Los Angeles) with an estimated 17.9 million travellers passing through in 2008.

Given its varied mountainous terrain and its coasts, lakes, rivers, and forests, British Columbia has long been enjoyed for pursuits like hiking and camping, rock climbing and mountaineering, <a href="hunting">hunting</a> and <a href="fishing">fishing</a>.

Water sports, both motorized and non-motorized, are enjoyed in many places. <a href="Sea%20kayak">Sea kayak</a>ing opportunities abound on the British Columbia coast with its <a href="fjord">fjord</a>s. <a href="Whitewater">Whitewater</a> <a href="rafting">rafting</a> and <a href="kayak">kayak</a>ing are popular on many inland rivers. <a href="Sailing">Sailing</a> and <a href="Windsurfing">sailboarding</a> are widely enjoyed.

In winter, <a href="Cross-country%20skiing">cross-country</a> and <a href="telemark%20skiing">telemark skiing</a> are much enjoyed, and in recent decades high-quality <a href="Alpine%20skiing">downhill</a> <a href="skiing">skiing</a> has been developed in the Coast Mountain range and the Rockies, as well as in the southern areas of the Shuswap Highlands and the <a href="Columbia%20Mountains">Columbia Mountains</a>. <a href="Snowboarding">Snowboarding</a> has mushroomed in popularity since the early 1990s. The <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a> downhill events were held in <a href="Whistler%20Blackcomb">Whistler Blackcomb</a> area of the province, while the indoor events were conducted in the Vancouver area.

In Vancouver and Victoria (as well as some other cities), opportunities for <a href="jogging">joggers</a> and bicyclists have been developed. Cross-country bike touring has been popular since the <a href="Bicycle%20gearing">ten-speed</a> bike became available many years ago. Since the advent of the more robust <a href="mountain%20bike">mountain bike</a>, trails in more rugged and wild places have been developed for them. A 2016 poll on global biking website <a href="http%3A//www.pinkbike.com">Pinkbike</a> rated BC as the top destination mountain bikers would like to ride. Some of the province's retired rail beds have been converted and maintained for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. <a href="Longboarding">Longboarding</a> is also a popular activity because of the hilly geography of the region.

<a href="Equestrianism">Horseback riding</a> is enjoyed by many British Columbians. Opportunities for <a href="trail%20riding">trail riding</a>, often into especially scenic areas, have been established for tourists in numerous areas of the province.

British Columbia also has strong participation levels in many other sports, including <a href="golf">golf</a>, <a href="tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="Association%20football">soccer</a>, <a href="ice%20hockey">hockey</a>, <a href="Canadian%20football">Canadian football</a>, <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a>, <a href="lacrosse">lacrosse</a>, <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, <a href="softball">softball</a>, <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, <a href="curling">curling</a> and <a href="figure%20skating">figure skating</a>. British Columbia has produced many outstanding athletes, especially in aquatic and <a href="winter%20sport">winter sport</a>s.

Consistent with both increased tourism and increased participation in diverse recreations by British Columbians has been the proliferation of <a href="Luxury%20resort">lodges</a>, <a href="chalet">chalet</a>s, <a href="bed%20and%20breakfast">bed and breakfast</a>s, motels, hotels, fishing camps, and park-camping facilities in recent decades.

In certain areas, there are businesses, non-profit societies, or municipal governments dedicated to promoting <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a> in their region. A number of British Columbia farmers offer visitors to combine tourism with farm work, for example, through the <a href="WWOOF">WWOOF</a> Canada program.

Public universities include:

In September 2014 there were 11,000 international students in BC public K-12 schools and about 3,000 international students in other BC K-12 schools. As of 2006 there were 59 school districts.

Gautama Buddha

Gautama Buddha (c. 563 BCE/480 BCE – c. 483 BCE/400 BCE), also known as Siddhārtha Gautama , Shakyamuni Buddha , or simply the Buddha, after the title of "<a href="Buddha%20%28title%29">Buddha</a>", was an ascetic (<a href="%C5%9Brama%E1%B9%87a">śramaṇa</a>) and <a href="sage%20%28philosophy%29">sage</a>, on whose teachings <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> was founded. He is believed to have lived and taught mostly in the eastern part of <a href="ancient%20India">ancient India</a> sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>.

Gautama taught a <a href="Middle%20Way">Middle Way</a> between sensual indulgence and the severe <a href="asceticism">asceticism</a> found in the <a href="%C5%9Brama%E1%B9%87a">śramaṇa</a> movement common in his region. He later taught throughout other regions of eastern India such as <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a> and <a href="Kosala">Kosala</a>.

Gautama is the primary figure in Buddhism. He is recognized by Buddhists as an <a href="Enlightenment%20in%20Buddhism">enlightened</a> teacher who attained full <a href="Buddhahood">Buddhahood</a>, and shared his insights to help <a href="Sentient%20beings%20%28Buddhism%29">sentient beings</a> end rebirth and <a href="dukkha">suffering</a>. Accounts of his life, discourses, and <a href="Monasticism">monastic</a> rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarized after his death and memorized by his followers. Various collections of teachings attributed to him were passed down by <a href="oral%20tradition">oral tradition</a> and <a href="P%C4%81li%20Canon">first committed to writing</a> about 400 years later.

Scholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life. Most accept that he lived, taught and founded a monastic order during the <a href="Mahajanapada">Mahajanapada</a> era during the reign of <a href="Bimbisara">Bimbisara</a> (, or c. 400 BCE), the ruler of the <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a> empire, and died during the early years of the reign of <a href="Ajatasatru">Ajatasatru</a>, who was the successor of Bimbisara, thus making him a younger contemporary of <a href="Mahavira">Mahavira</a>, the Jain <a href="tirthankara">tirthankara</a>. Apart from the <a href="Vedas">Vedic</a> <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>s, the Buddha's lifetime coincided with the flourishing of influential <a href="%C5%9Arama%E1%B9%87a">Śramaṇa schools</a> of thought like <a href="%C4%80j%C4%ABvika">Ājīvika</a>, <a href="Charvaka">Cārvāka</a>, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, and <a href="Aj%C3%B1ana">Ajñana</a>. <a href="Brahmajala%20Sutta">Brahmajala Sutta</a> records sixty-two such schools of thought. It was also the age of influential thinkers like <a href="Mahavira">Mahavira (referred to as 'Nigantha Nataputta' in Pali Canon)</a>, <a href="Purana%20Kassapa">Pūraṇa Kassapa</a>, <a href="Makkhali%20Gosala">Makkhali Gosāla</a>, <a href="Ajita%20Kesakambali">Ajita Kesakambalī</a>, <a href="Pakudha%20Kaccayana">Pakudha Kaccāyana</a>, and <a href="Sanjaya%20Belatthaputta">Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta</a>, as recorded in <a href="Sama%C3%B1%C3%B1aphala%20Sutta">Samaññaphala Sutta</a>, whose viewpoints the Buddha most certainly must have been acquainted with. Indeed, <a href="Sariputta">Sariputta</a> and <a href="Maudgalyayana">Moggallāna</a>, two of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, were formerly the foremost disciples of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, the skeptic; and the Pali canon frequently depicts Buddha engaging in debate with the adherents of rival schools of thought. There is also philological evidence to suggest that the two masters, <a href="Alara%20Kalama">Alara Kalama</a> and <a href="Uddaka%20Ramaputta">Uddaka Ramaputta</a>, were indeed historical figures and they most probably taught Buddha two different forms of meditative techniques. Thus, Buddha was just one of the many śramaṇa philosophers of that time. In an era where holiness of person was judged by their level of asceticism, Buddha was a reformist within the śramaṇa movement, rather than a reactionary against Vedic Brahminism. While the general sequence of "birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death" is widely accepted, there is less consensus on the veracity of many details contained in traditional biographies.

The times of Gautama's birth and death are uncertain. Most historians in the early 20th century dated his lifetime as circa 563 BCE to 483 BCE. More recently his death is dated later, between 411 and 400 BCE, while at a symposium on this question held in 1988, the majority of those who presented definite opinions gave dates within 20 years either side of 400 BCE for the Buddha's death. These alternative chronologies, however, have not yet been accepted by all historians.

The evidence of the early texts suggests that Siddhārtha Gautama was born into the <a href="Shakya">Shakya</a> clan, a community that was on the periphery, both geographically and culturally, of the eastern Indian subcontinent in the 5th century BCE. It was either a small republic, or an <a href="oligarchy">oligarchy</a>, and his father was an elected chieftain, or oligarch. According to the Buddhist tradition, Gautama was born in <a href="Lumbini">Lumbini</a>, now in modern-day <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, and raised in the Shakya capital of Kapilvastu, which may have been either in what is present day <a href="Tilaurakot">Tilaurakot</a>, Nepal or <a href="Piprahwa">Piprahwa</a>, India. He obtained his enlightenment in <a href="Bodh%20Gaya">Bodh Gaya</a>, gave his first sermon in <a href="Sarnath">Sarnath</a>, and died in <a href="Kushinagar">Kushinagar</a>.

No written records about Gautama were found from his lifetime or some centuries thereafter. One <a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">Edict of Asoka</a>, who reigned from circa 269 BCE to 232 BCE, commemorates the Emperor's pilgrimage to the Buddha's birthplace in <a href="Lumbini">Lumbini</a>. Another one of his edicts mentions the titles of several "<a href="Dharma">Dhamma</a>" texts, establishing the existence of a written Buddhist tradition at least by the time of the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Maurya era</a>. These texts may be the precursor of the <a href="P%C4%81li%20Canon">Pāli Canon</a>. The oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts are the <a href="Gandh%C4%81ran%20Buddhist%20texts">Gandhāran Buddhist texts</a>, reported to have been found in or around <a href="Hadda%2C%20Afghanistan">Haḍḍa</a> near <a href="Jalalabad">Jalalabad</a> in eastern <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and now preserved in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>. They are written in the <a href="G%C4%81ndh%C4%81r%C4%AB%20language">Gāndhārī language</a> using the <a href="Kharosthi">Kharosthi</a> script on twenty-seven <a href="birch%20bark%20manuscript">birch bark manuscript</a>s and date from the first century BCE to the third century CE.

The sources for the life of Siddhārtha Gautama are a variety of different, and sometimes conflicting, traditional biographies. These include the "<a href="Buddhacarita">Buddhacarita</a>", "<a href="Lalitavistara%20S%C5%ABtra">Lalitavistara Sūtra</a>", "<a href="Mah%C4%81vastu">Mahāvastu</a>", and the "Nidānakathā". Of these, the "Buddhacarita" is the earliest full biography, an epic poem written by the poet <a href="A%C5%9Bvagho%E1%B9%A3a">Aśvaghoṣa</a> in the first century CE. The "Lalitavistara Sūtra" is the next oldest biography, a <a href="Mahayana">Mahāyāna</a>/<a href="Sarvastivada">Sarvāstivāda</a> biography dating to the 3rd century CE. The "Mahāvastu" from the <a href="Mah%C4%81s%C4%81%E1%B9%83ghika">Mahāsāṃghika</a> <a href="Lokottarav%C4%81da">Lokottaravāda</a> tradition is another major biography, composed incrementally until perhaps the 4th century CE. The <a href="Dharmaguptaka">Dharmaguptaka</a> biography of the Buddha is the most exhaustive, and is entitled the "Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra", and various Chinese translations of this date between the 3rd and 6th century CE. The "Nidānakathā" is from the <a href="Theravada">Theravada</a> tradition in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> and was composed in the 5th century by <a href="Buddhaghosa">Buddhaghoṣa</a>.

From canonical sources come the <a href="Jataka%20tales">Jataka tales</a>, the "Mahapadana Sutta" (DN 14), and the "Achariyabhuta Sutta" (MN 123), which include selective accounts that may be older, but are not full biographies. The Jātakas retell previous lives of Gautama as a <a href="bodhisattva">bodhisattva</a>, and the first collection of these can be dated among the earliest Buddhist texts. The "Mahāpadāna Sutta" and "Achariyabhuta Sutta" both recount miraculous events surrounding Gautama's birth, such as the bodhisattva's descent from the <a href="Tushita">Tuṣita Heaven</a> into his mother's womb.

In the earliest Buddhist texts, the <a href="nik%C4%81ya">nikāya</a>s and <a href="%C4%80gama%20%28Buddhism%29">āgamas</a>, the Buddha is not depicted as possessing <a href="omniscience">omniscience</a> ("sabbaññu") nor is he depicted as being an eternal transcendent ("lokottara") being. According to <a href="Bhikkhu%20Analayo">Bhikkhu Analayo</a>, ideas of the Buddha's omniscience (along with an increasing tendency to deify him and his biography) are found only later, in the <a href="Mahayana%20sutras">Mahayana sutras</a> and later <a href="Pali">Pali</a> commentaries or texts such as the "Mahāvastu". In the "Sandaka Sutta", the Buddha's disciple Ananda outlines an argument against the claims of teachers who say they are all knowing while in the "Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta" the Buddha himself states that he has never made a claim to being omniscient, instead he claimed to have the "higher knowledges" (<a href="abhij%C3%B1%C4%81">abhijñā</a>). The earliest biographical material from the Pali Nikayas focuses on the Buddha's life as a <a href="%C5%9Brama%E1%B9%87a">śramaṇa</a>, his search for enlightenment under various teachers such as <a href="Alara%20Kalama">Alara Kalama</a> and his forty-five-year career as a teacher.

Traditional biographies of Gautama generally include numerous miracles, omens, and supernatural events. The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. "lokottara") and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the "Mahāvastu", over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supramundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such "in conformity with the world"; omniscience, and the ability to "suppress karma". Nevertheless, some of the more ordinary details of his life have been gathered from these traditional sources. In modern times there has been an attempt to form a <a href="secularity">secular understanding</a> of Siddhārtha Gautama's life by omitting the traditional supernatural elements of his early biographies.

Andrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human:

The ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the <a href="Jain%20Agamas">Jain scriptures</a>, and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in <a href="History%20of%20India">Indian history</a> for which significant accounts exist. British author <a href="Karen%20Armstrong">Karen Armstrong</a> writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddhārtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure. Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of "birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death" must be true.

The Buddhist tradition regards <a href="Lumbini">Lumbini</a>, in present-day <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> to be the birthplace of the Buddha. He grew up in <a href="Kapilavastu%20%28ancient%20city%29">Kapilavastu</a>. The exact site of ancient Kapilavastu is unknown. It may have been either <a href="Piprahwa">Piprahwa</a>, <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, in present-day India, or <a href="Tilaurakot">Tilaurakot</a>, in present-day <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>. Both places belonged to the Sakya territory, and are located only 15 miles apart.

Gautama was born as a <a href="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a>, the son of <a href="%C5%9Auddhodana">Śuddhodana</a>, "an elected chief of the <a href="Shakya">Shakya clan</a>", whose capital was Kapilavastu, and who were later annexed by the growing Kingdom of <a href="Kosala">Kosala</a> during the Buddha's lifetime. Gautama was the <a href="family%20name">family name</a>. His mother, <a href="Maya%20%28mother%20of%20the%20Buddha%29">Maya</a> (Māyādevī), Suddhodana's wife, was a <a href="Koli%20people">Koliyan</a> princess. Legend has it that, on the night Siddhartha was conceived, Queen Maya dreamt that a <a href="white%20elephant%20%28animal%29">white elephant</a> with six white tusks entered her right side, and ten <a href="lunar%20month">months</a> later Siddhartha was born. As was the Shakya tradition, when his mother Queen Maya became pregnant, she left Kapilavastu for her father's kingdom to give birth. However, her son is said to have been born on the way, at Lumbini, in a garden beneath a <a href="Shorea%20robusta">sal tree</a>.

The day of the Buddha's birth is widely celebrated in Theravada countries as <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a>. <a href="Buddha%27s%20Birthday">Buddha's Birthday</a> is called "Buddha <a href="Purnima">Purnima</a>" in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India as he is believed to have been born on a full moon day. Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. The infant was given the name Siddhartha (Pāli: Siddhattha), meaning "he who achieves his aim". During the birth celebrations, the hermit seer <a href="Asita">Asita</a> journeyed from his mountain abode and announced that the child would either become a great king (<a href="chakravartin">chakravartin</a>) or a great <a href="sadhu">sadhu</a>. By traditional account, this occurred after Siddhartha placed his feet in Asita's hair and Asita examined the birthmarks. Suddhodana held a naming ceremony on the fifth day, and invited eight <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> scholars to read the future. All gave a dual prediction that the baby would either become a great king or a great holy man. <a href="Kaundinya">Kondañña</a>, the youngest, and later to be the first <a href="arhat">arhat</a> other than the Buddha, was reputed to be the only one who unequivocally predicted that Siddhartha would become a <a href="Buddhahood">Buddha</a>.

While later tradition and legend characterized Śuddhodana as a <a href="hereditary%20monarchy">hereditary monarch</a>, the <a href="Kinship">descendant</a> of the <a href="Suryavansha">Suryavansha</a> (Solar dynasty) of (Pāli: Okkāka), many scholars think that Śuddhodana was the elected chief of a tribal confederacy.

Early texts suggest that Gautama was not familiar with the dominant religious teachings of his time until he left on his religious quest, which is said to have been motivated by existential concern for the human condition. The state of the Shakya clan was not a monarchy and seems to have been structured either as an <a href="oligarchy">oligarchy</a>, or as a form of republic. The more egalitarian gana-sangha form of government, as a political alternative to the strongly hierarchical kingdoms, may have influenced the development of the śramanic <a href="Jain%20monasticism">Jain</a> and Buddhist <a href="Sangha%20%28Buddhism%29">sanghas</a>, where monarchies tended toward <a href="Historical%20Vedic%20religion">Vedic Brahmanism</a>.

Siddhartha was brought up by his mother's younger sister, <a href="Mahapajapati%20Gotami">Maha Pajapati</a>. By tradition, he is said to have been destined by birth to the life of a prince and had three palaces (for seasonal occupation) built for him. His father, said to be King Śuddhodana, wishing for his son to be a great king, is said to have shielded him from religious teachings and from knowledge of human <a href="dukkha">suffering</a>. While Śuddhodana has traditionally been depicted as a king, and Siddhartha as his prince, more recent scholarship suggests the <a href="Shakya">Shakya</a> were in-fact organized as a semi-republican oligarchy rather than a monarchy. 

When he reached the age of 16, his father reputedly arranged his marriage to a cousin of the same age named <a href="Yashodhara">Yaśodharā</a> (Pāli: Yasodharā). According to the traditional account, she gave birth to a son, named <a href="R%C4%81hula">Rāhula</a>. Siddhartha is said to have spent 29 years as a prince in <a href="Kapilavastu%20%28ancient%20city%29">Kapilavastu</a>. Although his father ensured that Siddhartha was provided with everything he could want or need, Buddhist scriptures say that the future Buddha felt that material wealth was not life's ultimate goal.

At the age of 29, Siddhartha left his palace to meet his subjects. Despite his father's efforts to hide from him the sick, aged and suffering, Siddhartha was said to have seen an old man. When his charioteer <a href="Channa%20%28Buddhist%29">Channa</a> explained to him that all people grew old, the prince went on further trips beyond the palace. On these he encountered a <a href="disease">disease</a>d man, a decaying <a href="Cadaver">corpse</a>, and an <a href="Asceticism">ascetic</a>. These depressed him, and he initially strove to overcome ageing, sickness, and death by living the life of an ascetic.

Accompanied by Channa and riding his horse <a href="Kanthaka">Kanthaka</a>, Gautama quit his palace for the life of a <a href="mendicant">mendicant</a>. It's said that "the horse's hooves were muffled by the gods" to prevent guards from knowing of his departure.

Gautama initially went to <a href="Rajgir">Rajagaha</a> and began his ascetic life by begging for alms in the street. After King Bimbisara's men recognised Siddhartha and the king learned of his quest, Bimbisara offered Siddhartha the throne. Siddhartha rejected the offer but promised to visit his kingdom of <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a> first, upon attaining enlightenment.

He left Rajagaha and practised under two hermit teachers of <a href="yogic">yogic</a> meditation. After mastering the teachings of <a href="Alara%20Kalama">Alara Kalama</a> (Skr. Ārāḍa Kālāma), he was asked by Kalama to succeed him. However, Gautama felt unsatisfied by the practice, and moved on to become a student of <a href="yoga">yoga</a> with <a href="Udaka%20Ramaputta">Udaka Ramaputta</a> (Skr. Udraka Rāmaputra). With him he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness and was again asked to succeed his teacher. But, once more, he was not satisfied, and again moved on.

According to the early Buddhist texts, after realizing that meditative <a href="Dhy%C4%81na%20in%20Buddhism">dhyana</a> was the right path to , but that extreme <a href="asceticism">asceticism</a> didn't work, Gautama discovered what Buddhists know as being, the <a href="Middle%20Way">Middle Way</a>—a path of moderation away from the extremes of <a href="hedonism">self-indulgence</a> and self-mortification, or the <a href="Noble%20Eightfold%20Path">Noble Eightfold Path</a>, as described in the <a href="Dhammacakkappavattana%20Sutta">Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</a>, which is regarded as the first discourse of the Buddha. In a famous incident, after becoming starved and weakened, he is said to have accepted milk and <a href="rice%20pudding">rice pudding</a> from a village girl named Sujata. Such was his emaciated appearance that she wrongly believed him to be a spirit that had granted her a wish.

Following this incident, Gautama was famously seated under a <a href="Sacred%20fig">pipal</a> tree—now known as the <a href="Bodhi%20tree">Bodhi tree</a>—in <a href="Bodh%20Gaya">Bodh Gaya</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, when he vowed never to arise until he had found <a href="Truth">the truth</a>. <a href="Kaundinya">Kaundinya</a> and four other companions, believing that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined, ceased to stay with him, and went to somewhere else. After a reputed 49 days of meditation, at the age of 35, he is said to have attained <a href="Bodhi">Enlightenment</a>, and became known as the "Buddha" or "Awakened One" ("Buddha" is also sometimes translated as "The Enlightened One").

According to some sutras of the Pali canon, at the time of his awakening he realized complete <a href="insight">insight</a> into the <a href="Four%20Noble%20Truths">Four Noble Truths</a>, thereby attaining <a href="Moksha">liberation</a> from "<a href="samsara">samsara</a>", the endless cycle of rebirth, suffering and dying again. According to scholars, this story of the awakening and the stress on "liberating insight" is a later development in the Buddhist tradition, where the Buddha may have regarded the practice of "<a href="Dhy%C4%81na%20in%20Buddhism">dhyana</a>" as leading to <a href="Nirvana">Nirvana</a> and "moksha".

Nirvana is the extinguishing of the "fires" of desire, hatred, and ignorance, that keep the cycle of suffering and rebirth going. Nirvana is also regarded as the "end of the world", in that no personal identity or boundaries of the mind remain. In such a state, a being is said to possess the <a href="Buddhahood%23Ten%20characteristics%20of%20a%20Buddha">Ten Characteristics</a>, belonging to every Buddha.

According to a story in the "Āyācana Sutta" (Samyutta Nikaya VI.1) — a scripture found in the <a href="P%C4%81li">Pāli</a> and other <a href="wiktionary%3Acanon">canons</a> — immediately after his awakening, the Buddha debated whether or not he should teach the "<a href="Dharma%20%28Buddhism%29">Dharma</a>" to others. He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is subtle, deep and hard to grasp. However, in the story, <a href="Brahma%20%28Buddhism%29%23Brahm%C4%81%20Sahampati">Brahmā Sahampati</a> convinced him, arguing that at least some will understand it. The Buddha relented, and agreed to teach.

After his awakening, the Buddha met <a href="Trapusa%20and%20Bahalika">Taphussa and Bhallika</a> — two merchant brothers from the city of <a href="Balkh">Balkh</a> in what is currently Afghanistan — who became his first lay disciples. It is said that each was given hairs from his head, which are now claimed to be enshrined as <a href="%C5%9Aar%C4%ABra">relics</a> in the <a href="Shwe%20Dagon">Shwe Dagon</a> Temple in <a href="Rangoon">Rangoon</a>, <a href="Burma">Burma</a>. The Buddha intended to visit <a href="Asita">Asita</a>, and his former teachers, <a href="Alara%20Kalama">Alara Kalama</a> and <a href="Udaka%20Ramaputta">Udaka Ramaputta</a>, to explain his findings, but they had already died.

He then travelled to the <a href="Sarnath">Deer Park</a> near <a href="Varanasi">Varanasi</a> (Benares) in northern India, where he set in motion what Buddhists call the <a href="Dharmacakra">Wheel of Dharma</a> by delivering his first sermon to the five companions with whom he had sought enlightenment. Together with him, they formed the first <a href="Sangha%20%28Buddhism%29"></a>: the company of Buddhist monks.

All five become <a href="arahants">arahants</a>, and within the first two months, with the conversion of <a href="Yasa">Yasa</a> and fifty-four of his friends, the number of such arahants is said to have grown to 60. The conversion of three brothers named Kassapa followed, with their reputed 200, 300 and 500 disciples, respectively. This swelled the sangha to more than 1,000.

For the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the <a href="Gangetic%20Plain">Gangetic Plain</a>, in what is now <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a>, and southern <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, teaching a diverse range of people: from nobles to servants, murderers such as <a href="Angulimala">Angulimala</a>, and cannibals such as Alavaka. Although the Buddha's language remains unknown, it's likely that he taught in one or more of a variety of closely related Middle Indo-Aryan dialects, of which <a href="Pali">Pali</a> may be a standardization.

The sangha traveled through the subcontinent, expounding the dharma. This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the <a href="Vassa">Vassa</a> rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would come to them.

The first vassana was spent at <a href="Varanasi">Varanasi</a> when the sangha was formed. After this, the Buddha kept a promise to travel to <a href="Rajgir">Rajagaha</a>, capital of <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a>, to visit King <a href="Bimbisara">Bimbisara</a>. During this visit, <a href="Sariputta">Sariputta</a> and <a href="Maudgalyayana">Maudgalyayana</a> were converted by <a href="Assaji">Assaji</a>, one of the first five disciples, after which they were to become the Buddha's two foremost followers. The Buddha spent the next three seasons at Veluvana Bamboo Grove monastery in Rajagaha, the capital of Magadha.

Upon hearing of his son's awakening, Suddhodana sent, over a period, ten delegations to ask him to return to Kapilavastu. On the first nine occasions, the delegates failed to deliver the message and instead joined the sangha to become arahants. The tenth delegation, led by Kaludayi, a childhood friend of Gautama's (who also became an arahant), however, delivered the message.

Now two years after his awakening, the Buddha agreed to return, and made a two-month journey by foot to Kapilavastu, teaching the dharma as he went. At his return, the royal palace prepared a midday meal, but the sangha was making an alms round in Kapilavastu. Hearing this, Suddhodana approached his son, the Buddha, saying:
The Buddha is said to have replied:
Buddhist texts say that Suddhodana invited the sangha into the palace for the meal, followed by a dharma talk. After this he is said to have become a <a href="sotapanna">sotapanna</a>. During the visit, many members of the royal family joined the <a href="Sangha%20%28Buddhism%29">sangha</a>. The Buddha's cousins <a href="Ananda">Ananda</a> and <a href="Anuruddha">Anuruddha</a> became two of his five chief disciples. At the age of seven, his son <a href="Rahula">Rahula</a> also joined, and became one of his ten chief disciples. His half-brother <a href="Nanda%20%28Buddhist%29">Nanda</a> also joined and became an arahant.

Of the Buddha's disciples, Sariputta, <a href="Maudgalyayana">Maudgalyayana</a>, <a href="Mahakasyapa">Mahakasyapa</a>, Ananda and Anuruddha are believed to have been the five closest to him. His ten foremost disciples were reputedly completed by the quintet of <a href="Upali">Upali</a>, <a href="Subhoti">Subhoti</a>, Rahula, <a href="Mahakaccana">Mahakaccana</a> and <a href="Punna">Punna</a>.

In the fifth vassana, the Buddha was staying at Mahavana near <a href="Vesali">Vesali</a> when he heard news of the impending death of his father. He is said to have gone to Suddhodana and taught the dharma, after which his father became an arahant.

The king's death and cremation was to inspire the creation of an order of nuns. Buddhist texts record that the Buddha was reluctant to ordain women. His foster mother <a href="Maha%20Pajapati">Maha Pajapati</a>, for example, approached him, asking to join the sangha, but he refused. Maha Pajapati, however, was so intent on the path of awakening that she led a group of royal Sakyan and Koliyan ladies, which followed the sangha on a long journey to Rajagaha. In time, after Ananda championed their cause, the Buddha is said to have reconsidered and, five years after the formation of the sangha, agreed to the ordination of women as nuns. He reasoned that males and females had an equal capacity for awakening. But he gave women additional rules (<a href="Vinaya">Vinaya</a>) to follow.

According to the "Mahaparinibbana Sutta" of the Pali canon, at the age of 80, the Buddha announced that he would soon reach <a href="Parinirvana">Parinirvana</a>, or the final deathless state, and abandon his earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named <a href="Cunda%20%28Buddhism%29">Cunda</a>. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant <a href="Ananda">Ānanda</a> to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place had nothing to do with his passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha. Mettanando and <a href="Oskar%20von%20Hin%C3%BCber">von Hinüber</a> argue that the Buddha died of <a href="Superior%20mesenteric%20artery%20syndrome">mesenteric</a> <a href="infarction">infarction</a>, a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.

The precise contents of the Buddha's final meal are not clear, due to variant scriptural traditions and ambiguity over the translation of certain significant terms; the <a href="Theravada">Theravada</a> tradition generally believes that the Buddha was offered some kind of pork, while the <a href="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> tradition believes that the Buddha consumed some sort of truffle or other mushroom. These may reflect the different traditional views on <a href="Buddhist%20vegetarianism">Buddhist vegetarianism</a> and the precepts for monks and nuns.

<a href="Arthur%20Waley">Waley</a> suggests that Theravadins would take "suukaramaddava" (the contents of the Buddha's last meal), which can translate literally as "pig-soft", to mean "soft flesh of a pig" or "pig's soft-food", that is, after <a href="Karl%20Eugen%20Neumann">Neumann</a>, a soft food favoured by pigs, assumed to be a <a href="truffle">truffle</a>. He argues (also after Neumann) that as "(p)lant names tend to be local and dialectical", as there are several plants known to have "suukara-" (pig) as part of their names, and as Pali Buddhism developed in an area remote from the Buddha's death, "suukaramaddava" could easily have been a type of plant whose local name was unknown to those in Pali regions. Specifically, local writers writing soon after the Buddha's death knew more about their flora than Theravadin commentator <a href="Buddhaghosa">Buddhaghosa</a> who lived hundreds of years and hundreds of kilometres remote in time and space from the events described. Unaware that it may have been a local plant name and with no Theravadin prohibition against eating animal flesh, Theravadins would not have questioned the Buddha eating meat and interpreted the term accordingly.

According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha died at Kuśināra (present-day <a href="Kushinagar">Kushinagar</a>, India), which became a pilgrimage center. Ananda protested the Buddha's decision to enter Parinirvana in the abandoned jungles of <a href="Kushinagar">Kuśināra</a> of the <a href="Malla%20%28India%29">Malla</a> kingdom. The Buddha, however, is said to have reminded Ananda how Kushinara was a land once ruled by a righteous wheel-turning king and the appropriate place for him to die.

The Buddha then asked all the attendant <a href="Bhikkhu">Bhikkhu</a>s to clarify any doubts or questions they had and cleared them all in a way which others could not do. They had none. According to Buddhist scriptures, he then finally entered Parinirvana. The Buddha's final words are reported to have been: "All composite things (<a href="Sa%E1%B9%85kh%C4%81ra">Saṅkhāra</a>) are perishable. Strive for your own liberation with diligence" (Pali: 'vayadhammā saṅkhārā appamādena sampādethā'). His body was cremated and the <a href="relic">relic</a>s were placed in monuments or stupas, some of which are believed to have survived until the present. For example, the <a href="Temple%20of%20the%20Tooth">Temple of the Tooth</a> or "Dalada Maligawa" in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> is the place where what some believe to be the <a href="Relic%20of%20the%20tooth%20of%20the%20Buddha">relic of the right tooth of Buddha</a> is kept at present.

According to the Pāli historical chronicles of Sri Lanka, the <a href="Dipavamsa"></a> and <a href="Mahavamsa"></a>, the coronation of <a href="Ashoka">Emperor Aśoka</a> (Pāli: Asoka) is 218 years after the death of the Buddha. According to two textual records in Chinese ( and ), the coronation of Emperor Aśoka is 116 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore, the time of Buddha's passing is either 486 BCE according to Theravāda record or 383 BCE according to Mahayana record. However, the actual date traditionally accepted as the date of the Buddha's death in Theravāda countries is 544 or 545 BCE, because the reign of Emperor Aśoka was traditionally reckoned to be about 60 years earlier than current estimates. In Burmese Buddhist tradition, the date of the Buddha's death is 13 May 544 BCE. whereas in Thai tradition it is 11 March 545 BCE.

At his death, the Buddha is famously believed to have told his disciples to follow no leader. <a href="Mahakasyapa">Mahakasyapa</a> was chosen by the sangha to be the chairman of the <a href="First%20Buddhist%20Council">First Buddhist Council</a>, with the two chief disciples <a href="Maudgalyayana">Maudgalyayana</a> and <a href="Sariputta">Sariputta</a> having died before the Buddha.

While in the Buddha's days he was addressed by the very respected titles Buddha, Shākyamuni, Shākyasimha, Bhante and Bho, he was known after his parinirvana nirvana as Arihant, Bhagavā/Bhagavat/Bhagwān, Mahāvira, Jina/Jinendra, Sāstr, Sugata, and most popularly in scriptures as Tathāgata.

After his death, Buddha's cremation relics were divided amongst 8 royal families and his disciples; centuries later they would be enshrined by <a href="King%20Ashoka">King Ashoka</a> into 84,000 stupas. Many supernatural legends surround the history of alleged relics as they accompanied the spread of Buddhism and gave legitimacy to rulers.

An extensive and colorful physical description of the Buddha has been laid down in scriptures. A <a href="kshatriya">kshatriya</a> by birth, he had military training in his upbringing, and by Shakyan tradition was required to pass tests to demonstrate his worthiness as a warrior in order to marry. He had a strong enough body to be noticed by one of the kings and was asked to join his army as a general. He is also believed by Buddhists to have "the 32 Signs of the Great Man".

The Brahmin Sonadanda described him as "handsome, good-looking, and pleasing to the eye, with a most beautiful complexion. He has a godlike form and countenance, he is by no means unattractive." (D, I:115)

"It is wonderful, truly marvellous, how serene is the good Gotama's appearance, how clear and radiant his complexion, just as the golden jujube in autumn is clear and radiant, just as a palm-tree fruit just loosened from the stalk is clear and radiant, just as an adornment of red gold wrought in a crucible by a skilled goldsmith, deftly beaten and laid on a yellow-cloth shines, blazes and glitters, even so, the good Gotama's senses are calmed, his complexion is clear and radiant." (A, I:181)

A disciple named Vakkali, who later became an arahant, was so obsessed by the Buddha's physical presence that the Buddha is said to have felt impelled to tell him to desist, and to have reminded him that he should know the Buddha through the Dhamma and not through physical appearances.

Although there are no extant representations of the Buddha in human form until around the 1st century CE (see <a href="Buddhist%20art">Buddhist art</a>), descriptions of the physical characteristics of fully enlightened buddhas are attributed to the Buddha in the <a href="Digha%20Nikaya">Digha Nikaya</a>'s "" (D, I:142). In addition, the Buddha's physical appearance is described by <a href="Yasodhara">Yasodhara</a> to their son <a href="Rahula">Rahula</a> upon the Buddha's first post-Enlightenment return to his former princely palace in the non-canonical Pali devotional hymn, "Narasīha Gāthā" ("The Lion of Men").

Among the 32 main characteristics it is mentioned that Buddha has <a href="blue%20eyes">blue eyes</a>.

Recollection of nine virtues attributed to the Buddha is a common Buddhist meditation and devotional practice called <a href="Buddh%C4%81nusm%E1%B9%9Bti">Buddhānusmṛti</a>. The nine virtues are also among the <a href="Kamma%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADh%C4%81na">40 Buddhist meditation subjects</a>. The nine virtues of the Buddha appear throughout the <a href="Tripitaka">Tipitaka</a>, and include:

In the Pali Canon, the Buddha uses many <a href="Hinduism">Brahmanical</a> devices. For example, in <a href="Samyutta%20Nikaya">Samyutta Nikaya</a> 111, <a href="Majjhima%20Nikaya">Majjhima Nikaya</a> 92 and Vinaya i 246 of the <a href="Pali%20Canon">Pali Canon</a>, the Buddha praises the <a href="Agnihotra">Agnihotra</a> as the foremost sacrifice and the <a href="Gayatri%20mantra">Gayatri mantra</a> as the foremost meter:
Information of the oldest teachings may be obtained by analysis of the oldest texts. One method to obtain information on the oldest core of Buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the Theravadin <a href="Pali%20Canon">Pali Canon</a> and other texts. The reliability of these sources, and the possibility of drawing out a core of oldest teachings, is a matter of dispute. According to Vetter, inconsistencies remain, and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies.

According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished:

A core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between "dhyana" and insight. Schmithausen notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.

According to Tilmann Vetter, the core of earliest Buddhism is the practice of "<a href="Dhy%C4%81na%20in%20Buddhism">dhyāna</a>", as a workable alternative to painful ascetic practices. Bronkhorst agrees that "Dhyāna" was a Buddhist invention, whereas Norman notes that "the Buddha's way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices." Discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development.

According to the Mahāsaccakasutta, from the fourth "<a href="Dhyana%20in%20Buddhism">jhana</a>" the Buddha gained "<a href="bodhi">bodhi</a>". Yet, it is not clear what he was awakened to. According to Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, "liberating insight" is a later addition to this text, and reflects a later development and understanding in early Buddhism. The mentioning of the four truths as constituting "liberating insight" introduces a logical problem, since the four truths depict a linear path of practice, the knowledge of which is in itself not depicted as being liberating:
Although "<a href="Nibbana">"Nibbāna"</a>" (Sanskrit: "Nirvāna") is the common term for the desired goal of this practice, many other terms can be found throughout the Nikayas, which are not specified.

According to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term "the middle way". In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.

According to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the <a href="Four%20Noble%20Truths">four truths</a> became a substitution for prajna, or "liberating insight", in the suttas in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas. According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of "liberating insight". Gotama's teachings may have been personal, "adjusted to the need of each person."

The "<a href="three%20marks%20of%20existence">three marks of existence</a>" may reflect Upanishadic or other influences. K.R. Norman supposes that these terms were already in use at the Buddha's time, and were familiar to his listeners.

The <a href="Brahmavihara">Brahma-vihara</a> was in origin probably a brahmanic term; but its usage may have been common to the Sramana traditions.

In time, "liberating insight" became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition. The following teachings, which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism, are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this "liberating insight":

Some <a href="Hindus">Hindus</a> regard Gautama as the 9th <a href="avatar">avatar</a> of <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>. However, Buddha's teachings deny the authority of the <a href="Vedas">Vedas</a> and the concepts of <a href="Brahman">Brahman</a>-<a href="%C4%80tman%20%28Hinduism%29">Atman</a>. Consequently Buddhism is generally classified as a "<a href="Nastika">nāstika</a>" school (heterodox, literally "It is not so") in contrast to the six orthodox schools of Hinduism.

The Buddha is regarded as a <a href="prophet">prophet</a> by the minority <a href="Ahmadiyya">Ahmadiyya</a> sect of Muslims – a sect considered a deviant and rejected as <a href="apostate">apostate</a> by mainstream Islam. Some early Chinese Taoist-Buddhists thought the Buddha to be a reincarnation of <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a>.

Disciples of the <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a> religion worship the Buddha as a major religious teacher. His image can be found in both their Holy See and on the home altar. He is revealed during communication with Divine Beings as son of their Supreme Being (God the Father) together with other major religious teachers and founders like <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>, <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a>, and <a href="Confucius">Confucius</a>.

The Christian <a href="Barlaam%20and%20Josaphat">Saint Josaphat</a> is based on the Buddha. The name comes from the Sanskrit "<a href="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a>" via Arabic "Būdhasaf" and Georgian "Iodasaph". The only story in which St. Josaphat appears, "Barlaam and Josaphat", is based on the life of the Buddha. Josaphat was included in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology (feast day 27 November) — though not in the Roman Missal — and in the Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar (26 August).

In the ancient <a href="Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> sect of <a href="Manichaeism">Manichaeism</a>, the Buddha is listed among the prophets who preached the word of God before <a href="Mani%20%28prophet%29">Mani</a>.

Bridge

A bridge is a <a href="nonbuilding%20structure">structure</a> built to <a href="span%20%28engineering%29">span</a> physical obstacles without closing the way underneath such as a <a href="body%20of%20water">body of water</a>, <a href="valley">valley</a>, or <a href="road">road</a>, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the <a href="terrain">terrain</a> where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.

The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" traces the origin of the word "bridge" to an <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word "brycg", of the same meaning. The word can be traced directly back to Proto-Indo-European "*bʰrēw-." The word for the <a href="Contract%20bridge">card game of the same name</a> has a different origin.

The first bridges made by humans were probably spans of cut wooden logs or planks and eventually stones, using a simple support and <a href="crossbeam">crossbeam</a> arrangement. A common form of lashing sticks, logs, and <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> branches together involved the use of long reeds or other harvested fibers woven together to form a huge rope capable of binding and holding together the materials used in early bridges.

The <a href="Arkadiko%20Bridge">Arkadiko Bridge</a> is one of four Mycenaean <a href="corbel%20arch">corbel arch</a> bridges part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate <a href="chariot">chariot</a>s, between the fort of Tiryns and town of Epidauros in the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>, in southern Greece. Dating to the Greek <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> (13th century BC), it is one of the oldest <a href="arch%20bridge">arch bridge</a>s still in existence and use.
Several intact arched stone bridges from the <a href="Hellenistic%20age">Hellenistic era</a> can be found in the Peloponnese.

The greatest bridge builders of antiquity were the <a href="Roman%20Engineering">ancient Romans</a>. The Romans built arch bridges and <a href="aqueduct%20%28bridge%29">aqueducts</a> that could stand in conditions that would damage or destroy earlier designs. Some stand today. An example is the <a href="Alc%C3%A1ntara%20Bridge">Alcántara Bridge</a>, built over the river <a href="Tagus">Tagus</a>, in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. The Romans also used <a href="cement">cement</a>, which reduced the variation of strength found in natural stone. One type of cement, called <a href="pozzolana">pozzolana</a>, consisted of water, <a href="lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>, sand, and <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic rock</a>. <a href="Brick">Brick</a> and <a href="Mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a> bridges were built after the Roman era, as the technology for cement was lost (then later rediscovered).

In India, the "<a href="Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a>" treatise by <a href="Kautilya">Kautilya</a> mentions the construction of dams and bridges. A <a href="Mauryan">Mauryan</a> bridge near <a href="Girnar">Girnar</a> was surveyed by <a href="James%20Prinsep">James Princep</a>. The bridge was swept away during a flood, and later repaired by Puspagupta, the chief architect of emperor <a href="Chandragupta%20I">Chandragupta I</a>. The use of stronger bridges using plaited bamboo and iron chain was visible in India by about the 4th century. A number of bridges, both for military and commercial purposes, were constructed by the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> administration in India.

Although large Chinese bridges of wooden construction existed at the time of the <a href="Warring%20States">Warring States</a>, the oldest surviving stone bridge in China is the <a href="Zhaozhou%20Bridge">Zhaozhou Bridge</a>, built from 595 to 605 AD during the <a href="Sui%20Dynasty">Sui Dynasty</a>. This bridge is also historically significant as it is the world's oldest <a href="Spandrel">open-spandrel</a> stone segmental arch bridge. European segmental arch bridges date back to at least the <a href="Alcon%C3%A9tar%20Bridge">Alconétar Bridge</a> (approximately 2nd century AD), while the enormous Roman era <a href="Trajan%27s%20Bridge">Trajan's Bridge</a> (105 AD) featured open-spandrel segmental arches in wooden construction.

<a href="Inca%20rope%20bridge">Rope bridges</a>, a simple type of <a href="suspension%20bridge">suspension bridge</a>, were used by the <a href="Inca">Inca</a> civilization in the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> mountains of South America, just prior to European colonization in the 16th century.

During the 18th century there were many innovations in the design of timber bridges by <a href="Hans%20Ulrich%20Grubenmann">Hans Ulrich Grubenmann</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Grubenmann">Johannes Grubenmann</a>, and others. The first book on bridge engineering was written by <a href="Hubert%20Gautier">Hubert Gautier</a> in 1716.

A major breakthrough in bridge technology came with the erection of <a href="the%20Iron%20Bridge">the Iron Bridge</a> in Shropshire, England in 1779. It used <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> for the first time as arches to cross the river Severn.

With the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in the 19th century, <a href="truss">truss</a> systems of <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> were developed for larger bridges, but iron does not have the <a href="tensile%20strength">tensile strength</a> to support large loads. With the advent of steel, which has a high tensile strength, much larger bridges were built, many using the ideas of <a href="Gustave%20Eiffel">Gustave Eiffel</a>.

In 1927 <a href="welding">welding</a> pioneer <a href="Stefan%20Bry%C5%82a">Stefan Bryła</a> designed the first welded road bridge in the world, the <a href="Maurzyce%20Bridge">Maurzyce Bridge</a> which was later built across the river <a href="S%C5%82udwia%20River">Słudwia</a> at Maurzyce near <a href="%C5%81owicz">Łowicz</a>, Poland in 1929. In 1995, the <a href="American%20Welding%20Society">American Welding Society</a> presented the Historic Welded Structure Award for the bridge to Poland.

Bridges can be categorized in several different ways. Common categories include the type of structural elements used, by what they carry, whether they are fixed or movable, and by the materials used.

Bridges may be classified by how the forces of <a href="tension%20%28mechanics%29">tension</a>, <a href="compression%20%28physical%29">compression</a>, <a href="bending">bending</a>, <a href="torsion%20%28mechanics%29">torsion</a> and <a href="Shear%20stress">shear</a> are distributed through their structure. Most bridges will employ all of the principal forces to some degree, but only a few will predominate. The separation of forces may be quite clear. In a suspension or cable-stayed span, the elements in tension are distinct in shape and placement. In other cases the forces may be distributed among a large number of members, as in a truss.

Most bridges are fixed bridges, meaning they have no moving parts and stay in one place until they fail or are demolished. Temporary bridges, such as <a href="Bailey%20bridge">Bailey bridge</a>s, are designed to be assembled, and taken apart, transported to a different site, and re-used. They are important in military engineering, and are also used to carry traffic while an old bridge is being rebuilt. <a href="Movable%20bridge">Movable bridge</a>s are designed to move out of the way of boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit. These are generally electrically powered.

Double-decked (or double-decker) bridges have two levels, such as the <a href="George%20Washington%20Bridge">George Washington Bridge</a>, connecting <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to <a href="Bergen%20County">Bergen County</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, USA, as the world's busiest bridge, carrying 102 million vehicles annually; <a href="truss">truss</a> work between the roadway levels provided stiffness to the roadways and reduced movement of the upper level when the lower level was installed three decades after the upper level. The <a href="Tsing%20Ma%20Bridge">Tsing Ma Bridge</a> and <a href="Kap%20Shui%20Mun%20Bridge">Kap Shui Mun Bridge</a> in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> have six lanes on their upper decks, and on their lower decks there are two lanes and a pair of tracks for <a href="MTR">MTR</a> metro trains. Some double-decked bridges only use one level for street traffic; the <a href="Washington%20Avenue%20Bridge%20%28Minneapolis%29">Washington Avenue Bridge</a> in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> reserves its lower level for automobile and light rail traffic and its upper level for pedestrian and bicycle traffic (predominantly students at the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>). Likewise, in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, the <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Viaduct">Prince Edward Viaduct</a> has five lanes of motor traffic, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks on its upper deck; and a pair of tracks for the <a href="Bloor%E2%80%93Danforth%20line">Bloor–Danforth</a> <a href="Toronto%20subway%20and%20RT">subway line</a> on its lower deck. The western span of the <a href="San%20Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland%20Bay%20Bridge">San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge</a> also has two levels.

<a href="Robert%20Stephenson">Robert Stephenson</a>'s <a href="High%20Level%20Bridge">High Level Bridge</a> across the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a> in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, completed in 1849, is an early example of a double-decked bridge. The upper level carries a railway, and the lower level is used for road traffic. Other examples include <a href="Britannia%20Bridge">Britannia Bridge</a> over the <a href="Menai%20Strait">Menai Strait</a> and <a href="Craigavon%20Bridge">Craigavon Bridge</a> in <a href="Derry">Derry</a>, <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. The <a href="%C3%98resund%20Bridge">Oresund Bridge</a> between <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a> consists of a four-lane highway on the upper level and a pair of railway tracks at the lower level. <a href="Tower%20Bridge">Tower Bridge</a> in London is different example of a double-decked bridge, with the central section consisting of a low level <a href="Bascule%20bridge">bascule span</a> and a high level <a href="footbridge">footbridge</a>.

A viaduct is made up of multiple bridges connected into one longer structure. The longest and some of the highest bridges are viaducts, such as the <a href="Lake%20Pontchartrain%20Causeway">Lake Pontchartrain Causeway</a> and <a href="Millau%20Viaduct">Millau Viaduct</a>.

A three-way bridge has three separate spans which meet near the center of the bridge. The bridge appears as a "T" or "Y" when viewed from above. Three-way bridges are extremely rare. <a href="The%20Tridge%20%28Midland%2C%20Michigan%29">The Tridge</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Bridge">Margaret Bridge</a>, and <a href="Y-Bridge%20%28Zanesville%2C%20Ohio%29">Zanesville Y-Bridge</a> are examples.

A bridge can be categorized by what it is designed to carry, such as trains, pedestrian or road traffic, a pipeline or waterway for water transport or barge traffic. An <a href="aqueduct%20%28bridge%29">aqueduct</a> is a bridge that carries water, resembling a viaduct, which is a bridge that connects points of equal height. A road-rail bridge carries both road and rail traffic. A bridge can carry overhead power lines as does the <a href="Storstr%C3%B8m%20Bridge">Storstrøm Bridge</a>.

Some bridges accommodate other purposes, such as the tower of <a href="Nov%C3%BD%20Most">Nový Most</a> Bridge in <a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>, which features a restaurant, or a <a href="bridge-restaurant">bridge-restaurant</a> which is a bridge built to serve as a restaurant. Other suspension bridge towers carry transmission antennas.

Bridges are subject to unplanned uses as well. The areas underneath some bridges have become makeshift shelters and homes to homeless people, and the undersides of bridges all around the world are spots of prevalent graffiti. Some bridges attract people attempting <a href="suicide">suicide</a>, and become known as <a href="suicide%20bridge">suicide bridge</a>s.

The materials used to build the structure are also used to categorize bridges. Until the end of the 18th Century, bridges were made out of timber, stone and masonry. Modern bridges are currently built in concrete, steel, fiber reinforced polymers (FRP), stainless steel or combinations of those materials. <a href="living%20root%20bridges">Living bridges</a> have been constructed of live plants such as <a href="Ficus%20elastica">Ficus elastica</a> tree roots in India and <a href="wisteria">wisteria</a> vines in Japan.

Most bridges are utilitarian in appearance, but in some cases, the appearance of the bridge can have great importance. Often, this is the case with a large bridge that serves as an entrance to a city, or crosses over a main harbor entrance. These are sometimes known as "signature bridges". Designers of bridges in parks and along parkways often place more importance to aesthetics, as well. Examples include the stone-faced bridges along the <a href="Taconic%20State%20Parkway">Taconic State Parkway</a> in New York.

To create a beautiful image, some bridges are built much taller than necessary. This type, often found in east-Asian style gardens, is called a <a href="Moon%20bridge">Moon bridge</a>, evoking a rising full moon. Other garden bridges may cross only a dry bed of stream washed pebbles, intended only to convey an impression of a stream. Often in palaces a bridge will be built over an artificial waterway as symbolic of a passage to an important place or state of mind. A set of five bridges cross a sinuous waterway in an important courtyard of the <a href="Forbidden%20City">Forbidden City</a> in <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>, <a href="China">China</a>. The central bridge was reserved exclusively for the use of the Emperor, Empress, and their attendants.

Bridge maintenance consisting of a combination of structural health monitoring and testing. This is regulated in country-specific engineer standards and includes e.g. an ongoing monitoring every three to six months, a simple test or inspection every two to three years and a major inspection every six to ten years. In Europe, the cost of maintenance is higher than spending on new bridges. The lifetime of welded steel bridges can be significantly extended by <a href="High%20Frequency%20Impact%20Treatment">aftertreatment of the weld transitions</a> . This results in a potential high benefit, using existing bridges far beyond the planned lifetime.

The failure of bridges is of special concern for <a href="structural%20engineers">structural engineers</a> in trying to learn lessons vital to bridge design, construction and maintenance. The failure of bridges first assumed national interest during the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> when many new designs were being built, often using new materials.

In the United States, the <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a> tracks the structural evaluations of all bridges, including designations such as "structurally deficient" and "functionally obsolete".

There are several methods used to monitor the stress on large structures like bridges. The most common method is the use of an <a href="accelerometer">accelerometer</a>, which is integrated into the bridge while it is being built. This technology is used for long-term surveillance of the bridge.

Another option for structural-integrity monitoring is "non-contact monitoring", which uses the <a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler effect</a> (Doppler shift). A <a href="laser">laser</a> beam from a <a href="Laser%20Doppler%20Vibrometer">Laser Doppler Vibrometer</a> is directed at the point of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface. The advantage of this method is that the setup time for the equipment is faster and, unlike an accelerometer, this makes measurements possible on multiple structures in as short a time as possible. Additionally, this method can measure specific points on a bridge that might be difficult to access.

Beadwork

Beadwork is the art or craft of attaching <a href="bead">bead</a>s to one another by stringing them with a <a href="sewing%20needle">sewing needle</a> or beading needle and thread or thin wire, or sewing them to cloth. Beads come in a variety of materials, shapes and sizes. Beads are used to create <a href="jewellery">jewelry</a> or other articles of personal adornment; they are also used in wall hangings and <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a> and many other artworks.

Beadwork techniques are broadly divided into <a href="Bead%20weaving">loom</a> and <a href="Bead%20weaving">off-loom</a> weaving, <a href="Bead%20stringing">stringing</a>, <a href="bead%20embroidery">bead embroidery</a>, <a href="bead%20crochet">bead crochet</a>, and <a href="bead%20knitting">bead knitting</a>.

Beads, made of durable materials, survive in the archaeological record appearing with the very advent of modern man, <a href="Homo%20sapiens">Homo sapiens</a>.

Beads are used for <a href="religion">religious</a> purposes, as good luck <a href="amulet">talismans</a>, for barter, and as curative agents.
Modern beadwork is often used as a creative <a href="hobby">hobby</a> to create <a href="jewelry">jewelry</a>, <a href="handbag">handbag</a>s, coasters, and dozens of other crafts. Beads are available in many different designs, sizes, colors, shapes, and materials, allowing much variation among bead artisans and projects. Simple projects can be created in less than an hour by novice beaders, while complex beadwork may take weeks of meticulous work with specialized tools and equipment. Many free patterns and tutorials can be found in Internet.

<a href="Egyptian%20faience">Faience</a> is a mixture of powdered clays and lime, soda and silica sand. This is mixed with water to make a paste and molded around a small stick or bit of straw. It is then ready to be fired into a bead. As the bead heats up, the soda, sand and lime melt into glass that incorporates and covers the clay. The result is a hard bead covered in bluish glass.

This process was probably discovered first in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and then imported to <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>. However, it was the Egyptians who made it their own art form. Since before the <a href="1st%20dynasty">1st dynasty</a> of <a href="Narmer">Narmer</a> (3100 B.C.) to the last dynasty of the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a> (33 B.C.) and to the present day, faience beads have been made in the same way.

These beads predate glass beads and were probably a forerunner of glass making. If a beadmaker was a little short of clay and had a little extra lime and the fire is hotter than usual, the mixture will become glass. In fact some early tubular faience beads are clayish at one end and pure glass at the other end. Apparently the beads weren't fired evenly.

The uneven beads were noticed early on, this led to experimentation, slowly at first. It took a long time for new ideas to be accepted in a conservative, agricultural society. One of the first variations to take hold was to color the faience beads by adding metallic salts. By the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty (1850 B.C.), faience making and glass making had become two separate crafts.

Faience beads were so common because they were cheaper and less labor-intensive to make than stone beads. Aside from personal use and daily wear they were used to create beaded netting to cover mummies. Most of the archaeological specimens come from burials.

As early as the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a> (circa 2670–2195 B.C.), Egyptian artisans fashioned images of gods, kings, and mortals wearing broad collars made of molded tubular and teardrop beads. These beaded collars may have been derived from floral prototypes. In antiquity the collar was called a "wesekh", literally "the broad one." 

In the Americas, the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> used bead work to tell stories. They told them by the patterns in the beads. They used dried berries, gray Indian corn, teeth, bones, claws, or sometimes sea shells when they traded with coastal tribes.

3D beading generally uses the techniques of <a href="bead%20weaving">bead weaving</a>, which can be further divided into right angle weave and <a href="peyote%20stitch">peyote stitch</a>.

Many 3D beading patterns are done in right angle weave, but sometimes both techniques are combined in the same piece. Both stitches are done using either fishing line or nylon thread. Fishing line lends itself better to right angle
weave because it is stiffer than nylon thread, so it holds the beads in a tighter arrangement and does not easily break when tugged upon.

Nylon thread is more suited to peyote stitch because it is softer and more pliable than fishing line, which permits the beads of
the stitch to sit straight without undue tension bending the arrangement out of place. Two needle right angle weave is done using both ends of the fishing
line, in which beads are strung in repeated circular arrangements, and the fishing line is pulled tight after each bead circle is made. Single needed right angle weave was popularized in the 90's by David Chatt and has become the norm.

Peyote
stitch is stitched using only one end of the nylon thread. The other end of the string is left dangling at the beginning of the piece, while the first end of the thread progresses through the stitch. In peyote stitch, beads are woven into the piece in a very similar fashion to knitting or cross stitching.

In fact, it is not uncommon for cross stitch patterns to be beaded in peyote stitch technique. Peyote stitch patterns are very easy to depict diagrammatically because they are typically stitched flat.

Right angle weave lends itself better to 3D beading, but peyote stitch offers the advantage of allowing the beads to be more tightly knit, which is sometimes necessary to portray an object properly in three dimensions.

Beadwork in Europe has a history dating back millennia to a time when shells and animal bones were used as beads in <a href="necklace">necklace</a>s.

Glass beads were being made in <a href="Murano">Murano</a> by the end of the 14th century. French beaded flowers were being made as early as the 16th century, and <a href="murano%20beads">lampwork glass</a> was invented in the 18th century. <a href="beads%23Seed%20beads">Seed beads</a> began to be used for embroidery, crochet, and numerous <a href="Bead%20weaving%23Off-loom%20beadweaving">off-loom</a> techniques.

Beadwork is a <a href="Native%20American%20art">Native American art</a> form which evolved to mostly use glass beads imported from Europe and recently Asia. Glass beads have been in use for almost five centuries in the Americas. Today a wide range of beading styles flourish.

Alongside the widespread popularity of glass beads, bead artists continue incorporating natural items such as <a href="Quillwork">dyed porcupine quills</a>, shell such as wampum, and dendrite, and even sea urchin spines in a similar manner as beads.

Wampum shell beads are ceremonially and politically important to a range of Eastern tribes, and were used to depict several important treaties between the Native peoples and the colonists, as in the case of the <a href="Two%20Row%20Wampum%20Treaty">Two Row Wampum Treaty</a>.

In the Great Lakes, <a href="Ursulines">Ursuline</a> nuns introduced floral patterns to tribes who quickly applied them to beadwork. <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> tribes are known for their bandolier bags that might take an entire year to complete. During the 20th century the Plateau tribes, such as the <a href="Nez%20Perce%20%28tribe%29">Nez Perce</a>, perfected contour-style beadwork in which the lines of beads are stitched to emphasize the pictorial imagery. Plains tribes are master beaders, and today dance regalia for men and women feature a variety of beadwork styles. While Plains and Plateau tribes are renowned for their beaded <a href="Trap%20%28carriage%29">horse trappings</a>, Subarctic tribes such as the <a href="Dene">Dene</a> create lavish beaded floral dog blankets. Eastern tribes have a completely different beadwork aesthetic: <a href="Innu">Innu</a>, <a href="Mi%27kmaq%20people">Mi'kmaq</a>, <a href="Penobscot%20people">Penobscot</a>, and <a href="Haudenosaunee">Haudenosaunee</a> tribes are known for symmetrical scroll motifs in white beads, called the "double curve." Iroquois are also known for "embossed" beading in which strings pulled taut force beads to pop up from the surface, creating a <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a>. <a href="Tammy%20Rahr">Tammy Rahr</a> (Cayuga) is a contemporary practitioner of this style. <a href="Zuni%20people">Zuni</a> artists have developed a tradition of three-dimensional beaded sculptures.

<a href="Huichol%20people">Huichol</a> Indians of <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a> and <a href="Nayarit">Nayarit</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> have a completely unique approach to beadwork. They adhere beads one by one to a surface such as wood or a gourd with a mixture of resin and beeswax.

Most Native beadwork is created for tribal use, but beadworkers also create conceptual work for the art world. <a href="Richard%20Aitson">Richard Aitson</a> (<a href="Kiowa">Kiowa</a>-<a href="Apache">Apache</a>), enjoying both an Indian and non-Indian audience, is known for his fully beaded <a href="cradle%20board">cradleboards</a>. Another Kiowa beadworker, <a href="Teri%20Greeves">Teri Greeves</a>, has won top honors for her beadwork which consciously integrates both traditional and contemporary motifs such as beaded dancers on Converse high-tops. Greeves also beads on buckskin and explores such issues as warfare or Native American voting rights.

<a href="Marcus%20Amerman">Marcus Amerman</a>, <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, one of today's most celebrated bead artists, pioneered a movement of highly realistic beaded portraits. His imagery ranges from 19th century Native leaders to pop icons including <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a> and <a href="Brooke%20Shields">Brooke Shields</a>.

Roger Amerman, Marcus' brother, and <a href="Martha%20Berry%20%28artist%29">Martha Berry</a>, <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>, have effectively revived Southeastern beadwork, a style that had been lost because of the forced removal of their tribes to Indian Territory. Their beadwork commonly features white bead outlines, an echo of the shell beads or pearls Southeastern tribes used before contact.

<a href="Jamie%20Okuma">Jamie Okuma</a> (<a href="Luise%C3%B1o%20people">Luiseño</a>-<a href="Shoshone">Shoshone</a>-<a href="Bannock%20%28tribe%29">Bannock</a>) has won top awards with her beaded dolls, which can include entire families or horses and riders, all with fully beaded regalia. The antique Venetian beads she uses can be as small as size 22°, about the size of a grain of salt. <a href="Juanita%20Growing%20Thunder%20Fogarty">Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty</a>, Rhonda Holy Bear, and Charlene Holy Bear are also prominent beaded doll makers.

Board game

A board game is a <a href="tabletop%20game">tabletop game</a> that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or "board", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure <a href="Strategy%20game">strategy</a>, but many contain an element of <a href="Game%20of%20chance">chance</a>; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill.

Games usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve. Early board games represented a battle between two armies, and most modern board games are still based on defeating opponents in terms of counters, winning position, or accrual of points.

There are many varieties of board games. Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, like <a href="checkers">checkers</a>, to having a specific theme and narrative, like "<a href="Cluedo">Cluedo</a>". Rules can range from the very simple, like <a href="Tic-tac-toe">Tic-tac-toe</a>, to those describing a game universe in great detail, like "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>" – although most of the latter are <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a>s where the board is secondary to the game, serving to help visualize the game <a href="scenario">scenario</a>.

The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily correlated with the number or complexity of rules; games like <a href="chess">chess</a> or <a href="Go%20%28board%20game%29">Go</a> possess relatively simple , but have great strategic depth.

Board games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history. A number of important historical sites, artifacts, and documents shed light on early board games such as:

]

In 17th and 18th century colonial America, the agrarian life of the country left little time for game playing though <a href="draughts">draughts</a> (<a href="checkers">checkers</a>), <a href="bowling">bowling</a>, and card games were not unknown. The Pilgrims and Puritans of New England frowned on game playing and viewed dice as instruments of the devil. When the Governor William Bradford discovered a group of non-Puritans playing stool-ball, pitching the bar, and pursuing other sports in the streets on Christmas Day, 1622, he confiscated their implements, reprimanded them, and told them their devotion for the day should be confined to their homes.

In "Thoughts on Lotteries" (1826) <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> wrote: Almost all these pursuits of chance [i.e., of human industry] produce something useful to society. But there are some which produce nothing, and endanger the well-being of the individuals engaged in them or of others depending on them. Such are games with cards, dice, billiards, etc. And although the pursuit of them is a matter of natural right, yet society, perceiving the irresistible bent of some of its members to pursue them, and the ruin produced by them to the families depending on these individuals, consider it as a case of insanity, quoad hoc, step in to protect the family and the party himself, as in other cases of insanity, infancy, imbecility, etc., and suppress the pursuit altogether, and the natural right of following it. There are some other games of chance, useful on certain occasions, and injurious only when carried beyond their useful bounds. Such are insurances, lotteries, raffles, etc. These they do not suppress, but take their regulation under their own discretion.

The board game "Traveller's Tour Through the United States" and its sister game "Traveller’s Tour Through Europe" were published by New York City bookseller <a href="F.%20%26amp%3B%20R.%20Lockwood">F. & R. Lockwood</a> in 1822 and today claims the distinction of being the first board game published in the United States.

As the U.S. shifted from agrarian to urban living in the 19th century, greater leisure time and a rise in income became available to the middle class. The American home, once the center of economic production, became the <a href="wikt%3Alocus">locus</a> of entertainment, enlightenment, and education under the supervision of mothers. Children were encouraged to play board games that developed literacy skills and provided moral instruction.
The earliest board games published in the United States were based upon Christian morality. "<a href="The%20Mansion%20of%20Happiness">The Mansion of Happiness</a>" (1843), for example, sent players along a path of virtues and vices that led to the Mansion of Happiness (Heaven). "The Game of Pope or Pagan, or The Siege of the Stronghold of Satan by the Christian Army" (1844) pitted an image on its board of a <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> woman committing "<a href="suttee">suttee</a>" against missionaries landing on a foreign shore. The missionaries are cast in white as "the symbol of innocence, temperance, and hope" while the pope and pagan are cast in black, the color of "gloom of error, and ... grief at the daily loss of empire".

Commercially produced board games in the mid-19th century were monochrome prints laboriously hand-colored by teams of low-paid young factory women. Advances in paper making and printmaking during the period enabled the commercial production of relatively inexpensive board games. The most significant advance was the development of <a href="chromolithography">chromolithography</a>, a technological achievement that made bold, richly colored images available at affordable prices. Games cost as little as US$.25 for a small boxed card game to $3.00 for more elaborate games.

American Protestants believed a virtuous life led to success, but the belief was challenged mid-century when the country embraced materialism and capitalism. In 1860, "<a href="The%20Checkered%20Game%20of%20Life">The Checkered Game of Life</a>" rewarded players for mundane activities such as attending college, marrying, and getting rich. Daily life rather than eternal life became the focus of board games. The game was the first to focus on secular virtues rather than religious virtues, and sold 40,000 copies its first year.
"Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded", published in 1886 by the New York City firm of <a href="McLoughlin%20Brothers">McLoughlin Brothers</a>, was one of the first board games based on materialism and capitalism published in the United States. The game is a typical track board game. Players move their tokens along the track at the spin of the arrow toward the goal at track's end. Some spaces on the track will advance the player while others will send him back.

In the affluent 1880s, Americans witnessed the publication of <a href="Horatio%20Alger%2C%20Jr.">Algeresque</a> <a href="rags%20to%20riches">rags to riches</a> games that permitted players to emulate the capitalist heroes of the age. One of the first such games, "The Game of the District Messenger Boy", encouraged the idea that the lowliest messenger boy could ascend the corporate ladder to its topmost rung. Such games insinuated that the accumulation of wealth brought increased social status. Competitive capitalistic games culminated in 1935 with "<a href="Monopoly%20%28game%29">Monopoly</a>", the most commercially successful board game in U.S. history.

McLoughlin Brothers published similar games based on the telegraph boy theme including "Game of the Telegraph Boy, or Merit Rewarded" (1888). Greg Downey notes in his essay, "Information Networks and Urban Spaces: The Case of the Telegraph Messenger Boy", that families who could afford the deluxe version of the game in its <a href="chromolithography">chromolithographed</a>, wood-sided box would not "have sent their sons out for such a rough apprenticeship in the working world."

<a href="Margaret%20Hofer">Margaret Hofer</a> described the period of 1880s–1920s as "The Golden Age" of board gaming in America. Board game popularity was boosted, like that of many items, through <a href="mass%20production">mass production</a>, which made them cheaper and more easily available. Although there are no detailed statistics, some scholars suggest that the 20th century saw a decline in the popularity of the hobby.

The late 1990s onwards have seen substantial growth in the reach and market of board games. This has been attributed to, among other factors, the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>, which has made it easier for people to find out about games and to find opponents to play against. Around the year 2000 the board gaming industry began significant growth with companies producing a rising number of new games to be sold to a growing worldwide audience. In the 2010s, a number of publications referred to the board games as having a new Golden Age. Board game venues are also growing in popularity; for example <a href="board%20game%20cafe">board game cafe</a>s are reported to be very popular in China.

Some games, such as chess, depend completely on player skill, while many children's games such as "<a href="Candy%20Land">Candy Land</a>" and "<a href="Snakes%20and%20Ladders">Snakes and Ladders</a>" require no decisions by the players and are decided purely by luck.

Many games require some level of both skill and luck. A player may be hampered by bad luck in <a href="backgammon">backgammon</a>, "Monopoly", "<a href="Risk%20%28game%29">Risk</a>"; but over many games a skilled player will win more often, and the elements of luck can make for more excitement, and more diverse and multifaceted strategies, as concepts such as <a href="expected%20value">expected value</a> and <a href="risk%20management">risk management</a> must be considered.

Luck may be introduced into a game by a number of methods. The use of <a href="dice">dice</a> of various sorts goes back to the <a href="Royal%20Game%20of%20Ur">earliest board games</a>. These can decide everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in "Monopoly", to how their forces fare in battle, as in "Risk", or which resources a player gains, as in "The Settlers of Catan". Other games such as "<a href="Sorry%21%20%28game%29">Sorry!</a>" use a deck of special <a href="Playing%20card">cards</a> that, when shuffled, create randomness. "<a href="Scrabble">Scrabble</a>" does something similar with randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness. <a href="German-style%20board%20game">German-style board game</a>s are notable for often having less luck element than many North American board games.

Another important aspect of some games is <a href="diplomacy">diplomacy</a>, that is, players making deals with one another. Negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players, <a href="cooperative%20games">cooperative games</a> being the exception. An important facet of "<a href="The%20Settlers%20of%20Catan">The Settlers of Catan</a>", for example, is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents. In "Risk", two or more players may team up against others. "Easy" diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. "Advanced" diplomacy (e.g., in the aptly named game "<a href="Diplomacy%20%28board%20game%29">Diplomacy</a>") consists of making elaborate plans together, with the possibility of betrayal.

In "<a href="perfect%20information">perfect information</a>" games, such as chess, each player has complete information on the state of the game, but in other games, such as "<a href="Tigris%20and%20Euphrates">Tigris and Euphrates</a>" or "<a href="Stratego">Stratego</a>", some information is hidden from players. This makes finding the best move more difficult, and may involve estimating probabilities by the opponents.

Many board games are now available as <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s, which can include the computer playing as one or more opponents. Many board games can now be played <a href="Internet">online</a> against a computer and/or other players. Some <a href="website">website</a>s allow play in <a href="real%20time%20%28media%29">real time</a> and immediately show the opponents' moves, while others use <a href="email">email</a> to notify the players after each move. The <a href="Internet">Internet</a> and cheaper home printing has also influenced board games via print-and-play games that may be purchased and printed. Some games use external media such as audio cassettes or <a href="DVD">DVD</a>s in accompaniment to the game.
There are also virtual tabletop programs that allow online players to play a variety of existing and new board games through tools needed to manipulate the game board, but do not necessarily enforce the game's rules, leaving this up to the players. There are generalized programs such as "<a href="Vassal%20Engine">Vassal</a>", "<a href="Tabletop%20Simulator">Tabletop Simulator</a>" and "Tabletopia" that can be used to play any board or card game, while programs like "<a href="Roll20">Roll20</a>" and "<a href="Fantasy%20Grounds">Fantasy Grounds</a>" that are more specialized for role-playing games. Some of these virtual tabletops have worked with the license holders to allow for use of their game's assets within the program; for example, "Fantasy Grounds" has licenses for both "Dungeons & Dragons" and "<a href="Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a>" materials, while "Tabletop Simulator" has allows game published to provide <a href="microtransaction">paid downloadable content</a> for their games. However, as these games offer the ability to add in content through <a href="mod%20%28video%20gaming%29">user modifications</a>, there are also unlicensed uses of board game assets available through these programs.

While the board gaming market is estimated to be smaller than that for <a href="video%20games">video games</a>, it has also experienced significant growth from the late 1990s. A 2012 article in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" described board games as "making a comeback". Another from 2014 gave an estimate that put the growth of the board game market at "between 25% and 40% annually" since 2010, and described the current time as the "golden era for board games". The rise in board game popularity has been attributed to quality improvement (more elegant <a href="Game%20mechanic">mechanics</a>, , artwork, and graphics) as well as increased availability thanks to sales through the Internet.

A 1991 estimate for the global board game market was over $1.2 billion. A 2001 estimate for the United States "board games and puzzle" market gave a value of under $400 million, and for United Kingdom, of about £50 million. A 2009 estimate for the Korean market was put at 800 million won, and another estimate for the American board game market for the same year was at about $800 million. A 2011 estimate for the Chinese board game market was at over 10 billion <a href="Chinese%20yuan">yuan</a>. (Some estimates may split board games from collectible card, miniature and role-playing games; for example another 2014 estimate distinguishing board games from other types of hobby games gave the estimate for the U.S. and Canada market at only $75 million, with the total size of what it defined as the hobby game market at over $700 million, with a 2015 estimate suggesting a value of almost $900 million) A 2013 estimate put the size of the German toy market at 2.7 billion euros (out of which, the board games and puzzle market is worth about 375 million euros), and Polish markets, at 2 billion and 280 million <a href="z%C5%82oty">złoties</a>, respectively. Per capita, in 2009 Germany was considered to be the best market, with the highest number of games sold per individual.

A dedicated field of research into gaming exists, known as <a href="game%20studies">game studies</a> or ludology.

While there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., <a href="chess">chess</a>, <a href="Go%20%28board%20game%29">Go</a>, <a href="mancala">mancala</a>), less has been done on contemporary board games such as "<a href="Monopoly%20%28game%29">Monopoly</a>", "<a href="Scrabble">Scrabble</a>", and "<a href="Risk%20%28game%29">Risk</a>". Much research has been carried out on chess, in part because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise. The works of <a href="Adriaan%20de%20Groot">Adriaan de Groot</a>, William Chase, <a href="Herbert%20A.%20Simon">Herbert A. Simon</a>, and <a href="Fernand%20Gobet">Fernand Gobet</a> have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing.

Linearly arranged board games have been shown to improve children's spatial numerical understanding. This is because the game is similar to a <a href="number%20line">number line</a> in that they promote a linear understanding of numbers rather than the innate logarithmic one.

Research studies show that board games such as "Snakes and Ladders" result in children showing significant improvements in aspects of basic number skills such as counting, recognizing numbers, numerical estimation and number comprehension. They also practice fine motor skills each time they grasp a game piece. Playing board games has also been tied to improving children's <a href="executive%20functions">executive functions</a>.

Additionally, board games can be therapeutic. <a href="Bruce%20Barrymore%20Halpenny">Bruce Halpenny</a>, a <a href="games%20inventor">games inventor</a> said when interviewed about his game, <a href="The%20Great%20Train%20Robbery%20%28board%20game%29">"The Great Train Robbery"</a>: With crime you deal with every basic human emotion and also have enough elements to combine action with melodrama. The player’s imagination is fired as they plan to rob the train. Because of the gamble they take in the early stage of the game there is a build-up of tension, which is immediately released once the train is robbed. Release of tension is therapeutic and useful in our society, because most jobs are boring and repetitive.

Playing games has been suggested as a viable addition to traditional educational curriculum.

There are a number of ways in which board games can be classified, and considerable overlap may exist, so that a game belong in several categories. The following is a list of some of the most common:

Although many board games have a <a href="jargon">jargon</a> all their own, there is a generalized <a href="terminology">terminology</a> to describe concepts applicable to basic <a href="game%20mechanic">game mechanic</a>s and attributes common to nearly all board games.

Bead

A bead is a small, decorative object that is formed in a variety of shapes and sizes of a material such as stone, bone, shell, glass, plastic, wood or pearl and that a small hole is drilled for <a href="yarn">threading</a> or stringing. Beads range in size from under to over in diameter. A pair of beads made from "<a href="Nassarius">Nassarius</a>" sea snail shells, approximately 100,000 years old, are thought to be the earliest known examples of <a href="jewellery">jewellery</a>. <a href="Beadwork">Beadwork</a> is the art or craft of making things with beads. Beads can be woven together with specialized <a href="yarn">thread</a>, strung onto thread or soft, flexible <a href="wire">wire</a>, or adhered to a surface (e.g. <a href="Cloth">fabric</a>, <a href="clay">clay</a>).

Beads can be divided into several types of overlapping categories based on different criteria such as the materials from which they are made, the process used in their manufacturing, the place or period of origin, the patterns on their surface, or their general shape. In some cases, such as <a href="millefiori">millefiori</a> and <a href="cloisonn%C3%A9">cloisonné</a> beads, multiple categories may overlap in an interdependent fashion.

Beads can be made of many different materials. The earliest beads were made of a variety of natural materials which, after they were gathered, could be readily drilled and shaped. As humans became capable of obtaining and working with more difficult materials, those materials were added to the range of available substances. But now a days synthetic materials were added.

In modern manufacturing, the most common bead materials are wood, <a href="plastic">plastic</a>, <a href="glass">glass</a>, <a href="metal">metal</a>, and <a href="Rock%20%28geology%29">stone</a>.

Beads are still made from many naturally occurring materials, both organic (i.e., of <a href="animal">animal</a>- or <a href="plant">plant</a>-based origin) and inorganic (purely <a href="mineral">mineral</a> origin). However, some of these materials now routinely undergo some extra processing beyond mere shaping and drilling such as color enhancement via <a href="dyes">dyes</a> or irradiation.

The natural organics include <a href="bone">bone</a>, <a href="Coral%20%28precious%29">coral</a>, <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horn</a>, <a href="ivory">ivory</a>, <a href="seed">seed</a>s (such as <a href="tagua">tagua</a> nuts), <a href="animal%20shell">animal shell</a>, and <a href="wood">wood</a>. For most of human history <a href="pearl">pearl</a>s were the ultimate precious beads of natural origin because of their rarity; the modern <a href="cultured%20pearl">pearl-culturing process</a> has made them far more common. <a href="Amber">Amber</a> and <a href="jet%20%28lignite%29">jet</a> are also of natural organic origin although both are the result of partial <a href="fossil">fossil</a>ization.

The natural inorganics include various types of <a href="Rock%20%28geology%29">stone</a>s, ranging from <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a>s to common <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s, and <a href="metal">metal</a>s. Of the latter, only a few <a href="precious%20metal">precious metal</a>s occur in pure forms, but other purified <a href="base%20metal">base metal</a>s may as well be placed in this category along with certain naturally occurring alloys such as <a href="electrum">electrum</a>. There are also paper beads.

The oldest-surviving synthetic materials used for beadmaking have generally been <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a>s: <a href="pottery">pottery</a> and <a href="glass">glass</a>. Beads were also made from ancient alloys such as <a href="bronze">bronze</a> and <a href="brass">brass</a>, but as those were more vulnerable to <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> they have generally been less well-preserved at archaeological sites.

Many different subtypes of <a href="glass">glass</a> are now used for beadmaking, some of which have their own component-specific names. <a href="Lead%20crystal">Lead crystal</a> beads have a high percentage of <a href="lead%28II%29%20oxide">lead oxide</a> in the glass formula, increasing the <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a>. Most of the other named glass types have their formulations and patterns inseparable from the manufacturing process.

Small, colourful, fusible plastic beads (some brands are Nabbi, Hama, Perler, and Pyssla) can be placed on a solid plastic-backed peg array to form designs and then melted together with a <a href="Ironing">clothes iron</a>; alternatively, they can be strung into necklaces and bracelets or woven into keychains. Fusible beads come in many colors and degrees of <a href="transparency%20and%20translucency">transparency</a>/<a href="opacity%20%28optics%29">opacity</a>, including varieties that glow in the dark or have internal <a href="glitter">glitter</a>; peg boards come in various shapes and several geometric patterns. Plastic toy beads, made by chopping plastic tubes into short pieces, were introduced in 1958 by Munkplast AB in <a href="Munka-Ljungby">Munka-Ljungby</a>, Sweden, under the brand Nabbi. Known as <a href="Indian%20bead">Indian bead</a>s, they were originally sewn together to form ribbons. The pegboard for bead designs was invented in the early 1960s (patented 1962, patent granted 1967) by Gunnar Knutsson in Vällingby, Sweden, as a therapy for elderly homes; the pegboard later gained popularity as a toy for children. The bead designs were glued to cardboard or <a href="Masonite">Masonite</a> boards and used as <a href="trivet">trivet</a>s. Later, when the beads were made of <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a>, it became possible to fuse them with a flat iron. In 2005, Munkplast/Nabbi introduced the Photo Pearls software that converts digital photos to bead designs. Hama come in three sizes: mini (diameter 2.5 mm), midi (5 mm) and maxi (10 mm). Perler beads come in two sizes called classic (5 mm) and biggie (10 mm). Pyssla beads (by <a href="IKEA">IKEA</a>) only come in one size (5 mm).
Modern <a href="mass%20production">mass-produced</a> beads are generally shaped by <a href="carving">carving</a> or <a href="casting">casting</a>, depending on the material and desired effect. In some cases, more specialized <a href="metalworking">metalworking</a> or <a href="glass">glass</a>working techniques may be employed, or a combination of multiple techniques and materials may be used such as in <a href="cloisonn%C3%A9">cloisonné</a>.

Most glass beads are <a href="pressed%20glass">pressed glass</a>, mass-produced by preparing a molten batch of <a href="Glass%20coloring%20and%20color%20marking">glass of the desired color</a> and pouring it into molds to form the desired shape. This is also true of most <a href="plastic">plastic</a> beads.

A smaller and more expensive subset of glass and lead crystal beads are cut into precise faceted shapes on an individual basis. This was once done by hand but has largely been taken over by precision machinery.

"Fire-polished" faceted beads are a less expensive alternative to hand-cut faceted glass or crystal. They derive their name from the second half of a two-part process: first, the glass batch is poured into round bead molds, then they are faceted with a grinding wheel. The faceted beads are then poured onto a tray and briefly reheated just long enough to melt the surface, "polishing" out any minor surface irregularities from the grinding wheel.

There are several specialized glassworking techniques that create a distinctive appearance throughout the body of the resulting beads, which are then primarily referred to by the glass type.

If the glass batch is used to create a large massive block instead of pre-shaping it as it cools, the result may then be carved into smaller items in the same manner as stone. Conversely, glass artisans may make beads by <a href="lampworking">lampworking</a> the glass on an individual basis; once formed, the beads undergo little or no further shaping after the layers have been properly <a href="annealing%20%28glass%29">anneal</a>ed.

Most of these glass subtypes are some form of <a href="fused%20glass">fused glass</a>, although <a href="Goldstone%20%28gemstone%29">goldstone</a> is created by controlling the reductive atmosphere and cooling conditions of the glass batch rather than by fusing separate components together.

<a href="Dichroic%20glass">Dichroic glass</a> beads incorporate a semitransparent microlayer of metal between two or more layers. <a href="Fibre%20optic">Fibre optic</a> glass beads have an eyecatching <a href="chatoyant">chatoyant</a> effect across the grain.

There are also several ways to fuse many small glass canes together into a multicolored pattern, resulting in <a href="millefiori">millefiori</a> beads or <a href="chevron%20bead">chevron bead</a>s (sometimes called "trade beads"). "Furnace glass" beads encase a multicolored core in a transparent exterior layer which is then annealed in a furnace.

More economically, millefiori beads can also be made by limiting the patterning process to long, narrow canes or rods known as murrine. Thin cross-sections, or "decals", can then be cut from the murrine and fused into the surface of a plain glass bead.

Round

This is the most common shape of beads that are strung on wire to create necklaces, and bracelets. The shape of the round beads lay together and are pleasing to the eye. Rounds beads can be made of glass, stone, ceramic, metal, or wood.

Square or Cubed

Square beads can be to enhance a necklace design as a spacer however a necklace can be strung with just square beads. The necklaces with square beads are used in <a href="Rosary">Rosary</a> necklaces/prayer necklaces, and wooden or shell ones are made for beachwear.

Oval

Tube

Potato
Hair pipe beads
Elk rib bones were the original material for the long, tubular <a href="hair%20pipe">hair pipe</a> beads. Today these beads are commonly made of <a href="bison">bison</a> and <a href="water%20buffalo">water buffalo</a> bones and are popular for breastplates and chokers among <a href="Plains%20Indians">Plains Indians</a>. Black variations of these beads are made from the animals' horns.

Seed beads

Seed beads are uniformly shaped spheroidal or tube shaped beads ranging in size from under a millimetre to several millimetres. "Seed bead" is a generic term for any small bead. Usually rounded in shape, seed beads are most commonly used for <a href="Bead%20weaving">loom</a> and <a href="Bead%20weaving">off-loom</a> bead weaving.

African trade beads or <a href="slave%20beads">slave beads</a> may be antique beads that were manufactured in Europe and used for trade during the colonial period, such as chevron beads; or they may have been made in West Africa by and for Africans, such as Mauritanian <a href="Kiffa%20beads">Kiffa beads</a>, Ghanaian and Nigerian <a href="powder%20glass%20beads">powder glass beads</a>, or African-made brass beads.

Austrian crystal is a generic term for cut lead-crystal beads, based on the location and prestige of the <a href="Swarovski">Swarovski</a> firm.

Czech glass beads are made in the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>, in particular an area called <a href="Jablonec%20nad%20Nisou">Jablonec nad Nisou</a>. Production of glass beads in the area dates back to the 14th century, though production was depressed under communist rule. Because of this long tradition, their workmanship and quality has an excellent reputation.

Vintage beads, in the collectibles and antique market, refers to items that are at least 25 or more years old. Vintage beads are available in materials that include lucite, plastic, crystal, metal and glass.

<a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>an <a href="Dzi%20bead">Dzi bead</a>s and <a href="Rudraksha%20bead">Rudraksha bead</a>s are used to make Buddhist and Hindu rosaries (<a href="Prayer%20beads">malas</a>). <a href="Magatama">Magatama</a> are traditional <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese beads, and <a href="cinnabar">cinnabar</a> was often used for making beads in <a href="China">China</a>. <a href="Wampum">Wampum</a> are cylindrical white or purple beads made from <a href="quahog">quahog</a> or North Atlantic <a href="channeled%20whelk">channeled whelk</a> shells by northeastern Native American tribes, such as the <a href="Wampanoag%20people">Wampanoag</a> and <a href="Shinnecock%20Indian%20Nation">Shinnecock</a>. <a href="Job%27s%20tears">Job's tears</a> are seed beads popular among southeastern Native American tribes. <a href="Heishe">Heishe</a> are beads made of shells or stones by the <a href="Kewa%20Pueblo%2C%20New%20Mexico">Kewa Pueblo people</a> of <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>.

In many parts of the world, beads are used for symbolic purposes, for example:

Beads are known to be one of the earliest forms of trade between the human race. It is thought that is because of bead trading that humans developed language. Beads are said to have been used and traded for most of our history. The oldest beads found to date were at <a href="Ksar%20Akil">Ksar Akil</a>, in Lebanon. Prior to this find, the beads found in the <a href="Blombos%20Cave">Blombos Cave</a> were the oldest at about 72,000 years old.

After shaping, glass and crystal beads can have their surface appearance enhanced by etching a translucent frosted layer, applying an additional colour layer, or both. "Aurora Borealis", or AB, is a surface coating that diffuses light into a rainbow. Other surface coatings are vitrail, moonlight, dorado, satin, star shine, and heliotrope.

Faux beads are beads that are made to look like a more expensive original material, especially in the case of fake <a href="pearl">pearl</a>s and simulated rocks, <a href="minerals">minerals</a> and <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a>s. Precious metals and <a href="ivory">ivory</a> are also imitated.

<a href="Tagua%20nut">Tagua nut</a>s from South America are used as an ivory substitute since the natural <a href="ivory%20trade">ivory trade</a> has been restricted worldwide.

Bead weaving

Bead weaving (or beadweaving) using <a href="seed%20beads">seed beads</a> can be done either on a <a href="loom">loom</a> or using one of a number of off-loom stitches.

When weaving on a loom, the beads are locked in between the <a href="Warp%20%28weaving%29">warp</a> threads by the <a href="weft">weft</a> threads. The most common bead weaving technique requires two passes of the weft thread. First, an entire row of beads is strung on the weft <a href="yarn">thread</a>. Then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads. The <a href="Sewing%20needle">needle</a> is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place. Heddle looms were popular near the beginning of the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the warp threads.

Although loomed pieces are typically rectangular, it is possible to increase and decrease to produce angular or curvy shapes. <a href="Fringe%20%28trim%29">Fringe</a> can also be added during weaving or before the piece is removed from the loom.

Bead looms vary in size and are typically made of wood or metal. Usually, a <a href="comb">comb</a> or <a href="Spring%20%28device%29">spring</a> is used to hold the warp threads a bead-width apart. Some looms have roller bars that allow the weaver to produce pieces that are longer than the loom. Most looms are meant to sit on a table, but some have floor stands or are meant to sit in the <a href="lap">lap</a>.

Off-loom beadweaving is a family of <a href="beadwork">beadwork</a> techniques in which seed <a href="bead">bead</a>s are woven together into a flat <a href="Cloth">fabric</a>, a tubular rope, or a three-dimensional object such as a ball, clasp, box, or a piece of jewelry. All off-loom techniques can be accomplished using a single needle and thread (no warp threads), but some have two-needle variations.
Different stitches produce pieces with distinct textures, shapes, and patterns. There are many different off-loom bead stitches, including new stitches (distinct thread paths) published only in 2015:

Branchiopoda

Branchiopoda is a <a href="class%20%28biology%29">class</a> of <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s. It comprises <a href="Anostraca">fairy shrimp</a>, <a href="clam%20shrimp">clam shrimp</a>, <a href="Cladocera">Cladocera</a>, <a href="Notostraca">Notostraca</a> and the Devonian "<a href="Lepidocaris">Lepidocaris</a>". They are mostly small, freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus.

Members of the Branchiopoda are unified by the presence of <a href="gill">gill</a>s on many of the animals' <a href="appendage">appendage</a>s, including some of the <a href="arthropod%20mouthparts">mouthparts</a>. This is also responsible for the name of the group (from the , gills, akin to , <a href="windpipe">windpipe</a>; , foot). They generally possess <a href="compound%20eye">compound eye</a>s and a <a href="carapace">carapace</a>, which may be a shell of two valves enclosing the trunk (as in most Cladocera), broad and shallow (as in the Notostraca), or entirely absent (as in the Anostraca). In the groups where the carapace prevents the use of the trunk limbs for swimming (Cladocera, clam shrimp and the extinct <a href="Lipostraca">Lipostraca</a>), the <a href="antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a> are used for locomotion, as they are in the <a href="nauplius%20%28larva%29">nauplius</a>. Male fairy shrimp have an enlarged pair of antennae with which they grasp the female during mating, while the <a href="bottom%20feeder">bottom-feeding</a> Notostraca, the antennae are reduced to <a href="Vestigiality">vestiges</a>. The trunk limbs are beaten in a <a href="metachronal%20rhythm">metachronal rhythm</a>, causing a flow of water along the midline of the animal, from which it derives <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="food">food</a> and, in the case of the Anostraca and Notostraca, movement.

Among the branchiopods, only some <a href="cladocera">cladocera</a>ns are marine; all the other groups are found in continental <a href="freshwater">fresh water</a>, including <a href="vernal%20pool">temporary pools</a> and in salt lakes. Most branchiopodans eat floating <a href="detritus">detritus</a> or <a href="plankton">plankton</a>, which they take using the <a href="seta">seta</a>e on their appendages.

In early taxonomic treatments, the current members of the Branchiopoda were all placed in a single genus, "Monoculus". The taxon Branchiopoda was erected by <a href="Pierre%20Andr%C3%A9%20Latreille">Pierre André Latreille</a> in 1817, initially at the <a href="taxonomic%20rank">rank</a> of <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a>.

The fairy shrimp of the order <a href="Anostraca">Anostraca</a> are usually long (exceptionally up to ). Most species have 20 body segments, bearing 11 pairs of leaf-like "phyllopodia" (swimming legs), and the body lacks a <a href="carapace">carapace</a>. They live in <a href="vernal%20pool">vernal pool</a>s and <a href="hypersaline%20lake">hypersaline lake</a>s across the world, including pools in <a href="desert">desert</a>s, in ice-covered mountain lakes and in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. They swim "upside-down" and <a href="filter%20feeder">feed by filtering</a> organic particles from the water or by scraping <a href="algae">algae</a> from surfaces. They are an important food for many birds and fish, and are cultured and harvested for use as fish food. There are 300 species spread across 8 <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>.

Lipostraca contains a single extinct Early Devonan species, "<a href="Lepidocaris">Lepidocaris rhyniensis</a>", which is the most abundant animal in the <a href="Rhynie%20chert">Rhynie chert</a> deposits. It resembles modern Anostraca, to which it is probably closely related, although its relationships to other orders remain unclear. The body is long, with 23 body segments and 19 pairs of <a href="appendage">appendage</a>s, but no <a href="carapace">carapace</a>. It occurred chiefly among <a href="charophyte">charophyte</a>s, probably in alkaline <a href="vernal%20pool">temporary pools</a>.

The order <a href="Notostraca">Notostraca</a> comprises the single family Triopsidae, containing the tadpole shrimp or shield shrimp. The two genera, "<a href="Triops">Triops</a>" and "<a href="Lepidurus">Lepidurus</a>", are considered <a href="living%20fossil">living fossil</a>s, having not changed significantly in outward form since the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a>. They have a broad, flat carapace, which conceals the head and bears a single pair of compound eyes. The abdomen is long, appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs. The <a href="telson">telson</a> is flanked by a pair of long, thin caudal rami. <a href="Phenotypic%20plasticity">Phenotypic plasticity</a> within taxa makes species-level identification difficult, and is further compounded by variation in the mode of reproduction.

Baruch Spinoza

Baruch Spinoza (; ; born Benedito de Espinosa, ; 24 November 1632 – 21 February 1677, later Benedict de Spinoza) was a <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> philosopher of <a href="Sephardi">Sephardi</a>/<a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> origin. By laying the groundwork for the 18th-century <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> and modern <a href="biblical%20criticism">biblical criticism</a>, including modern conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered one of the great <a href="rationalism">rationalists</a> of <a href="17th-century%20philosophy">17th-century philosophy</a>. Along with <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a>, Spinoza was a leading philosophical figure of the <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Dutch Golden Age</a>. Spinoza's given name, which means "Blessed", varies among different languages. In Hebrew, it is written . His Portuguese name is . In his Latin works, he used .

Spinoza's <a href="masterpiece">magnum opus</a>, "<a href="Ethics%20%28Spinoza%29">Ethics</a>", was published posthumously in 1677. The work opposed Descartes' philosophy on <a href="mind%E2%80%93body%20dualism">mind–body dualism</a>, and earned Spinoza recognition as one of <a href="Western%20philosophy">Western philosophy</a>'s most important thinkers. In the "Ethics", "Spinoza wrote the last indisputable Latin masterpiece, and one in which the refined conceptions of medieval philosophy are finally turned against themselves and destroyed entirely". <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a> said, "You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all." His philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted 20th-century philosopher <a href="Gilles%20Deleuze">Gilles Deleuze</a> to name him "the 'prince' of philosophers."

Spinoza was raised in a Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam. He developed highly-controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and the nature of the Divine. <a href="Portuguese%20Synagogue%20%28Amsterdam%29">Jewish religious authorities</a> issued a "<a href="Herem%20%28censure%29">herem</a>" () against him, causing him to be effectively shunned by Jewish society at age 23. His books were also later put on the Catholic Church's "<a href="Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum">Index of Forbidden Books</a>".

Spinoza lived an outwardly-simple life as a <a href="lens%20%28optics%29">lens</a> grinder, turning down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. He died at the age of 44 allegedly of a lung illness, perhaps <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> or <a href="silicosis">silicosis</a> exacerbated by the inhalation of fine glass dust while grinding optical lenses. He is buried in the churchyard of the Christian <a href="Nieuwe%20Kerk%20%28The%20Hague%29">Nieuwe Kerk</a> in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>.

Spinoza's ancestors were of <a href="Sephardic%20Jew">Sephardic Jew</a>ish descent and were a part of the community of <a href="Portuguese%20Jews">Portuguese Jews</a> that had settled in the city of <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> in the wake of the <a href="Portuguese%20Inquisition">Portuguese Inquisition</a> (1536), which had resulted in <a href="Conversos">forced conversions</a> and expulsions from the <a href="Iberian%20peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a>.

The Spinoza family ("de Espinosa" or "Espinosa" in Portuguese and in Spanish; it could also be spelled as "de Espinoza" or "Espinoza" in both languages) probably had its origins in <a href="Espinosa%20de%20los%20Monteros">Espinosa de los Monteros</a>, near <a href="Burgos">Burgos</a>, or in <a href="Espinosa%20de%20Cerrato">Espinosa de Cerrato</a>, near <a href="Palencia">Palencia</a>, both in <a href="Castile%20%28historical%20region%29">Northern Castile</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. The family was <a href="Alhambra%20decree">expelled from Spain</a> in 1492 and fled to Portugal. Portugal compelled them to convert to Catholicism in 1498.

Attracted by the Decree of Toleration issued in 1579 by the <a href="Union%20of%20Utrecht">Union of Utrecht</a>, Portuguese "<a href="converso">converso</a>s" first sailed to Amsterdam in 1593 and promptly reconverted to Judaism. In 1598 permission was granted to build a synagogue, and in 1615 an ordinance for the admission and government of the Jews was passed. As a community of exiles, the Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam were highly proud of their identity.

Spinoza's father was born roughly a century after this forced conversion in the small Portuguese city of <a href="Vidigueira">Vidigueira</a>, near <a href="Beja%20%28Portugal%29">Beja</a> in <a href="Alentejo">Alentejo</a>. When Spinoza's father was still a child, Spinoza's grandfather, Isaac de Spinoza, who was from <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, took his family to <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a> in France. They were expelled in 1615 and moved to <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, where Isaac died in 1627.

Spinoza's father, Miguel (Michael), and his uncle, Manuel, then moved to Amsterdam where they resumed the practice of Judaism. Miguel was a successful merchant and became a warden of the synagogue and of the Amsterdam Jewish school. He buried three wives and three of his six children died before reaching adulthood.

Amsterdam and Rotterdam operated as important <a href="cosmopolitanism">cosmopolitan</a> centres where merchant ships from many parts of the world brought people of various customs and beliefs. This flourishing commercial activity encouraged a culture relatively tolerant of the play of new ideas, to a considerable degree sheltered from the censorious hand of ecclesiastical authority (though those considered to have gone "too far" might have gotten persecuted even in the Netherlands). Not by chance were the philosophical works of both Descartes and Spinoza developed in the cultural and intellectual background of the Dutch Republic in the 17th century. Spinoza may have had access to a circle of friends who were unconventional in terms of social tradition, including members of the <a href="Collegiants">Collegiants</a>. One of the people he knew was <a href="Nicolas%20Steno">Niels Stensen</a>, a brilliant Danish student in Leiden; others included <a href="Albert%20Burgh">Albert Burgh</a>, with whom Spinoza is known to have corresponded.

Benedito de Espinoza was born on 24 November 1632 in the <a href="Jodenbuurt">Jodenbuurt</a> in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He was the second son of Miguel de Espinoza, a successful, although not wealthy, Portuguese <a href="Sephardi%20Jews">Sephardic Jewish</a> merchant in Amsterdam. His mother, Ana Débora, Miguel's second wife, died when Baruch was only six years old. Spinoza's mother tongue was Portuguese, although he also knew Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch, perhaps French, and later Latin. Although he wrote in Latin, Spinoza learned the language only late in his youth.

Spinoza had a traditional Jewish upbringing, attending the Keter Torah <a href="yeshiva">yeshiva</a> of the Amsterdam <a href="Talmud%20Torah">Talmud Torah</a> congregation headed by the learned and traditional senior Rabbi <a href="Saul%20Levi%20Morteira">Saul Levi Morteira</a>. His teachers also included the less-traditional Rabbi <a href="Manasseh%20ben%20Israel">Manasseh ben Israel</a>, "a man of wide learning and secular interests, a friend of <a href="Gerardus%20Vossius">Vossius</a>, <a href="Hugo%20Grotius">Grotius</a>, and <a href="Rembrandt%20Harmenszoon%20van%20Rijn">Rembrandt</a>". While presumably a star pupil, and perhaps considered as a potential rabbi, Spinoza never reached the advanced study of the Torah in the upper levels of the curriculum. Instead, at the age of 17, after the death of his elder brother, Isaac, he cut short his formal studies in order to begin working in the family importing business.

In 1653, at age 20, Spinoza began studying Latin with Francis van den Enden (<a href="Franciscus%20van%20den%20Enden">Franciscus van den Enden</a>), a notorious free thinker, former Jesuit, and radical democrat who likely introduced Spinoza to scholastic and <a href="modern%20philosophy">modern philosophy</a>, including that of Descartes. (A decade later, in the early 1660s, Van den Enden was considered to be a <a href="Cartesian%20dualism">Cartesian</a> and <a href="atheist">atheist</a>, and his books were put on the <a href="Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum">Catholic Index of Banned Books</a>.)

Spinoza's father, Miguel, died in 1654 when Spinoza was 21. He duly recited <a href="Kaddish">Kaddish</a>, the Jewish prayer of mourning, for eleven months as required by Jewish law. When his sister Rebekah disputed his inheritance, he took her to court to establish his claim, won his case, but then renounced his claim in her favour.

Spinoza adopted the Latin name Benedictus de Spinoza, began boarding with Van den Enden, and began teaching in his school. Following an anecdote in an early biography by Johannes Colerus, he is said to have fallen in love with his teacher's daughter, Clara, but she rejected him for a richer student. (This story has been discounted on the basis that Clara Maria van den Enden was born in 1643 and would have been no more than about 18 years old when Spinoza left Amsterdam. In 1671 she married <a href="Theodor%20Kerckring">Dirck Kerckring</a>.)

During this period Spinoza also became acquainted with the <a href="Collegiants">Collegiants</a>, an anti-clerical sect of <a href="Remonstrants">Remonstrants</a> with tendencies towards <a href="rationalism">rationalism</a>, and with the <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a>s who had existed for a century but were close to the Remonstrants. Many of his friends belonged to dissident Christian groups which met regularly as discussion groups and which typically rejected the authority of established churches as well as traditional dogmas.

Spinoza's break with the prevailing dogmas of Judaism, and particularly the insistence on non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, was not sudden; rather, it appears to have been the result of a lengthy internal struggle: "If anyone thinks my criticism [regarding the authorship of the Bible] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I would ask him to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty Apollo. For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery. Indeed, I may add that I write nothing here that is not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, I have felt bound in the end to embrace the views I here express."

Nevertheless, once branded as a heretic, Spinoza's clashes with authorities became more pronounced. For example, questioned by two members of his synagogue, Spinoza apparently responded that God has a body and nothing in scripture says otherwise. He was later attacked on the steps of the synagogue by a knife-wielding assailant shouting "Heretic!" He was apparently quite shaken by this attack and for years kept (and wore) his torn cloak, unmended, as a souvenir.

After his father's death in 1654, Spinoza and his younger brother Gabriel (Abraham) ran the family importing business. The business ran into serious financial difficulties, however, perhaps as a result of the <a href="First%20Anglo-Dutch%20War">First Anglo-Dutch War</a>. In March 1656, Spinoza filed suit with the Amsterdam municipal authorities to be declared an orphan in order to escape his father's business debts and so that he could inherit his mother's estate (which at first was incorporated into his father's estate) without it being subject to his father's creditors. In addition, after having made substantial contributions to the Talmud Torah synagogue in 1654 and 1655, he reduced his December 1655 contribution and his March 1656 pledge to nominal amounts (and the March 1656 pledge was never paid).

Spinoza was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his younger brother, Gabriel, and devote himself chiefly to the study of philosophy, especially the system expounded by <a href="Descartes">Descartes</a>, and to optics.

On 27 July 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued a writ of "<a href="Herem%20%28censure%29">cherem</a>" (Hebrew: , a kind of ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion, or <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a>) against the 23-year-old Spinoza. The following document translates the official record of the censure:

The Lords of the ma'amad, having long known of the evil opinions and acts of Baruch de Espinoza, have endeavoured by various means and promises, to turn him from his evil ways. But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary, daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which he practised and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and borne witness to this effect in the presence of the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter; and after all of this has been investigated in the presence of the honourable "chachamin" [sages], they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel. By the decree of the angels, and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza, with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of all the Holy Congregation, in front of these holy Scrolls with the <a href="613%20commandments">six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts</a> which are written therein, with the excommunication with which <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Jericho">banned Jericho</a>, with the curse with which <a href="Elisha%23Biography">Elisha</a> cursed the boys and with all the curses which are written in the pageRank.Book of the Law. Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up; cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in. The Lord will not spare him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon him all the curses which are written in this book, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of Israel with all the curses of the covenant, which are written in the pageRank.Book of the Law. But you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day. We order that no one should communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favour, or stay with him under the same roof, or within four <a href="ell">ell</a>s of him, or read anything composed or written by him.
The Talmud Torah congregation issued censure routinely, on matters great and small, so such an edict was not unusual. The language of Spinoza's censure is unusually harsh, however, and does not appear in any other censure known to have been issued by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam. The exact reason for expelling Spinoza is not stated. The censure refers only to the "abominable heresies that he practised and taught," to his "monstrous deeds," and to the testimony of witnesses "in the presence of the said Espinoza." There is no record of such testimony, but there appear to have been several likely reasons for the issuance of the censure.

First, there were Spinoza's radical theological views that he was apparently expressing in public. As philosopher and Spinoza biographer Steven Nadler puts it: "No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential God—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can there be any mystery as to why one of history's boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?"

Second, the Amsterdam Jewish community was largely composed of former "conversos" who had fled from the Portuguese Inquisition within the previous century, with their children and grandchildren. This community must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution or expulsion. There is little evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinoza's censure itself. But "in 1619, the town council expressly ordered [the Portuguese Jewish community] to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law." Other evidence makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind, such as bans adopted by the synagogue on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might "disturb the liberty we enjoy." Thus, the issuance of Spinoza's censure was almost certainly, in part, an exercise in self-censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.

Third, it appears likely that Spinoza had already taken the initiative to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his "Theological-Political Treatise" that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons, he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. He had also committed the "monstrous deed," contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of some rabbinical authorities (including <a href="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities—to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he is reported to have said: "Very well; this does not force me to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, had I not been afraid of a scandal." Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.

After the censure, Spinoza is said to have addressed an "Apology" (defence), written in Spanish, to the elders of the synagogue, "in which he defended his views as orthodox, and condemned the rabbis for accusing him of 'horrible practices and other enormities' merely because he had neglected ceremonial observances." This "Apology" <a href="Lost%20works">does not survive</a>, but some of its contents may later have been included in his "Theological-Political Treatise". For example, he cited a series of cryptic statements by medieval Biblical commentator <a href="Abraham%20ibn%20Ezra">Abraham ibn Ezra</a> intimating that some apparently anachronistic passages of the Pentateuch (i.e., "[t]he Canaanite was then in the land," Genesis 12:6, which ibn Ezra called a "mystery" and exhorted those "who understand[] it keep silent") were not of <a href="Mosaic%20authorship">Mosaic authorship</a> as proof that his own views had valid historical precedent.

The most remarkable aspect of the censure may be not so much its issuance, or even Spinoza's refusal to submit, but the fact that Spinoza's expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity. Spinoza kept the Latin (and so implicitly Christian) name Benedict de Spinoza, maintained a close association with the Collegiants, a Christian sect, even moved to a town near the Collegiants' headquarters, and was buried in a Christian graveyard—but there is no evidence or suggestion that he ever accepted baptism or participated in a Christian mass. Thus, by default, Baruch de Espinoza became the first secular Jew of modern Europe.

In September 2012, the Portugees-Israëlietische Gemeente te Amsterdam asked the chief rabbi of their community <a href="Haham%20Pinchas%20Toledano">Haham Pinchas Toledano</a> to reconsider the cherem after consulting several Spinoza experts. However he declined to remove it, citing Spinoza's "preposterous ideas, where he was tearing apart the very fundamentals of our religion".

Spinoza spent his remaining 21 years writing and studying as a private scholar.

Spinoza believed in a "Philosophy of tolerance and benevolence" and actually lived the life which he preached. He was criticized and ridiculed during his life and afterwards for his alleged atheism. However, even those who were against him "had to admit he lived a saintly life". Besides the religious controversies, nobody really had much bad to say about Spinoza other than, "he sometimes enjoyed watching spiders chase flies".

After the cherem, the Amsterdam municipal authorities expelled Spinoza from Amsterdam, "responding to the appeals of the rabbis, and also of the Calvinist clergy, who had been vicariously offended by the existence of a free thinker in the synagogue". He spent a brief time in or near the village of <a href="Ouderkerk%20aan%20de%20Amstel">Ouderkerk aan de Amstel</a>, but returned soon afterwards to Amsterdam and lived there quietly for several years, giving private philosophy lessons and grinding lenses, before leaving the city in 1660 or 1661.

During this time in Amsterdam, Spinoza wrote his "Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being", which he never published in his lifetime—assuming with good reason that it might get suppressed. Two Dutch translations of it survive, discovered about 1810."

Spinoza moved around 1660 or 1661 from Amsterdam to <a href="Rijnsburg">Rijnsburg</a>, (near <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a>), the headquarters of the Collegiants. In Rijnsburg, he began work on his "Descartes' "Principles of Philosophy"" as well as on his masterpiece, the "Ethics". In 1663, he returned briefly to Amsterdam, where he finished and published "Descartes' "Principles of Philosophy,"" the only work published in his lifetime under his own name, and then moved the same year to <a href="Voorburg">Voorburg</a>.

In Voorburg, Spinoza continued work on the "Ethics" and corresponded with scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout Europe. He also wrote and published his "Theological Political Treatise" in 1670, in defence of secular and constitutional government, and in support of <a href="Johan%20de%20Witt">Jan de Witt</a>, the Grand Pensionary of the Netherlands, against the Stadholder, the Prince of Orange. <a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Leibniz</a> visited Spinoza and claimed that Spinoza's life was in danger when supporters of the <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">Prince of Orange</a> murdered de Witt in 1672. While published anonymously, the work did not long remain so, and de Witt's enemies characterized it as "forged in Hell by a renegade Jew and the Devil, and issued with the knowledge of Jan de Witt." It was condemned in 1673 by the Synod of the Reformed Church and formally banned in 1674.

Spinoza earned a modest living from lens-grinding and instrument making, yet he was involved in important optical investigations of the day while living in Voorburg, through correspondence and friendships with scientist <a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a> and mathematician <a href="Johannes%20Hudde">Johannes Hudde</a>, including debate over microscope design with Huygens, favouring small objectives and collaborating on calculations for a prospective 40 ft telescope which would have been one of the largest in Europe at the time. The quality of Spinoza's lenses was much praised by Christiaan Huygens, among others. In fact, his technique and instruments were so esteemed that <a href="Constantijn%20Huygens%2C%20Jr.">Constantijn Huygens</a> ground a "clear and bright" 42 ft. telescope lens in 1687 from one of Spinoza's grinding dishes, ten years after his death. The exact type of lenses that Spinoza made are not known, but very likely included lenses for both the microscope and telescope. He was said by anatomist <a href="Theodor%20Kerckring">Theodor Kerckring</a> to have produced an "excellent" microscope, the quality of which was the foundation of Kerckring's anatomy claims. During his time as a lens and instrument maker, he was also supported by small but regular donations from close friends.

In 1670, Spinoza moved to <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> where he lived on a small pension from Jan de Witt and a small annuity from the brother of his dead friend, Simon de Vries. He worked on the "Ethics", wrote an unfinished Hebrew grammar, began his "Political Treatise", wrote two scientific essays ("On the Rainbow" and "On the Calculation of Chances"), and began a Dutch translation of the Bible (which he later <a href="pageRank.Book%20burning">destroyed</a>).

Spinoza chose for his device the Latin word "caute" ("cautiously"), inscribed beneath a rose, itself a symbol of secrecy. "For, having chosen to write in a language that was so widely intelligible, he was compelled to hide what he had written."

Spinoza was offered the chair of philosophy at the <a href="University%20of%20Heidelberg">University of Heidelberg</a>, but he refused it, perhaps because of the possibility that it might in some way curb his <a href="freedom%20of%20thought">freedom of thought</a>.

In 1676, Spinoza met with Leibniz at The Hague for a discussion of his principal philosophical work, "<a href="Ethics%20%28Spinoza%29">Ethics</a>", which had been completed in 1676. This meeting was described in <a href="Matthew%20Stewart%20%28philosopher%29">Matthew Stewart</a>'s "The Courtier and the Heretic".

Spinoza's health began to fail in 1676, and he died on 20 February 1677 at the age of 44. His premature death was said to be due to lung illness, possibly <a href="silicosis">silicosis</a> as a result of breathing in glass dust from the lenses that he ground. Later, a shrine was made of his home in The Hague.

Textbooks and encyclopaedias often depict Spinoza as a solitary soul who eked out a living as a lens grinder; in reality, he had many friends but kept his needs to a minimum. He preached a philosophy of tolerance and benevolence. <a href="Anthony%20Gottlieb">Anthony Gottlieb</a> described him as living "a saintly life." Reviewer M. Stuart Phelps noted, "No one has ever come nearer to the ideal life of the philosopher than Spinoza." <a href="Harold%20Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> wrote, "As a teacher of reality, he practised his own wisdom, and was surely one of the most exemplary human beings ever to have lived." According to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>": "In outward appearance he was unpretending, but not careless. His way of living was exceedingly modest and retired; often he did not leave his room for many days together. He was likewise almost incredibly frugal; his expenses sometimes amounted only to a few pence a day." Bloom writes of Spinoza, "He appears to have had no sexual life."

Spinoza also corresponded with <a href="Peter%20Serrarius">Peter Serrarius</a>, a radical Protestant and <a href="Millennarianism">millennarian</a> merchant. Serrarius was a patron to Spinoza after Spinoza left the Jewish community and even had letters sent and received for the philosopher to and from third parties. Spinoza and Serrarius maintained their relationship until Serrarius' death in 1669. By the beginning of the 1660s, Spinoza's name became more widely known, and eventually Gottfried Leibniz and <a href="Henry%20Oldenburg">Henry Oldenburg</a> paid him visits, as stated in Matthew Stewart's "The Courtier and the Heretic". Spinoza corresponded with Oldenburg for the rest of his short life.

The writings of <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> have been described as "Spinoza's starting point." Spinoza's first publication was his geometric exposition (proofs using the geometric method on the model of Euclid with definitions, axioms, etc.) of Descartes's Parts I and II of "Principles of Philosophy" (1663). Spinoza has been associated with Leibniz and Descartes as "rationalists" in contrast to "empiricists."

Spinoza engaged in correspondence from December 1664 to June 1665 with <a href="Willem%20van%20Blijenbergh">Willem van Blijenbergh</a>, an amateur <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> theologian, who questioned Spinoza on the definition of <a href="evil">evil</a>. Later in 1665, Spinoza notified Oldenburg that he had started to work on a new book, the "<a href="Theologico-Political%20Treatise">Theologico-Political Treatise</a>", published in 1670. Leibniz disagreed harshly with Spinoza in his own manuscript "Refutation of Spinoza," but he is also known to have met with Spinoza on at least one occasion (as mentioned above), and his own work bears some striking resemblances to specific important parts of Spinoza's philosophy (see: <a href="Monadology">Monadology</a>).

When the public reactions to the anonymously published "Theologico-Political Treatise" were extremely unfavourable to his brand of Cartesianism, Spinoza was compelled to abstain from publishing more of his works. Wary and independent, he wore a <a href="signet%20ring">signet ring</a> which he used to mark his letters and which was engraved with a rose and the word "caute" (Latin for "cautiously").

The "Ethics" and all other works, apart from the "Descartes' Principles of Philosophy" and the "Theologico-Political Treatise", were published after his death in the "<a href="Opera%20Posthuma">Opera Posthuma</a>", edited by his friends in secrecy to avoid confiscation and destruction of manuscripts. The "Ethics" contains many still-unresolved obscurities and is written with a forbidding mathematical structure modelled on Euclid's geometry and has been described as a "superbly cryptic masterwork."

Spinoza argued that God exists and is abstract and impersonal. Spinoza's view of God is what <a href="Charles%20Hartshorne">Charles Hartshorne</a> describes as <a href="Classical%20Pantheism">Classical Pantheism</a>. Spinoza has also been described as an "Epicurean materialist," specifically in reference to his opposition to Cartesian mind-body dualism. This view was held by Epicureans before him, as they believed that atoms with their probabilistic paths were the only substance that existed fundamentally. Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, in contrast to the Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical <a href="thought">thought</a>, offering powerful weapons for prevailing against "received authority." He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality, namely a single, fundamental <a href="Substance%20theory">substance</a> (meaning "that which stands beneath" rather than "matter") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser "entities" are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause and effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published "Ethics." Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind–body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then it is not clear how they can coordinate in any manner. Humans presume themselves to have <a href="free%20will">free will</a>, he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons why they want and act as they do.

Spinoza contends that ""Deus sive Natura"" is a being of infinitely many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His account of the nature of reality, then, seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same substance. It is important to note here that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the "Ethics", Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors. He directly contests dualism. The universal substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different attributes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the <a href="mind%E2%80%93body%20problem">mind–body problem</a> known as <a href="neutral%20monism">neutral monism</a>. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence in which God can make changes, but a God which itself is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. Spinoza argues that "things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,"; he directly challenges a transcendental God which actively responds to events in the universe. Everything that has and will happen is a part of a long chain of cause and effect which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change. No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God. Only knowledge of God, or the existence which humans inhabit, allows them to best respond to the world around them.
Not only is it impossible for two infinite substances to exist (two infinities being absurd), God—being the ultimate substance—cannot be affected by anything else, or else it would be affected by something else, and not be the fundamental substance.

Spinoza was a thoroughgoing <a href="determinism">determinist</a> who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of <a href="Need">necessity</a>. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand "why" we act as we do. By forming more "adequate" ideas about what we do and our emotions or <a href="Affect%20%28philosophy%29">affections</a>, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.
Therefore, humans have no free will. They believe, however, that their will is free. This illusionary perception of freedom stems from our human consciousness, experience, and indifference to prior natural causes. Humans think they are free but they ″dream with their eyes open″. For Spinoza, our actions are guided entirely by natural impulses. In his letter to G. H. Schuller (Letter 58), he wrote: "men are conscious of their desire and unaware of the causes by which [their desires] are determined."

This picture of Spinoza's determinism is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in "Ethics": ″the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience that we have a false ideal of choice predicated upon this.

Spinoza's philosophy has much in common with <a href="Stoicism">Stoicism</a> inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness. However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that <a href="reason">reason</a> could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>'s <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>.

Spinoza shared ethical beliefs with ancient Epicureans, in renouncing ethics beyond the material world, although Epicureans focused more on physical pleasure and Spinoza more on emotional wellbeing. Encapsulated at the start in his "Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding" ("Tractatus de intellectus emendatione") is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good. Spinoza held good and evil to be <a href="relativism">relative</a> concepts, claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity. Things that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply good or bad for humans. Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which "All things in nature proceed from certain [definite] necessity and with the utmost perfection." Nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and nothing is <a href="Contingency%20%28philosophy%29">contingent</a>.

Given Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where "necessity" reigns, <a href="Good%20and%20evil">Good and Evil</a> have no absolute meaning. The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception.

In the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God or Nature. According to Spinoza, reality is perfection. If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality. While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence. Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful, is inadequate for discovering truth. His concept of "<a href="conatus">conatus</a>" states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being, and asserts that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine. According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe.

Also in the "Ethics", Spinoza discusses his beliefs about what he considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions. The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences. More precisely, this first type of knowledge can be known as the knowledge of things that could be “mutilated, confused, and without order.” Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning. Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a “passive” state. This type of “passive mind” that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.
Spinoza’s second knowledge involves reasoning plus emotions. He explains that this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes that have to do with anything common to the human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.
Spinoza defines the third and final knowledge as the knowledge of God, which requires rationality and reason of the mind. In more detail, Spinoza uses this type of knowledge to join together the essence of God with the individual essence. This knowledge is also formed from any adequate causes that include perfect virtue. 

In the final part of the "<a href="Ethics%20%28Spinoza%29">Ethics</a>", his concern with the meaning of "true blessedness", and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external causes in order to master them, foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s. His concept of three types of knowledge—opinion, reason, intuition—and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal.

It is a widespread belief that Spinoza equated God with the material universe. He has therefore been called the "prophet" and "prince" and most eminent expounder of <a href="pantheism">pantheism</a>. More specifically, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg he states, "as to the view of certain people that I identify God with Nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken". For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a "mode" under two "attributes" of Thought and <a href="Extension%20%28metaphysics%29">Extension</a>. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world.

According to German philosopher <a href="Karl%20Jaspers">Karl Jaspers</a> (1883–1969), when Spinoza wrote in ' (Latin for 'God or Nature'), Spinoza meant God was ' (nature doing what nature does; literally, 'nature naturing'), not "" (nature already created; literally, 'nature natured'). Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence. Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course "divisible"; it has parts. But Spinoza said, "no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided", meaning that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance. He also said, "a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13). Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, according to Jaspers, the pantheist formula "One and All" would apply to Spinoza only if the "One" preserves its transcendence and the "All" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.

<a href="Martial%20Gu%C3%A9roult">Martial Guéroult</a> (1891–1976) suggested the term "<a href="panentheism">panentheism</a>", rather than "pantheism" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, "in" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God. However, American panentheist philosopher <a href="Charles%20Hartshorne">Charles Hartshorne</a> (1897–2000) insisted on the term <a href="Classical%20Pantheism">Classical Pantheism</a> to describe Spinoza's view.

In 1785, <a href="Friedrich%20Heinrich%20Jacobi">Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi</a> published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after <a href="Gotthold%20Ephraim%20Lessing">Gotthold Lessing</a> was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a "Spinozist", which was the equivalent in his time of being called an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended <a href="Substance%20theory">substance</a>. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. <a href="Moses%20Mendelssohn">Moses Mendelssohn</a> disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between <a href="theism">theism</a> and pantheism. The issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late 18th-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
By 1879, Spinoza’s pantheism was praised by many, but was considered by some to be alarming and dangerously inimical.

Spinoza's "God or Nature" ("Deus sive Natura") provided a living, natural God, in contrast to <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s <a href="first%20cause%20argument">first cause argument</a> and the dead mechanism of <a href="Julien%20Offray%20de%20La%20Mettrie">Julien Offray de La Mettrie</a>'s (1709–1751) work, "<a href="Man%20a%20Machine">Man a Machine</a>" (")". Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a "religion of nature". <a href="Novalis">Novalis</a> called him the "God-intoxicated man". Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay "<a href="The%20Necessity%20of%20Atheism">The Necessity of Atheism</a>".

Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word "God" (Deus) to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. "Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law..." Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.

According to the "<a href="Stanford%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Philosophy">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>", Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect” ("Ethics" 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), and capable of loving both himself—and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends "amor intellectualis dei" (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).

<a href="Steven%20Nadler">Steven Nadler</a> suggests that settling the question of Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God is not one of reverence or religious awe, but instead one of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open to the possibility of error and superstition.

Similarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authors. The 19th-century German Sanskritist <a href="Theodore%20Goldst%C3%BCcker">Theodore Goldstücker</a> was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the <a href="Vedanta">Vedanta</a> tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was ... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.

<a href="Max%20Muller">Max Muller</a>, in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying "the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'." <a href="Helena%20Blavatsky">Helena Blavatsky</a>, a founder of the <a href="Theosophical%20Society">Theosophical Society</a> also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay "As to Spinoza's Deity—natura naturans—conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity—as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct out-flowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple."

Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries grew even more interested in Spinoza, often from a left-wing or <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a> perspective. <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> liked Spinoza's account of the universe, interpreting it as <a href="Materialism">materialistic</a>. Notable philosophers <a href="Louis%20Althusser">Louis Althusser</a>, <a href="Gilles%20Deleuze">Gilles Deleuze</a>, <a href="Antonio%20Negri">Antonio Negri</a> and <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Balibar">Étienne Balibar</a> have each drawn upon Spinoza's philosophy. Deleuze's doctoral thesis, published in 1968, calls him "the prince of philosophers". <a href="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> esteemed few philosophers, but he esteemed Spinoza. However, Nietzsche never read Spinoza's works themselves, but learned about Spinoza from <a href="Kuno%20Fischer">Kuno Fischer</a>'s "History of Modern Philosophy".

When <a href="George%20Santayana">George Santayana</a> graduated from college, he published an essay, "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", in "The Harvard Monthly". Later, he wrote an introduction to "Spinoza's Ethics and "De intellectus emendatione"". In 1932, Santayana was invited to present an essay (published as "Ultimate Religion") at a meeting at <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> celebrating the tricentennial of Spinoza's birth. In Santayana's autobiography, he characterized Spinoza as his "master and model" in understanding the naturalistic basis of morality.

Philosopher <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by <a href="G.%20E.%20Moore">G. E. Moore</a>) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, "<a href="Tractatus%20Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a>", an allusion to Spinoza's "<a href="Tractatus%20Theologico-Politicus">Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</a>". Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression "<a href="sub%20specie%20aeternitatis">sub specie aeternitatis</a>" from Spinoza ("Notebooks, 1914-16", p. 83). The structure of his "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" does have some structural affinities with Spinoza's "Ethics" (though, admittedly, not with the latter's own "Tractatus") in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical assertions and principles. Furthermore, in propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, stating that "If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present." (6.4311) "The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole." (6.45)

<a href="Leo%20Strauss">Leo Strauss</a> dedicated his first book, "Spinoza's Critique of Religion", to an examination of the latter's ideas. In the book, Strauss identified Spinoza as part of the tradition of Enlightenment rationalism that eventually produced Modernity. Moreover, he identifies Spinoza and his works as the beginning of Jewish Modernity. More recently <a href="Jonathan%20Israel">Jonathan Israel</a> argued that, from 1650 to 1750, Spinoza was "the chief challenger of the fundamentals of revealed religion, received ideas, tradition, morality, and what was everywhere regarded, in absolutist and non-absolutist states alike, as divinely constituted political authority."

Spinoza has had influence beyond the confines of philosophy.

Being

Being is an extremely broad concept encompassing <a href="Objectivity%20%28philosophy%29">objective</a> and <a href="Subjectivity">subjective</a> features of <a href="reality">reality</a> and <a href="existence">existence</a>. Anything that partakes in being is also called a "being", though often this usage is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression "<a href="human%20being">human being</a>"). The notion of "being" has, inevitably, been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in Western philosophy with attempts among the <a href="pre-Socratics">pre-Socratics</a> to deploy it intelligibly.

As an example of efforts in recent times, <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a> (who himself drew on ancient Greek sources) adopted after German terms like "<a href="Dasein">Dasein</a>" to articulate the topic. Several modern approaches build on such continental European exemplars as Heidegger, and apply metaphysical results to the understanding of human psychology and the human condition generally (notably in the <a href="Existentialism">Existentialist</a> tradition).

By contrast, in mainstream <a href="Analytical%20philosophy">Analytical philosophy</a> the topic is more confined to abstract investigation, in the work of such influential theorists as <a href="W.%20V.%20O.%20Quine">W. V. O. Quine</a>, to name one of many. One most fundamental question that continues to exercise philosophers is put by <a href="William%20James">William James</a>: "How comes the world to be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its place? ... from nothing to being there is no logical bridge."

The deficit of such a bridge was first encountered in history by the <a href="Pre-Socratic%20philosophy">Pre-Socratic philosophers</a> during the process of evolving a classification of all beings (noun). Aristotle, who wrote after the Pre-Socratics, applies the term <a href="Categories%20%28Aristotle%29">category</a> (perhaps not originally) to ten highest-level classes. They comprise one category of substance (<a href="ousia">ousia</a>e) existing independently (man, tree) and nine categories of accidents, which can only exist in something else (time, place). In Aristotle, substances are to be clarified by stating their <a href="definition">definition</a>: a note expressing a larger class (the genus) followed by further notes expressing <a href="Differentia">specific difference</a>s (differentiae) within the class. The substance so defined was a species. For example, the species, man, may be defined as an animal (genus) that is rational (difference). As the difference is potential within the genus; that is, an animal may or may not be rational, the difference is not identical to, and may be distinct from, the genus.

Applied to being, the system fails to arrive at a definition for the simple reason that no difference can be found. The species, the genus, and the difference are all equally being: a being is a being that is being. The genus cannot be nothing because nothing is not a class of everything. The trivial solution that being is being added to nothing is only a <a href="tautology%20%28logic%29">tautology</a>: being is being. There is no simpler intermediary between being and non-being that explains and classifies being.
Pre-Socratic reaction to this deficit was varied. As <a href="Substance%20theory">substance theorists</a> they accepted <a href="A%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori">a priori</a> the hypothesis that appearances are deceiving, that reality is to be reached through reasoning. <a href="Parmenides">Parmenides</a> reasoned that if everything is identical to being and being is a category of the same thing then there can be neither differences between things nor any change. To be different, or to change, would amount to <a href="Becoming%20%28philosophy%29">becoming</a> or being non-being; that is, not existing. Therefore, being is a homogeneous and non-differentiated sphere and the appearance of beings is illusory. <a href="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, on the other hand, foreshadowed modern thought by denying existence. Reality does not exist, it flows, and beings are an illusion upon the flow.

<a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> knew of this tradition when he began his "Metaphysics", and had already drawn his own conclusion, which he presented under the guise of asking what being is:"And indeed the question which was raised of old is raised now and always, and is always the subject of doubt, viz., what being is, is just the question, what is substance? For it is this that some assert to be one, others more than one, and that some assert to be limited in number, others unlimited. And so we also must consider chiefly and primarily and almost exclusively what that is which is in this sense."

and reiterates in no uncertain terms: "Nothing, then, which is not a species of a genus will have an essence – only species will have it ...". Being, however, for Aristotle, is not a genus.

One might expect a solution to follow from such certain language but none does. Instead Aristotle launches into a rephrasing of the problem, the <a href="Potentiality%20and%20actuality">Theory of Act and Potency</a>. In the definition of man as a two-legged animal Aristotle presumes that "two-legged" and "animal" are parts of other beings, but as far as man is concerned, are only potentially man. At the point where they are united into a single being, man, the being, becomes actual, or real. Unity is the basis of actuality: "... 'being' is being combined and one, and 'not being' is being not combined but more than one." Actuality has taken the place of existence, but Aristotle is no longer seeking to know what the actual is; he accepts it without question as something generated from the potential. He has found a "half-being" or a "pre-being", the potency, which is fully being as part of some other substance. Substances, in Aristotle, unite what they actually are now with everything they might become.

Some of Thomas Aquinas' propositions were reputedly condemned by Étienne Tempier, the local Bishop of Paris (not the Papal Magisterium itself) in 1270 and 1277, but his dedication to the use of philosophy to elucidate theology was so thorough that he was proclaimed a <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctor of the Church</a> in 1568. Those who adopt it are called <a href="Thomism">Thomists</a>.

In a single sentence, parallel to Aristotle's statement asserting that being is substance, St. Thomas pushes away from the Aristotelian doctrine: "Being is not a genus, since it is not predicated univocally but only analogically." His term for analogy is Latin "analogia". In the categorical classification of all beings, all substances are partly the same: man and chimpanzee are both animals and the animal part in man is "the same" as the animal part in chimpanzee. Most fundamentally all substances are matter, a theme taken up by science, which postulated one or more matters, such as earth, air, fire or water (<a href="Empedocles">Empedocles</a>). In today's chemistry the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in a chimpanzee are identical to the same elements in a man.

The original text reads, ""Although equivocal predications must be reduced to univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal cause of the whole species, as for instance the sun is the cause of the generation of all men; whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient cause of the whole species (otherwise it would be the cause of itself, since it is contained in the species), but is a particular cause of this individual which it places under the species by way of participation. Therefore the universal cause of the whole species is not an univocal agent; and the universal cause comes before the particular cause. But this universal agent, whilst it is not univocal, nevertheless is not altogether equivocal, otherwise it could not produce its own likeness, but rather it is to be called an analogical agent, as all univocal predications are reduced to one first non-univocal analogical predication, which is being.""

If substance is the highest category and there is no substance, being, then the unity perceived in all beings by virtue of their existing must be viewed in another way. St. Thomas chose the analogy: all beings are like, or analogous to, each other in existing. This comparison is the basis of his Analogy of Being. The analogy is said of being in many different ways, but the key to it is the real distinction between existence and essence. Existence is the principle that gives reality to an essence not the same in any way as the existence: "If things having essences are real, and it is not of their essence to be, then the reality of these things must be found in some principle other than (really distinct from) their essence." Substance can be real or not. What makes an individual substance – a man, a tree, a planet – real is a distinct act, a "to be", which actuates its unity. An analogy of proportion is therefore possible: "essence is related to existence as potency is related to act."

Existences are not things; they do not themselves exist, they lend themselves to essences, which do not intrinsically have them. They have no nature; an existence receives its nature from the essence it actuates. Existence is not being; it gives being – here a customary phrase is used, existence is a principle (a source) of being, not a previous source, but one which is continually in effect. The stage is set for the concept of God as the cause of all existence, who, as the Almighty, holds everything actual without reason or explanation as an act purely of will.

Aristotle's classificatory scheme had included the five <a href="predicables">predicables</a>, or characteristics that might be predicated of a substance. One of these was the <a href="Property%20%28philosophy%29">property</a>, an essential universal true of the species, but not in the definition (in modern terms, some examples would be grammatical language, a property of man, or a spectral pattern characteristic of an element, both of which are defined in other ways). Pointing out that predicables are predicated <a href="Univocity">univocally</a> of substances; that is, they refer to "the same thing" found in each instance, St. Thomas argued that whatever can be said about being is not univocal, because all beings are unique, each actuated by a unique existence. It is the analogous possession of an existence that allows them to be identified as being; therefore, being is an analogous predication.

Whatever can be predicated of all things is universal-like but not universal, category-like but not a category. St. Thomas called them (perhaps not originally) the "transcendentia", "<a href="transcendentals">transcendentals</a>", because they "climb above" the categories, just as being climbs above substance. Later academics also referred to them as "the properties of being." The number is generally three or four.

The nature of "being" has also been debated and explored in <a href="Islamic%20philosophy">Islamic philosophy</a>, notably by <a href="Ibn%20Sina">Ibn Sina</a> (<a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>), <a href="Suhrawardi%20Maqtul">Suhrawardi</a>, and <a href="Mulla%20Sadra">Mulla Sadra</a>. <a href="Indo-European%20copula">A modern linguistic approach</a> which notices that <a href="Persian%20language">Persian language</a> has exceptionally developed two kinds of "<a href="Indo-European%20copula">is</a>"es, i.e. "ast" ("is", as a <a href="Copula%20%28linguistics%29">copula</a>) and "hast" (as an existential "is") examines the linguistic properties of the two lexemes in the first place, then evaluates how the statements made by other languages with regard to "being" can stand the test of Persian frame of reference.

It is noticed that the original language of the source, e.g. <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a> and <a href="English%20language">English</a>, has only one word for two concepts, "ast" and "hast", or, like <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>, has no word at all for either word. It therefore exploits the Persian "hast" (existential "is") versus "ast" (predicative "is" or <a href="Copula%20%28linguistics%29">copula</a>) to address both Western and Islamic ontological arguments on "being" and "existence".

This linguistic method shows the scope of confusion created by languages which cannot differentiate between existential be and copula. It manifests, for instance, that the main theme of <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Heidegger</a>'s "<a href="Being%20and%20Time">Being and Time</a>" is "astī" (is-ness) rather than "hastī" (existence). When, in the beginning of his book, <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Heidegger</a> claims that people always talk about existence in their everyday language, without knowing what it means, the example he resorts to is: "the sky "is" blue" which in Persian can be ONLY translated with the use of the copula "ast", and says nothing about "being" or "existence".

In the same manner, the linguistic method addresses the ontological works written in Arabic. Since <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>, like <a href="Latin">Latin</a> in Europe, had become the official language of philosophical and scientific works in the so-called Islamic World, the early Persian or Arab philosophers had difficulty discussing "being" or "existence", since the <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic language</a>, like other Semitic languages, had no verb for either predicative "be" (<a href="Copula%20%28linguistics%29">copula</a>) or existential "be". So if you try to translate the aforementioned <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Heidegger</a>'s example into Arabic it appears as السماء زرقاء (viz. "The Sky-- blue") with no linking "is" to be a sign of existential statement. To overcome the problem, when translating the <a href="ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">ancient Greek philosophy</a>, certain words were coined like ایس "aysa" (from Arabic لیس "laysa" 'not') for '<a href="Indo-European%20copula">is</a>'. Eventually the Arabic verb وجد "wajada" (to find) prevailed, since it was thought that whatever is existent, is to be ""found"" in the world. Hence "existence" or Being was called وجود "wujud" (Cf. <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a> "finns" [found]> there exist; also the <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> coinage of "exsistere" 'standing out (there in the world)' > appear> exist). Now, with regard to the fact that Persian, as the mother tongue of both <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> and <a href="Mulla%20Sadra">Sadrā</a>, was in conflict with either Greek or Arabic in this regard, these philosophers should have been warned implicitly by their mother tongue not to confuse two kinds of linguistic beings (viz. <a href="Copula%20%28linguistics%29">copula</a> vs. existential). In fact when analyzed thoroughly, <a href="Copula%20%28linguistics%29">copula</a>, or Persian "ast" ('is') indicates an ever-moving chain of relations with no fixed "entity" to hold onto (every "entity", say A, will be dissolved into "A is B" and so on, as soon as one tries to define it). Therefore, the whole reality or what we see as existence ("found" in our world) resembles an ever-changing world of "astī" (is-ness) flowing in time and space. On the other hand, while Persian "ast" can be considered as the 3rd person singular of the verb 'to be', there is no verb but an arbitrary one supporting "hast" ('is' as an existential be= exists) has neither future nor past tense and nor a negative form of its own: "hast" is just a single untouchable lexeme. It needs no other linguistic element to be complete ("Hast." is a complete sentence meaning "s/he it exists"). In fact, any manipulation of the arbitrary verb, e.g. its conjugation, turns "hast" back into a copula.

Eventually from such linguistic analyses, it appears that while "astī" (is-ness) would resemble the world of <a href="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, "hastī" (existence) would rather approaches a metaphysical concept resembling the <a href="Parmenides">Parmenidas</a>'s interpretation of "existence".

In this regard, <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>, who was a firm follower of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, could not accept either Heraclitian "is-ness" (where only constant was "change"), nor Parmenidean "monist immoveable existence" (the "hastī" itself being constant). To solve the contradiction, it so appeared to Philosophers of Islamic world that <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> considered the core of existence (i.e. its "<a href="Substance%20theory">substance</a>"/"<a href="essence">essence</a>") as a fixed constant, while its facade (<a href="Accident%20%28philosophy%29">accident</a>) was prone to change. To translate such a philosophical image into Persian it is like having "hastī" (existence) as a unique constant core covered by "astī" (is-ness) as a cloud of ever-changing relationships. It is clear that the Persian language, deconstructs such a composite as a sheer mirage, since it is not clear how to link the interior core (existence) with the exterior shell (is-ness). Furthermore, "hast" cannot be linked to anything but itself (as it is self-referent).

The argument has a theological echos as well: assuming that God is the "Existence", beyond time and space, a question is raised by philosophers of the Islamic world as how he, as a transcendental existence, may ever create or contact a world of "is-ness" in space-time.

However, <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> who was more philosopher than theologian, followed the same line of argumentation as that of his ancient master, <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and tried to reconcile between "ast" and "hast", by considering the latter as higher order of existence than the former. It is like a hierarchical order of existence. It was a philosophical <a href="Tower%20of%20Babel">Tower of Babel</a> that the restriction of his own mother tongue (Persian) would not allow to be built, but he could maneuver in Arabic by giving the two concepts the same name "wujud", although with different attributes. So, implicitly, "astī" (is-ness) appears as ممکن الوجود "momken-al-wujud" (contingent being), and "hastī" (existence) as واجب الوجود "wājeb-al-wujud" (necessary being).

On the other hand, centuries later, <a href="Mulla%20Sadra">Sadrā</a>, chose a more radical route, by inclining towards the reality of "astī" (is-ness), as the true mode of existence, and tried to get rid of the concept of "hastī" (existence as fixed or immovable). Thus, in his philosophy, the universal movement penetrates deep into the <a href="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian</a> "<a href="Substance%20theory">substance</a>"/"<a href="essence">essence</a>", in unison with changing <a href="Accident%20%28philosophy%29">accident</a>. He called this deep existential change حرکت جوهری "harekat-e jowhari" (Substantial Movement). It is obvious that in such a changing existence, the whole world has to go through instantaneous annihilation and recreation incessantly, while as <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> had predicted in his remarks on Nature, such a universal change or substantial movement would eventually entail the shortening and lengthening of time as well which has never been observed. This logical objection, which was made on Aristotle's argumentation, could not be answered in the ancient times or medieval age, but now it does not sound contradictory to the real nature of Time (as addressed in relativity theory), so by a reverse argument, a philosopher may indeed deduce that everything is changing (moving) even in the deepest core of Being.

Although innovated in the late <a href="medieval">medieval</a> period, Thomism was dogmatized in the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. From roughly 1277 to 1567, it dominated the philosophic landscape. The <a href="rationalist">rationalist</a> philosophers, however, with a new emphasis on <a href="Reason">Reason</a> as a tool of the intellect, brought the classical and medieval traditions under new scrutiny, exercising a new concept of <a href="doubt">doubt</a>, with varying outcomes. Foremost among the new doubters were the <a href="Empiricism">empiricists</a>, the advocates of <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>, with its emphasis on <a href="experiment">experiment</a>ation and reliance on evidence gathered from sensory experience. In parallel with the <a href="revolution">revolution</a>s against rising political <a href="Absolutism%20%28European%20history%29">absolutism</a> based on <a href="established%20religion">established religion</a> and the replacement of <a href="faith">faith</a> by reasonable faith, new systems of metaphysics were promulgated in the lecture halls by charismatic professors, such as <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, and <a href="Hegel">Hegel</a>. The late 19th and 20th centuries featured an emotional return to the concept of existence under the name of <a href="existentialism">existentialism</a>. These philosophers were concerned mainly with ethics and religion. The metaphysical side became the domain of the <a href="phenomenalism">phenomenalists</a>. In parallel with these philosophies Thomism continued under the protection of the Catholic Church; in particular, the <a href="Jesuit%20order">Jesuit order</a>.

<a href="Rationalism">Rationalism</a> and <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a> have had many definitions, most concerned with specific schools of philosophy or groups of philosophers in particular countries, such as Germany. In general rationalism is the predominant school of thought in the multi-national, cross-cultural <a href="Age%20of%20reason">Age of reason</a>, which began in the century straddling 1600 as a conventional date, empiricism is the reliance on sensory data gathered in experimentation by scientists of any country, who, in the Age of Reason were rationalists. An early professed empiricist, <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>, known as an eccentric denizen of the court of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II of England</a> (an "old bear"), published in 1651 "<a href="Leviathan%20%28book%29">Leviathan</a>", a political treatise written during the <a href="English%20civil%20war">English civil war</a>, containing an early <a href="manifesto">manifesto</a> in English of rationalism.
Hobbes said:"The Latines called Accounts of mony Rationes ... and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in all other things...When a man reasoneth hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall ... For Reason ... is nothing but Reckoning ... of the consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts ..."
In Hobbes reasoning is the right process of drawing conclusions from definitions (the "names agreed upon"). He goes on to define error as self-contradiction of definition ("an absurdity, or senselesse Speech") or conclusions that do not follow the definitions on which they are supposed to be based. Science, on the other hand, is the outcome of "right reasoning," which is based on "natural sense and imagination", a kind of sensitivity to nature, as "nature it selfe cannot erre."

Having chosen his ground carefully Hobbes launches an <a href="Epistemology">epistemological</a> attack on <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>. The academic philosophers had arrived at the <a href="Hylomorphism%20%28Aristotelian%29">Theory of Matter and Form</a> from consideration of certain natural <a href="paradox">paradox</a>es subsumed under the general heading of the Unity Problem. For example, a body appears to be one thing and yet it is distributed into many parts. Which is it, one or many? Aristotle had arrived at the real distinction between <a href="Matter%20%28philosophy%29">matter</a> and <a href="Substantial%20form">form</a>, metaphysical components whose interpenetration produces the paradox. The whole unity comes from the substantial form and the distribution into parts from the matter. Inhering in the parts giving them really distinct unities are the <a href="Accident%20%28philosophy%29">accidental forms</a>. The unity of the whole being is actuated by another really distinct principle, the existence.

If nature cannot err, then there are no paradoxes in it; to Hobbes, the paradox is a form of the absurd, which is inconsistency: "Natural sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity" and "For error is but a deception ... But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd ..." Among Hobbes examples are "round quadrangle", "immaterial substance", "free subject." Of the scholastics he says:"Yet they will have us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at one and the same time in many places [the problem of the universals]; and many bodies at one and the same time in one place [the whole and the parts]; ... And these are but a small part of the Incongruencies they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, instead of admiring, and adoring of the Divine and Incomprehensible Nature ..."

The real distinction between essence and existence, and that between form and matter, which served for so long as the basis of metaphysics, Hobbes identifies as "the Error of Separated Essences." The words "Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like" add no meaning to an argument nor do derived words such as "Entity, Essence, Essentially, Essentiality", which "are the names of nothing" but are mere "Signes" connecting "one name or attribute to another: as when we say, ""a man is a living body"", we mean not that the "man" is one thing, the "living body" another, and the "is", or "being" a third: but that the "man", and the "living body", is the same thing; ..." Metaphysiques, Hobbes says, is "far from the possibility of being understood" and is "repugnant to natural reason."

Being to Hobbes (and the other empiricists) is the physical universe:The world, (I mean ... the Universe, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimension of magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body ... and consequently every part of the Universe is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: and because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing; and consequently no where."

Hobbes' view is representative of his tradition. As Aristotle offered the categories and the act of existence, and Aquinas the analogy of being, the rationalists also had their own system, the <a href="great%20chain%20of%20being">great chain of being</a>, an interlocking hierarchy of beings from God to dust.

In addition to the <a href="materialism">materialism</a> of the empiricists, under the same <a href="aegis">aegis</a> of Reason, rationalism produced systems that were diametrically opposed now called <a href="idealism">idealism</a>, which denied the reality of <a href="matter">matter</a> in favor of the reality of <a href="mind">mind</a>. By a 20th-century classification, the idealists (<a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a>, <a href="Hegel">Hegel</a> and others), are considered the beginning of <a href="continental%20philosophy">continental philosophy</a>, while the empiricists are the beginning, or the immediate predecessors, of <a href="analytical%20philosophy">analytical philosophy</a>. 

Some philosophers deny that the concept of "being" has any meaning at all, since we only define an object's existence by its relation to other objects, and actions it undertakes. The term "I am" has no meaning by itself; it must have an action or relation appended to it. This in turn has led to the thought that "being" and <a href="nothing">nothing</a>ness are closely related, developed in <a href="Existentialism">existential</a> philosophy.

<a href="Existentialism">Existentialist</a> philosophers such as <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Sartre</a>, as well as <a href="continental%20philosophy">continental philosophers</a> such as <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Hegel</a> and <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Heidegger</a> have also written extensively on the concept of being. Hegel distinguishes between the being of objects (<a href="being%20in%20itself">being in itself</a>) and the being of people ("<a href="Geist%20%28philosophy%29">Geist</a>)". Hegel, however, did not think there was much hope for delineating a "meaning" of being, because being stripped of all predicates is simply nothing.

Heidegger, in his quest to re-pose the original pre-Socratic question of Being, wondered at how to meaningfully ask the question of the meaning of being, since it is both the greatest, as it includes everything that is, and the least, since no particular thing can be said of it. He distinguishes between different modes of beings: a privative mode is <a href="present-at-hand">present-at-hand</a>, whereas beings in a fuller sense are described as <a href="ready-to-hand">ready-to-hand</a>. The one who asks the question of Being is described as Da-sein ("there/here-being") or <a href="being-in-the-world">being-in-the-world</a>. Sartre, popularly understood as misreading Heidegger (an understanding supported by Heidegger's essay "Letter on Humanism" which responds to Sartre's famous address, "Existentialism is a Humanism"), employs modes of being in an attempt to ground his concept of freedom ontologically by distinguishing between being-in-itself and being-for-itself.

Being is also understood as one's "state of being," and hence its common meaning is in the context of human (personal) <a href="experience">experience</a>, with aspects that involve expressions and manifestations coming from an innate "being", or personal character. <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Heidegger</a> coined the term ""<a href="dasein">dasein</a>"" for this property of being in his influential work "<a href="Being%20and%20Time">Being and Time</a>" ("this entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term 'dasein.'"), in which he argued that being or "dasein" links one's sense of one's body to one's perception of <a href="world">world</a>. Heidegger, amongst others, referred to an innate language as the foundation of being, which gives <a href="Information">signal</a> to all aspects of being.

While studying of meaning of being itself <a href="semantics">semantics</a> traditionally appeal to the oldest sign <a href="ouroboros">ouroboros</a> - snake eating its own tail which describes the cyclical nature of being or <a href="eternity">eternity</a>. In <a href="mathematical%20logic">mathematical logic</a> sometimes used in this case the sign <a href="infinity">infinity</a>, but indeed because of its quantitive character this sign is also inappropriate to use in description of being. 
Several experiments conducted by the cognitive psychologists in frames of <a href="Prototype%20theory">Prototype theory</a> in particular show that some prototypes are formed on the basis of common features. Lots of cultures describe being as some sort of line - process that can have its beginning - birth , midst - some occasion of being , or doubled occasions - system, and the end - death , as well it can exists in form of the smallest part of time - moment of being , or show the whole its length both sides bounded - period of being .

As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere being.<br>— <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>, "<a href="Memories%2C%20Dreams%2C%20Reflections">Memories, Dreams, Reflections</a>" ch. II (1962)

Under the heading ‘Individuality in Thought and Desire’, <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> ("German Ideology", 1845), says:
"It depends not on consciousness, but on "being"; not on thought, but on "life"; it depends on the individual's empirical development and manifestation of life, which in turn depends on the conditions existing in the world."
