Afroasiatic languages

Afroasiatic (Afro-Asiatic), also known as Afrasian and traditionally as Hamito-Semitic (Chamito-Semitic), is a large <a href="language%20family">language family</a> of several hundred related languages and dialects. It comprises about 300 or so living languages and dialects, according to the 2009 <a href="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a> estimate. It includes languages spoken predominantly in <a href="Western%20Asia">West Asia</a>, <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, the <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn of Africa</a>, and parts of the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>.

Afroasiatic languages have over 350 million native speakers, the fourth largest number of any language family (after <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a>, <a href="Sino-Tibetan%20languages">Sino-Tibetan</a> and <a href="Niger%E2%80%93Congo%20languages">Niger–Congo</a>). The phylum has six branches: <a href="Berber%20languages">Berber</a>, <a href="Chadic%20languages">Chadic</a>, <a href="Cushitic%20languages">Cushitic</a>, <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a>, <a href="Omotic%20languages">Omotic</a> and <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic</a>.

By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language is <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>. It is also the most widely spoken language within the Semitic branch, and includes <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a> and spoken <a href="Varieties%20of%20Arabic">colloquial varieties</a>. Arabic has around 290 million native speakers, who are concentrated primarily in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and Malta.

Other widely spoken Afroasiatic languages include:

In addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages, such as <a href="Egyptian%20language">Ancient Egyptian</a>, <a href="Akkadian">Akkadian</a>, <a href="Biblical%20Hebrew">Biblical Hebrew</a>, and <a href="Old%20Aramaic%20language">Old Aramaic</a>. It is uncertain when or where the original homeland of the Afroasiatic family existed. Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara, and the Levant.

During the early 1800s, linguists grouped the <a href="Berber%20languages">Berber</a>, <a href="Cushitic%20languages">Cushitic</a> and <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a> languages within a "Hamitic" phylum, in acknowledgement of these languages' genetic relation with each other and with those in the <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic</a> phylum. The terms "Hamitic" and "Semitic" were etymologically derived from the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>, which describes various Biblical tribes descended from <a href="Ham%20%28son%20of%20Noah%29">Ham</a> and <a href="Shem">Shem</a>, two sons of <a href="Noah">Noah</a>. By the 1860s, the main constituent elements within the broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out.

The scholar <a href="Friedrich%20M%C3%BCller%20%28linguist%29">Friedrich Müller</a> introduced the name "Hamito-Semitic" for the entire family in his "Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft" (1876). <a href="Maurice%20Delafosse">Maurice Delafosse</a> (1914) later coined the term "Afroasiatic" (often now spelled "Afro-Asiatic"). However, it did not come into general use until <a href="Joseph%20Greenberg">Joseph Greenberg</a> (1950) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic spanned the continents of both Africa and Asia.

Individual scholars have also called the family "Erythraean" (Tucker 1966) and "Lisramic" (Hodge 1972). In lieu of "Hamito-Semitic", the Russian linguist <a href="Igor%20Diakonoff">Igor Diakonoff</a> later suggested the term "Afrasian", meaning "half African, half Asiatic", in reference to the geographic distribution of the family's constituent languages.

The term "Hamito-Semitic" remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries.

The Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches:

Although there is general agreement on these six families, there are some points of disagreement among <a href="linguistics">linguists</a> who study Afroasiatic. In particular:

In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian <a href="Judah%20ibn%20Kuraish">Judah ibn Quraysh</a> of <a href="Tiaret">Tiaret</a> in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>.

In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships. In 1844, <a href="Theodor%20Benfey">Theodor Benfey</a> suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter "Ethiopic"). In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.

<a href="Friedrich%20M%C3%BCller%20%28linguist%29">Friedrich Müller</a> named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his "Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft" ("Outline of Linguistics"), and defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a "Hamitic" group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group. It was the <a href="Egyptology">Egyptologist</a> <a href="Karl%20Richard%20Lepsius">Karl Richard Lepsius</a> (1810–1884) who restricted Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized by a grammatical <a href="Grammatical%20gender">gender system</a>. This "Hamitic language group" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a>, the <a href="Berber%20languages">Berber languages</a>, the <a href="Cushitic%20languages">Cushitic languages</a>, the <a href="Beja%20language">Beja language</a>, and the <a href="Chadic%20languages">Chadic languages</a>. Unlike Müller, Lepsius considered that <a href="Hausa%20language">Hausa</a> and <a href="Nama%20language">Nama</a> were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.

In 1912, <a href="Carl%20Meinhof">Carl Meinhof</a> published "Die Sprachen der Hamiten" ("The Languages of the Hamites"), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the <a href="Fula%20language">Fula</a>, <a href="Maasai%20language">Maasai</a>, <a href="Bari%20language">Bari</a>, <a href="Nandi%20languages">Nandi</a>, <a href="Sandawe%20language">Sandawe</a> and <a href="Hadza%20language">Hadza</a> languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s. Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that "speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'." But, in the case of the so-called <a href="Nilo-Hamitic%20languages">Nilo-Hamitic languages</a> (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a "fallacious theory of <a href="mixed%20language">language mixture</a>." Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub "Nilo-Hamitic" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.

<a href="Leo%20Reinisch">Leo Reinisch</a> (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. <a href="Marcel%20Cohen">Marcel Cohen</a> (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct "Hamitic" subgroup, and included <a href="Hausa%20language">Hausa</a> (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, <a href="Joseph%20Greenberg">Joseph Greenberg</a>'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of "Hamitic" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate "Nilo-Hamitic" language category in particular, Greenberg was "returning to a view widely held a half century earlier." He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings. He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.

Greenberg's model was fully developed in his book "<a href="The%20Languages%20of%20Africa">The Languages of Africa</a>" (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably <a href="Nilo-Saharan">Nilo-Saharan</a>. Following <a href="Isaac%20Schapera">Isaac Schapera</a> and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the <a href="Hottentot%20language">Hottentot language</a> as a member of the Central <a href="Khoisan%20languages">Khoisan languages</a>. To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian <a href="Hadza%20language">Hadza</a> and <a href="Sandawe%20language">Sandawe</a>, though this view remains controversial since some scholars consider these languages to be <a href="Language%20isolate">linguistic isolates</a>. Despite this, Greenberg's model remains the basis for modern classifications of languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this.

Since the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages (Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian) have not been shown to form an exclusive (<a href="Monophyly">monophyletic</a>) phylogenetic unit of their own, separate from other Afroasiatic languages, linguists no longer use the term in this sense. Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family.

In 1969, <a href="Harold%20C.%20Fleming">Harold Fleming</a> proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name <a href="Omotic%20languages">Omotic</a>. This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.

Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and <a href="Robert%20Hetzron">Robert Hetzron</a>, have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic.

"<a href="Glottolog">Glottolog</a>" does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge. It therefore splits off the following groups as small families: <a href="South%20Omotic%20languages">South Omotic</a>, <a href="Mao%20languages">Mao</a>, <a href="Dizoid%20languages">Dizoid</a>, <a href="Gonga%E2%80%93Gimojan%20languages">Gonga–Gimojan</a> (North Omotic apart from the preceding), <a href="Ongota%20language">Ongota</a>, <a href="Kujarge%20language">Kujarge</a>.

Little agreement exists on the <a href="subgrouping%20%28linguistics%29">subgrouping</a> of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic. However, <a href="Christopher%20Ehret">Christopher Ehret</a> (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.

Otherwise:

Afroasiatic is one of the four major <a href="Languages%20of%20Africa">language families</a> spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book "<a href="The%20Languages%20of%20Africa">The Languages of Africa</a>" (1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.

There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:

The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an <a href="Egyptian%20language">Ancient Egyptian</a> inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago). Symbols on <a href="Gerzeh%20culture">Gerzean</a> (Naqada II) pottery resembling <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs%23History%20and%20evolution">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from <a href="Proto-Afroasiatic%20language">Proto-Afroasiatic</a> (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to <a href="Igor%20M.%20Diakonoff">Igor M. Diakonoff</a> (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken <a href="circa">c.</a> 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other <a href="proto-language">proto-language</a>s.

The term Afroasiatic Urheimat ("Urheimat" meaning "original homeland" in German) refers to the hypothetical place where <a href="Proto-Afroasiatic%20language">Proto-Afroasiatic language</a> speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in <a href="Western%20Asia">West Asia</a>, <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, the <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn of Africa</a>, and parts of the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the <a href="Sahara%20pump%20theory">Sahara pump</a> operating over the last 10,000 years.

There is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed. Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara, and the Levant.

Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include:

One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at the start of this section), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.

According to Ehret (1996), <a href="tonal%20language">tonal language</a>s appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic languages. The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not use tones <a href="phoneme">phonemically</a>.

The following are some examples of Afroasiatic <a href="cognate">cognate</a>s, including ten <a href="pronoun">pronoun</a>s, three <a href="noun">noun</a>s, and three <a href="verb">verb</a>s.

There are two etymological dictionaries of Afroasiatic, one by Christopher Ehret, and one by Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova. The two dictionaries disagree on almost everything. The following table contains the thirty roots or so (out of thousands) that represent a fragile consensus of present research:

Some of the main sources for Afroasiatic etymologies include:

Andorra (; , ), officially the Principality of Andorra (), also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra (), is a <a href="sovereign">sovereign</a> <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked</a> <a href="microstate">microstate</a> in <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Southwestern Europe</a>, located in the eastern <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> mountains and bordered by <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="France">France</a>. Created under a charter in 988, the present principality was formed in 1278. It is known as a <a href="principality">principality</a> as it is a <a href="coregency">diarchy</a> headed by two <a href="Co-Princes%20of%20Andorra">Co-Princes</a>the Catholic <a href="Bishop%20of%20Urgell">Bishop of Urgell</a> in Spain, and the <a href="President%20of%20France">President of France</a>.

Andorra is the <a href="European%20microstates">sixth-smallest nation in Europe</a>, having an area of 468 km (181 sq mi) and a population of approximately . Andorra is the 16th-smallest country in the world by land and 11th-smallest country by population. Its capital <a href="Andorra%20la%20Vella">Andorra la Vella</a> is the highest capital city in Europe, at an elevation of <a href="above%20mean%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>. The official language is <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a>, although Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken.

<a href="Tourism%20in%20Andorra">Andorra's tourism</a> services an estimated 10.2 million visitors annually. It is not a member of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, but the <a href="euro">euro</a> is the official currency. It has been a member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> since 1993. In 2013, the people of Andorra had <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20life%20expectancy">the highest life expectancy in the world</a> at 81 years, according to "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>".

The origin of the word "Andorra" is unknown, although several hypotheses have been formulated. The oldest derivation of the word "Andorra" is from the Greek historian <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> ("<a href="The%20Histories%20%28Polybius%29">The Histories</a>" III, 35, 1) who describes the "Andosins", an <a href="Iberians">Iberian</a> <a href="Pre-Roman%20peoples%20of%20the%20Iberian%20Peninsula">Pre-Roman tribe</a>, as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the <a href="Carthaginian">Carthaginian</a> army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the <a href="Punic%20Wars">Punic Wars</a>. The word "Andosini" or "Andosins" (Ἀνδοσίνους) may derive from the <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a> "handia" whose meaning is "big" or "giant". The Andorran <a href="toponymy">toponymy</a> shows evidence of <a href="Basque%20language">Basque language</a> in the area. Another theory suggests that the word "Andorra" may derive from the old word "Anorra" that contains the Basque word "ur" (water).

Another theory suggests that "Andorra" may derive from <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> "al-durra", meaning "The forest" (الدرة). When the <a href="Moors">Moors</a> colonized the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, the valleys of the Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest, and other regions and towns, also administered by Muslims, received this designation.

Other theories suggest that the term derives from the <a href="Navarro-Aragonese">Navarro-Aragonese</a> "andurrial", which means "land covered with bushes" or "scrubland".

The <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a> holds that <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> had named the region as a reference to the <a href="Biblical">Biblical</a> <a href="Cannan">Canaanite</a> valley of "<a href="Endor%20%28village%29">Endor</a>" or "<a href="Endor%20%28village%29">Andor</a>" (where the <a href="Midianites">Midianites</a> had been defeated), a name also bestowed by his heir and son <a href="Louis%20le%20Debonnaire">Louis le Debonnaire</a> after defeating the Moors in the "wild valleys of Hell".

"La Balma de la <a href="La%20Margineda">Margineda</a>" found by <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a>s at <a href="Sant%20Julia%20de%20Loria">Sant Julia de Loria</a> were the first temporal settled in 10,000 BC as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees. The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from <a href="Ari%C3%A8ge%20%28river%29">Ariege</a> and <a href="Segre%20%28river%29">Segre</a>.

During the <a href="Neolithic%20Age">Neolithic Age</a> the group of humans moved to the <a href="Madriu-Perafita-Claror%20Valley">Valley of Madriu</a> (nowaday Natural Parc located in <a href="Escaldes-Engordany">Escaldes-Engordany</a> declared <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>) as a permanent camp in 6640 BC. The population of the valley grew cereals, raised domestic livestock and developed a commercial trade with people from the <a href="Segre">Segre</a> and <a href="Occitania">Occitania</a>.

Other archaeological deposits include the "Tombs of <a href="Segudet">Segudet</a>" (<a href="Ordino">Ordino</a>) and "Feixa del Moro" (Sant Julia de Loria) both dated in 4900–4300 BC as an example of the <a href="Urnfield%20culture">Urn culture</a> in Andorra.
The model of small settlements begin to evolved as a complex urbanism during the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>. <a href="Metallurgy">Metallurgical</a> items of iron, ancient coins and relicaries can be found in the <a href="Sanctuary">ancient sanctuaries</a> scattered around the country.

The <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a> of "Roc de les Bruixes" (Stone of the Witches) is maybe the most important archeological complex of this Age in Andorra, located in the parish of <a href="Canillo">Canillo</a>, about the rituals of funerals, ancient scripture and engraved stone <a href="mural">mural</a>s.

The inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the <a href="Iberians">Iberians</a> and historically located in Andorra as the Iberian tribe "Andosins" or "Andosini" (Ἀνδοσίνους) during the VII and II centuries BC. Influenced by <a href="Aquitanian%20language">Aquitanias</a>, <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a> and <a href="Iberian%20languages">Iberian languages</a> the locals developed some current toponyms. Early writings and documents relating this group of people goes back to the second century BC by the Greek writer <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> in his "Histories" during the <a href="Punic%20Wars">Punic Wars</a>.

Some of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the "Roc d'Enclar" (part of the early <a href="Marca%20Hispanica">Marca Hispanica</a>), "l'Anxiu" in <a href="Les%20Escaldes">Les Escaldes</a> and "Roc de L'Oral" in <a href="Encamp">Encamp</a>.
It is known the presence of <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> influence from the II century BC to the V century AD. The places found with more Roman presence are in "Camp Vermell" (Red Field) in Sant Julia de Loria and in some places in Encamp as well as in the "Roc d'Enclar". People continued trading, mainly with wine and cereals, with the Roman cities of <a href="Urgellet">Urgellet</a> (nowaday <a href="La%20Seu%20d%27Urgell">La Seu d'Urgell</a>) and all across Segre through the "<a href="Roman%20roads">Via Romana</a> Strata Ceretana" (also known as "Strata Confluetana"). 

After the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">fall of the Roman Empire</a> Andorra was under the influence of the <a href="Visigothic%20Kingdom">Visigoths</a>, not directly from the <a href="History%20of%20Toledo%2C%20Spain%23Visigothic%20Toledo">Kingdom of Toledo</a> by distance, but more particular from the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Urgell">Diocese of Urgell</a>. The Visigoths remained during 200 years in the valleys, a period in which <a href="Gothic%20Christianity">Christianization</a> takes place within the country. The fall of the Visigoths came from the <a href="Al-Andalus">Muslim Empire</a> and its <a href="Umayyad%20conquest%20of%20Hispania">conquest</a> of the Iberian Peninsula. Andorra remained away from these invasions by the <a href="Francia">Franks</a>.

Tradition holds that "Charles the Great" (<a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>) granted a charter to the Andorran people, under the command of "Marc Almugaver" and an army of five thousand soldiers, in return for fighting against the <a href="Moors">Moors</a> near <a href="Port%C3%A9-Puymorens">Porté-Puymorens</a> (<a href="Cerdanya">Cerdanya</a>).

Andorra remained part of the Marca Hispanica of the <a href="Frankish%20Empire">Frankish Empire</a> being <a href="Feudalism">overlordship</a> of the territory the <a href="Count%20of%20Urgell">Count of Urgell</a> and eventually by the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Urgel">bishop</a> of the Diocese of Urgell. Also tradition holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis the Pious</a>, writing the "Carta de Poblament" or a local <a href="municipal%20charter">municipal charter</a> circa 805.

In 988, <a href="Borrell%20II">Borrell II</a>, Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya. Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has been <a href="Co-Princes%20of%20Andorra">Co-prince</a> of Andorra.

The first document that mentions "Andorra" as a territory is the "Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell" (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell). The old document dated from 839 depicts the six old <a href="Parishes%20of%20Andorra">parishes</a> of the Andorran valleys and therefore the administrative division of the country.

Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys, asked the <a href="Lord%20of%20Caboet">Lord of Caboet</a> for help and protection. In 1095 the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Years later their daughter, Ermessenda, married <a href="Roger-Bernard%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Foix">Roger Bernat II</a>, the French <a href="Count%20of%20Foix">Count of Foix</a>. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix as aftermath of the <a href="Cathar%20Crusade">Cathar Crusade</a>. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the king of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aragon">Aragon</a>, <a href="Pere%20el%20Gran">Pere II</a> between the Bishop and the Count, by the signing of the first <a href="Par%C3%A9age%20of%20Andorra%201278">paréage</a> which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. This gave the <a href="principality">principality</a> its territory and political form.

A second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the <a href="Roger-Bernard%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Foix">Count of Foix</a> ordered the construction of a castle in "Roc d'Enclar". The document was ratified by the noble notary <a href="County%20of%20Cerdanya">Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà</a> and the construction of military structures in the country was prohibited.

In 1364 the political organization of the country named the figure of the <a href="syndic">syndic</a> (now spokesman and president of the parliament) as representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes making possible the creation of <a href="Parishes%20of%20Andorra">local departments</a> ("comuns", "quarts" and "veïnats"). After being ratified by the Bishop Francesc Tovia and the Count <a href="John%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Foix">Jean I</a>, the "Consell de la Terra" or <a href="General%20Council%20%28Andorra%29">Consell General de les Valls</a> (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe. The syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organized the creation of the <a href="Politics%20of%20Andorra%23Judicial%20branch">Justice Courts</a> ("La Cort de Justicia") in 1433 with the Co-Princes and the collection of taxes like "foc i lloc" (literally "fire and site", a national tax active since then).

Although we can find remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century ("Sant Vicenç d'Enclar" or <a href="Esgl%C3%A9sia%20de%20Santa%20Coloma">Església de Santa Coloma</a>), Andorra developed an exquisite <a href="Romanesque%20Art%20and%20Architecture">Romanesque Art</a> during the 9th and 14th centuries, as much in the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the <a href="Virgin%20and%20Child">Virgin and Child</a> (being the most important the <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20Meritxell">Our Lady of Meritxell</a>). Nowadays, the <a href="List%20of%20regional%20characteristics%20of%20Romanesque%20churches%23Romanesque%20churches%20in%20Spain.2C%20Portugal%20and%20Andorra">Romanesque</a> buildings that form part of <a href="Cultural%20Heritage%20of%20Andorra">Andorra's cultural heritage</a> stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on <a href="Esgl%C3%A9sia%20de%20Sant%20Esteve">Església de Sant Esteve</a>, <a href="Sant%20Joan%20de%20Caselles">Sant Joan de Caselles</a>, <a href="Esgl%C3%A9sia%20de%20Sant%20Miquel%20d%27Engolasters">Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters</a>, <a href="Sant%20Mart%C3%AD%20de%20la%20Cortinada">Sant Martí de la Cortinada</a> and the medieval bridges of <a href="Pont%20de%20la%20Margineda">Margineda</a> and <a href="Pont%20dels%20Escalls">Escalls</a> among many others.

While the Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan language</a> at the end of the 11th century Andorra was influenced by the appearance of that language where it was adopted by proximity and influence even decades before it was expanded by the rest of the Kingdom of Aragon.

The local population based its economy during the Middle Ages in the livestock and agriculture, as well as in furs and weavers. Later, at the end of the 11th century, the first <a href="Bloomery%23Medieval%20Europe">foundries of iron</a> began to appear in Northern Parishes like <a href="Ordino">Ordino</a>, much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century.

In 1601 the <a href="Andorra%23Law%20and%20criminal%20justice">Tribunal de Corts</a> (High Court of Justice) was created as a result of <a href="Huguenot%20rebellions">Huguenot rebellions</a> from France, <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Inquisition</a> courts coming from Spain and <a href="Catalan%20mythology%20about%20witches">indigenous witchcraft</a> experienced in the country due to the <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a> and <a href="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a>. With the passage of time, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Navarre">Navarre</a>. After Henry of Navarre became King <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV of France</a>, he issued an edict in 1607, that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as <a href="Co-Princes%20of%20Andorra">Co-Princes of Andorra</a>. During 1617 communal councils form the "sometent" (popular militia or army) to deal with the rise of "bandolerisme" (<a href="brigandage">brigandage</a>) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition, organization and competences current today .

Andorra continues with the same economic system that it had during the 12th-14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy ("fargues", a system similar to "Farga catalana") and with the introduction of <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> circa 1692 and import trade. The <a href="fair">fair</a> of Andorra la Vella was ratified by the co-princes in 1371 and 1448 being the most important annual national festival commercially ever since.

The country had a unique and experienced <a href="guild">guild</a> of weavers, "Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors", located in <a href="Escaldes-Engordany">Escaldes-Engordany</a> founded in 1604 taking advantage of the thermal waters of the area. By the time the country constitutes the social system of "prohoms" (wealthy society) and "casalers" (rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition), deriving to the tradition of "<a href="pubilla">pubilla</a>" and <a href="Heir">"hereu"</a>.

Three centuries after its foundation the Consell de la Terra locates its headquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in <a href="Casa%20de%20la%20Vall">Casa de la Vall</a> in 1702. The <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the Busquets family. Inside the parliament was placed the "Closet of the six keys" ("Armari de les sis claus") representative of each Andorran parish and where the <a href="Andorran%20constitution">Andorran constitution</a> and other documents and laws were kept later on.

In both <a href="Guerra%20dels%20Segadors">Guerra dels Segadors</a> and <a href="Guerra%20de%20Sucesi%C3%B3n%20Espa%C3%B1ola">Guerra de Sucesión Española</a> conflicts, the Andorran people (although with the statement neutral country) supported the <a href="Catalans">Catalans</a> who saw their <a href="Catalan%20constitutions">rights</a> reduced in <a href="Nueva%20Planta%20decrees">1716</a>. The reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra, with cultural works such as the "Book of Privileges" ("Llibre de Privilegis de 1674"), "Manual Digest" (1748) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the "Polità andorrà" (1763) by Antoni Puig.

After the French Revolution Napoleon I reestablished in 1809 the Co-Principate and deleted the French medieval tithe. Although in 1812–13, the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a> annexed Catalonia during the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> ("Guerra del francés") and divided it in four <a href="d%C3%A9partement">département</a>s, with Andorra being made part of the district of <a href="Puigcerd%C3%A0">Puigcerdà</a> (département of <a href="S%C3%A8gre">Sègre</a>). In 1814 a royal decree reestablished the independence and economy of Andorra.

Andorra retained its late medieval institutions and rural culture largely unchanged during this period. In 1866 the syndic <a href="Casa%20d%27Areny-Plandolit">Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit</a> lead the "reformist" group in a Council General of 24 members, elected by suffrage limited to heads of families, replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state. The New Reform ("Nova Reforma" or "Pla de Reforma") began after being ratified by both Co-Princes and established the basis of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Andorra">constitution</a> and symbols (such as the <a href="Flag%20of%20Andorra">tricolor flag</a>) of Andorra. A new <a href="service%20economy">service economy</a> arise as a demand of the inhabitants of the valleys and began to build infrastructures such as hotels, spa resorts, roads and telegraph lines.
The authorities of the Co-Princes ("veguer") banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country by establishing an economic conflict with the demand of the Andorran people. The conflict led to the so-called "Revolution of 1881" or "Troubles of Andorra", when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic during 8 December 1880 and established the "Provisional Revolutionary Council" led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas, who granted the construction of casinos and spas to foreign companies. During 7 and 9 June 1881, the loyalists of <a href="Canillo">Canillo</a> and <a href="Encamp">Encamp</a> reconquered the parishes of <a href="Ordino">Ordino</a> and <a href="Massana">Massana</a> by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in <a href="Escaldes-Engordany">Escaldes-Engordany</a>. After a day of combat finally the <a href="Pont%20dels%20Escalls">Treaty of the Bridge of Escalls</a> was signed the 10 of June. The Council was replaced and new elections were made but the economic situation worsened with a divided society: the "Qüestió d'Andorra" (the "Andorran Question" in relation to the <a href="Eastern%20Question">Eastern Question</a>). The struggles continued between pro-bishops, pro-French and nationalists who derived the troubles of Canillo in 1882 and 1885.

Andorra participated in the cultural movement of the <a href="Catalonia">Catalan</a> <a href="Renaixen%C3%A7a">Renaixença</a>. Between 1882 and 1887 the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexists with the knowledge of the official language, Catalan. Some <a href="Romanticism">romantic</a> authors from both France and Spain reported the awakening of the <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">national consciousness</a> of the country. <a href="Jacint%20Verdaguer">Jacint Verdaguer</a> lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and share works related to the Renaixença with <a href="Casa%20Rossell">Joaquim de Riba</a>, writer and photographer. <a href="Fromental%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Fromental Halévy</a>, for his part, had already premiered in 1848 the opera "<a href="Le%20val%20d%27Andorre">Le Val d'Andorre</a>" of great success in Europe, where the national consciousness of the valleys during the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> was exposed in the romantic work.

Andorra declared war on <a href="Imperial%20Germany">Imperial Germany</a> during World War I, but did not actually take part in the fighting. It remained in an official state of <a href="belligerency">belligerency</a> until 1958 as it was not included in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>.

In 1933, France occupied Andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections. On 12 July 1934, adventurer <a href="Boris%20Skossyreff">Boris Skossyreff</a> issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself "Boris I, King of Andorra", simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by the Spanish authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. From 1936 until 1940, a French military detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to secure the principality against disruption from the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> and <a href="Francoist%20Spain">Francoist Spain</a>. Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war. During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy France</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a>.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Its political system was modernised in 1993, when it became a member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> and the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a>.

Andorra is a parliamentary <a href="co-principality">co-principality</a> with the <a href="President%20of%20the%20French%20Republic">President of France</a> and the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> <a href="Bishop%20of%20Urgell">Bishop of Urgell</a> (<a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>) as <a href="List%20of%20Co-Princes%20of%20Andorra">Co-Princes</a>. This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as <a href="Prince%20of%20Andorra">Prince of Andorra</a>, an elected reigning monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary</a> <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democracy</a>, whereby the <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20government%20of%20Andorra">Head of Government</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20government">chief executive</a>, and of a <a href="wiktionary%3Apluriform">pluriform</a> multi-party system.

The current Head of Government is <a href="Antoni%20Mart%C3%AD">Antoni Martí</a> of the <a href="Democrats%20for%20Andorra">Democrats for Andorra</a> (DA). <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors. The Councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.

Half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the Councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.

Candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-Princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.

If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-Princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.

The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Co-Princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.

The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-Princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.

Andorra does not have its own armed forces, although there is a small ceremonial army. Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with <a href="France">France</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the "Sometent" (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve. This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house) should, by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need. Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).

Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army. The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the "Sometent". Being a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a>, Andorra has no <a href="navy">navy</a>.

Prior to World War I Andorra maintained an armed force of about 600 part-time militiamen. This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials ("viguiers") appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell.

Despite not being involved in any fighting during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, Andorra was technically the longest combatant, as the country was left out of the <a href="Versailles%20Peace%20Conference">Versailles Peace Conference</a>, <a href="de%20jure">technically</a> remaining at war with Germany from its original declaration of war in 1914 until 24 September 1958 when Andorra officially declared peace with Germany.

In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties. Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities.

The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the <a href="Police%20Corps%20of%20Andorra">Police Corps of Andorra</a> in 1931. Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French <a href="National%20Gendarmerie">National Gendarmerie</a>, with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard. The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles. The force consisted of six <a href="Corporal">Corporal</a>s, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of major. It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.

Today a small, twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran Army, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service, with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm. The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the <a href="flag%20of%20Andorra">flag of Andorra</a> at official ceremonial functions. According to <a href="Marc%20Forn%C3%A9%20Moln%C3%A9">Marc Forné Molné</a>, Andorra's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time volunteers.

The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference. In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officers</a>, or <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s, because the <a href="Enlisted%20rank">other ranks</a> are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the "Sometent" to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.

Andorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force, with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants. The principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing. There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and a bomb disposal team.

The "Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra" (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in <a href="counter-terrorism">counter-terrorism</a>, and <a href="Hostage%20negotiator">hostage recovery</a> tasks. Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the <a href="Police%20Corps%20of%20Andorra">Police Corps</a>, and not the <a href="Military%20of%20Andorra">army</a>. As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.

The "Andorran Fire Brigade", with headquarters at <a href="Santa%20Coloma%20d%27Andorra">Santa Coloma</a>, operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), four light support vehicles (cars and vans) and four ambulances.

Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires. The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943. Serious fires which lasted for two days in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the "Andorran Fire Brigade" was formed on 21 April 1961.

The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time two at the brigade's headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.

Andorra consists of seven parishes:


Due to its location in the eastern <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the <a href="Coma%20Pedrosa">Coma Pedrosa</a> at , and the average elevation of Andorra is . These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the <a href="Gran%20Valira">Gran Valira</a> river, leaves the country for <a href="Spain">Spain</a> (at Andorra's lowest point of ). Andorra's land area is .

<a href="Phytogeography">Phytogeographically</a>, Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the <a href="Circumboreal%20Region">Circumboreal Region</a> within the <a href="Boreal%20Kingdom">Boreal Kingdom</a>. According to the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">WWF</a>, the territory of Andorra belongs to the <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a> of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.

Andorra has an <a href="alpine%20climate">alpine climate</a> and <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a>. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer.

Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10.2 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts.

One of the main sources of income in Andorra is tourism from ski resorts which total over of ski ground. The sport brings in over 7 million visitors and an estimated 340 million euros per year, sustaining 2,000 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs at present.

The banking sector, with its <a href="tax%20haven">tax haven</a> status, also contributes substantially to the economy (the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19% of GDP). The financial system comprises five banking groups, one specialised credit entity, 8 investment undertaking management entities, 3 asset management companies and 29 insurance companies, 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality.

Agricultural production is limited—only 2% of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.

Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a <a href="Andorra%E2%80%93European%20Union%20relations">special relationship</a> with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the <a href="French%20franc">French franc</a> and the <a href="Spanish%20peseta">Spanish peseta</a> in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins, beginning in 2014.

Andorra has traditionally had one of the world's lowest unemployment rates. In 2009 it stood at 2.9%.

Andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven, with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs. However, during the <a href="European%20sovereign-debt%20crisis">European sovereign-debt crisis</a> of the 21st century, its tourist economy suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, which undercut Andorran <a href="duty-free%20shop">duty-free shop</a>ping. This led to a growth in unemployment. On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced, followed by a <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a> of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter. On 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members. The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Head of Government <a href="Antoni%20Marti">Antoni Marti</a> and the French President and Prince of Andorra, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande">François Hollande</a>. Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra "bringing its taxation in line with international standards".

The population of Andorra is estimated at (). The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900.

Two-thirds of residents lack Andorran nationality and do not have the right to vote in communal elections. Moreover, they are not allowed to be elected as president or to own more than 33% of the capital stock of a privately held company.

The historic and <a href="official%20language">official language</a> is <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a>, a <a href="Romance%20language">Romance language</a>. The Andorran government encourages the use of Catalan. It funds a Commission for Catalan <a href="Toponymy">Toponymy</a> in Andorra (Catalan: "la Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra"), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.

Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a> are also commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey) that have never signed the <a href="Framework%20Convention%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20National%20Minorities">Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities</a>.

According to the "Observatori Social d'Andorra", the linguistic usage in Andorra is as follows:

The population of Andorra is predominantly (88.2%) Catholic. Their patron saint is <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20Meritxell">Our Lady of Meritxell</a>. Though it is not an official state religion, the constitution acknowledges a special relationship with the Catholic Church, offering some special privileges to that group. Other Christian denominations include the <a href="Anglican%20Church">Anglican Church</a>, the <a href="Unification%20Church">Unification Church</a>, the <a href="New%20Apostolic%20Church">New Apostolic Church</a>, and <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>. The small <a href="Islam%20in%20Andorra">Muslim community</a> is primarily made up of North African immigrants. There is a small community of <a href="Hinduism">Hindus</a> and <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20Andorra">Bahá'ís</a> and roughly 100 Jews live in Andorra. (See <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Andorra">History of the Jews in Andorra</a>.)

Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education. Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.

There are three systems of school—Andorran, French, and Spanish—which use Catalan, French, and Spanish, respectively, as the main language of instruction. Parents may choose which system their children attend. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by <a href="France">France</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. About 50% of Andorran children attend the French primary schools, and the rest attend Spanish or Andorran schools.

The <a href="Universitat%20d%27Andorra">Universitat d'Andorra</a> (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra. It was established in 1997. The university provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses. The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.

The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic programme, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities. The Virtual Studies Centre ("Centre d’Estudis Virtuals") at the University runs approximately twenty different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies. The Centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing-education courses for professionals.

Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, "<a href="Caixa%20Andorrana%20de%20Seguretat%20Social">Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social</a>" (CASS), which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries. The cost of healthcare is covered by CASS at rates of 75% for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents. The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance. Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.

The main hospital, Meritxell, is in <a href="Escaldes-Engordany">Escaldes-Engordany</a>. There are also 12 primary health care centres in various locations around the principality.

Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation. Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours' drive from Andorra.

Andorra has a road network of , of which is unpaved. The two main roads out of <a href="Andorra%20la%20Vella">Andorra la Vella</a> are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near <a href="El%20Pas%20de%20la%20Casa">El Pas de la Casa</a>. Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times. There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, plus a daily tour from the former city. Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government.

There are no airports for fixed-wing aircraft within Andorra's borders but there are, however, heliports in <a href="La%20Massana">La Massana</a> (Camí Heliport), <a href="Arinsal">Arinsal</a> and <a href="Escaldes-Engordany">Escaldes-Engordany</a> with commercial helicopter services and an airport located in the neighbouring Spanish comarca of <a href="Alt%20Urgell">Alt Urgell</a>, south of the Andorran-Spanish border. Since July 2015, <a href="Andorra%E2%80%93La%20Seu%20d%27Urgell%20Airport">Andorra–La Seu d'Urgell Airport</a> has operated commercial flights to <a href="Adolfo%20Su%C3%A1rez%20Madrid%E2%80%93Barajas%20Airport">Madrid</a> and <a href="Palma%20de%20Mallorca%20Airport">Palma de Mallorca</a>, and is the <a href="airline%20hub">main hub</a> for <a href="Air%20Andorra">Air Andorra</a> and <a href="Andorra%20Airlines">Andorra Airlines</a>.

Nearby airports located in <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="France">France</a> provide access to international flights for the principality. The nearest airports are at <a href="Perpignan%E2%80%93Rivesaltes%20Airport">Perpignan</a>, France ( from Andorra) and <a href="Lleida-Alguaire%20Airport">Lleida</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a> ( from Andorra). The largest nearby airports are at <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, France ( from Andorra) and <a href="Barcelona%20Airport">Barcelona</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a> ( from Andorra). There are hourly bus services from both Barcelona and Toulouse airports to Andorra.

The nearest railway station is <a href="L%27Hospitalet-pr%C3%A8s-l%27Andorre">L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre</a> east of Andorra which is on the <a href="Standard%20gauge">-gauge</a> line from <a href="Latour-de-Carol">Latour-de-Carol</a> () southeast of Andorra, to <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> and on to Paris by the French <a href="TGV">high-speed trains</a>. This line is operated by the <a href="SNCF">SNCF</a>. Latour-de-Carol has a scenic <a href="Yellow%20Train">trainline</a> to <a href="Villefranche-de-Conflent">Villefranche-de-Conflent</a>, as well as the SNCF's gauge line connecting to <a href="Perpignan">Perpignan</a>, and the <a href="RENFE">RENFE's</a> <a href="Iberian%20gauge">-gauge</a> line to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. There are also direct <a href="Intercit%C3%A9s%23Night%20trains">Intercités de Nuit</a> trains between L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre and Paris on certain dates.

In Andorra, mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as <a href="Andorra%20Telecom">Andorra Telecom</a> (STA). The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio.

By the end of 2010, it was planned that every home in the country would have fibre-to-the-home for internet access at a minimum speed of 100 Mbit/s, and the availability was complete in June 2012.

There is only one Andorran television station, "<a href="R%C3%A0dio%20i%20Televisi%C3%B3%20d%27Andorra">Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra</a>" (RTVA). "Radio Nacional d’Andorra" operates two radio stations, "<a href="Radio%20Andorra">Radio Andorra</a>" and "Andorra Música". There are three national newspapers, "<a href="Diari%20d%27Andorra">Diari d'Andorra</a>", "<a href="El%20Peri%C3%B2dic%20d%27Andorra">El Periòdic d'Andorra</a>", and "<a href="Bondia%20%28newspaper%29">Bondia</a>" as well as several local newspapers. There is also an <a href="amateur%20radio">amateur radio</a> society. Additional TV and radio stations from <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="France">France</a> are available via digital terrestrial television and IPTV.

The official and historic language is Catalan. Thus the culture is Catalan, with its own specificity.

Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs and marratxa, which survive in <a href="Sant%20Juli%C3%A0%20de%20L%C3%B2ria">Sant Julià de Lòria</a> especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours, but is especially <a href="music%20of%20Catalonia">Catalan</a> in character, especially in the presence of dances such as the <a href="sardana">sardana</a>. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in <a href="Andorra%20la%20Vella">Andorra la Vella</a> and Saint Anne's dance in Escaldes-Engordany. Andorra's national holiday is <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20Meritxell">Our Lady of Meritxell</a> Day, 8 September. American folk artist <a href="Malvina%20Reynolds">Malvina Reynolds</a>, intrigued by its defence budget of $4.90, wrote a song "Andorra". <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a> added verses, and sang "Andorra" on his 1962 album "The Bitter and the Sweet".

Arithmetic mean

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="statistics">statistics</a>, the arithmetic mean (, stress on third syllable of "arithmetic"), or simply the <a href="mean">mean</a> or average when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection. The collection is often a set of results of an <a href="experiment%20%28probability%20theory%29">experiment</a>, or a set of results from a <a href="Survey%20methodology">survey</a>. The term "arithmetic mean" is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other <a href="average">mean</a>s, such as the <a href="geometric%20mean">geometric mean</a> and the <a href="harmonic%20mean">harmonic mean</a>.

In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics, <a href="sociology">sociology</a>, and history, and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent. For example, <a href="per%20capita%20income">per capita income</a> is the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.

While the arithmetic mean is often used to report <a href="central%20tendency">central tendencies</a>, it is not a <a href="robust%20statistic">robust statistic</a>, meaning that it is greatly influenced by <a href="outlier">outlier</a>s (values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values). Notably, for <a href="skewed%20distribution">skewed distribution</a>s, such as the <a href="distribution%20of%20income">distribution of income</a> for which a few people's incomes are substantially greater than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one's notion of "middle", and robust statistics, such as the <a href="median">median</a>, may be a better description of central tendency.

The arithmetic mean (or mean or average) is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency. In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency. The arithmetic mean is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, if we have a data set containing the values formula_1, then the arithmetic mean formula_2 is defined by the formula:

(See <a href="summation">summation</a> for an explanation of the <a href="summation%20operator">summation operator</a>).

For example, let us consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm: 2500, 2700, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2650, 2750, 2450, 2600, 2400. The arithmetic mean is

If the data set is a <a href="statistical%20population">statistical population</a> (i.e., consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the population mean. If the data set is a <a href="sampling%20%28statistics%29">statistical sample</a> (a subset of the population), we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean.

The arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar, for example as in formula_5 (read formula_6 "bar"), which is the mean of the formula_7 values formula_8.

The arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency. These include:


The arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median. The median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than, and no more than half are smaller than, the median. If elements in the sample data <a href="arithmetic%20progression">increase arithmetically</a>, when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the data sample formula_15. The average is formula_16, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as formula_17, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case, the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4. In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them.

There are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.

A weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation. For example, the arithmetic mean of formula_18 and formula_19 is formula_20, or equivalently formula_21. In contrast, a "weighted" mean in which the first number receives, for example, twice as much weight as the second (perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled) would be calculated as formula_22. Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are formula_23 and formula_24, the former being twice the latter. Note that the arithmetic mean (sometimes called the "unweighted average" or "equally weighted average") can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other (equal to formula_25 in the above example, and equal to formula_26 in a situation with formula_7 numbers being averaged).

When a population of numbers, and any sample of data from it, could take on any of a continuous range of numbers, instead of for example just integers, then the <a href="probability">probability</a> of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values, even if the lengths of both ranges are the same. In such a case, the set of probabilities can be described using a <a href="continuous%20probability%20distribution">continuous probability distribution</a>. The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable, is called the "mean of the probability distribution". The most widely encountered probability distribution is called the <a href="normal%20distribution">normal distribution</a>; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the <a href="Mode%20%28statistics%29">mode</a>, are equal to each other. This property does not hold however, in the cases of a great many probability distributions, such as the <a href="lognormal%20distribution">lognormal distribution</a> illustrated here.

Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data, such as phases or <a href="angle">angle</a>s. Naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°.
This is incorrect for two reasons:

In general application, such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range. A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation (<a href="viz.">viz.</a>, define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2°, not 358°).

<doc id="615" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=615" title="American Football Conference">
American Football Conference

The American Football Conference (AFC) is one of the two <a href="Conference%20%28sports%29">conferences</a> of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States. This conference and its counterpart, the <a href="National%20Football%20Conference">National Football Conference</a> (NFC), currently contain 16 teams each, making up the 32 teams of the NFL. Both conferences were created as part of the <a href="AFL%E2%80%93NFL%20merger">1970 merger</a> with the rival <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> (AFL), with all ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams forming the AFC, and the remaining thirteen NFL clubs forming the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total 16 clubs per each conference.

Since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> have won nine AFC titles, the most of any team in the conference (and of any team in either conference since the merger), and are its current title holder.

Since 2002, the AFC has 16 teams, organized into four <a href="Division%20%28sport%29">divisions</a> each with four teams: <a href="AFC%20East">East</a>, <a href="AFC%20North">North</a>, <a href="AFC%20South">South</a> and <a href="AFC%20West">West</a>.

Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:

Each AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC South. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the two games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing.

At the end of each season, the top six teams in the conference proceeds into the <a href="National%20Football%20League%20playoffs">playoff</a>. These teams consist of the four division winners and the top two <a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild card</a> teams. The AFC playoffs culminate in the <a href="AFC%20Championship%20Game">AFC Championship Game</a> with the winner receiving the <a href="Lamar%20Hunt">Lamar Hunt</a> Trophy. The AFC Champion then plays the <a href="National%20Football%20Conference">NFC</a> Champion in the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>.

Both the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL <a href="AFL%E2%80%93NFL%20merger">merged</a> with the <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> (AFL) in 1970. The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> in 1966 and the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> in 1968) before the merger. In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFL's launch (the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, and the then-<a href="Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a>) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC. The two AFL divisions <a href="AFL%20East">AFL East</a> and <a href="AFL%20West">AFL West</a> were more or less intact, while the Century Division, in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central.

Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> and the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the <a href="2002%20NFL%20season%23Expansion%20and%20realignment">2002 realignment</a>. The expansion <a href="Jacksonville%20Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> joined the AFC in 1995. There have been five teams that have relocated at least once. In 1984, the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> <a href="Baltimore%20Colts%20relocation%20to%20Indianapolis">relocated</a> to Indianapolis in 1984. In 1995, the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> had attempted to move to Baltimore, the resulting <a href="Cleveland%20Browns%20relocation%20controversy">dispute</a> between Cleveland and the team, led to Modell establishing the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL.

In California, the <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, and Back to Oakland in 1995, while the <a href="History%20of%20the%20San%20Diego%20Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a> moved to Los Angeles in 2017.

The <a href="History%20of%20the%20Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a> moved to <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> in 1997, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers. The team would change its name again, two years later, to the <a href="Tennessee%20Titans">Tennessee Titans</a>.

The NFL would again expand in 2002, adding the <a href="Houston%20Texans">Houston Texans</a> to the AFC.

Between 2000 and 2016, the AFC has sent either the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> (2 times), the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> (2 times), the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> (2 times), the <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> (1 time), the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> (7 times), and the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> (3 times) to the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>. By contrast, the <a href="National%20Football%20Conference">NFC</a> has sent 12 different teams during that same time frame. 14 of the last 17 AFC champions have started one of just three quarterbacks - <a href="Tom%20Brady">Tom Brady</a>, <a href="Peyton%20Manning">Peyton Manning</a>, and <a href="Ben%20Roethlisberger">Ben Roethlisberger</a> - in the Super Bowl.

The merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the "A" and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.

Animal Farm is an <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> novella by <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, first published in England on 17 August 1945. According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> and then on into the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281927%E2%80%9353%29">Stalinist era</a> of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Orwell, a <a href="democratic%20socialism">democratic socialist</a>, was a critic of <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and hostile to Moscow-directed <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal <a href="dictatorship">dictatorship</a>, built upon a <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a> and enforced by <a href="Great%20purge">a reign of terror</a>. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described "Animal Farm" as a <a href="satire">satirical</a> tale against Stalin (""un conte satirique contre Staline""), and in his essay "<a href="Why%20I%20Write">Why I Write</a>" (1946), wrote that "Animal Farm" was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole".

The original title was "Animal Farm: A Fairy Story;" U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like ""A Satire"" and ""A Contemporary Satire"". Orwell suggested the title "Union des républiques socialistes animales" for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for "bear", a <a href="Russian%20bear">symbol of Russia</a>. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, "Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques".

Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the UK was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union and the British people and intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated. The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers, including one of Orwell's own, <a href="Victor%20Gollancz">Victor Gollancz</a>, which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

"Time" magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005); it also featured at number 31 on the <a href="Modern%20Library%20List%20of%20Best%2020th-Century%20Novels">Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels</a>. It won a Retrospective <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> in 1996, and is included in the <a href="Great%20Books%20of%20the%20Western%20World">Great Books of the Western World</a> selection.

<a href="Old%20Major">Old Major</a>, the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as "enemies" and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called "<a href="Beasts%20of%20England">Beasts of England</a>". When Major dies, two young pigs, <a href="Snowball%20%28Animal%20Farm%29">Snowball</a> and <a href="Napoleon%20%28Animal%20Farm%29">Napoleon</a>, assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion. The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer <a href="Jones%20%28Animal%20Farm%29">Mr. Jones</a> from the farm, renaming it "Animal Farm". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, "All animals are equal."

Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of <a href="%23Animalism">Animalism</a>. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health.

Some time later, several men attack Animal Farm. Jones and his men are making an attempt to recapture the farm, aided by several other farmers who are terrified of similar animal revolts. Snowball and the animals, who are hiding in ambush, defeat the men by launching a surprise attack as soon as they enter the farmyard. Snowball's popularity soars, and this event is proclaimed "The Battle of the Cowshed". It is celebrated annually with the firing of a gun, on the anniversary of the Revolution.

Napoleon and Snowball vie for pre-eminence. When Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a <a href="windmill">windmill</a>, Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and declares himself leader.

Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named <a href="Squealer%20%28Animal%20Farm%29">Squealer</a>, Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project. Once Snowball becomes a <a href="scapegoat">scapegoat</a>, Napoleon begins to <a href="purge">purge</a> the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) frequently smears Snowball as a collaborator of Jones', while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle. "Beasts of England" is replaced with an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones.

<a href="Frederick%20%28Animal%20Farm%29">Mr Frederick</a>, one of the neighbouring farmers, attacks the farm, using <a href="Explosive%20material">blasting powder</a> to blow up the restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so <a href="Pyrrhic%20victory">at great cost</a>, as many, including <a href="Boxer%20%28Animal%20Farm%29">Boxer</a> the workhorse, are wounded. Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin, the cynical donkey who "could read as well as any pig", notices that the van belongs to a <a href="knacker">knacker</a> and attempts a futile rescue. Squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital, and the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. In a subsequent report, Squealer reports sadly to the animals that Boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital; the pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer's death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer's ways. However, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy <a href="whisky">whisky</a> for themselves. (In 1940s England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker, who would kill the animal and boil its remains into <a href="animal%20glue">animal glue</a>.)
Years pass, and the windmill is rebuilt along with construction of another windmill, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals which Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating and running water are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. In addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the Revolution are dead, as is Farmer Jones, who died in another part of England. The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase: "All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others". Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name "The Manor Farm". As the animals look from pigs to humans, they realise they can no longer distinguish between the two.





George Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, which he described in "<a href="Homage%20to%20Catalonia">Homage to Catalonia</a>" (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of "Animal Farm", he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him "how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries". This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the <a href="Stalinist">Stalinist</a> corruption of the original socialist ideals.

Immediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.

In the preface, Orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:
Orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused; one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Information</a>. Eventually, <a href="Secker%20and%20Warburg">Secker and Warburg</a> published the first edition in 1945.

During the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch—including his regular publisher <a href="Victor%20Gollancz%20Ltd">Gollancz</a>. He also submitted the manuscript to <a href="Faber%20and%20Faber">Faber and Faber</a>, where the poet <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's "good writing" and "fundamental integrity", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint "which I take to be generally <a href="Deformed%20workers%27%20state">Trotskyite</a>". Eliot said he found the view "not convincing", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue "what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs". Orwell let <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Deutsch">André Deutsch</a>, who was working for Nicholson & Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and "lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in "Animal Farm"." In his "London Letter" on 17 April 1944 for "<a href="Partisan%20Review">Partisan Review</a>", Orwell wrote that it was "now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle."

The publisher <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>, who had initially accepted "Animal Farm", subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off—although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> spy. Writing to <a href="Leonard%20Moore%20%28literary%20agent%29">Leonard Moore</a>, a partner in the literary agency of Christy & Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the 'important official' was a man named <a href="Peter%20Smollett">Peter Smollett</a>, who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent. Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell <a href="Orwell%27s%20list">included in his list</a> of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949. Born Hans Peter Smolka in Vienna in 1912, he came to Britain in 1933 as an <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> agent with the codename 'Abo', became a naturalised British subject in 1938, changed his name, and after the outbreak of World War II joined the Ministry of Information where he organised pro-Soviet propaganda, working with <a href="Kim%20Philby">Kim Philby</a> in 1943–45. Smollett's family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy. The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:
<a href="Frederic%20Warburg">Frederic Warburg</a> also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>, which had played a major part in defeating Hitler. A Russian translation was printed in the paper "Posev", and in giving permission for a Russian translation of "Animal Farm", Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.

In October 1945, Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist <a href="David%20Low%20%28cartoonist%29">David Low</a> might illustrate "Animal Farm". Low had written a letter saying that he had had "a good time with "ANIMAL FARM"—an excellent bit of satire—it would illustrate perfectly." Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker & Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the <a href="Folio%20Society">Folio Society</a> published an edition in 1984 illustrated by <a href="Quentin%20Blake">Quentin Blake</a> and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist <a href="Ralph%20Steadman">Ralph Steadman</a> was published by Secker & Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of "Animal Farm".

Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British <a href="self-censorship">self-censorship</a> and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:

Although the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included, and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.

Secker and Warburg published the first edition of "Animal Farm" in 1945 without an introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied, and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute.

In 1972, <a href="Ian%20Angus%20%28librarian%29">Ian Angus</a> found the original typescript titled "The Freedom of the Press", and <a href="Bernard%20Crick">Bernard Crick</a> published it, together with his own introduction, in "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>" on 15 September 1972 as "How the essay came to be written". Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government. The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition of "Animal Farm" with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface. Other publishers were still declining to publish it.

Contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive. Writing in the American "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">New Republic</a>" magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it "puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly." Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations, and said, "It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well".

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" on 24 August 1945 called "Animal Farm" "a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few". <a href="Tosco%20Fyvel">Tosco Fyvel</a>, writing in "<a href="Tribune%20%28magazine%29">Tribune</a>" on the same day, called the book "a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us." <a href="Julian%20Symons">Julian Symons</a> responded, on 7 September, "Should we not expect, in "Tribune" at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State—Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, "Animal Farm" may be simply a fairy story, today it is a political satire with a good deal of point."

"Animal Farm" has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.

The pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into "a complete system of thought", which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric reference to <a href="Communism">Communism</a>. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an <a href="allusion">allusion</a> to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.
The original commandments are:

These commandments are also distilled into the maxim "Four legs good, two legs bad!" which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm, often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism.

Later, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:

Eventually, these are replaced with the maxims, "All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others", and "Four legs good, two legs better!" as the pigs become more human. This is an <a href="Irony">ironic</a> twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political <a href="dogma">dogma</a> can be turned into malleable <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>.

In the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>, both "Animal Farm" and later "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>" were on the list of forbidden books until the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">end of communist rule in 1989</a>, and were only available via clandestine <a href="Samizdat">Samizdat</a> networks.

Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, "virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory." Orwell himself wrote in 1946, "Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution..[and] "that kind" of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert." In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, "... for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages."

The revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell's analogy with the <a href="October%20Revolution">October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution</a>. The "Battle of the Cowshed" has been said to represent the <a href="Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War">allied invasion</a> of <a href="Russian%20SFSR">Soviet Russia</a> in 1918, and the defeat of the <a href="White%20movement">White Russians</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>. The pigs' rise to pre-eminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon's emergence as the farm's sole leader reflects Stalin's emergence. The pigs' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, "the turning point of the story" as Orwell termed it in a letter to <a href="Dwight%20Macdonald">Dwight Macdonald</a>, stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 <a href="Kronstadt%20rebellion">Kronstadt revolt</a> against the Bolsheviks, and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various <a href="Five-Year%20Plans%20for%20the%20National%20Economy%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Five Year Plans</a>. The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure, and the pigs' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s. In chapter seven, when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed, Orwell directly alludes to the purges, confessions and <a href="Moscow%20show%20trials">show trials</a> of the late 1930s. These contributed to Orwell's conviction that the Bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten.

<a href="Peter%20Edgerly%20Firchow">Peter Edgerly Firchow</a> and <a href="Peter%20Davison%20%28professor%29">Peter Davison</a> consider that the "Battle of the Windmill" represents the <a href="Great%20Patriotic%20War">Great Patriotic War</a> (<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>), especially the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow">Battle of Moscow</a>. During the battle, Orwell first wrote, "All the animals, including Napoleon" took cover. Orwell had the publisher alter this to "All the animals except Napoleon" in recognition of Stalin's decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance. Orwell requested the change after he met Joseph Czapski in Paris in March 1945. Czapski, a survivor of the <a href="Katyn%20Massacre">Katyn Massacre</a> and an opponent of the Soviet regime, told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to <a href="Arthur%20Koestler">Arthur Koestler</a>, that it had been "the character [and] greatness of Stalin" that saved Russia from the German invasion.

Other connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion, which stands for the abortive revolutions <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201919">in Hungary</a> and <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319">in Germany</a> (Ch IV); the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball (Ch V), paralleling "the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another: <a href="Trotskyism">Trotskyism</a>, with its faith in the <a href="Permanent%20revolution">revolutionary vocation</a> of the proletariat of the West; and Stalinism with its glorification of <a href="socialism%20in%20one%20country">Russia's socialist destiny</a>"; Napoleon's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets (Ch VI), paralleling the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Rapallo%20%281922%29">Treaty of Rapallo</a>; and Frederick's forged bank notes, paralleling the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Non-Aggression%20between%20Germany%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact of August 1939</a>, after which Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill.

The book's close, with the pigs and men in a kind of <a href="rapprochement">rapprochement</a>, reflected Orwell's view of the 1943 <a href="Teheran%20Conference">Teheran Conference</a> that seemed to display the establishment of "the best possible relations between the USSR and the West"—but in reality were destined, as Orwell presciently predicted, to continue to unravel. The disagreement between the allies and the start of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> is suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington, both suspicious, "played an ace of spades simultaneously".

Similarly, the music in the novel, starting with "Beasts of England" and the later anthems, parallels "<a href="The%20Internationale">The Internationale</a>" and its adoption and repudiation by the Soviet authorities as the Anthem of the USSR in the 1920s and 1930s.

"Animal Farm" has been adapted to film twice. Both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties, including sanitising some aspects. 

In 2012, a HFR-3D version of "Animal Farm", potentially directed by <a href="Andy%20Serkis">Andy Serkis</a> was announced.

A BBC radio version, produced by <a href="Rayner%20Heppenstall">Rayner Heppenstall</a>, was broadcast in January 1947. Orwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square, London, with <a href="Hugh%20Gordon%20Porteus">Hugh Gordon Porteous</a>, amongst others. Orwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous, "who had not read the book, grasped what was happening after a few minutes."

A further radio production, again using Orwell's own dramatisation of the book, was broadcast in January 2013 on BBC <a href="Radio%20Four">Radio 4</a>. <a href="Tamsin%20Greig">Tamsin Greig</a> narrated, and the cast included <a href="Nicky%20Henson">Nicky Henson</a> as Napoleon, <a href="Toby%20Jones">Toby Jones</a> as the propagandist Squealer, and <a href="Ralph%20Ineson">Ralph Ineson</a> as Boxer.

A theatrical version, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by <a href="Adrian%20Mitchell">Adrian Mitchell</a>, was staged at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> London on 25 April 1984, directed by <a href="Peter%20Hall%20%28director%29">Peter Hall</a>. It toured nine cities in 1985.

A solo version, adapted and performed by Guy Masterson, premièred at the <a href="Traverse%20Theatre">Traverse Theatre</a> Edinburgh in January 1995 and has toured worldwide since.



A video game adaptation of "Animal Farm" was announced in August 2017. Fully authorised by the estate of <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, "Animal Farm" is created by an independent team formed specifically to deliver Orwell’s vision in an interactive format.


On 17 July 2009, <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> withdrew certain <a href="Amazon%20Kindle">Amazon Kindle</a> titles, including "Animal Farm" and "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>" by <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, from sale, refunded buyers, and remotely deleted items from purchasers' devices after discovering that the publisher lacked rights to publish the titles in question. Notes and annotations for the books made by users on their devices were also deleted. After the move prompted outcry and comparisons to "Nineteen Eighty-Four" itself, Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener stated that the company is "[c]hanging our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers' devices in these circumstances."

Amphibian

Amphibians are <a href="ectotherm">ectotherm</a>ic, <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a> <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s of the <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">class</a> Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all <a href="Lissamphibia">Lissamphibia</a>. They inhabit a wide variety of <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s, with most species living within <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a>, <a href="fossorial">fossorial</a>, <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> or freshwater <a href="Aquatic%20animal">aquatic</a> <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s. Thus amphibians typically start out as <a href="larva">larva</a>e living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with <a href="lung">lung</a>s. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s and <a href="frog">frog</a>s lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are <a href="amniote">amniote</a>s and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often <a href="ecological%20indicator">ecological indicator</a>s; in recent decades there has been a dramatic <a href="decline%20in%20amphibian%20populations">decline in amphibian populations</a> for many species around the globe.

The earliest amphibians <a href="evolution%20of%20tetrapods">evolved</a> in the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> period from <a href="sarcopterygian">sarcopterygian</a> fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> and <a href="Permian">Permian</a> periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass <a href="Lissamphibia">Lissamphibia</a>.

The three modern orders of amphibians are <a href="Anura%20%28frog%29">Anura</a> (the frogs and toads), <a href="Urodela">Urodela</a> (the salamanders), and <a href="caecilian">Apoda</a> (the caecilians). The number of known amphibian species is approximately 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> ("<a href="Paedophryne%20amauensis">Paedophryne amauensis</a>") with a length of just . The largest living amphibian is the <a href="Chinese%20giant%20salamander">Chinese giant salamander</a> ("Andrias davidianus"), but this is dwarfed by the extinct "<a href="Prionosuchus">Prionosuchus</a>" from the middle Permian of Brazil. The study of amphibians is called <a href="batrachology">batrachology</a>, while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called <a href="herpetology">herpetology</a>.

The word "amphibian" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> term ἀμφίβιος ("amphíbios"), which means "both kinds of life", "ἀμφί" meaning "of both kinds" and "βιος" meaning "life". The term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water, including seals and otters. Traditionally, the class Amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes. Amphibia in its widest sense ("<a href="sensu%20lato">sensu lato</a>") was divided into three <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">subclasses</a>, two of which are extinct:
The actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed. The two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website AmphibiaWeb, <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> and the classification by <a href="Herpetology">herpetologist</a> <a href="Darrel%20Frost">Darrel Frost</a> and the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, available as the online reference database "Amphibian Species of the World". The numbers of species cited above follows Frost and the total number of known amphibian species is over 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs.

With the <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> classification, the taxon <a href="Labyrinthodontia">Labyrinthodontia</a> has been discarded as it is a <a href="Paraphyly">polyparaphyletic</a> group without unique defining features apart from <a href="Cladistics%23plesiomorphy">shared primitive characteristics</a>. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a <a href="Cladistics%23Three%20definitions%20of%20clade">stem-based or a node-based</a> classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of <a href="phylogenetic%20nomenclature">phylogenetic nomenclature</a> have removed a large number of <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">Linnaean taxonomy</a>, and included them elsewhere under <a href="cladistic%20taxonomy">cladistic taxonomy</a>. If the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in Amphibia, it becomes a paraphyletic group.

All modern amphibians are included in the subclass Lissamphibia, which is usually considered a <a href="clade">clade</a>, a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor. The three modern orders are Anura (the frogs and toads), Caudata (or Urodela, the salamanders), and Gymnophiona (or Apoda, the caecilians). It has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a Temnospondyl-like ancestor, and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced <a href="reptiliomorpha">reptiliomorph</a> amphibians, and thus of amniotes. Although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with primitive characteristics are known, the oldest "true frog" is "<a href="Prosalirus%20bitis">Prosalirus bitis</a>", from the <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Early Jurassic</a> <a href="Kayenta%20Formation">Kayenta Formation</a> of Arizona. It is anatomically very similar to modern frogs. The oldest known caecilian is another Early Jurassic species, "<a href="Eocaecilia%20micropodia">Eocaecilia micropodia</a>", also from Arizona. The earliest salamander is "<a href="Beiyanerpeton%20jianpingensis">Beiyanerpeton jianpingensis</a>" from the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> of northeastern China.

Authorities disagree as to whether Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">orders</a>, but an extinct salamander-like family, the <a href="Albanerpetontidae">Albanerpetontidae</a>, is now considered part of Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog, "<a href="Triadobatrachus">Triadobatrachus</a>".

The first major groups of amphibians developed in the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> period, around 370 million years ago, from <a href="Sarcopterygii">lobe-finned fish</a> which were similar to the modern <a href="coelacanth">coelacanth</a> and <a href="lungfish">lungfish</a>. These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would <a href="evolution">evolve</a> into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric <a href="tetrapodomorph">tetrapodomorph</a> fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.

Many examples of species showing <a href="transitional%20fossil">transitional features</a> have been discovered. "<a href="Ichthyostega">Ichthyostega</a>" was one of the first primitive amphibians, with nostrils and more efficient lungs. It had four sturdy limbs, a neck, a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish, "<a href="Eusthenopteron">Eusthenopteron</a>". Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods. Their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger, better able to support the weight of their bodies on land. They developed "hands" and "feet" with five or more digits; the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation. The fish's <a href="hyomandibula">hyomandibula</a> bone in the <a href="hyoid%20bone">hyoid</a> region behind the gills diminished in size and became the <a href="stapes">stapes</a> of the amphibian ear, an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land. An affinity between the amphibians and the <a href="teleost">teleost</a> fish is the multi-folded structure of the teeth and the paired <a href="Occipital%20bone">supra-occipital bones</a> at the back of the head, neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom.
At the end of the Devonian period (360 million years ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as "Ichthyostega", may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the <a href="elephant%20seal">elephant seal</a>. In the early <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with <a href="moss">moss</a>es, <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="horsetail">horsetail</a>s and <a href="calamites">calamites</a>. Air-breathing <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the <a href="Carnivore">carnivorous</a> amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail. They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the <a href="amniote">amniotic</a> egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their <a href="Dominance%20%28ecology%29">dominance</a> in the period that followed.

After the <a href="Carboniferous%20rainforest%20collapse">Carboniferous rainforest collapse</a> amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles, and amphibians were further devastated by the <a href="Permian%E2%80%93Triassic%20extinction%20event">Permian–Triassic extinction event</a>. During the <a href="Triassic">Triassic Period</a> (250 to 200 million years ago), the reptiles continued to out-compete the amphibians, leading to a reduction in both the amphibians' size and their importance in the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a>. According to the fossil record, <a href="Lissamphibia">Lissamphibia</a>, which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage, may have branched off from the extinct groups <a href="Temnospondyli">Temnospondyli</a> and <a href="Lepospondyli">Lepospondyli</a> at some period between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Triassic. The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating, but the most recent molecular study, based on <a href="multilocus%20sequence%20typing">multilocus sequence typing</a>, suggests a Late Carboniferous/Early <a href="Permian">Permian</a> origin for extant amphibians.
The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on <a href="Ribosomal%20DNA">rDNA</a> analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> or early <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent <a href="Pangaea">Pangaea</a> and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils. There are large gaps in the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a>, but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular analysis</a> suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the <a href="Paleontology">palaeontological</a> evidence indicates. Newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all Lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago, and that <a href="Stereospondyli">stereospondyls</a> are the closest relatives to the caecilians.

As they evolved from lunged fish, amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land, including the need to develop new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their <a href="lateral%20line">lateral line</a> systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.

The superclass <a href="Tetrapoda">Tetrapoda</a> is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs. Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, some of which are impervious. Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage. They are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in <a href="brackish%20water">brackish water</a> in <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> swamps. On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp.

The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a <a href="microhylid">microhylid</a> frog from <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> ("<a href="Paedophryne%20amauensis">Paedophryne amauensis</a>") first discovered in 2012. It has an average length of and is part of a genus that contains four of the world's ten smallest frog species. The largest living amphibian is the <a href="Chinese%20giant%20salamander">Chinese giant salamander</a> ("Andrias davidianus") but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed—the extinct "<a href="Prionosuchus">Prionosuchus</a>", a crocodile-like temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle Permian of Brazil! The largest frog is the African <a href="Goliath%20frog">Goliath frog</a> ("Conraua goliath"), which can reach and weigh .

Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal <a href="Physiology">physiological</a> processes. Their <a href="Basal%20metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a> is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully <a href="Ossification">ossified</a> vertebrae with <a href="articular%20processes">articular processes</a>. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little <a href="keratin">keratin</a> and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many <a href="mucous%20gland">mucous gland</a>s and in some species, <a href="Skin">poison glands</a> (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two <a href="atrium%20%28heart%29">atria</a> and one <a href="ventricle%20%28heart%29">ventricle</a>. They have a <a href="urinary%20bladder">urinary bladder</a> and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as <a href="urea">urea</a>. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the <a href="Buccopharyngeal%20membrane">buccopharyngeal</a> region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with <a href="gas%20exchange">gas exchange</a> through the skin.

The order <a href="Anura%20%28frog%29">Anura</a> (from the Ancient Greek "<a href="Privative%20a">a(n)-</a>" meaning "without" and "oura" meaning "tail") comprises the frogs and toads. They usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them, shorter forelimbs, webbed toes with no claws, no tails, large eyes and glandular moist skin. Members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs, while those with <a href="wikt%3Awarty">warty</a> skins are known as toads. The difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule. Members of the family <a href="Bufonidae">Bufonidae</a> are known as the "true toads". Frogs range in size from the <a href="Goliath%20frog">Goliath frog</a> ("Conraua goliath") of West Africa to the "<a href="Paedophryne%20amauensis">Paedophryne amauensis</a>", first described in Papua New Guinea in 2012, which is also the smallest known vertebrate. Although most species are associated with water and damp habitats, some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts. They are found worldwide except for polar areas.

Anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community, but the relationships between some families remain unclear. Future <a href="molecular%20genetics">molecular</a> studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships. The suborder <a href="Archaeobatrachia">Archaeobatrachia</a> contains four families of primitive frogs. These are <a href="Ascaphidae">Ascaphidae</a>, <a href="Bombinatoridae">Bombinatoridae</a>, <a href="Discoglossidae">Discoglossidae</a> and <a href="Leiopelmatidae">Leiopelmatidae</a> which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages. The six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder <a href="Mesobatrachia">Mesobatrachia</a> are the <a href="fossorial">fossorial</a> <a href="Megophryidae">Megophryidae</a>, <a href="Pelobatidae">Pelobatidae</a>, <a href="Pelodytidae">Pelodytidae</a>, <a href="Scaphiopodidae">Scaphiopodidae</a> and <a href="Rhinophrynidae">Rhinophrynidae</a> and the obligatorily aquatic <a href="Pipidae">Pipidae</a>. These have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders. <a href="Neobatrachia">Neobatrachia</a> is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs, including most common species. Ninety-six percent of the over 5,000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians.

The order <a href="Caudata">Caudata</a> (from the Latin "cauda" meaning "tail") consists of the salamanders—elongated, low-slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form. This is a <a href="Symplesiomorphy">symplesiomorphic trait</a> and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals. Salamanders lack claws, have scale-free skins, either smooth or covered with <a href="tubercle">tubercle</a>s, and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned. They range in size from the <a href="Chinese%20giant%20salamander">Chinese giant salamander</a> ("Andrias davidianus"), which has been reported to grow to a length of , to the diminutive "<a href="Thorius%20pennatulus">Thorius pennatulus</a>" from Mexico which seldom exceeds in length. Salamanders have a mostly <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a>n distribution, being present in much of the <a href="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> region of the northern hemisphere. The family <a href="Plethodontidae">Plethodontidae</a> is also found in Central America and South America north of the <a href="Amazon%20basin">Amazon basin</a>; South America was apparently invaded from Central America by about the start of the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, 23 million years ago. Urodela is a name sometimes used for all the <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> species of salamanders. Members of several salamander families have become <a href="Neoteny">paedomorphic</a> and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults. Most salamanders are under long. They may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat. When on land, they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation, emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms, insects and other invertebrates.

The suborder <a href="Cryptobranchoidea">Cryptobranchoidea</a> contains the primitive salamanders. A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, but there are only three living species, the Chinese giant salamander ("Andrias davidianus"), the <a href="Japanese%20giant%20salamander">Japanese giant salamander</a> ("Andrias japonicus") and the <a href="hellbender">hellbender</a> ("Cryptobranchus alleganiensis") from North America. These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded. A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction, depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right. The males excavate nests, persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them, and guard them. As well as breathing with lungs, they respire through the many folds in their thin skin, which has <a href="Capillary">capillaries</a> close to the surface.

The suborder <a href="Salamandroidea">Salamandroidea</a> contains the advanced salamanders. They differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused <a href="Mandible">prearticular bones</a> in the lower jaw, and by using internal fertilisation. In salamandrids, the male deposits a bundle of sperm, the <a href="spermatophore">spermatophore</a>, and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid. The largest family in this group is Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders, which includes 60% of all salamander species. The <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Salamandridae">Salamandridae</a> includes the true salamanders and the name "<a href="newt">newt</a>" is given to members of its subfamily <a href="Pleurodelinae">Pleurodelinae</a>.

The third suborder, <a href="Sirenoidea">Sirenoidea</a>, contains the four species of sirens, which are in a single family, <a href="Sirenidae">Sirenidae</a>. Members of this order are <a href="eel">eel</a>-like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs. Some of their features are primitive while others are derived. Fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack <a href="spermatheca">spermatheca</a>e for sperm storage. Despite this, the eggs are laid singly, a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation.

The order <a href="Gymnophiona">Gymnophiona</a> (from the Greek "gymnos" meaning "naked" and "ophis" meaning "serpent") or Apoda (from the Latin "an-" meaning "without" and the Greek "poda" meaning "legs") comprises the caecilians. These are long, cylindrical, limbless animals with a snake- or <a href="Annelid">worm-like</a> form. The adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres (3 to 30 inches) with the exception of <a href="Caecilia%20thompsoni">Thomson's caecilian</a> ("Caecilia thompsoni"), which can reach . A caecilian's skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales. It has rudimentary eyes covered in skin, which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity. It also has a pair of short <a href="tentacle">tentacle</a>s near the eye that can be extended and which have <a href="Somatosensory%20system">tactile</a> and <a href="Olfaction">olfactory</a> functions. Most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil, in rotten wood and under plant debris, but some are aquatic. Most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch, they make their way to adjacent bodies of water. Others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch. A few species give birth to live young, nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct. Caecilians have a mostly <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>n distribution, being found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Central and South America.

The structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates, such as the presence of highly <a href="Keratin%23Cornification">cornified</a> outer layers, renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the <a href="pituitary%20gland">pituitary</a> and <a href="thyroid">thyroid</a> glands. Local thickenings (often called warts) are common, such as those found on toads. The outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece, in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes. Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin. Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the <a href="dermis">dermis</a> between the furrows in the skin. The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial. <a href="Squamata">Lizards</a> and some frogs have somewhat similar <a href="osteoderm">osteoderm</a>s forming bony deposits in the dermis, but this is an example of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a> with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages.

Amphibian skin is permeable to water. Gas exchange can take place through the skin (<a href="cutaneous%20respiration">cutaneous respiration</a>) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds. To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect. The main poison-producing glands, the <a href="Parotoid%20gland">paratoids</a>, produce the neurotoxin <a href="bufotoxin">bufotoxin</a> and are located behind the ears of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.

The skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called <a href="chromatophore">chromatophore</a>s. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by <a href="hormone">hormone</a>s secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.

Amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a> to other tetrapods, though with a number of variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully <a href="ossification">ossified</a> and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral girdle</a> is supported by muscle, and the well-developed <a href="pelvic%20girdle">pelvic girdle</a> is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.
In most amphibians, there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some salamanders have fewer digits and the <a href="amphiuma">amphiuma</a>s are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The <a href="Siren%20%28genus%29">sirens</a> are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.

In frogs, the hind legs are larger than the fore legs, especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus "<a href="Aneides">Aneides</a>" and certain <a href="lungless%20salamander">plethodontids</a> climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal</a> and <a href="ventral%20fin">ventral</a> fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.

Salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as <a href="autotomy">autotomy</a>. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated. Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.

Amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation is similar to that of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the <a href="pulmonary%20artery">pulmonary artery</a> to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.

The <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> is basically the same as in other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish. It is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving <a href="Pain%20in%20amphibians">pain</a>. The brain consists of equal parts, <a href="cerebrum">cerebrum</a>, <a href="midbrain">midbrain</a> and <a href="cerebellum">cerebellum</a>. Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input, such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe, and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning. The cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the <a href="medulla%20oblongata">medulla oblongata</a> controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body. The <a href="pineal%20body">pineal body</a>, known to regulate sleep patterns in humans, is thought to produce the hormones involved in <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a> and <a href="aestivation">aestivation</a> in amphibians.

Tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess <a href="Electroreception">electroreceptors</a> that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular <a href="Tympanum%20%28anatomy%29">eardrum</a> lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the <a href="stapes">stapes</a>, to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism. There is a patch of specialized haircells, called "papilla amphibiorum", in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals. The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.

The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, the <a href="cornea">cornea</a> becomes more dome-shaped, the <a href="Lens%20%28anatomy%29">lens</a> becomes flatter, and <a href="eyelid">eyelid</a>s and associated glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths.

Many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by <a href="inertia">inertia</a>. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short <a href="Esophagus">oesophagus</a> is lined with <a href="Cilium">cilia</a> that help to move the food to the stomach and <a href="mucus">mucus</a> produced by glands in the mouth and <a href="pharynx">pharynx</a> eases its passage. The enzyme <a href="chitinase">chitinase</a> produced in the stomach helps digest the <a href="chitin">chitin</a>ous cuticle of arthropod prey.

Amphibians possess a <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a>, <a href="liver">liver</a> and <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a>. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is determined by its function as a <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a> and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. <a href="Adipose%20tissue">Adipose tissue</a> is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.
There are two <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s located dorsally, near the roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.

The lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes, possessing few internal <a href="alveolar%20septum">septa</a> and large <a href="Pulmonary%20alveolus">alveoli</a>, and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by <a href="buccal%20pumping">buccal pumping</a>. Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient <a href="cutaneous%20respiration">cutaneous respiration</a>, the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate. Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the <a href="Telmatobius%20culeus">Titicaca water frog</a> and the <a href="Cryptobranchus">hellbender salamander</a>. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the <a href="Plethodontidae">plethodontid salamanders</a>, which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the <a href="axolotl">axolotl</a>) retaining gills as aquatic adults.

For the purpose of <a href="Biological%20reproduction">reproduction</a> most amphibians require <a href="fresh%20water">fresh water</a> although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. "<a href="Fejervarya%20raja">Fejervarya raja</a>") can inhabit brackish water, but there are no true <a href="marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such was the case with the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> invasion of the natural hybrid "<a href="Pelophylax%20esculentus">Pelophylax esculentus</a>" reported in 2010.

Several hundred frog species in <a href="adaptive%20radiation">adaptive radiation</a>s (e.g., "<a href="Eleutherodactylus">Eleutherodactylus</a>", the Pacific "<a href="Platymantis">Platymantis</a>", the Australo-Papuan <a href="microhylid">microhylid</a>s, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water for <a href="breeding%20in%20the%20wild">breeding in the wild</a>. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20moist%20broadleaf%20forests">tropical rainforests</a> and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the <a href="tadpole">tadpole</a> stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.

In the tropics, many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.

In caecilians, fertilisation is internal, the male extruding an <a href="intromittent%20organ">intromittent organ</a>, the phallodeum, and inserting it into the female cloaca. The paired Müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian <a href="prostate">prostate</a> glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct.

The majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone, on the <a href="Substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a> either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called <a href="amplexus">amplexus</a>. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, <a href="Hynobiidae">Hynobiidae</a> and <a href="Cryptobranchidae">Cryptobranchidae</a> practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.

With a few exceptions, frogs use external fertilisation. The male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs, or in the case of "<a href="Epipedobates%20tricolor">Epipedobates tricolor</a>", around the neck. They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm. Roughened nuptial pads on the male's hands aid in retaining grip. Often the male collects and retains the egg mass, forming a sort of basket with the hind feet. An exception is the <a href="granular%20poison%20frog">granular poison frog</a> ("Oophaga granulifera") where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously. The <a href="tailed%20frog">tailed frog</a> ("Ascaphus truei") exhibits internal fertilisation. The "tail" is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female. This frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs. The sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the <a href="oviduct">oviduct</a> until the following spring.

Most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders. Typically, prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site, the males usually arriving first, calling and setting up territories. Other satellite males remain quietly nearby, waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory. The females arrive sporadically, mate selection takes place and eggs are laid. The females depart and territories may change hands. More females appear and in due course, the breeding season comes to an end. Explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall. These frogs are typically <a href="wikt%3Afossorial">fossorial</a> species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site. They are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place, perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season. The assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues, the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females.

There is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts, with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female's attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to <a href="mating">mate</a> with. Some species store <a href="sperm">sperm</a> through long breeding seasons, as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm.

Most amphibians go through <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a>, a process of significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by <a href="thyroxine">thyroxine</a> concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and <a href="prolactin">prolactin</a>, which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.

The egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing <a href="mucoprotein">mucoprotein</a>s and <a href="mucopolysaccharide">mucopolysaccharide</a>s. This capsule is permeable to water and gases, and swells considerably as it absorbs water. The ovum is at first rigidly held, but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the <a href="embryo">embryo</a> to move freely. This also happens in salamander eggs, even when they are unfertilised. Eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae. These penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis. They seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality. Most eggs contain the pigment <a href="melanin">melanin</a> which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against <a href="ultraviolet%20radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a>. Caecilians, some <a href="plethodontid">plethodontid</a> salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented. In the <a href="wood%20frog">wood frog</a> ("Rana sylvatica"), the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to warmer than its surroundings, which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat.

The eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups, or may take the form of spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander "<a href="Ensatina">Ensatina</a>" attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The <a href="Eleutherodactylus%20planirostris">greenhouse frog</a> ("Eleutherodactylus planirostris") lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage. The <a href="tungara%20frog">tungara frog</a> ("Physalaemus pustulosus") builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties. It contains no <a href="detergent">detergent</a>s but is created by whipping up <a href="protein">protein</a>s and <a href="lectin">lectin</a>s secreted by the female.

The eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the <a href="alpine%20salamander">alpine salamander</a> ("Salamandra atra") and some of the <a href="Nectophrynoides">African live-bearing toads</a> ("Nectophrynoides spp.") are <a href="Vivipary">viviparous</a>. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are <a href="Ovoviviparity">ovoviviparous</a>. The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body, but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species. The toad genus "Nectophrynoides" exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.

Frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. The free-living larvae are normally fully aquatic, but the tadpoles of some species (such as "<a href="Nannophrys%20ceylonensis">Nannophrys ceylonensis</a>") are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks. Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), <a href="lateral%20line%20system">lateral line system</a>s and large tails that they use for swimming. Newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills. The lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs, the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air. Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. These larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place. While tadpoles do not have true teeth, in most species, the jaws have long, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak. Front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later.
Iodine and T4 (over stimulate the spectacular <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> [programmed cell death] of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins) also stimulate the <a href="evolution%20of%20nervous%20systems">evolution of nervous systems</a> transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological, visuospatial, olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting.

In fact, tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a>. Pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of <a href="algae">algae</a> and bacteria. They also feed on <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s, filtered from the water through the <a href="gill">gill</a>s, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the <a href="Cuban%20tree%20frog">Cuban tree frog</a> ("Osteopilus septentrionalis") can occasionally be <a href="Cannibalism%20%28zoology%29">cannibalistic</a>, the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.
At metamorphosis, rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.

At hatching, a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both upper and lower jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">dorsal</a> and <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">ventral</a> fins. The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera "<a href="Ambystoma">Ambystoma</a>" and "<a href="Dicamptodon">Dicamptodon</a>" have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form, but this varies with species and with populations. The <a href="northwestern%20salamander">northwestern salamander</a> ("Ambystoma gracile") is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as <a href="neoteny">neoteny</a>, or transforms into an adult. Both of these are able to breed. Neoteny occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine. Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a>s. The <a href="tiger%20salamander">tiger salamander</a> ("Ambystoma tigrinum") also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process. The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state. When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out. There are fifteen species of <a href="wikt%3Aobligate">obligate</a> neotenic salamanders, including species of "<a href="Necturus">Necturus</a>", "<a href="Olm">Proteus</a>" and "Amphiuma", and many examples of <a href="wikt%3Afacultative">facultative</a> ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.

Lungless salamanders in the family Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus "<a href="Ensatinas">Ensatinas</a>", the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.

In newts and salamanders, metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs. This is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land. Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.

Most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water. The development of the young of "<a href="Ichthyophis%20glutinosus">Ichthyophis glutinosus</a>", a species from Sri Lanka, has been much studied. The eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water. They have three pairs of external red feathery gills, a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes, a lateral line system and a short tail with fins. They swim by undulating their body from side to side. They are mostly active at night, soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land. Metamorphosis is gradual. By the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes, lateral line systems and tails. The skin thickens, embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments. By this time, the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.
In the majority of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. "<a href="Typhlonectes%20compressicauda">Typhlonectes compressicauda</a>", a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths as long as their mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.

The ringed caecilian ("<a href="Siphonops%20annulatus">Siphonops annulatus</a>") has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction. The progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy. The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate. Meanwhile, they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.

The care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.

Many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The <a href="black%20mountain%20salamander">black mountain salamander</a> ("Desmognathus welteri") does this, the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders. The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.
The male "<a href="Colostethus%20subpunctatus">Colostethus subpunctatus</a>", a tiny frog, protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male transports the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off. The male <a href="Common%20midwife%20toad">midwife toad</a> ("Alytes obstetricans") winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks. He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles. The female <a href="gastric-brooding%20frog">gastric-brooding frog</a> ("Rheobatrachus spp.") reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings; however, this stage was never observed before the species became extinct. The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply. The <a href="pouched%20frog">pouched frog</a> ("Assa darlingtoni") lays eggs on the ground. When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs. The aquatic <a href="Surinam%20toad">Surinam toad</a> ("Pipa pipa") raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis. The granular poison frog ("Oophaga granulifera") is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family <a href="Dendrobatidae">Dendrobatidae</a>. Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the <a href="wikt%3Aaxil">axil</a> of a leaf or the <a href="Rosette%20%28botany%29">rosette</a> of a <a href="Bromeliaceae">bromeliad</a>. The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.

With a few exceptions, adult amphibians are <a href="Predation">predators</a>, feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow. The diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles, caterpillars, earthworms and spiders. The sirens ("<a href="Siren%20%28genus%29">Siren spp.</a>") often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a Brazilian tree frog ("<a href="Xenohyla%20truncata">Xenohyla truncata</a>") includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet. The <a href="Mexican%20burrowing%20toad">Mexican burrowing toad</a> ("Rhinophrynus dorsalis") has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites. It projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first, their tongues being hinged at the front.

Food is mostly selected by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and <a href="Rana%20clamitans">green frogs</a> ("Rana clamitans") have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.

Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it. They typically have small hinged <a href="pedicellate%20teeth">pedicellate teeth</a>, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown of these are composed of <a href="dentine">dentine</a> separated by an <a href="Calcification">uncalcified</a> layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs ("Rana spp.") lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads ("Bufo spp.") have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also <a href="vomerine%20teeth">vomerine teeth</a> attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.
The <a href="tiger%20salamander">tiger salamander</a> ("Ambystoma tigrinum") is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the "Bufo spp." toads, actively search for prey, while the <a href="Argentine%20horned%20frog">Argentine horned frog</a> ("Ceratophrys ornata") lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes. Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged. Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.

When they are newly hatched, frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg. When this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually at the bottom of their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths. Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.

The calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the <a href="California%20giant%20salamander">California giant salamander</a> ("Dicamptodon ensatus") has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.
Frogs are much more vocal, especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an <a href="Gular%20skin">air sac</a> or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog ("Osteopilus septentrionalis") produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.

Little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.
In salamanders, defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder. This may involve snapping, chasing and sometimes biting, occasionally causing the loss of a tail. The behaviour of <a href="red%20back%20salamander">red back salamander</a>s ("Plethodon cinereus") has been much studied. 91% of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre (yard) of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock. A similar proportion, when moved experimentally a distance of , found their way back to their home base. The salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair. These deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas. Much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals. An aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively. If the intruder persisted, a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso-labial grooves. Damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival, either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food.

In frogs, male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates. In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males. Much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires. There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders. Holders of territories have a "home advantage" and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs. If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place. Fighting methods include pushing and shoving, deflating the opponent's vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.

Amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins, and lack claws, defensive armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow <a href="African%20clawed%20frog">African clawed frog</a>s ("Xenopus laevis"), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian ("Typhlonectes compressicauda") produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The <a href="rough-skinned%20newt">rough-skinned newt</a> ("Taricha granulosa") from North America and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin <a href="tetrodotoxin">tetrodotoxin</a> (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by <a href="pufferfish">pufferfish</a>. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of <a href="Common%20Garter%20Snake">common garter snake</a> ("Thamnophis sirtalis").
In locations where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity. <a href="Coevolution">Coevolution</a> occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.

Poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black, with the <a href="fire%20salamander">fire salamander</a> ("Salamandra salamandra") being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the <a href="fire-bellied%20toad">fire-bellied toad</a> ("Bombina spp."), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog "<a href="Allobates%20zaparo">Allobates zaparo</a>" is not poisonous, but <a href="Batesian%20mimicry">mimics</a> the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.

Many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a> to avoid being detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American <a href="northern%20short-tailed%20shrew">northern short-tailed shrew</a> ("Blarina brevicauda"). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.
Some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce, and some spadefoot toads ("<a href="Pelobates">Pelobates</a> spp") scream and leap towards the attacker. Giant salamanders of the genus "<a href="Andrias">Andrias</a>", as well as <a href="Ceratophryinae">Ceratophrine</a> and "<a href="Pyxicephalus">Pyxicephalus</a>" frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite. The <a href="blackbelly%20salamander">blackbelly salamander</a> ("Desmognathus quadramaculatus") can bite an attacking common garter snake ("Thamnophis sirtalis") two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape.

In amphibians, there is evidence of <a href="habituation">habituation</a>, <a href="associative%20learning">associative learning</a> through both <a href="Classical%20conditioning">classical</a> and <a href="instrumental%20learning">instrumental learning</a>, and discrimination abilities.

In one experiment, when offered live fruit flies ("<a href="Drosophila">Drosophila</a> virilis"), salamanders choose the larger of 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3. Frogs can distinguish between low numbers (1 vs 2, 2 vs 3, but not 3 vs 4) and large numbers (3 vs 6, 4 vs 8, but not 4 vs 6) of prey. This is irrespective of other characteristics, i.e. surface area, volume, weight and movement, although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area.

Dramatic declines in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized <a href="extinction">extinction</a>, have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. In 2004, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) reported stating that currently birds, mammals, and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.
In 2006 there were believed to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and modification, <a href="over-exploitation">over-exploitation</a>, pollution, <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a>, <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the <a href="ozone%20layer">ozone layer</a> (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like <a href="chytridiomycosis">chytridiomycosis</a>. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.
With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often considered to be <a href="ecological%20indicator">ecological indicator</a>s. In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass. Any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation. The loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species. In the Middle East, a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es. Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline. The <a href="western%20terrestrial%20garter%20snake">western terrestrial garter snake</a> ("Thamnophis elegans") in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers, the <a href="Yosemite%20toad">Yosemite toad</a> ("Bufo canorus") and the <a href="mountain%20yellow-legged%20frog">mountain yellow-legged frog</a> ("Rana muscosa"), putting the snake's future at risk. If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it. Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles. These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on <a href="detritus">detritus</a> that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose. Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.

A <a href="global%20strategy">global strategy</a> to stem the crisis was released in 2005 in the form of the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. <a href="Amphibian%20Ark">Amphibian Ark</a> is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.

Alaska

Alaska () is a <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> located in the northwest extremity of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. The <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">Canadian administrative divisions</a> of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> and <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a> border the state to the east, its most extreme western part is <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu Island</a>, and it has a maritime border with <a href="Russia">Russia</a> to the west across the <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a>. To the north are the <a href="Chukchi%20Sea">Chukchi</a> and <a href="Beaufort%20Sea">Beaufort</a> seas–the southern parts of the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>. The <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> lies to the south and southwest. It is the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20area">largest state</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> by area and the 
<a href="List%20of%20country%20subdivisions%20by%20area">seventh largest subnational division in the world</a>. In addition, it is the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20population">3rd least populous</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20population%20density">most sparsely populated</a> of the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states">50 United States</a>; nevertheless, it is by far the most populous territory located mostly north of the <a href="60th%20parallel%20north">60th parallel</a> in North America, its population (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) more than quadrupling the combined populations of <a href="Northern%20Canada">Northern Canada</a> and <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the <a href="Anchorage%20metropolitan%20area">Anchorage metropolitan area</a>. Alaska's economy is dominated by the <a href="fishing">fishing</a>, <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>, and <a href="petroleum">oil</a> industries, resources which it has in abundance. <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">Military</a> bases and tourism are also a significant part of the <a href="Economy%20of%20Alaska">economy</a>.

The United States <a href="Alaska%20Purchase">purchased Alaska</a> from the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> on March 30, 1867, for 7.2 million U.S. dollars at approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a <a href="Territories%20of%20the%20United%20States">territory</a> on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.

The name "Alaska" () was introduced in the <a href="Russian%20America">Russian colonial period</a> when it was used to refer to the <a href="Alaska%20Peninsula">peninsula</a>. It was derived from an <a href="Aleut%20language">Aleut</a>, or <a href="Unangam">Unangam</a> <a href="idiom">idiom</a>, which figuratively refers to the mainland of Alaska. Literally, it means "object to which the action of the sea is directed".

Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States and has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> extend into the <a href="Eastern%20Hemisphere">Eastern Hemisphere</a>. Alaska is the only non-<a href="contiguous">contiguous</a> U.S. state on continental North America; about of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> (Canada) separates Alaska from <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>. It is technically part of the <a href="Continental%20United%20States">continental U.S.</a>, but is sometimes not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous U.S.</a>, often called <a href="Outside%20%28Alaska%29">"the Lower 48"</a>. The capital city, <a href="Juneau">Juneau</a>, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.

The state is bordered by <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a> and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> in Canada, to the east, the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Alaska">Gulf of Alaska</a> and the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> to the south and southwest, the <a href="Bering%20Sea">Bering Sea</a>, <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a>, and <a href="Chukchi%20Sea">Chukchi Sea</a> to the west and the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> to the north. Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian <a href="Big%20Diomede%20Island">Big Diomede Island</a> and Alaskan <a href="Little%20Diomede%20Island">Little Diomede Island</a> are only apart. Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.

Alaska is the largest state in the United States by total area at , over twice the size of <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, the next largest state. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries. Counting territorial waters, Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states: Texas, <a href="California">California</a>, and <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. It is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest U.S. states.

There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six widely accepted regions:

The most populous region of Alaska, containing <a href="Anchorage">Anchorage</a>, the <a href="Matanuska-Susitna%20Valley">Matanuska-Susitna Valley</a> and the <a href="Kenai%20Peninsula">Kenai Peninsula</a>. Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the <a href="Alaska%20Range">Alaska Range</a> and west of the <a href="Wrangell%20Mountains">Wrangell Mountains</a> also fall within the definition of South Central, as do the <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a> area and the communities of <a href="Cordova%2C%20Alaska">Cordova</a> and <a href="Valdez%2C%20Alaska">Valdez</a>.

Also referred to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States. As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the <a href="Alaska%20Purchase">Alaska Purchase</a>. The region is dominated by the <a href="Alexander%20Archipelago">Alexander Archipelago</a> as well as the <a href="Tongass%20National%20Forest">Tongass National Forest</a>, the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital <a href="Juneau">Juneau</a>, the former capital <a href="Sitka%2C%20Alaska">Sitka</a>, and <a href="Ketchikan">Ketchikan</a>, at one time Alaska's largest city. The <a href="Alaska%20Marine%20Highway">Alaska Marine Highway</a> provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities (<a href="Haines%2C%20Alaska">Haines</a>, <a href="Hyder%2C%20Alaska">Hyder</a> and <a href="Skagway%2C%20Alaska">Skagway</a>) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system. Officially designated in 1963.

The Interior is the largest region of Alaska; much of it is uninhabited wilderness. <a href="Fairbanks%2C%20Alaska">Fairbanks</a> is the only large city in the region. <a href="Denali%20National%20Park%20and%20Preserve">Denali National Park and Preserve</a> is located here. "<a href="Denali">Denali</a>" is the highest <a href="mountain">mountain</a> in North America.

Southwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. <a href="Kodiak%20Island">Kodiak Island</a> is also located in Southwest. The massive <a href="Yukon%E2%80%93Kuskokwim%20Delta">Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta</a>, one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here. Portions of the <a href="Alaska%20Peninsula">Alaska Peninsula</a> are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).

The North Slope is mostly <a href="tundra">tundra</a> peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the <a href="National%20Petroleum%20Reserve%E2%80%93Alaska">National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska</a> and the <a href="Prudhoe%20Bay%20Oil%20Field">Prudhoe Bay Oil Field</a>. <a href="Barrow%2C%20Alaska">Barrow</a>, the northernmost city in the United States, is located here. The <a href="Northwest%20Arctic%20Borough%2C%20Alaska">Northwest Arctic area</a>, anchored by <a href="Kotzebue%2C%20Alaska">Kotzebue</a> and also containing the <a href="Kobuk%20River">Kobuk River</a> valley, is often regarded as being part of this region. However, the respective <a href="Inupiat%20people">Inupiat</a> of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.

More than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches over into the Pacific Ocean. Some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, but the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a> was drawn west of <a href="180th%20meridian">180°</a> to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day. Two of the islands, <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu</a> and <a href="Kiska">Kiska</a>, were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.

With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly of tidal shoreline. The <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> chain extends west from the southern tip of the <a href="Alaska%20Peninsula">Alaska Peninsula</a>. Many active <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. <a href="Unimak%20Island">Unimak Island</a>, for example, is home to <a href="Mount%20Shishaldin">Mount Shishaldin</a>, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to above the North Pacific. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's <a href="Mount%20Fuji">Mount Fuji</a>. The chain of volcanoes extends to <a href="Mount%20Spurr">Mount Spurr</a>, west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of <a href="Wrangellia">Wrangellia</a>, a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>, which is actively undergoing <a href="plate%20tectonics">continent building</a>.

One of the world's largest tides occurs in <a href="Turnagain%20Arm">Turnagain Arm</a>, just south of Anchorage – tidal differences can be more than .
Alaska has more than three million lakes. <a href="Marshland">Marshland</a>s and wetland <a href="permafrost">permafrost</a> cover (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Glacier ice covers some of land and of tidal zone. The <a href="Bering%20Glacier">Bering Glacier</a> complex near the southeastern border with Yukon covers alone. With over 100,000 glaciers, Alaska has half of all in the world.

According to an October 1998 report by the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">United States Bureau of Land Management</a>, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. federal government</a> as public lands, including a multitude of <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">national forests</a>, national parks, and <a href="national%20wildlife%20refuge">national wildlife refuge</a>s. Of these, the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> manages , or 23.8% of the state. The <a href="Arctic%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> is managed by the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a>. It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising .

Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns , its entitlement under the <a href="Alaska%20Statehood%20Act">Alaska Statehood Act</a>. A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs. Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The <a href="University%20of%20Alaska">University of Alaska</a>, as a <a href="land%20grant%20university">land grant university</a>, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.

Another are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Claims%20Settlement%20Act">Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act</a> (ANCSA) of 1971. <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Regional%20Corporation">Regional Native corporation</a> <a href="Doyon%2C%20Limited">Doyon, Limited</a> often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications. Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Allotment%20Act">Individual Native allotments</a> can be and are sold on the open market, however.

Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state. Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.

The climate in Southeast Alaska is a mid-latitude <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>: "Cfb") in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen "Cfc") in the northern parts. On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over of precipitation a year, and <a href="Ketchikan%2C%20Alaska">Ketchikan</a> averages over . This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.

The climate of <a href="Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Anchorage</a> and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, <a href="Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Anchorage</a> receives of precipitation a year, with around of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate () due to its brief, cool summers.

The climate of <a href="Southwest%20Alaska">Western Alaska</a> is determined in large part by the <a href="Bering%20Sea">Bering Sea</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Alaska">Gulf of Alaska</a>. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This <a href="region">region</a> has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the <a href="Kobuk%20River">Kobuk River</a> valley (i. e., the region around <a href="Kotzebue%20Sound">Kotzebue Sound</a>) is technically a <a href="desert">desert</a>, with portions receiving less than of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between <a href="Dillingham%2C%20Alaska">Dillingham</a> and <a href="Bethel%2C%20Alaska">Bethel</a> average around of precipitation.

The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near <a href="Fairbanks%2C%20Alaska">Fairbanks</a>. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (the low-to-mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below . Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire <a href="winter">winter</a>.

The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is in <a href="Fort%20Yukon%2C%20Alaska">Fort Yukon</a> (which is just inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915, making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States. The lowest official Alaska temperature is in <a href="Prospect%20Creek%2C%20Alaska">Prospect Creek</a> on January 23, 1971, one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in <a href="Snag%2C%20Yukon">Snag, Yukon, Canada</a>).

The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is <a href="polar%20climate">Arctic</a> () with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in <a href="Barrow%2C%20Alaska">Barrow</a> is . Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska, with many places averaging less than per year, mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year.

Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the <a href="Bering%20land%20bridge">Bering land bridge</a>. The <a href="Tlingit%20people">Tlingit people</a> developed a society with a <a href="matrilineal">matrilineal</a> kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the <a href="Haida%20people">Haida</a>, now well known for their unique arts. The <a href="Tsimshian">Tsimshian</a> people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on <a href="Annette%20Island">Annette Island</a> and found the town of <a href="Metlakatla%2C%20Alaska">Metlakatla</a>. All three of these peoples, as well as other <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Pacific%20Northwest%20Coast">indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast</a>, experienced <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating <a href="epidemics">epidemics</a> occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.

The Aleutian Islands are still home to the <a href="Aleut%20people">Aleut people</a>'s seafaring society, although they were the first Native Alaskans to be exploited by Russians. Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the <a href="Yup%27ik">Yup'ik</a>, while their cousins the <a href="Alutiiq%20people">Alutiiq ~ Sugpiaq</a> lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska. The <a href="Gwich%27in%20people">Gwich'in people</a> of the northern Interior region are <a href="Alaskan%20Athabaskans">Athabaskan</a> and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested <a href="Arctic%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a>. The North Slope and <a href="Little%20Diomede%20Island">Little Diomede Island</a> are occupied by the widespread <a href="Inupiat%20people">Inupiat people</a>.

Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century. According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several <a href="Koch%20%28boat%29">koches</a> of <a href="Semyon%20Dezhnyov">Semyon Dezhnyov</a>'s expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement. This hypothesis is based on the testimony of <a href="Chukchi%20people">Chukchi</a> geographer <a href="Nikolai%20Daurkin">Nikolai Daurkin</a>, who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the <a href="Kheuveren">Kheuveren</a> River, populated by "bearded men" who "pray to the <a href="icons">icons</a>". Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with <a href="Koyuk%20River">Koyuk River</a>.

The first European vessel to reach Alaska is generally held to be the "St. Gabriel" under the authority of the surveyor <a href="Mikhail%20Gvozdev">M. S. Gvozdev</a> and assistant navigator <a href="Ivan%20Fyodorov%20%28navigator%29">I. Fyodorov</a> on August 21, 1732, during an expedition of Siberian cossak <a href="Afanasiy%20Shestakov">A. F. Shestakov</a> and Belorussian explorer <a href="Dmitry%20Pavlutsky">Dmitry Pavlutsky</a> (1729–1735).

Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when <a href="Vitus%20Bering">Vitus Bering</a> led an <a href="second%20Kamchatka%20expedition">expedition</a> for the Russian Navy aboard the "St. Peter". After his crew returned to Russia with <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a> pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.
Between 1774 and 1800, <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20New%20Spain">Spain</a> sent several <a href="Spanish%20expeditions%20to%20the%20Pacific%20Northwest">expeditions to Alaska</a> in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and <a href="Fort%20San%20Miguel">fort</a> were built in <a href="Nootka%20Sound">Nootka Sound</a>. These expeditions gave names to places such as <a href="Valdez%2C%20Alaska">Valdez</a>, <a href="Bucareli%20Sound">Bucareli Sound</a>, and <a href="Cordova%2C%20Alaska">Cordova</a>. Later, the <a href="Russian-American%20Company">Russian-American Company</a> carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.

<a href="Sitka%2C%20Alaska">Sitka</a>, renamed <a href="New%20Archangel">New Archangel</a> from 1804 to 1867, on <a href="Baranof%20Island">Baranof Island</a> in the <a href="Alexander%20Archipelago">Alexander Archipelago</a> in what is now <a href="Southeast%20Alaska">Southeast Alaska</a>, became the capital of <a href="Russian%20America">Russian America</a>. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.

<a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">United States Secretary of State</a>, negotiated the <a href="Alaska%20Purchase">Alaska Purchase</a> (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2 million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a <a href="District%20of%20Alaska">district</a> starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. A federal <a href="United%20States%20territorial%20court">district court</a> was headquartered in Sitka.

For most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers. They organized a "provisional city government," which was Alaska's first municipal government, but not in a legal sense. Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and <a href="Home%20rule%23Home%20rule%20in%20the%20United%20States">home rule</a> for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959.

Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, <a href="Alaska%20Gold%20Rush">gold rushes</a> in Alaska and the nearby <a href="Yukon">Yukon Territory</a> brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska. Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in <a href="Sitka%2C%20Alaska">Sitka</a> until 1906, was moved north to <a href="Juneau%2C%20Alaska">Juneau</a>. Construction of the <a href="Alaska%20Governor%27s%20Mansion">Alaska Governor's Mansion</a> began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.

During World War II, the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands%20Campaign">Aleutian Islands Campaign</a> focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands – <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu</a>, <a href="Agattu">Agattu</a> and <a href="Kiska%20Island">Kiska</a> – that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943. During the occupation, one Alaskan civilian was killed by Japanese troops and nearly fifty were interned in Japan, where about half of them died. <a href="Unalaska">Unalaska</a>/<a href="Dutch%20Harbor">Dutch Harbor</a> became a significant base for the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Navy">Navy</a> <a href="submarine">submarine</a>rs.

The United States <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.

Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of <a href="James%20Wickersham">James Wickersham</a> early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.

In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.

On March 27, 1964, the massive <a href="1964%20Alaska%20earthquake">Good Friday earthquake</a> killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant <a href="tsunamis">tsunamis</a> and landslides. It was the <a href="Largest%20earthquakes%20by%20magnitude">second-most-powerful earthquake</a> in the recorded history of the world, with a <a href="moment%20magnitude%20scale">moment magnitude</a> of 9.2. It was over one thousand times more powerful than the <a href="1989%20Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake">1989 San Francisco earthquake</a>. The time of day (5:36 pm), time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.

The 1968 discovery of oil at <a href="Prudhoe%20Bay">Prudhoe Bay</a> and the 1977 completion of the <a href="Trans-Alaska%20Pipeline%20System">Trans-Alaska Pipeline System</a> led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.

In 1989, the "<a href="Exxon%20Valdez">Exxon Valdez</a>" hit a reef in the <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a>, spilling over of crude oil over of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the <a href="Arctic%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> and the proposed <a href="Pebble%20Mine">Pebble Mine</a>.

The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted <a href="inventory">inventory</a> of all reported <a href="historic%20site">historic</a> and <a href="prehistoric">prehistoric</a> sites within the state of Alaska; it is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology. The survey's inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways, with a general provision that they are over 50 years old. As of January 31, 2012, over 35,000 sites have been reported.

The <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> estimates that the population of Alaska was 738,432 on July 1, 2015, a 3.97% increase since the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a>.

In 2010, Alaska ranked as the 47th state by population, ahead of <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>, <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, and <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> (and <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>) Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world, at , with the next state, Wyoming, at . Alaska is the largest U.S. state by <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20area">area</a>, and the tenth wealthiest (per capita income). As of November 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 6.6%.

According to the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a>, Alaska had a population of 710,231. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% <a href="White%20American">White</a> (64.1% Non-Hispanic <a href="Non-Hispanic%20Whites">White</a>), 14.8% <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indian</a> and Alaska Native, 5.4% <a href="Asian%20American">Asian</a>, 3.3% <a href="African%20American">Black</a> or African American, 1.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.6% from Some Other Race, and 7.3% from Two or More Races. <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanics</a> or Latinos of any race made up 5.5% of the population.

, 50.7% of Alaska's population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., did not have two parents of non-Hispanic white ancestry).

According to the 2011 <a href="American%20Community%20Survey">American Community Survey</a>, 83.4% of people over the age of five speak only English at home. About 3.5% speak Spanish at home. About 2.2% speak another <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European language</a> at home and about 4.3% speak an <a href="Languages%20of%20Asia">Asian</a> language (including <a href="Tagalog%20language">Tagalog</a>) at home. About 5.3% speak other languages at home.

The <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Language%20Center">Alaska Native Language Center</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Alaska%20Fairbanks">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a> claims that at least 20 <a href="Alaska%20Native%20languages">Alaskan native languages</a> exist and there are also some languages with different dialects. Most of Alaska's native languages belong to either the <a href="Eskimo%E2%80%93Aleut%20languages">Eskimo–Aleut</a> or <a href="Na-Dene%20languages">Na-Dene</a> language families however some languages are thought to be <a href="Language%20isolate">isolates</a> (e.g. <a href="Haida%20language">Haida</a>) or have not yet been classified (e.g. <a href="Tsimshianic%20languages">Tsimshianic</a>).

A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 20 <a href="Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous languages</a>, known locally as "native languages".

In October 2014, the governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the state's 20 indigenous languages as official languages. This bill gave the languages symbolic recognition as official languages, though they have not been adopted for official use within the government. The 20 languages that were included in the bill are:

According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives from 2010, about 34% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations. 100,960 people identified as <a href="Evangelical%20Protestant">Evangelical Protestant</a>s, 50,866 as Roman Catholic, and 32,550 as mainline Protestants. Roughly 4% are Mormon, 0.5% are Jewish, 1% are Muslim, 0.5% are Buddhist, and 0.5% are Hindu. The largest religious denominations in Alaska were the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> with 50,866 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 38,070 adherents, <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> with 32,170 adherents, and the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> with 19,891 adherents. Alaska has been identified, along with Pacific Northwest states Washington and Oregon, as being <a href="Unchurched%20Belt">the least religious states of the USA</a>, in terms of church membership.

In 1795, the First <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> was established in <a href="Kodiak%20Island%20Borough%2C%20Alaska">Kodiak</a>. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society. As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska. Alaska also has the largest <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> population (by percentage) of any state. In 2009 there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for whom observance of <a href="halakha">halakha</a> <a href="Jewish%20law%20in%20the%20polar%20regions">may pose special problems</a>). Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including <a href="Sikhism">Sikhs</a> and <a href="Jainism">Jains</a>.

Estimates for the number of Muslims in Alaska range from 2,000 to 5,000. The <a href="Islamic%20Community%20Center%20of%20Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Islamic Community Center of Anchorage</a> began efforts in the late 1990s to construct a mosque in Anchorage. They broke ground on a building in south Anchorage in 2010 and were nearing completion in late 2014. When completed, the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world.

The 2007 <a href="gross%20state%20product">gross state product</a> was $44.9 billion, 45th in the nation. Its <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20by%20GDP%20per%20capita%20%28nominal%29">per capita personal income</a> for 2007 was $40,042, ranking 15th in the nation. According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent. The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.

Agriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.

Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.

Alaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted. Major oil and gas reserves were found in the <a href="Alaska%20North%20Slope">Alaska North Slope</a> (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the <a href="Energy%20Information%20Administration">Energy Information Administration</a>, by February 2014 Alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota, and California. Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about , although by early 2014 North Dakota's <a href="Bakken%20Formation">Bakken Formation</a> was producing over . Prudhoe Bay was the largest <a href="conventional%20oil">conventional oil</a> field ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than Canada's enormous <a href="Athabasca%20oil%20sands">Athabasca oil sands</a> field, which by 2014 was producing about of <a href="unconventional%20oil">unconventional oil</a>, and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate.

The <a href="Trans-Alaska%20Pipeline">Trans-Alaska Pipeline</a> can transport and pump up to of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins. The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> estimates that there are of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope. Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.
Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special <a href="single-wire%20earth%20return%23Use%20in%20interties">low-cost electric interties</a>) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population. The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.

The <a href="Alaska%20Permanent%20Fund">Alaska Permanent Fund</a> is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed <a href="Trans-Alaska%20Pipeline%20System">Trans-Alaska Pipeline System</a>. The fund was originally proposed by Governor <a href="Keith%20Harvey%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor <a href="Jay%20Hammond">Jay Hammond</a> and <a href="Kenai%2C%20Alaska">Kenai</a> <a href="Alaska%20House%20of%20Representatives">state representative</a> Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.

The <a href="Alaska%20Constitution">Alaska Constitution</a> was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs. Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.

Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 "Resource Rebate"). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences, and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.

The Permanent Fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a "<a href="Basic%20income">Basic Income</a>" policy in the world.

The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. Federal government employees, particularly <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.

Rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.

Due to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the <a href="Matanuska%20Valley">Matanuska Valley</a>, about northeast of <a href="Anchorage">Anchorage</a>, or on the <a href="Kenai%20Peninsula">Kenai Peninsula</a>, about southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.

The <a href="Tanana%20Valley">Tanana Valley</a> is another notable agricultural locus, especially the <a href="Delta%20Junction%2C%20Alaska">Delta Junction</a> area, about southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of <a href="Fort%20Greely">Fort Greely</a>. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and <a href="community-supported%20agriculture">community-supported agriculture</a>.

Alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of <a href="market%20gardener">market gardener</a>s, small farms and <a href="farmers%27%20market">farmers' market</a>s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide. The <a href="peony">peony</a> industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.
Alaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs. However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the <a href="Alaska%20State%20Fair">Alaska State Fair</a> in <a href="Palmer%2C%20Alaska">Palmer</a> the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. "Alaska Grown" is used as an agricultural slogan.

Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.

Hunting for subsistence, primarily <a href="caribou">caribou</a>, <a href="moose">moose</a>, and <a href="Dall%20sheep">Dall sheep</a> is still common in the state, particularly in remote <a href="The%20Bush%20%28Alaska%29">Bush</a> communities. An example of a traditional native food is <a href="Akutaq">Akutaq</a>, the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.

Alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on <a href="Seward%20Peninsula">Seward Peninsula</a>, where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.

Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from <a href="Outside%20%28Alaska%29">"Outside"</a>, and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Though most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20–30¢ higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.

Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the <a href="Alaska%20Highway">Alaska Highway</a>, the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from <a href="Haines%2C%20Alaska">Haines</a>. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.
One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the <a href="Anton%20Anderson%20Memorial%20Tunnel">Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel</a>, an active <a href="Alaska%20Railroad">Alaska Railroad</a> tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of <a href="Whittier%2C%20Alaska">Whittier</a> on <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a> to the <a href="Seward%20Highway">Seward Highway</a> about southeast of Anchorage at <a href="Portage%2C%20Alaska">Portage</a>. At , the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007. The tunnel is the longest combination <a href="List%20of%20road-rail%20tunnels">road and rail tunnel</a> in North America.

Built around 1915, the <a href="Alaska%20Railroad">Alaska Railroad</a> (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from <a href="Seward%2C%20Alaska">Seward</a> to <a href="Interior%20Alaska">Interior Alaska</a> by way of <a href="South%20Central%20Alaska">South Central Alaska</a>, passing through Anchorage, <a href="Eklutna">Eklutna</a>, Wasilla, <a href="Talkeetna%2C%20Alaska">Talkeetna</a>, <a href="Denali">Denali</a>, and Fairbanks, with spurs to <a href="Whittier%2C%20Alaska">Whittier</a>, <a href="Palmer%2C%20Alaska">Palmer</a> and <a href="North%20Pole%2C%20Alaska">North Pole</a>. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as "The Railbelt". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.

The railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near <a href="Healy%2C%20Alaska">Healy</a> to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.

The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use <a href="caboose">caboose</a>s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last <a href="Request%20stop">flag stop</a> routes in the country. A stretch of about of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.

In northern Southeast Alaska, the <a href="White%20Pass%20and%20Yukon%20Route">White Pass and Yukon Route</a> also partly runs through the state from <a href="Skagway%2C%20Alaska">Skagway</a> northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at <a href="White%20Pass">White Pass</a> Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television series "<a href="Great%20Little%20Railways">Great Little Railways</a>."

The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.

<a href="Alaska%20Rail%20Marine">Alaska Rail Marine</a> provides <a href="car%20float">car float</a> service between <a href="Whittier%2C%20Alaska">Whittier</a> and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>.

Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.

Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the <a href="Alaska%20Marine%20Highway">Alaska Marine Highway</a>) serves the cities of <a href="Southeast%20Alaska">southeast</a>, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula. The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers. The system also operates a ferry service from <a href="Bellingham%2C%20Washington">Bellingham, Washington</a> and <a href="Prince%20Rupert%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince Rupert, British Columbia</a> in Canada through the <a href="Inside%20Passage">Inside Passage</a> to <a href="Skagway%2C%20Alaska">Skagway</a>. The <a href="Inter-Island%20Ferry%20Authority">Inter-Island Ferry Authority</a> also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Island%20%28Alaska%29">Prince of Wales Island</a> region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.

In recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska's gulf coast. The population of <a href="Ketchikan%2C%20Alaska">Ketchikan</a> may rise by over 10,000 people on many days during the summer, as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock, debarking thousands of passengers.

Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed <a href="Alaskan%20Bush">bush</a> air services—an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage and, to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by <a href="Ted%20Stevens%20Anchorage%20International%20Airport%23Airlines%20and%20destinations">many major airlines</a>. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at <a href="Ted%20Stevens%20Anchorage%20International%20Airport">Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport</a> to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska received almost 2 million visitors).

Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the <a href="Essential%20Air%20Service">Essential Air Service</a> program. <a href="Alaska%20Airlines">Alaska Airlines</a> is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger <a href="Boeing%20737">Boeing 737</a>-400s) from Anchorage and <a href="Fairbanks%20International%20Airport">Fairbanks</a> to regional hubs like <a href="Bethel%2C%20Alaska">Bethel</a>, <a href="Nome%2C%20Alaska">Nome</a>, <a href="Kotzebue%2C%20Alaska">Kotzebue</a>, <a href="Dillingham%2C%20Alaska">Dillingham</a>, <a href="Kodiak%2C%20Alaska">Kodiak</a>, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.

The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as <a href="Ravn%20Alaska">Ravn Alaska</a>, <a href="PenAir">PenAir</a>, and <a href="Frontier%20Flying%20Service">Frontier Flying Service</a>. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the <a href="Cessna%20Caravan">Cessna Caravan</a>, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.

Many communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is <a href="Lake%20Hood%20Seaplane%20Base">Lake Hood</a>, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state.

Another Alaskan transportation method is the <a href="dogsled">dogsled</a>. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog <a href="mushing">mushing</a> is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the <a href="Iditarod%20Trail%20Sled%20Dog%20Race">Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</a>, a trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at ). The race commemorates the famous <a href="1925%20serum%20run%20to%20Nome">1925 serum run to Nome</a> in which mushers and dogs like <a href="Togo%20%28dog%29">Togo</a> and <a href="Balto">Balto</a> took much-needed medicine to the <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>-stricken community of <a href="Nome%2C%20Alaska">Nome</a> when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The "Serum Run" is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of <a href="Nenana%2C%20Alaska">Nenana</a> (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.

In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by <a href="all-terrain%20vehicle">all-terrain vehicle</a> and in winter by <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a> or "snow machine," as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.

Alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: <a href="GCI%20%28company%29">GCI</a> and <a href="Alaska%20Communications">Alaska Communications</a>. GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and as of late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised that it has "two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska. In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government.

Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three <a href="separation%20of%20powers">branches of government</a>: an <a href="executive%20branch">executive branch</a> consisting of the <a href="Governor%20of%20Alaska">Governor of Alaska</a> and the other independently elected constitutional officers; a <a href="legislative%20branch">legislative branch</a> consisting of the <a href="Alaska%20House%20of%20Representatives">Alaska House of Representatives</a> and <a href="Alaska%20Senate">Alaska Senate</a>; and a <a href="judicial%20branch">judicial branch</a> consisting of the <a href="Alaska%20Supreme%20Court">Alaska Supreme Court</a> and lower courts.

The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people statewide.

The <a href="Alaska%20Legislature">Alaska Legislature</a> consists of a 40-member <a href="Alaska%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> and a 20-member <a href="Alaska%20Senate">Senate</a>. Senators serve four-year terms and House members two. The <a href="Governor%20of%20Alaska">Governor of Alaska</a> serves four-year terms. The <a href="List%20of%20Lieutenant%20Governors%20of%20Alaska">lieutenant governor</a> runs separately from the governor in the <a href="Primary%20election">primaries</a>, but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket.

Alaska's court system has four levels: the <a href="Alaska%20Supreme%20Court">Alaska Supreme Court</a>, the <a href="Alaska%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Alaska Court of Appeals</a>, the superior courts and the district courts. The superior and district courts are <a href="trial%20court">trial court</a>s. Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts only hear certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.

The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are <a href="appellate%20court">appellate court</a>s. The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>. The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.

Although in its early years of statehood Alaska was a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>-leaning. Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights. <a href="Alaska%20Natives">Alaska Natives</a>, while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Regional%20Corporations">Native corporations</a>. These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship.

Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.

The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the <a href="Alaskan%20Independence%20Party">Alaskan Independence Party</a>.

Six <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> and four <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> have served as governor of Alaska. In addition, Republican Governor <a href="Wally%20Hickel">Wally Hickel</a> was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected. He officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994.

Alaska's voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on February 24, 2015, placing Alaska alongside Colorado and Washington as the first three U.S. states where recreational marijuana is legal. The new law means people over age 21 can consume small amounts of pot – if they can find it. There is a rather lengthy and involved application process, per <a href="Alaska%20Measure%202%20%282014%29">Alaska Measure 2 (2014)</a>. The first legal marijuana store opened in Valdez in October 2016.

To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies. This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States. It is one of five states with no state <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a>, one of seven states that do not levy an individual <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a>, and one of the two states that has neither. The Department of Revenue Tax Division reports regularly on the state's revenue sources. The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division.

While Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1.0–7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, <a href="severance%20tax">severance tax</a>es, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.

<a href="Fairbanks%2C%20Alaska">Fairbanks</a> has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the <a href="Fairbanks%20North%20Star%20Borough">Fairbanks North Star Borough</a> (FNSB). A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times, but has yet to be approved, leading lawmakers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco.

In 2014 the <a href="Tax%20Foundation">Tax Foundation</a> ranked Alaska as having the fourth most "business friendly" tax policy, behind only <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>, and <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>.

Alaska regularly supports <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> in presidential elections and has done so since statehood. Republicans have won the state's <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral college</a> votes in all but one election that it has participated in (<a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201964">1964</a>). No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> nominee <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> during his landslide election in <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201964">1964</a>, while the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201960">1960</a> and <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201968">1968</a> elections were close. Since <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201972">1972</a>, however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">2008</a>, Republican <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a> defeated Democrat <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a>, the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">2012</a>, but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968.

The <a href="The%20Bush%20%28Alaska%29">Alaska Bush</a>, central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the <a href="University%20of%20Alaska%20Fairbanks">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a> campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing. , well over half of all registered voters have chosen "Non-Partisan" or "Undeclared" as their affiliation, despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters.

Because of its population relative to other U.S. states, Alaska has only one member in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>. This seat is held by Republican <a href="Don%20Young">Don Young</a>, who was re-elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012. <a href="Alaska%27s%20at-large%20congressional%20district">Alaska's at-large congressional district</a> is one of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the world.

In 2008, Governor <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a> became the first Republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>'s running mate. She continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor's job in July 2009.

<a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Senators%20from%20Alaska">Alaska's United States Senators</a> belong to <a href="Classes%20of%20United%20States%20Senators">Class 2 and Class 3</a>. In 2008, Democrat <a href="Mark%20Begich">Mark Begich</a>, mayor of Anchorage, defeated long-time Republican senator <a href="Ted%20Stevens">Ted Stevens</a>. Stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on Senate financial discloser forms one week before the election. The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.

Republican <a href="Frank%20Murkowski">Frank Murkowski</a> held the state's other senatorial position. After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State Representative <a href="Lisa%20Murkowski">Lisa Murkowski</a> as his successor. She won full six-year terms in 2004 and 2010.

Alaska is not divided into <a href="County%20%28United%20States%29">counties</a>, as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into "<a href="List%20of%20boroughs%20and%20census%20areas%20in%20Alaska">boroughs</a>". Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the <a href="Unorganized%20Borough%2C%20Alaska">Unorganized Borough</a>.

The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the <a href="U.S.%20Census%20Bureau">U.S. Census Bureau</a> in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 <a href="census%20area">census area</a>s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation. A "recording district" is a mechanism for administration of the <a href="public%20record">public record</a> in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State <a href="recorder%20of%20deeds">Recorder</a>. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.

Whereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the <a href="Unorganized%20Borough">Unorganized Borough</a>. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.

Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the <a href="Fairbanks%20North%20Star%20Borough">Fairbanks North Star Borough</a>) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).

The state's most populous city is <a href="Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Anchorage</a>, home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. The richest <a href="Alaska%20locations%20by%20per%20capita%20income">location in Alaska by per capita income</a> is <a href="Halibut%20Cove%2C%20Alaska">Halibut Cove</a> ($89,895). <a href="Yakutat%20City">Yakutat City</a>, Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20cities%20by%20area">largest cities in the U.S. by area</a>.

As reflected in the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a>, Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and <a href="census-designated%20place">census-designated place</a>s (CDPs). The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a <a href="consolidated%20city%E2%80%93county">consolidated city–county</a>. The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as "<a href="The%20Bush%20%28Alaska%29">The Bush</a>" and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.

Of Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla. CDPs have not been established for these areas by the <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the <a href="1980%20United%20States%20Census">1980 Census</a> (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North <a href="Tongass%20Highway">Tongass Highway</a>, <a href="Pennock%20Island">Pennock Island</a> and <a href="Saxman%2C%20Alaska">Saxman</a> East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the <a href="Unorganized%20Borough">Unorganized Borough</a>, in largely remote areas.

The <a href="Alaska%20Department%20of%20Education%20and%20Early%20Development">Alaska Department of Education and Early Development</a> administers many <a href="List%20of%20school%20districts%20in%20Alaska">school districts</a> in Alaska. In addition, the state operates a boarding school, <a href="Mt.%20Edgecumbe%20High%20School">Mt. Edgecumbe High School</a> in <a href="Sitka%2C%20Alaska">Sitka</a>, and provides partial funding for other boarding schools, including <a href="Nenana%20Student%20Living%20Center">Nenana Student Living Center</a> in <a href="Nenana%2C%20Alaska">Nenana</a> and The Galena Interior Learning Academy in <a href="Galena%2C%20Alaska">Galena</a>.

There are more than a dozen <a href="List%20of%20colleges%20and%20universities%20in%20Alaska">colleges and universities in Alaska</a>. Accredited universities in Alaska include the <a href="University%20of%20Alaska%20Anchorage">University of Alaska Anchorage</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Alaska%20Fairbanks">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Alaska%20Southeast">University of Alaska Southeast</a>, and <a href="Alaska%20Pacific%20University">Alaska Pacific University</a>. Alaska is the only state that has no institutions that are part of the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29">Division I</a>.

The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development operates AVTEC, Alaska's Institute of Technology. Campuses in Seward and Anchorage offer 1 week to 11-month training programs in areas as diverse as Information Technology, Welding, Nursing, and Mechanics.

Alaska has had a problem with a "<a href="brain%20drain">brain drain</a>". Many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state after high school graduation and do not return. , Alaska did not have a <a href="Legal%20education%20in%20Alaska">law school</a> or medical school. The <a href="University%20of%20Alaska">University of Alaska</a> has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program.

The <a href="Alaska%20State%20Troopers">Alaska State Troopers</a> are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on "Public Safety Officers" who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.

Many rural communities in Alaska are considered "dry," having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages. Suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban.

<a href="Domestic%20abuse">Domestic abuse</a> and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse. Alaska has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation, especially in rural areas. The average age of sexually assaulted victims is 16 years old. In four out of five cases, the suspects were relatives, friends or acquaintances.

Some of Alaska's popular annual events are the <a href="Iditarod%20Trail%20Sled%20Dog%20Race">Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</a> that starts in Anchorage and ends in Nome, World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, the Blueberry Festival and Alaska Hummingbird Festival in <a href="Ketchikan%2C%20Alaska">Ketchikan</a>, the <a href="Sitka%20Whale%20Fest">Sitka Whale Fest</a>, and the Stikine River Garnet Fest in <a href="Wrangell%2C%20Alaska">Wrangell</a>. The <a href="Stikine%20River">Stikine River</a> attracts the largest springtime concentration of <a href="American%20bald%20eagle">American bald eagle</a>s in the world.

The <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Heritage%20Center">Alaska Native Heritage Center</a> celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups. Their purpose is to encourage cross-cultural exchanges among all people and enhance self-esteem among Native people. The <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Arts%20Foundation">Alaska Native Arts Foundation</a> promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, using the internet.

Influences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe. Prominent musicians from Alaska include singer <a href="Jewel%20%28singer%29">Jewel</a>, traditional Aleut flautist <a href="Mary%20Youngblood">Mary Youngblood</a>, folk singer-songwriter <a href="Libby%20Roderick">Libby Roderick</a>, Christian music singer-songwriter <a href="Lincoln%20Brewster">Lincoln Brewster</a>, metal/post hardcore band <a href="36%20Crazyfists">36 Crazyfists</a> and the groups <a href="Pamyua">Pamyua</a> and <a href="Portugal.%20The%20Man">Portugal. The Man</a>.

There are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the <a href="Alaska%20Folk%20Festival">Alaska Folk Festival</a>, the <a href="Fairbanks%20Summer%20Arts%20Festival">Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival</a>, the <a href="http%3A//anchoragefolkfestival.org/">Anchorage Folk Festival</a>, the <a href="Athabascan%20Old-Time%20Fiddling%20Festival">Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival</a>, the Sitka Jazz Festival, and the <a href="Sitka%20Summer%20Music%20Festival">Sitka Summer Music Festival</a>. The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the <a href="Anchorage%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Anchorage Symphony Orchestra</a>, though the <a href="Fairbanks%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra</a> and <a href="Juneau%20Symphony">Juneau Symphony</a> are also notable. The <a href="Anchorage%20Opera">Anchorage Opera</a> is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.

The official <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20songs">state song</a> of Alaska is "<a href="Alaska%27s%20Flag">Alaska's Flag</a>", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the <a href="flag%20of%20Alaska">flag of Alaska</a>.

Alaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was "<a href="The%20Chechahcos">The Chechahcos</a>", produced by Alaskan businessman <a href="Austin%20E.%20Lathrop">Austin E. Lathrop</a> and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.

One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a>'s "<a href="Eskimo/Mala%20The%20Magnificent">Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent</a>", starring Alaska Native <a href="Ray%20Mala">Ray Mala</a>. In 1932 an expedition set out from <a href="MGM">MGM</a>'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as "The Biggest Picture Ever Made." Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up "Camp Hollywood" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. <a href="Louis%20B.%20Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the <a href="Roosevelt%20Hotel%20%28Hollywood%29">Hotel Roosevelt</a> in Hollywood to prepare meals.

When "Eskimo" premiered at the <a href="Astor%20Theatre%2C%20New%20York%20City">Astor Theatre</a> in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history to that point. "Eskimo" was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. "Eskimo" won the first Oscar for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Editing">Best Film Editing</a> at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of <a href="Inupiat%20people">Inupiat</a> culture on film.

The 1983 Disney movie "<a href="Never%20Cry%20Wolf%20%28film%29">Never Cry Wolf</a>" was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film "<a href="White%20Fang%20%281991%20film%29">White Fang</a>", based on <a href="Jack%20London">Jack London</a>'s novel and starring <a href="Ethan%20Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a>, was filmed in and around <a href="Haines%2C%20Alaska">Haines</a>. <a href="Steven%20Seagal">Steven Seagal</a>'s 1994 "<a href="On%20Deadly%20Ground">On Deadly Ground</a>", starring <a href="Michael%20Caine">Michael Caine</a>, was filmed in part at the <a href="Worthington%20Glacier">Worthington Glacier</a> near <a href="Valdez%2C%20Alaska">Valdez</a>. The 1999 <a href="John%20Sayles">John Sayles</a> film "<a href="Limbo%20%281999%20film%29">Limbo</a>", starring <a href="David%20Strathairn">David Strathairn</a>, <a href="Mary%20Elizabeth%20Mastrantonio">Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio</a>, and <a href="Kris%20Kristofferson">Kris Kristofferson</a>, was filmed in Juneau.

The psychological thriller "<a href="Insomnia%20%282002%20film%29">Insomnia</a>", starring <a href="Al%20Pacino">Al Pacino</a> and <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a>, was shot in Canada, but was set in Alaska. The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, "<a href="Into%20the%20Wild%20%28film%29">Into The Wild</a>", was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of <a href="Christopher%20McCandless">Christopher McCandless</a>, who died in a remote abandoned bus along the <a href="Stampede%20Trail">Stampede Trail</a> west of <a href="Healy%2C%20Alaska">Healy</a> in 1992.

Many films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, "<a href="Northern%20Exposure">Northern Exposure</a>", set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in <a href="Roslyn%2C%20Washington">Roslyn, Washington</a>. The 2007 horror feature "<a href="30%20Days%20of%20Night%20%28film%29">30 Days of Night</a>" is set in <a href="Barrow%2C%20Alaska">Barrow</a>, but was filmed in New Zealand.

Many <a href="reality%20television">reality television</a> shows are filmed in Alaska. In 2011 the "Anchorage Daily News" found ten set in the state.

Agriculture

Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of <a href="animal">animal</a>s, <a href="plant">plant</a>s and <a href="Fungus">fungi</a> for <a href="food">food</a>, <a href="fiber">fiber</a>, <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a>, <a href="medicinal%20plants">medicinal plants</a> and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of <a href="sedentism">sedentary</a> <a href="human%20civilization">human civilization</a>, whereby farming of <a href="domestication">domesticated</a> species created food <a href="economic%20surplus">surpluses</a> that nurtured the development of <a href="civilization">civilization</a>. The study of agriculture is known as <a href="agricultural%20science">agricultural science</a>. The <a href="history%20of%20agriculture">history of agriculture</a> dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different <a href="climate">climate</a>s, <a href="culture">culture</a>s, and technologies. <a href="Industrial%20agriculture">Industrial agriculture</a> based on large-scale <a href="monoculture">monoculture</a> farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.

Modern <a href="agronomy">agronomy</a>, <a href="plant%20breeding">plant breeding</a>, <a href="agrochemical">agrochemical</a>s such as <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s and <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s, and technological developments have in many cases sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. <a href="Selective%20breeding">Selective breeding</a> and modern practices in <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a> have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about <a href="animal%20welfare">animal welfare</a> and the health effects of the <a href="antibiotics">antibiotics</a>, <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a>s, and other chemicals commonly used in <a href="industrial%20meat%20production">industrial meat production</a>. <a href="Genetically%20modified%20organism">Genetically modified organism</a>s are an increasing component of agriculture, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management are increasingly becoming global issues that are fostering debate on a number of fronts. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>s, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, <a href="fuel">fuel</a>s, and <a href="raw%20material">raw material</a>s. Specific foods include <a href="cereal">cereal</a>s (grains), <a href="vegetable">vegetable</a>s, <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s, <a href="cooking%20oil">oils</a>, <a href="meat">meat</a>s and <a href="spice">spice</a>s. Fibers include <a href="cotton">cotton</a>, <a href="wool">wool</a>, <a href="hemp">hemp</a>, <a href="silk">silk</a> and <a href="flax">flax</a>. Raw materials include <a href="lumber">lumber</a> and <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a>. Other useful materials are also produced by plants, such as <a href="resin">resin</a>s, <a href="natural%20dye">dyes</a>, <a href="drug">drug</a>s, <a href="perfume">perfume</a>s, <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a>s and ornamental products such as <a href="Floriculture">cut flowers</a> and <a href="nursery%20%28horticulture%29">nursery plants</a>. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

The word "agriculture" is a late <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> adaptation of Latin "agricultūra", from "ager", "field", and "cultūra", "<a href="Tillage">cultivation</a>" or "growing". Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of <a href="ant">ant</a>, <a href="termite">termite</a> and <a href="ambrosia%20beetle">ambrosia beetle</a>. To practice agriculture means to use natural resources to "produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services." This definition includes <a href="arable%20farming">arable farming</a> or <a href="agronomy">agronomy</a>, and <a href="horticulture">horticulture</a>, all terms for the growing of plants, <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a> and <a href="forestry">forestry</a>. A distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. Even then, it is acknowledged that there is a large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between <a href="silviculture">silviculture</a> (the management of forests) and agriculture. In traditional farming, the two are often combined even on small landholdings, leading to the term <a href="agroforestry">agroforestry</a>.

Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent <a href="centers%20of%20origin">centers of origin</a>. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. <a href="Pig">Pig</a>s were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 15,000 years ago. <a href="Rice">Rice</a> was domesticated in China between 13,500 and 8,200 years ago, followed by <a href="mung%20bean">mung</a>, <a href="soy">soy</a> and <a href="Azuki%20bean">azuki</a> beans. <a href="Sheep">Sheep</a> were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight <a href="Neolithic%20founder%20crops">Neolithic founder crops</a>, <a href="emmer%20wheat">emmer</a> and <a href="einkorn%20wheat">einkorn wheat</a>, hulled <a href="barley">barley</a>, <a href="pea">pea</a>s, <a href="lentil">lentil</a>s, <a href="Vicia%20ervilia">bitter vetch</a>, <a href="chick%20pea">chick pea</a>s and <a href="flax">flax</a> were cultivated in the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. <a href="Cattle">Cattle</a> were domesticated from the wild <a href="aurochs">aurochs</a> in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. In the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> of South America, the <a href="potato">potato</a> was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, <a href="coca">coca</a>, <a href="llama">llama</a>s, <a href="alpaca">alpaca</a>s, and <a href="guinea%20pig">guinea pig</a>s. <a href="Sugarcane">Sugarcane</a> and some <a href="List%20of%20root%20vegetables">root vegetables</a> were domesticated in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> around 9,000 years ago. <a href="Sorghum">Sorghum</a> was domesticated in the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. <a href="Cotton">Cotton</a> was domesticated in <a href="Peru">Peru</a> by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia at an unknown time. <a href="Agriculture%20in%20Mesoamerica">In Mesoamerica</a>, wild <a href="teosinte">teosinte</a> was domesticated to <a href="maize">maize</a> by 6,000 years ago.

In the Middle Ages, both <a href="Islamic%20Golden%20Age">in the Islamic world</a> and in Europe, agriculture was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the <a href="orange%20%28fruit%29">orange</a> to Europe by way of <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>. After 1492, the <a href="Columbian%20exchange">Columbian exchange</a> brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, <a href="sweet%20potato">sweet potato</a>es and <a href="manioc">manioc</a> to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice and <a href="turnip">turnip</a>s, and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep and goats to the Americas.
<a href="Irrigation">Irrigation</a>, <a href="crop%20rotation">crop rotation</a>, and <a href="fertilizers">fertilizers</a> were introduced soon after the <a href="Neolithic%20Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a> and developed much further in the past 200 years, starting with the <a href="British%20Agricultural%20Revolution">British Agricultural Revolution</a>. Since 1900, agriculture in the developed nations, and to a lesser extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labor has been replaced by <a href="Mechanized%20farming">mechanization</a>, and assisted by <a href="synthetic%20fertilizer">synthetic fertilizer</a>s, pesticides, and <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a>. The <a href="Haber-Bosch">Haber-Bosch</a> method allowed the synthesis of <a href="ammonium%20nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing <a href="crop%20yields">crop yields</a>. Modern agriculture has raised political issues including <a href="water%20pollution">water pollution</a>, <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a>s, <a href="genetically%20modified%20organism">genetically modified organism</a>s, <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s and <a href="Agricultural%20subsidy">farm subsidies</a>, leading to alternative approaches such as the <a href="organic%20movement">organic movement</a> and <a href="regenerative%20agriculture">regenerative agriculture</a>.

<a href="Civilization">Civilization</a> was the product of the Agricultural <a href="Neolithic%20Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a>; as <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> put it, "civilization was the agricultural surplus." In the course of history, civilization coincided in space with fertile areas such as <a href="The%20Fertile%20Crescent">The Fertile Crescent</a>, and <a href="Carneiro%27s%20circumscription%20theory">states formed mainly in circumscribed agricultural lands</a>. The <a href="Great%20Wall">Great Wall</a> of China and the Roman empire's "<a href="limes">limes</a>" (borders) demarcated the same northern frontier of cereal agriculture. This cereal belt fed the civilizations formed in the <a href="Axial%20Age">Axial Age</a> and connected by the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>.

Ancient Egyptians, whose agriculture depended exclusively on the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>, deified the river, worshipped, and exalted it in a great hymn. The Chinese imperial court issued numerous edicts, stating: "Agriculture is the foundation of this Empire." Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Chinese, and Inca Emperors themselves plowed ceremonial fields in order to show personal example to everyone.

Ancient strategists, Chinese <a href="Guan%20Zhong">Guan Zhong</a> and <a href="Shang%20Yang">Shang Yang</a> and Indian <a href="Kautilya">Kautilya</a>, drew doctrines linking agriculture with military power. Agriculture defined the limits on how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. Shang Yang called agriculture and war the "One". In the vast human pantheon of agricultural deities there are several deities who combined the functions of agriculture and war.

As the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution produced civilization, the modern Agricultural Revolution, begun in Britain (<a href="British%20Agricultural%20Revolution">British Agricultural Revolution</a>), made possible the <a href="industrial%20civilization">industrial civilization</a>. The first precondition for industry was greater yields by less manpower, resulting in greater percentage of manpower available for non-agricultural sectors.

<a href="Pastoralism">Pastoralism</a> involves managing domesticated animals. In <a href="nomadic%20pastoralism">nomadic pastoralism</a>, herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India.

In <a href="shifting%20cultivation">shifting cultivation</a>, a small area of a forest is cleared by cutting down all the trees and the area is burned. The land is then used for growing crops for several years. When the soil becomes less fertile, the area is then abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.

<a href="Subsistence%20farming">Subsistence farming</a> is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little left over for transport elsewhere. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.

In <a href="intensive%20farming">intensive farming</a>, the crops are cultivated for commercial purpose i.e., for selling. The main motive of the farmer is to make profit, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs. This type of farming is mainly practiced in highly developed countries.

In the past century, agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, <a href="water%20pollution">water pollution</a>, and <a href="Agricultural%20subsidy">farm subsidies</a>. In recent years there has been a backlash against the <a href="externality">external</a> <a href="environmental%20awareness">environmental effects</a> of conventional agriculture, resulting in the <a href="organic%20farming">organic</a>, <a href="Regenerative%20agriculture">regenerative</a>, and <a href="sustainable%20agriculture">sustainable agriculture</a> movements. One of the major forces behind this movement has been the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, which first certified <a href="organic%20food">organic food</a> in 1991 and began reform of its <a href="Common%20Agricultural%20Policy">Common Agricultural Policy</a> (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies, also known as <a href="Decoupling%20and%20re-coupling">decoupling</a>. The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as <a href="integrated%20pest%20management">integrated pest management</a> and selective breeding. Recent mainstream technological developments include <a href="genetically%20modified%20food">genetically modified food</a>.

In 2007, higher incentives for farmers to grow non-food biofuel crops combined with other factors, such as over development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, growing consumer demand in China and India, and <a href="population%20growth">population growth</a>, caused <a href="food%20security">food shortages</a> in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico, as well as rising food prices around the globe. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. Some of these shortages resulted in <a href="2007-2008%20world%20food%20price%20crisis">food riots</a> and even deadly stampedes. The <a href="International%20Fund%20for%20Agricultural%20Development">International Fund for Agricultural Development</a> posits that an increase in <a href="smallholding">smallholder agriculture</a> may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security. They in part base this on the experience of Vietnam, which went from a food importer to large food exporter and saw a significant drop in poverty, due mainly to the development of smallholder agriculture in the country.

Disease and land degradation are two of the major concerns in agriculture today. For example, an epidemic of <a href="stem%20rust">stem rust</a> on wheat caused by the <a href="Ug99">Ug99</a> lineage is currently spreading across Africa and into Asia and is causing major concerns due to crop losses of 70% or more under some conditions. Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. In Africa, if current trends of <a href="soil%20retrogression%20and%20degradation">soil degradation</a> continue, the continent might be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to <a href="United%20Nations%20University">United Nations University's</a> Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa.

Agrarian structure is a long-term structure in the <a href="Fernand%20Braudel">Braudelian</a> understanding of the concept. On a larger scale the agrarian structure is more dependent on the regional, social, cultural and historical factors than on the state’s undertaken activities. Like in Poland, where despite running an intense agrarian policy for many years, the agrarian structure in 2002 has much in common with that found in 1921 soon after the <a href="History%20of%20Poland%20%281795%E2%80%931918%29">partitions period</a>.

In 2009, the <a href="Agriculture%20in%20China">agricultural output of China</a> was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States, according to the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> ("<a href="Agriculture%23List%20of%20countries%20by%20agricultural%20output">see below</a>"). Economists measure the <a href="total%20factor%20productivity">total factor productivity</a> of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.

, the <a href="International%20Labour%20Organization">International Labour Organization</a> states that approximately one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, are employed in the global agricultural sector. Agriculture constitutes approximately 70% of the global employment of children, and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry. The <a href="service%20sector">service sector</a> only overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007. Between 1997 and 2007, the percentage of people employed in agriculture fell by over four percentage points, a trend that is expected to continue. The number of people employed in agriculture varies widely on a per-country basis, ranging from less than 2% in countries like the US and Canada to over 80% in many African nations. In developed countries, these figures are significantly lower than in previous centuries. During the 16th century in Europe, for example, between 55 and 75 percent of the population was engaged in agriculture, depending on the country. By the 19th century in Europe, this had dropped to between 35 and 65 percent. In the same countries today, the figure is less than 10%.

Agriculture, specifically <a href="farm">farm</a>ing, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, <a href="noise-induced%20hearing%20loss">noise-induced hearing loss</a>, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On <a href="industrial%20agriculture">industrialized farms</a>, injuries frequently involve the use of <a href="agricultural%20machinery">agricultural machinery</a>, and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers. Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects. As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death. Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.

The International Labour Organization considers agriculture "one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors." It estimates that the annual work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. In addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported. The organization has developed the <a href="Safety%20and%20Health%20in%20Agriculture%20Convention%2C%202001">Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001</a>, which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play.

Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.

<a href="Shifting%20cultivation">Shifting cultivation</a> (or <a href="slash%20and%20burn">slash and burn</a>) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then <a href="perennial%20plant">perennial</a> crops for a period of several years. Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or <a href="manure">manure</a>) and some manual <a href="pest%20control">pest control</a>. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.

Further industrialization led to the use of <a href="monoculture">monoculture</a>s, when one <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s and fertilizers. <a href="Multiple%20cropping">Multiple cropping</a>, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and <a href="intercropping">intercropping</a>, when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as <a href="polyculture">polyculture</a>s.

In <a href="subtropics">subtropical</a> and <a href="arid">arid</a> environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a>. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. In <a href="Temperateness">temperate</a> environments, where ecosystems were predominantly <a href="grassland">grassland</a> or <a href="prairie">prairie</a>, highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.

Important categories of crops include <a href="cereal">cereal</a>s and <a href="pseudocereals">pseudocereals</a>, pulses (legumes), forage, and fruits and vegetables. Specific crops are cultivated in distinct <a href="growing%20region">growing region</a>s throughout the world. In millions of metric tons, based on <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">FAO</a> estimate.

Animals, including horses, <a href="mule">mule</a>s, <a href="ox">ox</a>en, <a href="water%20buffalo">water buffalo</a>, <a href="camel">camel</a>s, <a href="llama">llama</a>s, <a href="alpaca">alpaca</a>s, <a href="donkey">donkey</a>s, and dogs, are often used to help cultivate fields, <a href="harvest">harvest</a> crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers. Animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, <a href="egg%20%28food%29">eggs</a>, or <a href="wool">wool</a>) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.

Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless. , 30% of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050. <a href="Aquaculture">Aquaculture</a> or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a> focused on creating livestock <a href="breed">breed</a>s and <a href="crossbreed">crossbreed</a>s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a>. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>, <a href="rangeland">rangeland</a>, and <a href="managed%20intensive%20rotational%20grazing">pastures</a> for feeding <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a> animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists. Mixed production systems use grassland, <a href="fodder">fodder</a> crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in <a href="Organisation%20for%20Economic%20Co-operation%20and%20Development">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a>(OECD) member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution. Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in <a href="confined%20animal%20feeding%20operations">confined animal feeding operations</a>, sometimes called <a href="factory%20farming">factory farming</a>. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa. Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a>s, are controversial.

Farming is the practice of agriculture by specialized labor in an area primarily devoted to agricultural processes, in service of a dislocated population usually in a <a href="city">city</a>.

Tillage is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to <a href="no-till%20farming">no-till</a>. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.

Pest control includes the management of weeds, <a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="mite">mite</a>s, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological (<a href="biocontrol">biocontrol</a>), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include <a href="crop%20rotation">crop rotation</a>, <a href="culling">culling</a>, <a href="cover%20crop">cover crop</a>s, intercropping, <a href="compost">compost</a>ing, avoidance, and <a href="Disease%20resistance%20in%20fruit%20and%20vegetables">resistance</a>. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.

<a href="Nutrient%20management">Nutrient management</a> includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of <a href="manure">manure</a> produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, <a href="manure">manure</a>, <a href="green%20manure">green manure</a>, compost and mined <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s. Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a <a href="fallow">fallow</a> period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or <a href="Manure%20spreader">by spreading</a> either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or <a href="pasture">pasture</a>s.

<a href="Water%20management">Water management</a> is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world. Some farmers use <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year. Agriculture represents 70% of freshwater use worldwide.

According to a report by the <a href="International%20Food%20Policy%20Research%20Institute">International Food Policy Research Institute</a>, agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.

"<a href="Payment%20for%20ecosystem%20services">Payment for ecosystem services</a> (PES) can further incentivise efforts to green the agriculture sector. This is an approach that verifies values and rewards the benefits of ecosystem services provided by green agricultural practices." "Innovative PES measures could include reforestation payments made by cities to upstream communities in rural areas of shared watersheds for improved quantities and quality of fresh water for municipal users. Ecoservice payments by farmers to upstream forest stewards for properly managing the flow of soil nutrients, and methods to monetise the carbon sequestration and emission reduction credit benefits of green agriculture practices in order to compensate farmers for their efforts to restore and build SOM and employ other practices."

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist <a href="Gregor%20Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>. His work on <a href="dominant%20allele">dominant</a> and <a href="recessive%20allele">recessive allele</a>s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, <a href="self-pollination">self-pollination</a> and <a href="cross-pollination">cross-pollination</a>, and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and <a href="drought%20tolerance">drought tolerance</a>, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.

The <a href="Green%20Revolution">Green Revolution</a> popularized the use of conventional <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> to sharply increase yield by creating "high-yielding varieties". For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).

<a href="Genetically%20modified%20organism">Genetically modified organism</a>s (GMO) are <a href="organism">organism</a>s whose <a href="Genetics">genetic</a> material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as <a href="recombinant%20DNA%20technology">recombinant DNA technology</a>. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause <a href="food%20safety">food safety</a> and <a href="food%20labeling%20regulations">food labeling</a> concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops. Currently a global treaty, the <a href="Biosafety%20Protocol">Biosafety Protocol</a>, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including <a href="glyphosate">glyphosate</a>s. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.

Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium "<a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis">Bacillus thuringiensis</a>" (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops protect plants from damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.

Agriculture, as implemented through the method of farming, imposes external costs upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare. A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million. Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society. In 2010, the <a href="International%20Resource%20Panel">International Resource Panel</a> of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Environment%20Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production. The study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that "[a]gricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs. "On average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per cent for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020)."

A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem, Henning Steinfeld, said "Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems". Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO. It produces 65% of human-related <a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a> (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO) and 37% of all human-induced <a href="methane">methane</a> (which is 23 times as warming as CO.) It also generates 64% of the <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>; in the Amazon basin 70% of <a href="Deforestation%20of%20the%20Amazon%20Rainforest">previously forested area</a> is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops. Through deforestation and <a href="land%20degradation">land degradation</a>, livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity. Furthermore, the UNEP states that "<a href="methane%20emissions">methane emissions</a> from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns."

Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force in the <a href="Biodiversity%20loss">loss of biodiversity</a>. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50%. Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with cropland overrepresented. The UN-FAO report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be deforestation, <a href="desertification">desertification</a>, <a href="soil%20erosion">soil erosion</a>, mineral depletion, or chemical degradation (<a href="soil%20acidification">acidification</a> and <a href="salinization">salinization</a>).

<a href="Eutrophication">Eutrophication</a>, excessive nutrients in <a href="aquatic%20ecosystem">aquatic ecosystem</a>s resulting in <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a>s and <a href="anoxic%20waters">anoxia</a>, leads to <a href="fish%20kill">fish kill</a>s, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>) <a href="surface%20runoff">runoff</a> and <a href="leaching%20%28agriculture%29">leaching</a> from agricultural land. These nutrients are major <a href="nonpoint%20source%20pollution">nonpoint pollutants</a> contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.

Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources. Agriculture is a major draw on water from <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>s, and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate. It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, the <a href="Ganges">Upper Ganges</a> and the western US are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas, meaning that <a href="water%20scarcity">water scarcity</a> is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with reduced water resources. <a href="Farm%20water">Agricultural water</a> usage can also cause major environmental problems, including the destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is performed incorrectly.

Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant. The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that 3million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths. Pesticides select for <a href="pesticide%20resistance">pesticide resistance</a> in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the "pesticide treadmill" in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.

An alternative argument is that the way to "save the environment" and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'. However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace <a href="good%20agricultural%20practices">good agronomic practices</a> such as crop rotation. The UNEP introduces the <a href="Push%E2%80%93pull%20agricultural%20pest%20management">Push–pull agricultural pest management</a> technique which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects. "The implementation of push-pull in eastern Africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of N-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. With increased livestock operations, the farmers are able to produce meat, milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields."

Climate change has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), <a href="carbon%20dioxide">CO</a>, <a href="solar%20radiation">solar radiation</a> and the interaction of these elements. Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold. Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%. Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future. For example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.

Agriculture in its many forms can both mitigate or worsen <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>. Some of the increase in CO in the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere</a> comes from the <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a> of <a href="organic%20matter">organic matter</a> in the soil, and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice <a href="paddy%20field">paddy field</a>s, as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. Further, wet or <a href="Hypoxia%20%28environmental%29">anaerobic</a> soils also lose nitrogen through <a href="denitrification">denitrification</a>, releasing the greenhouse gases <a href="nitric%20oxide">nitric oxide</a> and nitrous oxide. Changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases, and soil can further be used to <a href="carbon%20capture%20and%20storage">sequester</a> some of the CO in the atmosphere. Informed by the UNEP, "[a]griculture also produces about 58 per cent of global nitrous oxide emissions and about 47 per cent of global methane emissions. Cattle and rice farms release methane, fertilized fields release nitrous oxide, and the cutting down of rainforests to grow crops or raise livestock releases carbon dioxide. Both of these gases have a far greater global warming potential per tonne than CO2 (298 times and 25 times respectively)."

There are several factors within the field of agriculture that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals. Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels from the beginning of the process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors. The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.

Some major organizations are hailing farming within <a href="agroecosystem">agroecosystem</a>s as the way forward for mainstream agriculture. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. According to a report by the <a href="International%20Water%20Management%20Institute">International Water Management Institute</a> and <a href="UNEP">UNEP</a>, there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for
more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.

Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable. New technologies have given rise to innovations like <a href="conservation%20tillage">conservation tillage</a>, a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration.

According to a report by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, IFPRI found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.

Agricultural economics refers to economics as it relates to the "production, distribution and consumption of [agricultural] goods and services". Combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s, and grew significantly through the 20th century. Although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent, major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history, ranging from <a href="tenant%20farmer">tenant farmer</a>s and <a href="sharecropping">sharecropping</a> in the post-<a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern United States</a> to the European <a href="feudal">feudal</a> system of <a href="manorialism">manorialism</a>. In the United States, and elsewhere, food costs attributed to <a href="food%20processing">food processing</a>, distribution, and <a href="agricultural%20marketing">agricultural marketing</a>, sometimes referred to as the <a href="Agricultural%20value%20chain">value chain</a>, have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of <a href="value%20added">value addition</a> (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. <a href="Market%20concentration">Market concentration</a> has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute <a href="economic%20surplus">economic surplus</a> from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.

National government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in the form of taxation, <a href="Subsidy">subsidies</a>, <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s and other measures. Since at least the 1960s, a combination of import/export restrictions, <a href="exchange%20rate%20policy">exchange rate policies</a> and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and developed world. In the 1980s, it was clear that non-subsidized farmers in developing countries were experiencing adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.

However, , there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the <a href="oilseed">oilseed</a>s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy. Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers. Unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn, soybeans, cows) are generally graded to indicate quality. The quality affects the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight.

Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a> sources. Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area) as <a href="world%20population">world population</a> doubled. Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on <a href="petrochemical">petrochemical</a>s and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages.

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1. direct consumption on the farm and 2. indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline, liquid <a href="propane">propane</a>, and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1% of the nation's total energy.

Indirect consumption is mainly oil and <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002. The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of <a href="nitrogen%20fertilizer">nitrogen fertilizer</a> can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by <a href="The%20Royal%20Society">The Royal Society</a>, agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location. The energy used to manufacture farm machinery is also a form of indirect agricultural energy consumption. Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years. <a href="Food%20systems">Food systems</a> encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.

In the event of a petroleum shortage (see <a href="peak%20oil">peak oil</a> for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields equal to or higher than those available from conventional farming. In the aftermath of the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">fall of the Soviet Union</a>, with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including <a href="biopesticides">biopesticides</a>, plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace. However, organic farming may be more <a href="labour%20%28economics%29">labor</a>-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas. The <a href="soil%20conditioner">reconditioning of soil</a> to restore organic matter lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques is important to provide a reservoir of plant-available nutrients, to maintain texture, and to minimize erosion.

It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the <a href="biochar">biochar</a> and <a href="synfuel">synfuel</a> process, which uses agricultural "waste" to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel "and" food, instead of the normal <a href="food%20vs.%20fuel">food vs. fuel</a> debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.

It has been suggested that some transgenic plants may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil-fuel-derived inputs than conventional crops. The possibility of success of these programs is questioned by ecologists and economists concerned with unsustainable GMO practices such as <a href="terminator%20seeds">terminator seeds</a>. While there has been some research on sustainability using GMO crops, at least one prominent multi-year attempt by <a href="Monsanto%20Company">Monsanto Company</a> has been unsuccessful, though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop.

<a href="Agricultural%20policy">Agricultural policy</a> is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), <a href="economic%20stability">economic stability</a> (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and <a href="environmental%20sustainability">environmental sustainability</a> (especially <a href="water%20resource%20management">water policy</a>), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries). Agricultural policy can also touch on <a href="food%20quality">food quality</a>, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and <a href="Conservation%20biology">conservation</a>. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. <a href="Agribusiness">Agribusiness</a> interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of <a href="lobbying">lobbying</a> and <a href="campaign%20contribution">campaign contribution</a>s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and <a href="labor%20union">labor union</a>s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities. The <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a> (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.

Aldous Huxley

Aldous Leonard Huxley (; 26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer, novelist, philosopher, and prominent member of the <a href="Huxley%20family">Huxley family</a>. He graduated from <a href="Balliol%20College%2C%20Oxford">Balliol College</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> with a <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification%23First%20Class%20Honours">first-class honours</a> in English literature.

The author of nearly fifty books, he was best known for his novels including "<a href="Brave%20New%20World">Brave New World</a>", set in a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n future; for non-fiction works, such as "<a href="The%20Doors%20of%20Perception">The Doors of Perception</a>", which recalls experiences when taking a <a href="psychedelic%20drug">psychedelic drug</a>; and a wide-ranging output of essays. Early in his career Huxley edited the magazine "<a href="Oxford%20Poetry">Oxford Poetry</a>" and published short stories and poetry. Mid career and later, he published travel writing, film stories, and scripts. He spent the later part of his life in the United States, living in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> from 1937 until his death. In 1962, a year before his death, he was elected Companion of Literature by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Literature">Royal Society of Literature</a>.

Huxley was a <a href="Humanism">humanist</a>, <a href="Pacifism">pacifist</a>, and <a href="Satire">satirist</a>. He later became interested in spiritual subjects such as <a href="parapsychology">parapsychology</a> and philosophical <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>, in particular <a href="universalism">universalism</a>. By the end of his life, Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the pre-eminent intellectuals of his time. He was nominated for the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> in seven different years.

Huxley was born in <a href="Godalming">Godalming</a>, Surrey, England, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster <a href="Leonard%20Huxley%20%28writer%29">Leonard Huxley,</a> who edited "<a href="Cornhill%20Magazine">Cornhill Magazine</a>", and his first wife, Julia Arnold, who founded <a href="Prior%27s%20Field%20School">Prior's Field School</a>. Julia was the niece of poet and critic <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> and the sister of <a href="Mary%20Augusta%20Ward">Mrs. Humphrey Ward</a>. Aldous was the grandson of <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a>, the <a href="Zoology">zoologist</a>, agnostic, and controversialist ("Darwin's Bulldog"). His brother <a href="Julian%20Huxley">Julian Huxley</a> and half-brother <a href="Andrew%20Huxley">Andrew Huxley</a> also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevelyan Huxley (1891–1914), who committed suicide after a period of <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">clinical depression</a>.

As a child, Huxley's nickname was "Ogie", short for "Ogre". He was described by his brother, Julian, as someone who frequently "[contemplated] the strangeness of things". According to his cousin and contemporary, Gervas Huxley, he had an early interest in drawing.

Huxley's education began in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, after which he enrolled at Hillside School near <a href="Godalming">Godalming</a>. He was taught there by his own mother for several years until she became terminally ill. After Hillside, he went on to <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>. His mother died in 1908 when he was 14. In 1911 he contracted the eye disease (<a href="Keratitis">keratitis punctata</a>) which "left [him] practically blind for two to three years". This "ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor." In October 1913, Huxley went up to <a href="Balliol%20College%2C%20Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a>, where he read English Literature. In January 1916, he volunteered to join the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> in the <a href="World%20War%20I">Great War</a>, but was rejected on health grounds, being half-blind in one eye. His eyesight later partly recovered. In 1916 he edited "<a href="Oxford%20Poetry">Oxford Poetry</a>" and in June of that year graduated <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">BA</a> with <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification%23First%20Class%20Honours">First Class honours</a>. His brother Julian wrote:

Following his years at Balliol, Huxley, being financially indebted to his father, decided to find employment. From April to July 1917, he was in charge of ordering supplies at the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> . He taught French for a year at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>, where Eric Blair (who was to take the pen name <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>) and <a href="Steven%20Runciman">Steven Runciman</a> were among his pupils. He was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class. Nevertheless, Blair and others spoke highly of his brilliant command of language.

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at <a href="Tata%20Chemicals%20Europe">Brunner and Mond</a>, a high-tech chemical plant in <a href="Billingham">Billingham</a> in <a href="County%20Durham">County Durham</a>, northeast England. According to the introduction to the latest edition of his great science fiction novel "<a href="Brave%20New%20World">Brave New World</a>" (1932), the experience he had there of "an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence" was an important source for the novel.

Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s, establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist. His first published novels were social satires, "<a href="Crome%20Yellow">Crome Yellow</a>" (1921), "<a href="Antic%20Hay">Antic Hay</a>" (1923), "<a href="Those%20Barren%20Leaves">Those Barren Leaves</a>" (1925), and "<a href="Point%20Counter%20Point">Point Counter Point</a>" (1928). "Brave New World" was Huxley's fifth novel and first dystopian work. In the 1920s he was also a contributor to "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28American%20magazine%201913%E2%80%931936%29">Vanity Fair</a>" and <a href="Vogue%20%28British%20magazine%29">British "Vogue"</a> magazines.

During World War I, Huxley spent much of his time at <a href="Garsington%20Manor">Garsington Manor</a> near Oxford, home of <a href="Lady%20Ottoline%20Morrell">Lady Ottoline Morrell</a>, working as a farm labourer. There he met several <a href="Bloomsbury%20Group">Bloomsbury</a> figures, including <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a>, and <a href="Clive%20Bell">Clive Bell</a>. Later, in "<a href="Crome%20Yellow">Crome Yellow</a>" (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 <a href="John%20Middleton%20Murry">John Middleton Murry</a> was reorganising the "<a href="Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">Athenaeum</a>" and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington. They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).

Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously "<a href="Brave%20New%20World">Brave New World</a>", and on pacifist themes (for example, "<a href="Eyeless%20in%20Gaza%20%28novel%29">Eyeless in Gaza</a>"). In "Brave New World", set in a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n London, Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and <a href="Classical%20conditioning">Pavlovian conditioning</a>. Huxley was strongly influenced by <a href="F.%20Matthias%20Alexander">F. Matthias Alexander</a> and included him as a character in "Eyeless in Gaza".

Starting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including "<a href="Ends%20and%20Means">Ends and Means</a>", "An Encyclopedia of Pacifism", and "Pacifism and Philosophy", and was an active member of the <a href="Peace%20Pledge%20Union">Peace Pledge Union</a>.

In 1937, Huxley moved to Hollywood with his wife Maria, son <a href="Matthew%20Huxley">Matthew Huxley</a>, and friend <a href="Gerald%20Heard">Gerald Heard</a>. He lived in the US, mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in <a href="Taos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Taos, New Mexico</a>, where he wrote "<a href="Ends%20and%20Means">Ends and Means</a>" (published in 1937). The book contains tracts on war, religion, nationalism and ethics.

Heard introduced Huxley to <a href="Vedanta">Vedanta</a> (<a href="Upanishads">Upanishad-centered philosophy</a>), meditation, and <a href="vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a> through the principle of <a href="ahimsa">ahimsa</a>. In 1938, Huxley befriended <a href="Jiddu%20Krishnamurti">Jiddu Krishnamurti</a>, whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu <a href="Swami%20Prabhavananda">Swami Prabhavananda</a>, and introduced <a href="Christopher%20Isherwood">Christopher Isherwood</a> to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, "<a href="The%20Perennial%20Philosophy">The Perennial Philosophy</a>", which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted "five senses" and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of <a href="Occidental%20College">Occidental College</a>. He spent much time at the college, which is in the <a href="Eagle%20Rock%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Eagle Rock</a> neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as "Tarzana College" in his satirical novel "<a href="After%20Many%20a%20Summer">After Many a Summer</a>" (1939). The novel won Huxley a British literary award, the 1939 <a href="James%20Tait%20Black%20Memorial%20Prize">James Tait Black Memorial Prize</a> for fiction. Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; <a href="Christopher%20Isherwood">Christopher Isherwood</a>, in his autobiography "My Guru and His Disciple", states that Huxley earned more than $3,000 per week (an enormous sum in those days) as a screenwriter, and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the U.S. In March 1938, his friend <a href="Anita%20Loos">Anita Loos</a>, a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> who hired Huxley for "<a href="Madame%20Curie%20%28film%29">Madame Curie</a>", which was originally to star <a href="Greta%20Garbo">Greta Garbo</a> and be directed by <a href="George%20Cukor">George Cukor</a>. (Eventually, the film was completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice%20%281940%20film%29">Pride and Prejudice</a>" (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including "<a href="Jane%20Eyre%20%281943%20film%29">Jane Eyre</a>" (1944). Huxley was commissioned by Walt Disney in 1945 to write a script based on "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and the biography of the story's author, Lewis Carroll. The script was not used, however.

Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of <a href="J.%20D.%20Unwin">J. D. Unwin</a>'s 1940 book "Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society".

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, author of "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>", congratulating him on "how fine and how profoundly important the book is". In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:
Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself. From these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist <a href="Mike%20Wallace">Mike Wallace</a>, Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well-marketed commodities.

In 1953, Huxley and Maria applied for <a href="Citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States citizenship</a> and presented themselves for examination. When Huxley refused to bear arms for the US and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals, the only excuse allowed under the <a href="McCarran%20Internal%20Security%20Act">McCarran Act</a>, the judge had to adjourn the proceedings. He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the US. In 1959 Huxley turned down an offer of a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> by the <a href="Harold%20Macmillan%23Prime%20Minister%20%281957%E2%80%931963%29">Macmillan government</a> without putting forward a reason; his brother Julian had been knighted in 1958, while another brother Andrew would be knighted in 1974.

Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the <a href="Vedanta%20Society%20of%20Southern%20California">Vedanta Society of Southern California</a>, founded and headed by <a href="Swami%20Prabhavananda">Swami Prabhavananda</a>. Together with <a href="Gerald%20Heard">Gerald Heard</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Isherwood">Christopher Isherwood</a>, and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.

In 1944, Huxley wrote the introduction to the "Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God", translated by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.

From 1941 until 1960, Huxley contributed 48 articles to "Vedanta and the West", published by the society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: "<a href="Knowledge%20and%20Understanding">Knowledge and Understanding</a>" and "<a href="Who%20Are%20We%3F%20%28album%29">Who Are We?</a>" from 1955. Nonetheless, Huxley's agnosticism, together with his speculative propensity, made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalized religion.

In the spring of 1953, Huxley had his first experience with <a href="psychedelic%20drug">psychedelic drug</a>s (in this case, <a href="mescaline">mescaline</a>). Huxley had initiated a correspondence with <a href="Humphry%20Osmond">Dr. Humphry Osmond</a>, a British psychiatrist then employed in a Canadian institution, and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline; Osmond obliged and supervised Huxley’s session in southern California. After the publication of "<a href="The%20Doors%20of%20Perception">The Doors of Perception</a>", in which he recounted this experience, Huxley and Swami Prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.

There are differing accounts about the details of the quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life. About 1939, Huxley encountered the <a href="Bates%20method">Bates method</a> for better eyesight, and a teacher, <a href="Margaret%20Darst%20Corbett">Margaret Darst Corbett</a>, who was able to teach the method to him. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a "ranchito" in the high desert hamlet of <a href="Llano%2C%20California">Llano, California</a>, in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that, for the first time in more than 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20Seeing">The Art of Seeing</a>", which was published in 1942 (U.S.), 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.

It was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens, despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford. For example, some ten years after publication of "The Art of Seeing", in 1952, <a href="Bennett%20Cerf">Bennett Cerf</a> was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: "Then suddenly he faltered — and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment."

Brazilian author <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Ubaldo%20Ribeiro">João Ubaldo Ribeiro</a>, who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the Huxleys company in the late 1950's, wrote that Huxley had said to him, with a wry smile: “I can hardly see at all. And I don't give a damn, really.” Ribeiro then proceeds to confirm <a href="Bennett%20Cerf">Bennett Cerf</a>'s experience, as described above.

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, <a href="Laura%20Archera">Laura Archera</a>, would later emphasise in her biographical account, "This Timeless Moment": "One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight." After revealing a letter she wrote to the "Los Angeles Times" disclaiming the label of Huxley as a "poor fellow who can hardly see" by <a href="Walter%20C.%20Alvarez">Walter C. Alvarez</a>, she tempered this: "Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens." Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from "The Art of Seeing": "The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable." Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.

American <a href="popular%20science">popular science</a> author <a href="Steven%20Johnson%20%28author%29">Steven Johnson</a>, in his book "Mind Wide Open", quotes Huxley about his difficulties with <a href="Encoding%20%28memory%29%23Visual%20encoding">visual encoding</a>: "I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a poor visualizer. Words, even the pregnant words of poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind. No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep. When I recall something, the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object. By an effort of the will, I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon ..."

Huxley married Maria Nys (10 September 1899 – 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at <a href="Garsington">Garsington</a>, Oxfordshire, in 1919. They had one child, <a href="Matthew%20Huxley">Matthew Huxley</a> (19 April 1920 – 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent <a href="epidemiology">epidemiologist</a>. In 1955, Maria died of cancer.

In 1956, Huxley married <a href="Laura%20Huxley">Laura Archera</a> (1911–2007), also an author as well as a violinist and psychotherapist. She wrote "This Timeless Moment", a biography of Huxley. Laura felt inspired to illuminate the story of their marriage through Mary Ann Braubach's 2010 documentary, "Huxley on Huxley".

In 1960, Huxley was diagnosed with <a href="laryngeal%20cancer">laryngeal cancer</a> and, in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel "<a href="Island%20%28Huxley%20novel%29">Island</a>", and gave lectures on "Human Potentialities" both at the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a>'s San Francisco Medical Center and at the <a href="Esalen%20Institute">Esalen Institute</a>. These lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the <a href="Human%20Potential%20Movement">Human Potential Movement</a>.

Huxley was a close friend of <a href="Jiddu%20Krishnamurti">Jiddu Krishnamurti</a> and <a href="Rosalind%20Rajagopal">Rosalind Rajagopal</a> and was involved in the creation of the Happy Valley School (now <a href="Besant%20Hill%20School">Besant Hill School</a> of Happy Valley) in <a href="Ojai%2C%20California">Ojai, California</a>.

The most substantial collection of Huxley's few remaining papers (following the destruction of most in a fire) is at the Library of the University of California, Los Angeles. Some are also at the <a href="Stanford%20University%20Libraries">Stanford University Libraries</a>.

On 9 April 1962, Huxley was informed he was elected Companion of Literature by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Literature">Royal Society of Literature</a>, the senior literary organisation in Britain, and he accepted the title via letter on 28 April 1962. The correspondence between Huxley and the society are kept at the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Library">Cambridge University Library</a>. The society invited Huxley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at <a href="Somerset%20House">Somerset House</a>, London in June 1963. Huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society; however, his deteriorating health meant he would not be able to attend.

On his deathbed, unable to speak due to advanced <a href="laryngeal%20cancer">laryngeal cancer</a>, Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for "LSD, 100 <a href="Microgram">µg</a>, <a href="Intramuscular%20injection">intramuscular</a>". According to her account of his death in "This Timeless Moment", she obliged with an injection at 11:20 a.m. and a second dose an hour later; Huxley died aged 69, at 5:20 p.m. (Los Angeles time), on 22 November 1963.

Media coverage of Huxley's death — as with that of the author <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> – was overshadowed by the <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy</a> on the same day. This coincidence served as the basis for <a href="Peter%20Kreeft">Peter Kreeft</a>'s book "<a href="Between%20Heaven%20and%20Hell%20%28novel%29">Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, & Aldous Huxley</a>", which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in Purgatory following their deaths.

Huxley's memorial service took place in London in December 1963 which was led by his older brother <a href="Julian%20Huxley">Julian</a>, and on 27 October 1971 his ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the <a href="Watts%20Mortuary%20Chapel">Watts Mortuary Chapel</a> in <a href="Compton%2C%20Guildford">Compton, Guildford</a>, Surrey, England.

Huxley had been a long-time friend of Russian composer <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>, who later dedicated his last orchestral composition to Huxley. Stravinsky began "Variations" in Santa Fé, New Mexico, in July 1963, and completed the composition in Hollywood on 28 October 1964. It was first performed in Chicago on 17 April 1965, by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Craft.

Algae

Algae (; singular alga ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> <a href="organism">organism</a>s which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>. Included organisms range from <a href="unicellular">unicellular</a> genera, such as "<a href="Chlorella">Chlorella</a>" and the <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s, to <a href="multicellular">multicellular</a> forms, such as the <a href="Macrocystis%20pyrifera">giant kelp</a>, a large <a href="brown%20algae">brown alga</a> which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and <a href="autotrophic">autotrophic</a> and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as <a href="stoma">stoma</a>ta, <a href="xylem">xylem</a>, and <a href="phloem">phloem</a>, which are found in <a href="embryophyte">land plants</a>. The largest and most complex marine algae are called <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a>s, while the most complex freshwater forms are the <a href="Charophyta">Charophyta</a>, a <a href="phylum">division</a> of green algae which includes, for example, "<a href="Spirogyra">Spirogyra</a>" and the <a href="stonewort">stonewort</a>s.

No definition of algae is generally accepted. One definition is that algae "have <a href="chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a> as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells". Some authors exclude all <a href="prokaryotes">prokaryotes</a> and thus do not consider <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> (blue-green algae) as algae.

Algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor, and although their <a href="plastid">plastid</a>s seem to have a single origin, from cyanobacteria, they were acquired in different ways. <a href="Green%20algae">Green algae</a> are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from <a href="endosymbiotic%20theory">endosymbiotic</a> cyanobacteria. <a href="Diatom">Diatom</a>s and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an <a href="endosymbiotic%20theory%23Secondary%20endosymbiosis">endosymbiotic</a> <a href="red%20alga">red alga</a>.

Algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexual</a> cell division to complex forms of <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual reproduction</a>.

Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) of <a href="bryophyte">bryophyte</a>s, <a href="rhizoid">rhizoid</a>s in <a href="nonvascular%20plants">nonvascular plants</a>, and the <a href="root">root</a>s, <a href="leaf">leaves</a>, and other <a href="Organ%20%28anatomy%29">organs</a> found in <a href="tracheophyte">tracheophyte</a>s (<a href="vascular%20plants">vascular plants</a>). Most are <a href="phototroph">phototroph</a>ic, although some are <a href="mixotroph">mixotroph</a>ic, deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by <a href="osmotrophy">osmotrophy</a>, <a href="myzocytosis">myzotrophy</a>, or <a href="phagocytosis">phagotrophy</a>. Some unicellular species of <a href="green%20algae">green algae</a>, many <a href="golden%20algae">golden algae</a>, <a href="euglenid">euglenid</a>s, <a href="dinoflagellate">dinoflagellate</a>s, and other algae have become <a href="heterotroph">heterotroph</a>s (also called colorless or apochlorotic algae), sometimes parasitic, relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus. Some other heterotrophic organisms, such as the <a href="apicomplexans">apicomplexans</a>, are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids, but are not traditionally considered as algae. Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> that produce <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as <a href="Purple%20sulfur%20bacteria">purple</a> and <a href="green%20sulfur%20bacteria">green sulfur bacteria</a>. Fossilized filamentous algae from the <a href="Vindhya">Vindhya</a> basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago.

The singular "alga" is the Latin word for "seaweed" and retains that meaning in English. The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> is obscure. Although some speculate that it is related to Latin "algēre", "be cold", no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature. A more likely source is "alliga", "binding, entwining".

The <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word for seaweed was φῦκος ("phŷcos"), which could mean either the seaweed (probably red algae) or a red dye derived from it. The Latinization, "fūcus", meant primarily the cosmetic rouge. The etymology is uncertain, but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical פוך ("pūk"), "paint" (if not that word itself), a cosmetic eye-shadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean. It could be any color: black, red, green, or blue.

Accordingly, the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either <a href="phycology">phycology</a> or algology, depending on whether the Greek or Latin root is used. The name "Fucus" appears in a number of <a href="taxon">taxa</a>.

Most algae contain <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts contain circular <a href="DNA">DNA</a> like that in cyanobacteria and presumably represent reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. However, the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae, reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost plastids entirely.

<a href="Phylogeny">Phylogeny</a> based on <a href="plastid">plastid</a> not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy:

<a href="Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>, in "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>" (1753), the starting point for modern <a href="botanical%20nomenclature">botanical nomenclature</a>, recognized 14 genera of algae, of which only four are currently considered among algae. In "<a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", Linnaeus described the genera "<a href="Volvox">Volvox</a>" and "<a href="Corallina">Corallina</a>", and a species of "<a href="Acetabularia">Acetabularia</a>" (as "<a href="Madrepora">Madrepora</a>"), among the animals.

In 1768, <a href="Samuel%20Gottlieb%20Gmelin">Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin</a> (1744–1774) published the "Historia Fucorum", the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on <a href="marine%20biology">marine biology</a> to use the then new binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus. It included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves.

<a href="W.H.Harvey">W.H.Harvey</a> (1811—1866) and <a href="Lamouroux">Lamouroux</a> (1813) were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation. This is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics. Harvey's four divisions are: red algae (Rhodospermae), brown algae (Melanospermae), green algae (Chlorospermae), and Diatomaceae.

At this time, microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers (e.g., <a href="Otto%20Friedrich%20M%C3%BCller">O. F. Müller</a> and <a href="Christian%20Gottfried%20Ehrenberg">Ehrenberg</a>) studying the <a href="Infusoria">Infusoria</a> (microscopic organisms). Unlike <a href="macroalgae">macroalgae</a>, which were clearly viewed as plants, <a href="microalgae">microalgae</a> were frequently considered animals because they are often motile. Even the nonmotile (coccoid) microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants, macroalgae, or animals.

Although used as a taxonomic category in some pre-Darwinian classifications, e.g., Linnaeus (1753), de Jussieu (1789), Horaninow (1843), Agassiz (1859), Wilson & Cassin (1864), in further classifications, the "algae" are seen as an artificial, polyphyletic group.

Throughout the 20th century, most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae: <a href="cyanophyte">cyanophyte</a>s, <a href="rhodophyte">rhodophyte</a>s, <a href="chrysophyte">chrysophyte</a>s, <a href="xanthophyte">xanthophyte</a>s, <a href="diatom">bacillariophyte</a>s, <a href="phaeophyte">phaeophyte</a>s, <a href="Dinoflagellate%23history">pyrrhophyte</a>s (<a href="Cryptomonad">cryptophyte</a>s and <a href="dinophyte">dinophyte</a>s), <a href="euglenophyte">euglenophyte</a>s, and <a href="chlorophyte">chlorophyte</a>s. Later, many new groups were discovered (e.g., <a href="Bolidophyceae">Bolidophyceae</a>), and others were splintered from older groups: <a href="charophyte">charophyte</a>s and <a href="glaucophyte">glaucophyte</a>s (from chlorophytes), many <a href="heterokontophyte">heterokontophyte</a>s (e.g., <a href="Synurophyceae">synurophytes</a> from chrysophytes, or <a href="eustigmatophyte">eustigmatophyte</a>s from xanthophytes), <a href="haptophyte">haptophyte</a>s (from chrysophytes), and <a href="chlorarachniophyte">chlorarachniophyte</a>s (from xanthophytes).

With the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous classification, most groups of algae (sometimes all) were included in <a href="Protist">Protist</a>a, later also abandoned in favour of <a href="Eukaryota">Eukaryota</a>. However, as a legacy of the older plant life scheme, some groups that were also treated as <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>ns in the past still have duplicated classifications (see <a href="ambiregnal%20protist">ambiregnal protist</a>s).

Some parasitic algae (e.g., the green algae "<a href="Prototheca">Prototheca</a>" and "<a href="Helicosporidium">Helicosporidium</a>", parasites of metazoans, or "<a href="Cephaleuros">Cephaleuros</a>", parasites of plants) were originally classified as <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="sporozoan">sporozoan</a>s, or <a href="protist">protist</a>ans of "<a href="incertae%20sedis">incertae sedis</a>", while others (e.g., the green algae "<a href="Phyllosiphon">Phyllosiphon</a>" and "<a href="Rhodochytrium">Rhodochytrium</a>", parasites of plants, or the red algae "<a href="Pterocladiophila">Pterocladiophila</a>" and "<a href="Gelidiocolax%20mammillatus">Gelidiocolax mammillatus</a>", parasites of other red algae, or the dinoflagellates "<a href="Oodinium">Oodinium</a>", parasites of fish) had their relationship with algae conjectured early. In other cases, some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae (e.g., "<a href="Chlorochytrium">Chlorochytrium</a>"), but later were seen as <a href="endophytic">endophytic</a> algae. Some filamentous bacteria (e.g., "<a href="Beggiatoa">Beggiatoa</a>") were originally seen as algae. Furthermore, groups like the <a href="apicomplexan">apicomplexan</a>s are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids, but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae.

The first land plants probably evolved from shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like "<a href="Chara%20%28alga%29">Chara</a>" almost 500 million years ago. These probably had an isomorphic <a href="alternation%20of%20generations">alternation of generations</a> and were probably filamentous. Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago.

A range of algal <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologies</a> is exhibited, and <a href="Convergent%20evolution">convergence</a> of features in unrelated groups is common. The only groups to exhibit three-dimensional multicellular <a href="Thallus">thalli</a> are the <a href="Red%20algae">reds</a> and <a href="Brown%20algae">browns</a>, and some <a href="Chlorophyta">chlorophytes</a>. Apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups: the <a href="Florideophyceae">florideophyte</a> reds, various browns, and the charophytes. The form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns, because they have distinct nodes, separated by internode 'stems'; whorls of branches reminiscent of the <a href="horsetail">horsetail</a>s occur at the nodes. <a href="Conceptacle">Conceptacle</a>s are another <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a> trait; they appear in the <a href="coralline%20algae">coralline algae</a> and the <a href="Hildenbrandiales">Hildenbrandiales</a>, as well as the browns.

Most of the simpler algae are <a href="unicellular">unicellular</a> <a href="flagellate">flagellate</a>s or <a href="amoeboid">amoeboid</a>s, but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups. Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">lifecycle</a> of a species, are

In three lines, even higher levels of organization have been reached, with full tissue differentiation. These are the brown algae,—some of which may reach 50 m in length (<a href="kelp">kelp</a>s)—the red algae, and the green algae. The most complex forms are found among the green algae (see <a href="Charales">Charales</a> and <a href="Charophyta">Charophyta</a>), in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants. The point where these nonalgal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers, a characteristic not found in the other algal groups.

Many algae, particularly members of the <a href="Characeae">Characeae</a>, have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes, <a href="osmoregulation">osmoregulation</a>, <a href="turgor%20regulation">turgor regulation</a>, <a href="salt%20tolerance">salt tolerance</a>, <a href="cytoplasmic%20streaming">cytoplasmic streaming</a>, and the generation of <a href="action%20potentials">action potentials</a>.

<a href="Phytohormone">Phytohormone</a>s are found not only in higher plants, but in algae, too.

Some species of algae form <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic relationships</a> with other organisms. In these symbioses, the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells. The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae. Examples are:

<a href="Lichen">Lichen</a>s are defined by the <a href="International%20Association%20for%20Lichenology">International Association for Lichenology</a> to be "an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic <a href="symbiont">symbiont</a> resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure." The fungi, or mycobionts, are mainly from the <a href="Ascomycota">Ascomycota</a> with a few from the <a href="Basidiomycota">Basidiomycota</a>. They are not found alone in nature; but when they began to associate is not known. One mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species, rarely two, from the green algae, except that alternatively, the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria (hence "photobiont" is the more accurate term). A photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently; accordingly, lichens are named and classified as fungal species. The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated). The photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont.

 <a href="Coral%20reef">Coral reef</a>s are accumulated from the <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>s of <a href="marine%20invertebrate">marine invertebrate</a>s of the order <a href="Scleractinia">Scleractinia</a> (stony <a href="coral">coral</a>s). These <a href="Animal%23Food%20and%20energy%20sourcing">animals</a> <a href="Metabolism">metabolize</a> <a href="Sugar%23Chemistry">sugar</a> and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell-building processes, including <a href="secretion">secretion</a> of the exoskeleton, with water and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> as byproducts. Dinoflagellates (algal protists) are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coral-forming marine invertebrates, where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host. Reef-building stony corals (<a href="hermatypic%20coral">hermatypic coral</a>s) require endosymbiotic algae from the genus "<a href="Symbiodinium">Symbiodinium</a>" to be in a healthy condition. The loss of "Symbiodinium" from the host is known as <a href="coral%20bleaching">coral bleaching</a>, a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef.

Green algae live close to the surface of some sponges, for example, breadcrumb sponge ("<a href="Halichondria%20panicea">Halichondria panicea</a>"). The alga is thus protected from predators; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80% of sponge growth in some species.

<a href="Rhodophyta">Rhodophyta</a>, <a href="Chlorophyta">Chlorophyta</a>, and <a href="Heterokontophyta">Heterokontophyta</a>, the three main algal <a href="phylum">divisions</a>, have lifecycles which show considerable variation and complexity. In general, an asexual phase exists where the seaweed's cells are <a href="diploid">diploid</a>, a sexual phase where the cells are <a href="haploid">haploid</a>, followed by fusion of the male and female <a href="gamete">gamete</a>s. Asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible. Commonly, in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae, two specialized, sexually compatible, haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a <a href="zygote">zygote</a>. To ensure a successful mating, the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated; pheromones may play a key role in these processes. Sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiosis, a key stage of the sexual cycle. However, sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction. Meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae.

The "Algal Collection of the US National Herbarium" (located in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">National Museum of Natural History</a>) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens, which, although not exhaustive (no exhaustive collection exists), gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species (that number remains unknown). Estimates vary widely. For example, according to one standard textbook, in the British Isles the "UK Biodiversity Steering Group Report" estimated there to be 20,000 algal species in the UK. Another checklist reports only about 5,000 species. Regarding the difference of about 15,000 species, the text concludes: "It will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species ..."

Regional and group estimates have been made, as well:
and so on, but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources, these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above. Most estimates also omit microscopic algae, such as phytoplankton.

The most recent estimate suggests 72,500 algal species worldwide.

The distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of <a href="phytogeography">phytogeography</a> in the mid-19th century. Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of <a href="spore">spore</a>s analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores. This dispersal can be accomplished by air, water, or other organisms. Due to this, spores can be found in a variety of environments: fresh and marine waters, air, soil, and in or on other organisms. Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands.

The spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers. However, not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae, as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them. Marine spores are often spread by ocean currents. Ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability, resulting in phytogeographic zones, regions, and provinces.

To some degree, the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features, such as <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is, therefore, possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as "Pacific algae" or "North Sea algae". When they occur out of their localities, hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible, such as the hulls of ships. For example, "Ulva reticulata" and "U. fasciata" travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner.

Mapping is possible for select species only: "there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns." For example, "Clathromorphum" is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there. However, scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the "difficulties of undertaking such studies."

Algae are prominent in bodies of water, common in terrestrial environments, and are found in unusual environments, such as on <a href="Snow%20algae">snow</a> and <a href="Ice%20algae">ice</a>. Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters, under deep; however, some such as <a href="Navicula">Navicula</a> pennata have been recorded to a depth of .

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology. Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column (<a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>) provide the food base for most marine <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>s. In very high densities (<a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a>s), these algae may discolor the water and outcompete, poison, or <a href="asphyxiate">asphyxiate</a> other life forms.

Algae can be used as <a href="indicator%20organism">indicator organism</a>s to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems. In many cases, algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants. Due to this, the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants. To detect these changes, algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease.

On the basis of their habitat, algae can be categorized as: <a href="Aquatic%20plant">aquatic</a> (<a href="planktonic">planktonic</a>, <a href="benthic">benthic</a>, <a href="Marine%20biology">marine</a>, <a href="freshwater">freshwater</a>, <a href="lentic">lentic</a>, <a href="lotic">lotic</a>), <a href="terrestrial%20plant">terrestrial</a>, <a href="Aerobiology">aerial</a> (subareial), <a href="lithophytic">lithophytic</a>, <a href="halophytic">halophytic</a> (or <a href="euryhaline">euryhaline</a>), <a href="psammon">psammon</a>, <a href="thermophilic">thermophilic</a>, <a href="Psychrophile">cryophilic</a>, <a href="epibiont">epibiont</a> (<a href="epiphytic">epiphytic</a>, <a href="epizoic">epizoic</a>), <a href="endosymbiont">endosymbiont</a> (<a href="endophytic">endophytic</a>, endozoic), <a href="parasitic">parasitic</a>, <a href="calcareous">calcifilic</a> or <a href="lichen">lichen</a>ic (phycobiont).

In <a href="classical%20Chinese">classical Chinese</a>, the word is used both for "algae" and (in the modest tradition of the <a href="scholar-official">imperial scholars</a>) for "literary talent". The third island in <a href="Kunming%20Lake">Kunming Lake</a> beside the <a href="Summer%20Palace">Summer Palace</a> in Beijing is known as the Zaojian Tang Dao, which thus simultaneously means "Island of the Algae-Viewing Hall" and "Island of the Hall for Reflecting on Literary Talent".

<a href="Agar">Agar</a>, a <a href="gelatin">gelatin</a>ous substance derived from red algae, has a number of commercial uses. It is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi, as most microorganisms cannot digest agar.

Alginic acid, or alginate, is extracted from brown algae. Its uses range from gelling agents in food, to medical dressings. Alginic acid also has been used in the field of <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a> as a <a href="Biocompatibility">biocompatible medium</a> for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization. <a href="Molecular%20cuisine">Molecular cuisine</a> is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties, by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours.

Between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of "<a href="Macrocystis">Macrocystis</a>" are harvested annually in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> for <a href="Alginic%20acid">alginate</a> extraction and <a href="abalone">abalone</a> feed.

To be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from (local) policy on the long run, biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels. Here, algae-based fuels hold great promise, directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass. The break-even point for algae-based biofuels is estimated to occur by 2025.

For centuries, seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; <a href="George%20Owen%20of%20Henllys">George Owen of Henllys</a> writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a>:This kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes, where it heteth and rotteth, and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land, as they do their muck, and thereof springeth good corn, especially barley ... After spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea, they fetch it in sacks on horse backes, and carie the same three, four, or five miles, and cast it on the lande, which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass.

Today, algae are used by humans in many ways; for example, as <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s, <a href="soil%20conditioner">soil conditioner</a>s, and livestock feed.

Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer.

Analysis of variance

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of <a href="statistical%20model">statistical model</a>s used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures (such as "variation" among and between groups), developed by <a href="statistician">statistician</a> and <a href="evolutionary%20biology">evolutionary biologist</a> <a href="Ronald%20Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>. In the ANOVA setting, the observed <a href="variance">variance</a> in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a <a href="statistical%20test">statistical test</a> of whether or not the <a href="mean">mean</a>s of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the <a href="Student%27s%20t-test%23Independent%20two-sample%20t-test">"t"-test</a> to more than two groups. ANOVAs are useful for comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for <a href="statistical%20significance">statistical significance</a>. It is conceptually similar to <a href="Multiple%20comparisons%20problem">multiple two-sample t-tests</a>, but is more conservative (results in less <a href="type%20I%20error">type I error</a>) and is therefore suited to a wide range of practical problems.
While the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century, antecedents extend centuries into the past according to Stigler. These include hypothesis testing, the partitioning of sums of squares, experimental techniques and the additive model. <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Laplace</a> was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s. The development of least-squares methods by Laplace and <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Gauss</a> circa 1800 provided an improved method of combining observations (over the existing practices then used in astronomy and geodesy). It also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares. Laplace soon knew how to estimate a variance from a residual (rather than a total) sum of squares. By 1827 Laplace was using least squares methods to address ANOVA problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides. Before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting 
from reaction times (the "<a href="personal%20equation">personal equation</a>") and had developed methods of reducing the errors. The experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology which developed strong (full factorial) experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added. An eloquent non-mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was
available in 1885.

<a href="Ronald%20Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a> introduced the term <a href="variance">variance</a> and proposed its formal analysis in a 1918 article "<a href="The%20Correlation%20Between%20Relatives%20on%20the%20Supposition%20of%20Mendelian%20Inheritance">The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance</a>". His first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921. Analysis of variance became widely known after being included in Fisher's 1925 book "<a href="Statistical%20Methods%20for%20Research%20Workers">Statistical Methods for Research Workers</a>".

Randomization models were developed by several researchers. The first was published in Polish by <a href="Jerzy%20Neyman">Jerzy Neyman</a> in 1923.

One of the attributes of ANOVA which ensured its early popularity was computational elegance. The structure of the additive model allows solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than by matrix calculations. In the era of mechanical calculators this simplicity was critical. The determination of statistical significance also required access to tables of the F function which were supplied by early statistics texts.

The analysis of variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations. A dog show provides an example. A dog show is not a random sampling of the breed: it is typically limited to dogs that are adult, pure-bred, and exemplary. A histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex, like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations. Suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog. Before we could do that, we would need to "explain" the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics. A successful grouping will split dogs such that (a) each group has a low variance of dog weights (meaning the group is relatively homogeneous) and (b) the mean of each group is distinct (if two groups have the same mean, then it isn't reasonable to conclude that the groups are, in fact, separate in any meaningful way).
In the illustrations to the right, each group is identified as "X", "X", etc. In the first illustration, we divide the dogs according to the product (interaction) of two binary groupings: young vs old, and short-haired vs long-haired (thus, group 1 is young, short-haired dogs, group 2 is young, long-haired dogs, etc.). Since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups (shown in blue) has a large variance, and since the means are very close across groups, grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights: knowing which group a dog is in does not allow us to make any reasonable statements as to what that dog's weight is likely to be. Thus, this grouping fails to "fit" the distribution we are trying to explain (yellow-orange).

An attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as (pet vs working breed) and (less athletic vs more athletic) would probably be somewhat more successful (fair fit). The heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds, while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter. As shown by the second illustration, the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case, and the means are more reasonably distinguishable. However, the significant overlap of distributions, for example, means that we cannot reliably say that "X" and "X" are truly distinct (i.e., it is perhaps reasonably likely that splitting dogs according to the flip of a coin—by pure chance—might produce distributions that look similar).

An attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit. All Chihuahuas are light and all St Bernards are heavy. The difference in weights between Setters and Pointers does not justify separate breeds. The analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments. A common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models. The method has some advantages over correlation: not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship.

ANOVA is a particular form of <a href="statistical%20hypothesis%20testing">statistical hypothesis testing</a> heavily used in the analysis of experimental data. A test result (calculated from the <a href="null%20hypothesis">null hypothesis</a> and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance, "assuming the truth of the null hypothesis". A statistically significant result, when a probability (<a href="p-value">p-value</a>) is less than a threshold (significance level), justifies the rejection of the <a href="null%20hypothesis">null hypothesis</a>, but only if the priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high.

In the typical application of ANOVA, the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population. For example, when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients, the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none). Rejecting the null hypothesis would imply that different treatments result in altered effects.

By construction, hypothesis testing limits the rate of <a href="Type%20I%20errors">Type I errors</a> (false positives) to a significance level. Experimenters also wish to limit <a href="Type%20II%20errors">Type II errors</a> (false negatives). 
The rate of Type II errors depends largely on sample size (the rate will increase for small numbers of samples), significance 
level (when the standard of proof is high, the chances of overlooking 
a discovery are also high) and <a href="effect%20size">effect size</a> (a smaller effect size is more prone to Type II error).

The terminology of ANOVA is largely from the statistical 
<a href="design%20of%20experiments">design of experiments</a>. The experimenter adjusts factors and 
measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect. Factors are 
assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and 
<a href="Randomized%20block%20design">blocking</a> to ensure the validity of the results. <a href="Blind%20experiment">Blinding</a> keeps the
weighing impartial. Responses show a variability that is partially 
the result of the effect and is partially random error.

ANOVA is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple 
purposes. As a consequence, it is difficult to define concisely or precisely.

"Classical ANOVA for balanced data does three things at once:

In short, ANOVA is a statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data.

Additionally:

As a result:
ANOVA "has long enjoyed the status of being the most used (some would 
say abused) statistical technique in psychological research."
ANOVA "is probably the most useful technique in the field of 
statistical inference."

ANOVA is difficult to teach, particularly for complex experiments, with <a href="Restricted%20randomization">split-plot designs</a> being notorious. In some cases the proper 
application of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition 
followed by the consultation of a classic authoritative test.

(Condensed from the NIST Engineering Statistics handbook: Section 5.7. A 
Glossary of DOE Terminology.)


There are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance, and these are outlined here.

The fixed-effects model (class I) of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the <a href="response%20variable">response variable</a> values change. This allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole.

Random effects model (class II) is used when the treatments are not fixed. This occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population. Because the levels themselves are <a href="random%20variable">random variable</a>s, some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments (a multi-variable generalization of simple differences) differ from the fixed-effects model.

A mixed-effects model (class III) contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types, with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types.

Example:
Teaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department 
to find a good introductory textbook, with each text considered a 
treatment. The fixed-effects model would compare a list of candidate 
texts. The random-effects model would determine whether important 
differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts. The 
mixed-effects model would compare the (fixed) incumbent texts to 
randomly selected alternatives.

Defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive, with competing 
definitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire.

The analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches, the most common of which uses a <a href="linear%20model">linear model</a> that relates the response to the treatments and blocks. Note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels. Interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data.

The analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a <a href="linear%20model">linear model</a>, which makes the following assumptions about the <a href="probability%20distribution">probability distribution</a> of the responses:

The separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the <a href="errors%20and%20residuals%20in%20statistics">errors</a> are independently, identically, and normally distributed for fixed effects models, that is, that the errors (formula_1) are independent and

In a <a href="Randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized controlled experiment</a>, the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units, following the experimental protocol. This randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out. The objective random-assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis, following the ideas of <a href="Charles%20Sanders%20Peirce">C. S. Peirce</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>. This design-based analysis was discussed and developed by <a href="Francis%20J.%20Anscombe">Francis J. Anscombe</a> at <a href="Rothamsted%20Experimental%20Station">Rothamsted Experimental Station</a> and by <a href="Oscar%20Kempthorne">Oscar Kempthorne</a> at <a href="Iowa%20State%20University">Iowa State University</a>. Kempthorne and his students make an assumption of "unit treatment additivity", which is discussed in the books of Kempthorne and <a href="David%20R.%20Cox">David R. Cox</a>.

In its simplest form, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity states that the observed response formula_3 from experimental unit formula_4 when receiving treatment formula_5 can be written as the sum of the unit's response formula_6 and the treatment-effect formula_7, that is 
The assumption of unit-treatment additivity implies that, for every treatment formula_5, the formula_5th treatment has exactly the same effect formula_11 on every experiment unit.

The assumption of unit treatment additivity usually cannot be directly <a href="falsificationism">falsified</a>, according to Cox and Kempthorne. However, many "consequences" of treatment-unit additivity can be falsified. For a randomized experiment, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity "implies" that the variance is constant for all treatments. Therefore, by <a href="contraposition">contraposition</a>, a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the variance is constant.

The use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population <a href="survey%20sampling">survey sampling</a>.

Kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of "unit treatment additivity" to produce a "derived linear model", very similar to the textbook model discussed previously. The test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model, according to approximation theorems and simulation studies. However, there are differences. For example, the randomization-based analysis results in a small but (strictly) negative correlation between the observations. In the randomization-based analysis, there is "no assumption" of a "normal" distribution and certainly "no assumption" of "independence". On the contrary, "the observations are dependent"!

The randomization-based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time. Since the randomization-based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model, most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach. Few statisticians object to model-based analysis of balanced randomized experiments.

However, when applied to data from non-randomized experiments or <a href="observational%20study">observational studies</a>, model-based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization. For observational data, the derivation of confidence intervals must use "subjective" models, as emphasized by <a href="Ronald%20Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a> and his followers. In practice, the estimates of treatment-effects from observational studies generally are often inconsistent. In practice, "statistical models" and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public.

The normal-model based ANOVA analysis assumes the independence, normality and 
homogeneity of the variances of the residuals. The 
randomization-based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the 
variances of the residuals (as a consequence of unit-treatment 
additivity) and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment. 
Both these analyses require <a href="homoscedasticity">homoscedasticity</a>, as an assumption for the normal-model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization-based analysis.

However, studies of processes that 
change variances rather than means (called dispersion effects) have 
been successfully conducted using ANOVA. There are
"no" necessary assumptions for ANOVA in its full generality, but the
F-test used for ANOVA hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical 
limitations which are of continuing interest.

Problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of ANOVA can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions. 
The property of unit-treatment additivity is not invariant under a "change of scale", so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity. If the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions, then the statistician may specify (in the protocol for the experiment or observational study) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance. Also, a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses, which are believed to follow a multiplicative model.
According to Cauchy's <a href="functional%20equation">functional equation</a> theorem, the <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a> is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition.

ANOVA is used in the analysis of comparative experiments, those in 
which only the difference in outcomes is of interest. The statistical
significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two 
variances. This ratio is independent of several possible alterations
to the experimental observations: Adding a constant to all 
observations does not alter significance. Multiplying all 
observations by a constant does not alter significance. So ANOVA 
statistical significance result is independent of constant bias and 
scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations. 
In the era of mechanical calculation it was common to 
subtract a constant from all observations (when equivalent to 
dropping leading digits) to simplify data entry. This is an example of data
<a href="Coding%20%28social%20sciences%29">coding</a>.

The calculations of ANOVA can be characterized as computing a number
of means and variances, dividing two variances and comparing the ratio 
to a handbook value to determine statistical significance. Calculating 
a treatment effect is then trivial, "the effect of any treatment is 
estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the 
observations which receive the treatment and the general mean".

ANOVA uses traditional standardized terminology. The definitional 
equation of sample variance is
formula_12, where the 
divisor is called the degrees of freedom (DF), the summation is called 
the sum of squares (SS), the result is called the mean square (MS) and 
the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean. ANOVA 
estimates 3 sample variances: a total variance based on all the 
observation deviations from the grand mean, an error variance based on 
all the observation deviations from their appropriate 
treatment means, and a treatment variance. The treatment variance is
based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean, the 
result being multiplied by the number of observations in each 
treatment to account for the difference between the variance of 
observations and the variance of means.

The fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total <a href="sum%20of%20squares%20%28statistics%29">sum of squares</a> "SS" into components related to the effects used in the model. For example, the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels.

The number of <a href="Degrees%20of%20freedom%20%28statistics%29">degrees of freedom</a> "DF" can be partitioned in a similar way: one of these components (that for error) specifies a <a href="chi-squared%20distribution">chi-squared distribution</a> which describes the associated sum of squares, while the same is true for "treatments" if there is no treatment effect.

See also <a href="Lack-of-fit%20sum%20of%20squares">Lack-of-fit sum of squares</a>.

The <a href="F-test">F-test</a> is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation. For example, in one-way, or single-factor ANOVA, statistical significance is tested for by comparing the F test statistic

where "MS" is mean square, formula_17 = number of treatments and 
formula_18 = total number of cases

to the <a href="F-distribution">F-distribution</a> with formula_19, formula_20 degrees of freedom. Using the <a href="F-distribution">F-distribution</a> is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled <a href="chi-squared%20distribution">chi-squared distribution</a>.

The expected value of F is formula_21 (where n is the treatment sample size)
which is 1 for no treatment effect. As values of F increase above 1, the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis. Two apparent experimental methods of increasing F are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls.

There are two methods of concluding the ANOVA hypothesis test, both of which produce the same result:
The ANOVA F-test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors (i.e. maximizing power for a fixed significance level). For example, to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect, the <a href="F-test">F-test</a>'s p-values closely approximate the <a href="permutation%20test">permutation test</a>'s <a href="p-value">p-value</a>s: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced. Such <a href="permutation%20test">permutation test</a>s characterize <a href="uniformly%20most%20powerful%20test">tests with maximum power</a> against all <a href="alternative%20hypothesis">alternative hypotheses</a>, as observed by Rosenbaum. The ANOVA F–test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions.

ANOVA consists of separable parts; partitioning sources of variance 
and hypothesis testing can be used individually. ANOVA is used to 
support other statistical tools. Regression is first used to fit more 
complex models to data, then ANOVA is used to compare models with the 
objective of selecting simple(r) models that adequately describe the 
data. "Such models could be fit without any reference to ANOVA, but 
ANOVA tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models, 
and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients." 
"[W]e think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring 
multilevel models—not as an alternative to regression but as a tool 
for summarizing complex high-dimensional inferences ..."

The simplest experiment suitable for ANOVA analysis is the completely 
randomized experiment with a single factor. More complex experiments 
with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include 
completely randomized blocks and Latin squares (and variants: 
Graeco-Latin squares, etc.). The more complex experiments share many 
of the complexities of multiple factors. A relatively complete 
discussion of the analysis (models, data summaries, ANOVA table) of 
the completely randomized experiment is 
<a href="One-way%20analysis%20of%20variance">available</a>.

ANOVA generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors. 
When the experiment includes observations at all combinations of 
levels of each factor, it is termed <a href="Factorial%20experiment">factorial</a>. 
Factorial experiments 
are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the 
efficiency grows as the number of factors increases. Consequently, factorial designs are heavily used.

The use of ANOVA to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication. In a 3-way ANOVA with factors x, y and z, the ANOVA model includes terms for the main effects (x, y, z) and terms for <a href="Interaction%20%28statistics%29">interactions</a> (xy, xz, yz, xyz). 
All terms require hypothesis tests. The proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance. Fortunately, experience says that high order interactions are rare. 
The ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple 
factor ANOVA. Testing one factor at a time hides interactions, but 
produces apparently inconsistent experimental results.

Caution is advised when encountering interactions; Test 
interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond ANOVA if 
interactions are found. Texts vary in their recommendations regarding 
the continuation of the ANOVA procedure after encountering an 
interaction. Interactions complicate the interpretation of 
experimental data. Neither the calculations of significance nor the 
estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value. "A 
significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects." Graphical methods are recommended
to enhance understanding. Regression is often useful. A lengthy discussion of interactions is available in Cox (1958). Some interactions can be removed (by transformations) while others cannot.

A variety of techniques are used with multiple factor ANOVA to reduce expense. One technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication (possibly no replication with support of <a href="Tukey%27s%20test%20of%20additivity">analytical trickery</a>) and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically (or practically) insignificant. An experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications.

Several fully worked numerical examples are available. A 
<a href="F-test%23One-way%20ANOVA%20example">simple case</a> uses one-way (a single factor) analysis. A <a href="Two-way%20analysis%20of%20variance">more complex case</a> uses two-way (two-factor) analysis.

Some analysis is required in support of the "design" of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses. Because experimentation is iterative, the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments.

In the design of an experiment, the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment. Experimentation is often sequential.

Early experiments are often designed to provide mean-unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error. Later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude; in this case, the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power, among other goals.

Reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology. "Provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions." The analysis, which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted, is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards.

Besides the power analysis, there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units. These include graphical methods based on limiting
the probability of false negative errors, graphical methods based on an expected variation increase (above the residuals) and methods based on achieving a desired confident interval.

<a href="Statistical%20power">Power analysis</a> is often applied in the context of ANOVA in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain ANOVA design, effect size in the population, sample size and significance level. Power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.

Several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for ANOVA to summarize the strength of the association between a predictor(s) and the dependent variable (e.g., η, ω, or ƒ) or the overall standardized difference (Ψ) of the complete model. Standardized effect-size estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines. However, while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature, a non-standardized measure of effect size that has immediately "meaningful" units may be preferable for reporting purposes.

It is always appropriate to carefully consider outliers. They have a disproportionate impact on statistical conclusions and are often the result of errors.

It is prudent to verify that the assumptions of ANOVA have been met. Residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm <a href="homoscedasticity">homoscedasticity</a> and gross normality. Residuals should have the appearance of (zero mean normal distribution) noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and 
modeled data values. Trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations. One rule of thumb: "If the largest standard deviation is less than twice the smallest standard deviation, we can use methods based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our results 
will still be approximately correct."

A statistically significant effect in ANOVA is often followed up with one or more different follow-up tests. This can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses. Follow-up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned (<a href="A%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori">a priori</a>) or <a href="Post-hoc%20analysis">post hoc</a>. Planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data.

Often one of the "treatments" is none, so the treatment group can act as a control. <a href="Dunnett%27s%20test">Dunnett's test</a> (a modification of the t-test) tests whether each of the other treatment groups has the same 
mean as the control.

Post hoc tests such as <a href="Tukey%27s%20range%20test">Tukey's range test</a> most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for Type I errors. Comparisons, which are most commonly planned, can be either simple or compound. Simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean. Compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups (e.g., compare average group means of group A, B and C with group D). Comparisons can also look at tests of trend, such as linear and quadratic relationships, when the independent variable involves ordered levels.

Following ANOVA with pair-wise multiple-comparison tests has been criticized on several grounds. There are many such tests (10 in one table) and recommendations regarding their use are vague or conflicting.

There are several types of ANOVA. Many statisticians base ANOVA on the <a href="experimental%20design">design of the experiment</a>, especially on the protocol that specifies the <a href="random%20assignment">random assignment</a> of treatments to subjects; the protocol's description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any <a href="blocking%20%28statistics%29">blocking</a>. It is also common to apply ANOVA to observational data using an appropriate statistical model.

Some popular designs use the following types of ANOVA:

Balanced experiments (those with an equal sample size for each treatment) are relatively easy to interpret; Unbalanced 
experiments offer more complexity. For single factor (one way) ANOVA, the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy, but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power. For more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications. "The orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case. This means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply. 
Consequently, the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs." In the general case, "The analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data, but then the sums of squares, mean squares, and F-ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation 
are considered." The simplest techniques for handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data or by synthesizing missing data. More complex techniques use regression.

ANOVA is (in part) a significance test. The American Psychological Association holds the view that simply reporting significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred.

While ANOVA is conservative (in maintaining a significance level) against <a href="multiple%20comparisons">multiple comparisons</a> in one dimension, it is not conservative against comparisons in multiple dimensions.

ANOVA is considered to be a special case of <a href="linear%20regression">linear regression</a> which in turn is a special case of the <a href="general%20linear%20model">general linear model</a>. All consider the observations to be the sum of a model (fit) and a residual (error) to be minimized.

The <a href="Kruskal%26amp%3Bndash%3BWallis%20test">Kruskal–Wallis test</a> and the <a href="Friedman%20test">Friedman test</a> are <a href="nonparametric">nonparametric</a> tests, which do not rely on an assumption of normality.

Below we make clear the connection between multi-way ANOVA and linear regression. Linearly re-order the data so that formula_22 observation is associated with a response formula_23 and factors formula_24 where formula_25 denotes the different factors and formula_26 is the total number of factors. In one-way ANOVA formula_27 and in two-way ANOVA formula_28. Furthermore, we assume the formula_29 factor has formula_30 levels. Now, we can <a href="one-hot">one-hot</a> encode the factors into the formula_31 dimensional vector formula_32.

The one-hot encoding function formula_33 is defined such that the formula_34 entry of formula_35 is
formula_36
The vector formula_32 is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all formula_38. Thus, formula_39. In order to obtain a fully general formula_26-way interaction ANOVA we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector formula_32 and then add an intercept term. Let that vector be formula_42.

With this notation in place, we now have the exact connection with linear regression. We simply regress response formula_23 against the vector formula_44. However, there is a concern about identifiability. In order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero. From here, one can use F-statistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors.

We can consider the 2-way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has 2 levels and the second factor has 3 levels.

Define formula_45 if formula_46 and formula_47 if formula_48, i.e. formula_49 is the one-hot encoding of the first factor and formula_38 is the one-hot encoding of the second factor.

With that,
formula_51
where the last term is an intercept term. For a more concrete example suppose that
formula_52
Then,
formula_53

Alkane

In <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, an alkane, or paraffin (a historical name that also has <a href="paraffin%20%28disambiguation%29">other meanings</a>), is an <a href="open-chain%20compound">acyclic</a> <a href="saturation%20%28chemistry%29">saturated</a> <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>. In other words, an alkane consists of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="carbon">carbon</a> atoms arranged in a <a href="tree%20%28graph%20theory%29">tree</a> structure in which all the <a href="C-C%20bond">carbon-carbon bonds</a> are <a href="single%20bond">single</a>. Alkanes have the general chemical formula . The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of <a href="methane">methane</a>, CH where "n" = 1 (sometimes called the parent molecule), to arbitrarily large molecules. 

Besides this standard definition by <a href="IUPAC">the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a>, in some authors' usage the term "alkane" is applied to any saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the <a href="cycloalkane">cycloalkane</a>s) or polycyclic.

In an alkane, each carbon atom has 4 bonds (either C-C or <a href="C-H%20bond">C-H</a>), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms (so in a C-H bond). The longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its <a href="skeletal%20formula">carbon skeleton</a> or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms may be thought of as the size of the alkane.

One group of the <a href="higher%20alkanes">higher alkanes</a> are <a href="wax">wax</a>es, solids at standard <a href="ambient%20temperature">ambient temperature</a> and pressure (SATP), for which the number of carbons in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17.

With their repeated -CH- units, the alkanes constitute a <a href="homologous%20series">homologous series</a> of organic compounds in which the members differ in <a href="molecular%20mass">molecular mass</a> by multiples of 14.03 <a href="atomic%20mass%20unit">u</a> (the total mass of each such <a href="methylene%20bridge">methylene-bridge</a> unit, which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12.01 u and two hydrogen atoms of mass ~1.01 u each).

Alkanes are not very reactive and have little <a href="biological%20activity">biological activity</a>. They can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active/reactive <a href="functional%20groups">functional groups</a> of biological molecules.

The alkanes have two main commercial sources: <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> (crude oil) and <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>.

An <a href="alkyl">alkyl</a> group, generally abbreviated with the symbol R, is a functional group that, like an alkane, consists solely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms connected acyclically—for example, a <a href="methyl">methyl</a> or <a href="ethyl%20group">ethyl group</a>.

Saturated hydrocarbons are <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s having only single covalent bonds between their carbons. They can be:

According to the definition by <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">IUPAC</a>, the former two are alkanes, whereas the third group is called <a href="cycloalkane">cycloalkane</a>s. Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures; the general formula is , where "k" is the number of independent loops. Alkanes are the <a href="Open%20chain%20compound">acyclic</a> (loopless) ones, corresponding to "k" = 0.

Alkanes with more than three <a href="carbon">carbon</a> atoms can be arranged in various different ways, forming <a href="structural%20isomer">structural isomer</a>s. The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the "n"-isomer ("n" for "normal", although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms. For example:

Branched alkanes can be <a href="chirality%20%28chemistry%29">chiral</a>. For example, <a href="3-methylhexane">3-methylhexane</a> and its higher <a href="Homology%20%28chemistry%29">homologues</a> are chiral due to their <a href="stereogenic%20center">stereogenic center</a> at carbon atom number 3. In addition to the alkane isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called <a href="cycloalkane">cycloalkane</a>s.

The <a href="IUPAC%20nomenclature%20of%20organic%20chemistry%23Alkanes">IUPAC nomenclature</a> (systematic way of naming compounds) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains. Unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix "-ane".

In 1866, <a href="August%20Wilhelm%20von%20Hofmann">August Wilhelm von Hofmann</a> suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a, e, i, o and u to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the <a href="hydrocarbons">hydrocarbons</a> CH, CH, CH, CH, CH. Now, the first three name hydrocarbons with single, double and triple bonds; "-one" represents a <a href="ketone">ketone</a>; "-ol" represents an alcohol or OH group; "-oxy-" means an <a href="ether">ether</a> and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that methoxymethane is the IUPAC name for <a href="dimethyl%20ether">dimethyl ether</a>.

It is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">IUPAC</a> name. This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets. Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group. Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.

Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix ""n"-" (for "normal") where a non-linear <a href="isomer">isomer</a> exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers, e.g., <a href="hexane">"n"-hexane</a> or 2- or 3-methylpentane. Alternative names for this group are: linear paraffins or "n"-paraffins.

The members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:

The first four names were <a href="back-formation">derived</a> from <a href="methanol">methanol</a>, <a href="diethyl%20ether">ether</a>, <a href="propionic%20acid">propionic acid</a> and <a href="butyric%20acid">butyric acid</a>, respectively (<a href="hexadecane">hexadecane</a> is also sometimes referred to as cetane). Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the <a href="Affix">suffix</a> -ane to the appropriate <a href="IUPAC%20numerical%20multiplier">numerical multiplier</a> prefix with elision of any terminal vowel ("-a" or "-o") from the basic numerical term. Hence, <a href="pentane">pentane</a>, CH; <a href="hexane">hexane</a>, CH; <a href="heptane">heptane</a>, CH; <a href="octane">octane</a>, CH; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example <a href="nonane">nonane</a>, use the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> prefix non-. For a more complete list, see <a href="List%20of%20alkanes">List of alkanes</a>.

Simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes, for example <a href="pentane">"n"-pentane</a>, <a href="isopentane">isopentane</a>, and <a href="neopentane">neopentane</a>.

IUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name.

The key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows:

Though technically distinct from the alkanes, this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the "cyclic alkanes." As their description implies, they contain one or more rings.

Simple cycloalkanes have a prefix "cyclo-" to distinguish them from alkanes. Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones, e.g., <a href="cyclopentane">cyclopentane</a> (CH) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like <a href="pentane">pentane</a> (CH), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring. In a similar manner, <a href="propane">propane</a> and <a href="cyclopropane">cyclopropane</a>, <a href="butane">butane</a> and <a href="cyclobutane">cyclobutane</a>, etc.

Substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes — the cycloalkane ring is stated, and the substituents are according to their position on the ring, with the numbering decided by the <a href="Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog%20priority%20rules">Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules</a>.

The trivial (non-<a href="IUPAC%20nomenclature">systematic</a>) name for alkanes is "paraffins". Together, alkanes are known as the "paraffin series". Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.

It is almost certain that the term "paraffin" stems from the petrochemical industry. Branched-chain alkanes are called "isoparaffins". The use of the term "paraffin" is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of <a href="isomer">isomer</a>s, i.e., compounds of the same <a href="chemical%20formula">chemical formula</a>, e.g., <a href="pentane">pentane</a> and <a href="isopentane">isopentane</a>.

The following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system:

All alkanes are colourless and odourless.

Alkanes experience intermolecular <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20force">van der Waals force</a>s. Stronger intermolecular van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes.

There are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces:

Under <a href="standard%20conditions">standard conditions</a>, from CH to CH alkanes are gaseous; from CH to CH they are liquids; and after CH they are solids. As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size (<a href="molecular%20weight">molecular weight</a>) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20–30 °C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.

A straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare <a href="isobutane">isobutane</a> (2-methylpropane) and <a href="n-butane">n-butane</a> (butane), which boil at −12 and 0 °C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58 °C, respectively. For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can "lock" into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.

On the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact.

The <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a>s of the alkanes follow a similar trend to <a href="boiling%20points">boiling points</a> for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-numbered alkanes pack less well and so the "looser" organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.

The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for <a href="isoalkanes">isoalkanes</a> (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.

Alkanes do not conduct electricity, nor are they substantially <a href="Relative%20static%20permittivity">polarized</a> by an <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a>. For this reason, they do not form <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in <a href="entropy">entropy</a>). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the <a href="second%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a> suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be <a href="Hydrophobe">hydrophobic</a> in that they repel water.

Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property that is called <a href="lipophilicity">lipophilicity</a>. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.

The density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane–water mixture.

The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a> of <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, which has four <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always <a href="Orbital%20hybridization">sp hybridized</a>, that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a <a href="tetrahedron">tetrahedron</a>, the angle of cos(−) ≈ 109.47° between them.

An alkane molecule has only C–H and C–C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of an sp orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp orbitals on different carbon atoms. The <a href="bond%20length">bond length</a>s amount to 1.09 × 10 m for a C–H bond and 1.54 × 10 m for a C–C bond.
The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them. Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.

The structural formula and the <a href="bond%20angle">bond angle</a>s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further <a href="degrees%20of%20freedom%20%28physics%20and%20chemistry%29">degree of freedom</a> for each carbon–carbon bond: the <a href="torsion%20angle">torsion angle</a> between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its <a href="conformational%20isomerism">conformation</a>.

<a href="Ethane">Ethane</a> forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called <a href="Newman%20projection">Newman projection</a>. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: <a href="eclipsed">eclipsed</a> conformation and <a href="staggered%20conformation">staggered conformation</a>.

The two conformations, also known as <a href="rotamer">rotamer</a>s, differ in energy: The staggered conformation is 12.6 kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).

This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the <a href="torsion%20energy">torsion energy</a>, is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C–C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order of 10 seconds.

The case of <a href="higher%20alkanes">higher alkanes</a> is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon–carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.

Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon–carbon, and carbon–hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the "absence" of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a different functional group like <a href="Alcohol%20%28chemistry%29">–OH</a>, <a href="Aldehyde">–CHO</a>, <a href="Carboxylic%20acid">–COOH</a> etc.

The carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960 <a href="Wavenumber">cm</a>, while the carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 cm. The carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450 cm and 1375 cm, while methylene groups show bands at 1465 cm and 1450 cm. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725 cm.

The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at <a href="chemical%20shift">"δ"</a> = 0.5–1.5. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: "δ" = 8–30 (primary, methyl, –CH), 15–55 (secondary, methylene, –CH–), 20–60 (tertiary, methyne, C–H) and quaternary. The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of <a href="nuclear%20Overhauser%20effect">nuclear Overhauser effect</a> and the long <a href="relaxation%20time">relaxation time</a>, and can be missed in weak samples, or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time.

Alkanes have a high <a href="ionization%20energy">ionization energy</a>, and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting <a href="free%20radical">free radical</a>s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group ("M" − 15) is often absent, and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH groups.

Alkanes are only weakly reactive with ionic and other polar substances. The <a href="acid%20dissociation%20constant">acid dissociation constant</a> (pK) values of all alkanes are above 60, hence they are practically inert to acids and bases (see: <a href="carbon%20acid">carbon acid</a>s). This inertness is the source of the term "paraffins" (with the meaning here of "lacking affinity"). In <a href="crude%20oil">crude oil</a> the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

However redox reactions of alkanes, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon (−4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen ("if" present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction <a href="stoichiometry">stoichiometry</a>) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and water. <a href="Free%20radical%20halogenation">Free radical halogenation</a> reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of <a href="haloalkanes">haloalkanes</a>. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in <a href="carbon-hydrogen%20bond%20activation">C–H bond activation</a>.

<a href="Free%20radical">Free radical</a>s, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.

In highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5°) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as <a href="steric%20hindrance">steric hindrance</a>, and can substantially increase the reactivity.

All alkanes react with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> in a <a href="combustion">combustion</a> reaction, although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:

In the absence of sufficient oxygen, <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> or even <a href="soot">soot</a> can be formed, as shown below:

For example, <a href="methane">methane</a>:

See the <a href="Standard%20enthalpy%20change%20of%20formation%20%28data%20table%29%23Alkanes">alkane heat of formation table</a> for detailed data.
The <a href="standard%20enthalpy%20change%20of%20combustion">standard enthalpy change of combustion</a>, Δ"H", for alkanes increases by about 650 kJ/mol per CH group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of Δ"H" than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.

Alkanes react with <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s in a so-called "free radical halogenation" reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms. <a href="Free%20radical">Free radical</a>s are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly <a href="exothermic%20reaction">exothermic</a>, and can lead to an explosion.

These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons. There are three steps:

Experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction. The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals. An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane:

Cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a <a href="homolysis%20%28chemistry%29">homolytic</a> mechanism with formation of <a href="free-radical">free-radical</a>s. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of <a href="acid">acid</a> <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>s (usually solid acids such as <a href="silica-alumina">silica-alumina</a> and <a href="zeolite">zeolite</a>s), which promote a <a href="heterolytic%20cleavage">heterolytic</a> (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a <a href="carbocation">carbocation</a> and the very unstable <a href="hydride">hydride</a> <a href="anion">anion</a>. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C–C scission in position <a href="beta%20scission">beta</a> (i.e., cracking) and <a href="intramolecular">intra-</a> and <a href="intermolecular">intermolecular</a> hydrogen transfer or <a href="hydride">hydride</a> transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding <a href="reactive%20intermediate">reactive intermediate</a>s (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.

Dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes. Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a <a href="platinum">platinum</a> catalyst. In isomerization, the alkanes become branched-chain isomers. In other words, it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens, keeping the same molecular weight. In reformation, the alkanes become <a href="cycloalkane">cycloalkane</a>s or <a href="aromatic%20hydrocarbon">aromatic hydrocarbon</a>s, giving off hydrogen as a by-product. Both of these processes raise the <a href="octane%20number">octane number</a> of the substance. Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization, as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers.

Alkanes will react with <a href="steam">steam</a> in the presence of a <a href="nickel">nickel</a> <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a> to give <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. Alkanes can be <a href="Chlorosulfonation">chlorosulfonated</a> and <a href="nitration">nitrated</a>, although both reactions require special conditions. The <a href="fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a> of alkanes to <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s is of some technical importance. In the <a href="Reed%20reaction">Reed reaction</a>, <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>, <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> and <a href="photochemistry">light</a> convert hydrocarbons to <a href="Sulfonic%20acid">sulfonyl chlorides</a>. <a href="Nucleophilic%20abstraction">Nucleophilic Abstraction</a> can be used to separate an alkane from a metal. Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by <a href="transmetalation">transmetalation</a> reactions.

Alkanes form a small portion of the <a href="Celestial%20body%20atmosphere">atmospheres</a> of the outer gas planets such as <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> (0.1% methane, 2 <a href="parts%20per%20million">ppm</a> ethane), <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> (0.2% methane, 5 ppm ethane), <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> (1.99% methane, 2.5 ppm ethane) and <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> (1.5% methane, 1.5 ppm ethane). <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a> (1.6% methane), a satellite of Saturn, was examined by the <a href="Huygens%20%28spacecraft%29">"Huygens" probe</a>, which indicated that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon's surface. Also on Titan the Cassini mission has imaged seasonal methane/ethane lakes near the polar regions of Titan. <a href="Methane">Methane</a> and <a href="ethane">ethane</a> have also been detected in the tail of the comet <a href="Hyakutake">Hyakutake</a>. Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal, which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space, away from the Sun, which would have evaporated these volatile molecules. Alkanes have also been detected in <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s such as <a href="carbonaceous%20chondrite">carbonaceous chondrite</a>s.

Traces of methane gas (about 0.0002% or 1745 ppb) occur in the Earth's atmosphere, produced primarily by <a href="methanogenesis">methanogenic</a> microorganisms, such as <a href="Archaea">Archaea</a> in the gut of ruminants.

The most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and <a href="Petroleum">oil</a>. Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some <a href="propane">propane</a> and <a href="butane">butane</a>: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other <a href="hydrocarbons">hydrocarbons</a>. These hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an <a href="wikt%3Aanoxic">anoxic</a> environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:

These hydrocarbon deposits, collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks, comprise commercial <a href="oil%20fields">oil fields</a>. They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced. The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the <a href="energy%20crisis">energy crisis</a>.

Methane is also present in what is called <a href="biogas">biogas</a>, produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible <a href="renewable%20energy%20source">renewable energy source</a>.

Alkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid <a href="methane%20clathrate">methane clathrate</a> (methane hydrate). Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together. Methane extracted from methane clathrate is, therefore, a candidate for future fuels.

Acyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways.


Certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.

On the other hand, certain <a href="archaea">archaea</a>, the <a href="methanogen">methanogen</a>s, produce large quantities of <a href="methane">methane</a> by the metabolism of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> or other <a href="oxidation">oxidized</a> organic compounds. The energy is released by the oxidation of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>:

Methanogens are also the producers of <a href="marsh%20gas">marsh gas</a> in <a href="wetlands">wetlands</a>, and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year—the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them. The methane output of <a href="cattle">cattle</a> and other <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s, which can release up to 150 liters per day, and of <a href="termite">termite</a>s, is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the <a href="intestine">intestine</a>s of humans. Methanogenic archaea are, hence, at the end of the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a>, with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. It is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way.

Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three <a href="eukaryote">eukaryotic</a> groups of organisms: <a href="Fungus">fungi</a>, plants and animals. Some specialized yeasts, e.g., "Candida tropicale", "<a href="Pichia">Pichia</a>" sp., "<a href="Rhodotorula">Rhodotorula</a>" sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon or energy. The fungus "<a href="Amorphotheca%20resinae">Amorphotheca resinae</a>" prefers the longer-chain alkanes in <a href="aviation%20fuel">aviation fuel</a>, and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.

In plants, the solid long-chain alkanes are found in the <a href="plant%20cuticle">plant cuticle</a> and <a href="epicuticular%20wax">epicuticular wax</a> of many species, but are only rarely major constituents. They protect the plant against water loss, prevent the <a href="Leaching%20%28agriculture%29">leaching</a> of important minerals by the rain, and protect against bacteria, fungi, and harmful insects. The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered, between 27 and 33 carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by <a href="decarboxylation">decarboxylation</a> of even-numbered <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.

More volatile short-chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues. The <a href="Jeffrey%20pine">Jeffrey pine</a> is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of "n"-<a href="heptane">heptane</a> in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one <a href="octane%20rating">octane rating</a>. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and "n"-<a href="nonane">nonane</a> is a significant component in the scent of some <a href="rose">rose</a>s. Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as <a href="ethane">ethane</a>, <a href="pentane">pentane</a>, and <a href="hexane">hexane</a> by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution.

Edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers, mainly 8 to 35, usually peaking in the low to upper 20s, with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram (parts per million by weight) and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction.

Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. One example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% <a href="pristane">pristane</a> (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, CH). They are important as <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s, chemical messenger materials, on which insects depend for communication. In some species, e.g. the support beetle "<a href="Xylotrechus%20colonus">Xylotrechus colonus</a>", <a href="pentacosane">pentacosane</a> (CH), 3-methylpentaicosane (CH) and 9-methylpentaicosane (CH) are transferred by body contact. With others like the <a href="tsetse%20fly">tsetse fly</a> "Glossina morsitans morsitans", the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (CH), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (CH), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (CH) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (CH), and acts by smell over longer distances. <a href="waggle%20dance">Waggle-dancing</a> <a href="honey%20bee">honey bee</a>s produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane.

One example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the <a href="sand%20bee">sand bee</a> ("<a href="Andrena%20nigroaenea">Andrena nigroaenea</a>") and the <a href="early%20spider%20orchid">early spider orchid</a> ("<a href="Ophrys%20sphegodes">Ophrys sphegodes</a>"); the latter is dependent for <a href="pollination">pollination</a> on the former. Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of "A. nigroaenea", the females emit a mixture of <a href="tricosane">tricosane</a> (CH), <a href="pentacosane">pentacosane</a> (CH) and <a href="heptacosane">heptacosane</a> (CH) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result, numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,
which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.

As stated earlier, the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and <a href="crude%20oil">crude oil</a>. Alkanes are separated in an <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a> by <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> and processed into many different products.

The <a href="Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch%20process">Fischer–Tropsch process</a> is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons, including alkanes, from <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and hydrogen. This method is used to produce substitutes for <a href="petroleum%20distillate">petroleum distillate</a>s.

There is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory, since they are usually commercially available. Also, alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo <a href="functional%20group%20interconversion">functional group interconversion</a>s cleanly. When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction. For example, the use of <a href="N-Butyllithium">"n"-butyllithium</a> as a strong <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a> gives the conjugate acid, "n"-butane as a side-product:

However, at times it may be desirable to make a section of a molecule into an alkane-like functionality (<a href="alkyl">alkyl</a> group) using the above or similar methods. For example, an <a href="ethyl%20group">ethyl group</a> is an alkyl group; when this is attached to a <a href="Hydroxyl">hydroxy</a> group, it gives <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>, which is not an alkane. To do so, the best-known methods are <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a> of <a href="alkene">alkene</a>s:

Alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from <a href="alkyl%20halide">alkyl halide</a>s in the <a href="Corey%E2%80%93House%20synthesis">Corey–House–Posner–Whitesides reaction</a>. The <a href="Barton%E2%80%93McCombie%20deoxygenation">Barton–McCombie deoxygenation</a> removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols e.g.

and the <a href="Clemmensen%20reduction">Clemmensen reduction</a> removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or alkyl-substituted compounds e.g.:

The applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. <a href="Methane">Methane</a> and <a href="ethane">ethane</a> are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.

<a href="Propane">Propane</a> and <a href="butane">butane</a> are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as <a href="liquified%20petroleum%20gas">liquified petroleum gas</a> (LPG). Propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles, butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in <a href="aerosol%20spray">aerosol spray</a>s.

From <a href="pentane">pentane</a> to <a href="octane">octane</a> the alkanes are highly volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in <a href="internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion engine</a>s, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes <a href="Engine%20knocking">knocking</a>, than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the <a href="octane%20rating">octane rating</a> of the fuel, where <a href="2%2C2%2C4-Trimethylpentane">2,2,4-trimethylpentane</a> ("isooctane") has an arbitrary value of 100, and <a href="heptane">heptane</a> has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s for nonpolar substances.

Alkanes from <a href="nonane">nonane</a> to, for instance, <a href="hexadecane">hexadecane</a> (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a>, less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of <a href="Diesel%20fuel">diesel</a> and <a href="aviation%20fuel">aviation fuel</a>. Diesel fuels are characterized by their <a href="cetane%20number">cetane number</a>, cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.

Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and <a href="lubricating%20oil">lubricating oil</a>. In the latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as <a href="paraffin%20wax">paraffin wax</a>, for example, in <a href="candle">candle</a>s. This should not be confused however with true <a href="wax">wax</a>, which consists primarily of <a href="ester">ester</a>s.

Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in <a href="bitumen">bitumen</a>, used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by <a href="Cracking%20%28chemistry%29">cracking</a>.

Some synthetic <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s such as <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> and <a href="polypropylene">polypropylene</a> are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms. These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year.

Alkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds. This inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment. Due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility, alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms.

There are, however, some microorganisms possessing the metabolic capacity to utilize n-alkanes as both carbon and energy sources. Some bacterial species are highly specialised in degrading alkanes; these are referred to as hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria.

Methane is flammable, explosive and dangerous to inhale, because it is a colorless, odorless gas, special caution must be taken around methane. Ethane is also extremely flammable, dangerous to inhale and explosive. Both of these may cause suffocation. Similarly, propane is flammable and explosive. It may cause drowsiness or unconsciousness if inhaled. Butane has the same hazards to consider as propane.

Alkanes also pose a threat to the environment. Branched alkanes have a lower biodegradability than unbranched alkanes. However, methane is ranked as the most dangerous greenhouse gas. Although the amount of methane in the atmosphere is low, it does pose a threat to the environment.

Appellate procedure in the United States

United States appellate procedure involves the rules and regulations for filing <a href="appeal">appeal</a>s in <a href="state%20court%20%28United%20States%29">state courts</a> and <a href="United%20States%20federal%20courts">federal courts</a>. The nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a> where the case was prosecuted. There are many types of <a href="standard%20of%20review">standard of review</a> for appeals, such as "<a href="Trial%20de%20novo">de novo</a>" and <a href="abuse%20of%20discretion">abuse of discretion</a>. However, most appeals begin when a party files a <a href="petition%20for%20review">petition for review</a> to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision.

An <a href="appellate%20court">appellate court</a> is a <a href="court">court</a> that hears cases on appeal from another court. Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a <a href="court%20case">court case</a> who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of law, <a href="fact">fact</a>, procedure or due process. In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.

The specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision, can vary greatly from state to state. The right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state; for example, the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Constitution">New Jersey Constitution</a> vests judicial power in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, and other courts of limited jurisdiction, with an appellate court being part of the Superior Court.

A party who files an appeal is called an "appellant", "plaintiff in error", "petitioner" or "pursuer", and a party on the other side is called a "appellee". A "cross-appeal" is an appeal brought by the respondent. For example, suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay $50,000. If the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money, then the plaintiff might file a cross-appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay $200,000 instead of $50,000.

The appellant is the party who, having lost part or all their <a href="lawsuit">claim</a> in a <a href="lower%20court">lower court</a> decision, is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered. This is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law, but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct, or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence.

The appellant in the new case can be either the <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a> (or claimant), <a href="defendant">defendant</a>, third-party <a href="intervenor">intervenor</a>, or respondent (appellee) from the lower case, depending on who was the losing party. The winning party from the lower court, however, is now the respondent. In unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below, but still appeal.

An appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court <a href="judgment%20%28law%29">judgment</a> was in its favor. The appellee is required to respond to the <a href="petition">petition</a>, <a href="oral%20argument">oral argument</a>s, and <a href="legal%20brief">legal brief</a>s of the appellant. In general, the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court's decision should be affirmed.

An appeal "as of right" is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle. The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal. An appeal "by leave" or "permission" requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant's demand to appeal the lower court's decision. In the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">Supreme Court</a>, review in most cases is available only if the Court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari.

In <a href="tort">tort</a>, <a href="equity%20%28law%29">equity</a>, or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal. In criminal matters, however, the state or prosecution generally has no appeal "as of right". And due to the <a href="double%20jeopardy">double jeopardy</a> principle, the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal. But in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal "as of right" from a trial court's dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion. Likewise, in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law "by leave" from the trial court or the appellate court. The ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally. All parties must present grounds to appeal, or it will not be heard.

By convention in some law reports, the appellant is named first. This can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals, the name of the case in the law reports reverses (in some cases twice) as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy. This is not always true, however. In the <a href="United%20States%20federal%20courts">federal courts</a>, the parties' names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the <a href="United%20States%20Courts%20of%20Appeals">circuit courts of appeals</a>, and are re-ordered only if the appeal reaches the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">Supreme Court</a>.

Many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals, particularly in the criminal context. The first is the traditional "direct" appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review. The second is the collateral appeal or post-conviction petition, in which the petitioner-appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance—usually the court that tried the case.

The key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts, and the latter in federal courts.

Relief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in <a href="capital%20punishment">capital</a> or violent <a href="felony">felony</a> cases. The typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating <a href="DNA">DNA</a> evidence demonstrating the defendant's actual innocence.

"Appellate review" is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a> take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts. It is distinguished from <a href="Judicial%20review%20%28theory%29">judicial review</a>, which refers to the court's overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons (which may vary by jurisdiction).

In most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final <a href="Legal%20judgment">judgment</a>. Generally, an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case. This is because such orders cannot be appealed "as of right". However, certain critical interlocutory <a href="court%20order">court order</a>s, such as the denial of a request for an interim <a href="injunction">injunction</a>, or an order holding a person in <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a>, can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of.

There are two distinct forms of appellate review, "direct" and "collateral". For example, a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court, and lose on "direct appeal" to higher state appellate courts, and if unsuccessful, mount a "collateral" action such as filing for a writ of <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20federal%20courts">federal courts</a>. Generally speaking, "[d]irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact. ... [Collateral review], on the other hand, provide[s] an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence, and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional, jurisdictional, or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial." "Graham v. Borgen", 483 F 3d. 475 (7th Cir. 2007) (no. 04-4103) (slip op. at 7) (citation omitted).

In Anglo-American <a href="common%20law">common law</a> courts, appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by <a href="prerogative%20writ">prerogative writ</a> in certain cases. There is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental <a href="civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a> legal systems, though some mixed systems such as <a href="Civil%20Code%20of%20Quebec">Quebec</a> recognize these prerogative writs.

After exhausting the first appeal as of right, defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision. This appeal is known as a direct appeal. The highest state court, generally known as the Supreme Court, exercises discretion over whether it will review the case. On direct appeal, a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process.

An appellant's claim(s) must usually be preserved at trial. This means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial. Because constitutional claims are of great magnitude, appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved. For example, Connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims: 1.the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; 2. the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; 3. the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; 4. if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.

All States have a post-conviction relief process. Similar to federal post-conviction relief, an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review. Typical claims might include <a href="ineffective%20assistance%20of%20counsel">ineffective assistance of counsel</a> and actual innocence based on new evidence. These proceedings are normally separate from the direct appeal, however some states allow for collateral relief to be sought on direct appeal. After direct appeal, the conviction is considered final. An appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal. That is, it goes to the intermediate appellate court, followed by the highest court. If the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration, the sentence could be modified, or a new trial could be ordered.

A "notice of appeal" is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal. The form is completed by the appellant or by the appellant's legal representative. The nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country.

The specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun. For example, the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court, or with the court from which the appeal is taken, or both.

Some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the court's own web site. In New Jersey, for example, the Administrative Office of the Court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants, though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used.

The deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short: traditionally, it is measured in days, not months. This can vary from country to country, as well as within a country, depending on the specific rules in force. In the U.S. federal court system, criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed, or the right to appeal is forfeited.

Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of <a href="evidence%20%28law%29">evidence</a> presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not. The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).

If the appellate court finds no defect, it "affirms" the judgment. If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision "below" (i.e., in the lower court), it may "modify" the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify ("reverse" or "vacate") the whole decision or any part of it. It may, in addition, send the case back ("remand" or "remit") to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.

In some cases, an appellate court may review a lower court decision "de novo" (or completely), challenging even the lower court's findings of fact. This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial <a href="motion%20to%20dismiss">motion to dismiss</a> or motion for <a href="summary%20judgment">summary judgment</a> which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.

Another situation is where appeal is by way of "re-hearing". Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court.

Sometimes, the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below. (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court's rules, to file the appeal.)

Generally, there is no <a href="Jury%20trial">trial</a> in an appellate court, only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed—unless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in "very" rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as <a href="prosecutorial%20misconduct">prosecutorial misconduct</a>.

In some systems, an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.

The appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it. Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers, if represented, or "<a href="pro%20se">pro se</a>" if the party has not engaged legal representation. Those arguments are presented in written <a href="brief%20%28law%29">briefs</a> and sometimes in <a href="oral%20argument">oral argument</a> to the court at a <a href="hearing%20%28law%29">hearing</a>. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.

In an <a href="adversarial%20system">adversarial system</a>, appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore, if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner, or against <a href="Precedent">legal precedent</a>, that judgment will stand if not appealed – even if it might have been overturned on appeal.

The United States legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial "de novo" or an appeal on the record.

A <a href="trial%20de%20novo">trial de novo</a> is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial <a href="trial%20%28law%29">trial</a>. If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all. If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial "de novo" by a <a href="court%20of%20record">court of record</a>. In such a proceeding, all issues and <a href="evidence%20%28law%29">evidence</a> may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding. Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.

In some cases, an application for "trial de novo" effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place. The Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that '"This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to "annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial."' The only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses, where they are convicted on a lesser offense, the appeal is of the lesser offense; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses. "[A] trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles, . . . subject only to the limitation that conviction in [the] district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense,
permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser-included offense."

In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal. Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result. <a href="Precedent">Precedent</a> and <a href="case%20law">case law</a> figure prominently in the arguments. In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed <a href="reversible%20error">reversible error</a>, that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly. Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously <a href="improper%20argument">improper argument</a> by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc. The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not "preserve the issue for appeal" by objecting.

In cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an "abuse of discretion" standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court's view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness. On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.

In some cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was <a href="Constitutionality">unconstitutional</a> or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered. In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial. Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.

A lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words "May it please the court."

After an appeal is heard, the "mandate" is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal; this notice is transmitted to the trial court and, when filed by the <a href="Court%20clerk">clerk</a> of the trial court, constitutes the final judgment on the case, unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court. The mandate is distinguished from the appeal court's <a href="court%20opinion">opinion</a>, which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision. In some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the "remittitur".

The result of an appeal can be:

There can be multiple outcomes, so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings, reverse others and remand the case all at the same time. Remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case. "Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'".

Some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than "review improvidently granted". In other words, after looking at the case, they chose not to say anything. The result for the case of "review improvidently granted" is effectively the same as affirmed, but without that extra higher court stamp of approval.

Answer (law)

In law, an Answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or <a href="defense%20%28legal%29">defense</a>, a <a href="reply">reply</a> to a <a href="question">question</a> or response, or <a href="objection%20%28law%29">objection</a>, or a correct solution of a problem.

In the <a href="common%20law">common law</a>, an Answer is the first <a href="pleading">pleading</a> by a <a href="defendant">defendant</a>, usually filed and served upon the <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a> within a certain strict time limit after a civil <a href="complaint">complaint</a> or criminal <a href="information">information</a> or <a href="indictment">indictment</a> has been served upon the defendant. It may have been preceded by an "optional" "pre-answer" <a href="motion%20to%20dismiss">motion to dismiss</a> or <a href="demurrer">demurrer</a>; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant "must" file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse <a href="default%20judgment">default judgment</a>.

In a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court. The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either <a href="guilt%20%28law%29">guilt</a>y or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of <a href="equitable%20remedy">equitable remedy</a> such as <a href="restitution">restitution</a> or a permanent <a href="injunction">injunction</a>. Criminal cases may lead to <a href="Fine%20%28penalty%29">fine</a>s or other <a href="punishment">punishment</a>, such as <a href="imprisonment">imprisonment</a>.

The famous Latin "Responsa Prudentium" ("answers of the learned ones") were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman <a href="lawyer">lawyer</a>s, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.

During debates of a contentious nature, deflection, colloquially known as 'changing the topic', has been widely observed, and is often seen as a failure to answer a question.

<doc id="643" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=643" title="Appellate court">
Appellate court

An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (<a href="American%20English">American English</a>), appeal court (<a href="British%20English">British English</a>), court of second instance or second instance court, is any <a href="court%20of%20law">court of law</a> that is empowered to hear an <a href="appeal">appeal</a> of a <a href="trial%20court">trial court</a> or other lower <a href="tribunal">tribunal</a>. In most <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>s, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a <a href="supreme%20court">supreme court</a> (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules.

The authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another. In some areas the appellate court has limited powers of review. Generally, an appellate court's judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified.

The <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20New%20Zealand">Court of Appeal of New Zealand</a>, located in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>, is New Zealand's principal intermediate appellate court. In practice, most appeals are resolved at this intermediate appellate level, rather than in the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20New%20Zealand">Supreme Court</a>.

The <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20Sri%20Lanka">Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka</a> is located in <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, is the second most senior court in the <a href="Courts%20of%20Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lankan legal system</a>.

In the United States, both state and <a href="United%20States%20courts%20of%20appeals">federal</a> appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations, rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were. Furthermore, U.S. appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court. Hence, such an appellate court will not consider an appellant's argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal.

In most U.S. states, and in U.S. federal courts, parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right. This means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an <a href="appeal">appeal</a> to contest that outcome. However, appeals may be costly, and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict. Therefore, only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals. Some appellate courts, particularly supreme courts, have the power of <a href="discretionary%20review">discretionary review</a>, meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case.

Many U.S. jurisdictions title their appellate court a court of appeal or court of appeals. Historically, others have titled their appellate court a court of errors (or court of errors and appeals), on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts. Examples of such courts include the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Court%20of%20Errors%20and%20Appeals">New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals</a> (which existed from 1844 to 1947), the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors (which has been renamed the <a href="Connecticut%20Supreme%20Court">Connecticut Supreme Court</a>), the Kentucky Court of Errors (renamed the <a href="Kentucky%20Supreme%20Court">Kentucky Supreme Court</a>), and the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeals (since renamed the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Mississippi">Supreme Court of Mississippi</a>). In some jurisdictions, courts able to hear appeals are known as an appellate division.

The phrase "court of appeals" most often refers to intermediate appellate courts. However, the New York system is different: the "<a href="New%20York%20Court%20of%20Appeals">New York Court of Appeals</a>" is the highest appellate court; and the phrase "<a href="New%20York%20Supreme%20Court">New York Supreme Court</a>" applies to the trial court of general jurisdiction.

Depending on the system, certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts, hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts, such as the <a href="Texas%20Court%20of%20Criminal%20Appeals">Texas Court of Criminal Appeals</a>, which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases, and the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Federal%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a>, which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases, on one hand, and appeals from the <a href="Court%20of%20Federal%20Claims">Court of Federal Claims</a> on the other.

<doc id="649" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=649" title="Arraignment">
Arraignment

Arraignment is a formal reading of a <a href="crime">criminal</a> charging document in the presence of the <a href="defendant">defendant</a> to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her. In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a <a href="plea">plea</a>. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdiction but they generally include "guilty", "not guilty", and the <a href="peremptory%20pleas">peremptory pleas</a> (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. Pleas of "<a href="nolo%20contendere">nolo contendere</a>" (no contest) and the "<a href="Alford%20plea">"Alford" plea</a>" are allowed in some circumstances.

In Australia, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the <a href="court%20clerk">clerk</a> of the <a href="court">court</a> reading out the <a href="indictment">indictment</a>. The judge will testify during the indictment process.

In every province in Canada except British Columbia, defendants are arraigned on the day of their trial. In British Columbia, arraignment takes places in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer. The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge.

In France, the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest. However, police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances, especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year's imprisonment, or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time, and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime. The police needs to have the consent of the prosecutor (in the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor will consent).

In Germany, if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest.

At the first appearance, the accused is read the charges and asked for a plea. The available pleas are, guilty, not guilty, and no plea. No plea allows the defendant to get legal advice on the plea, which must be made on the second appearance.

In South Africa, arraignment is defined as the calling upon the accused to appear, the informing of the accused of the crime charged against him, the demanding of the accused whether he be guilty or not guilty, and the entering of his plea. His plea having been entered he is said to stand arraigned.

In England, Wales, and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the <a href="court%20clerk">clerk</a> of the <a href="court">court</a> reading out the <a href="indictment">indictment</a>.

In England and Wales, the police cannot legally detain anyone for more than 24 hours without charging them unless an officer with the rank of superintendent (or above) authorises detention for a further 12 hours (36 hours total), or a judge (who will be a magistrate) authorises detention by the police before charge for up to a maximum of 96 hours, but for terrorism-related offences people can be held by the police for up to 28 days before charge. If they are not released after being charged, they should be brought before a court as soon as practicable.

Under the United States <a href="Federal%20Rules%20of%20Criminal%20Procedure">Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a>, "arraignment shall [consist of an] open...reading [of] the <a href="indictment">indictment</a>...to the defendant...and call[] on him to plead thereto. He/she shall be given a copy of the indictment...before he/she is called upon to plead."

In federal courts, arraignment takes place in two stages. The first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest, 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until Monday. During this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. The presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set <a href="bail">bail</a>. During the second arraignment, a post-indictment arraignment or PIA, the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.

In New York, most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours.

In California, arraignments must be conducted without unnecessary delay and, in any event, within 48 hours of arrest, excluding weekends and holidays. Thus, an individual arrested without a warrant, in some cases, may be held for as long as 168 hours (7 days) without arraignment or charge.

The wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. However, it generally conforms with the following principles:

Video arraignment is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of <a href="videoconferencing">videoconferencing</a> technology. Use of video arraignment system allows the <a href="court">court</a>s to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the <a href="courtroom">courtroom</a> by using an <a href="audio-visual">audio-visual</a> link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom.

Use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants. The transportation of defendants requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention. It also addresses the rising costs of transportation.

If the defendant pleads guilty, an <a href="Preliminary%20hearing">evidentiary hearing</a> usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the <a href="mitigating%20factor">mitigating factor</a>s, and the defendant's character, and passes <a href="Sentence%20%28law%29">sentence</a>.

If the defendant pleads <a href="not%20guilty%20%28plea%29">not guilty</a>, a date is set for a <a href="preliminary%20hearing">preliminary hearing</a> or a <a href="trial">trial</a>.

In the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or "stood mute") was subject to <a href="peine%20forte%20et%20dure">peine forte et dure</a> (<a href="Law%20French">Law French</a> for "strong and hard punishment"). Today in <a href="Common%20law">common-law</a> jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea. The rationale for this is the defendant's <a href="right%20to%20silence">right to silence</a>.

This is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail may be made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.

America the Beautiful

"America the Beautiful" is an American <a href="patriotic%20song">patriotic song</a>. The lyrics were written by <a href="Katharine%20Lee%20Bates">Katharine Lee Bates</a>, and the music was composed by church organist and choirmaster <a href="Samuel%20A.%20Ward">Samuel A. Ward</a> at <a href="Grace%20Church%20%28Newark%29">Grace Episcopal Church</a> in Newark, New Jersey.

Bates originally wrote the words as a poem, "Pikes Peak", first published in the <a href="Fourth%20of%20July">Fourth of July</a> edition of the church periodical "The Congregationalist" in 1895. At that time, the poem was titled "America" for publication.

Ward had originally written the music, "Materna", for the hymn "<a href="O%20Mother%20dear%2C%20Jerusalem">O Mother dear, Jerusalem</a>" in 1882, though it was not first published until 1892. Ward's music combined with the Bates poem was first published in 1910 and titled "America the Beautiful".

The song is one of the most popular of the many American patriotic songs.

In 1893, at the age of 33, Bates, an English professor at <a href="Wellesley%20College">Wellesley College</a>, had taken a train trip to <a href="Colorado%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Colorado Springs</a>, Colorado, to teach a short summer school session at <a href="Colorado%20College">Colorado College</a>. Several of the sights on her trip inspired her, and they found their way into her poem, including the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, the "White City" with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings; the wheat fields of America's heartland <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, through which her train was riding on July 16; and the majestic view of the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> from high atop <a href="Pikes%20Peak">Pikes Peak</a>.

On the pinnacle of that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original <a href="Antlers%20Hilton%20Hotel">Antlers Hotel</a>. The poem was initially published two years later in "The Congregationalist" to commemorate <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">the Fourth of July.</a> It quickly caught the public's fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1911.

The first known melody written for the song was sent in by Silas Pratt when the poem was published in "The Congregationalist." By 1900, at least 75 different melodies had been written. A <a href="hymn%20tune">hymn tune</a> composed by <a href="Samuel%20A.%20Ward">Samuel A. Ward</a> was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward, too, was inspired to compose his tune. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a> back to his home in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, after a leisurely summer day in 1882, and he immediately wrote it down. Supposedly, he was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on. He composed the tune for the old hymn "O Mother Dear, Jerusalem", retitling the work "Materna". Ward's music combined with Bates's poem were first published together in 1910 and titled "America the Beautiful".

Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain since the music was only first applied to the song in 1904. Bates was more fortunate since the song's popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929.

At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song was written, particularly during the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> administration, there have been efforts to give "America the Beautiful" legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>", but so far this has not succeeded. Proponents prefer "America the Beautiful" for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>". Some prefer "America the Beautiful" over "The Star-Spangled Banner" due to the latter's war-oriented imagery. Others prefer "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the same reason. While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, "America the Beautiful" continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.

This song was used as the background music of the television broadcast of the <a href="Tiangong-1">Tiangong-1</a> launch.

The song is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of religious congregations in the United States.
In 1976, while the United States celebrated its bicentennial, a soulful version popularized by <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a> peaked at number 98 on the US R&B Charts, and is included on the soundtrack for the movie "<a href="The%20Sandlot">The Sandlot</a>".

Three different renditions of the song have entered the <a href="Hot%20Country%20Songs">Hot Country Songs</a> charts. The first was by <a href="Charlie%20Rich">Charlie Rich</a>, which went to number 22 in 1976. A second, by <a href="Mickey%20Newbury">Mickey Newbury</a>, peaked at number 82 in 1980. An <a href="all-star">all-star</a> version of "America the Beautiful" performed by <a href="country%20music">country</a> singers <a href="Trace%20Adkins">Trace Adkins</a>, <a href="Sherri%C3%A9%20Austin">Sherrié Austin</a>, <a href="Billy%20Dean">Billy Dean</a>, <a href="Vince%20Gill">Vince Gill</a>, <a href="Carolyn%20Dawn%20Johnson">Carolyn Dawn Johnson</a>, <a href="Toby%20Keith">Toby Keith</a>, <a href="Brenda%20Lee">Brenda Lee</a>, <a href="Lonestar">Lonestar</a>, <a href="Lyle%20Lovett">Lyle Lovett</a>, <a href="Lila%20McCann">Lila McCann</a>, <a href="Lorrie%20Morgan">Lorrie Morgan</a>, <a href="Jamie%20O%27Neal">Jamie O'Neal</a>, <a href="The%20Oak%20Ridge%20Boys">The Oak Ridge Boys</a>, <a href="Collin%20Raye">Collin Raye</a>, <a href="Kenny%20Rogers">Kenny Rogers</a>, <a href="Keith%20Urban">Keith Urban</a> and <a href="Phil%20Vassar">Phil Vassar</a> reached number 58 in July 2001. The song re-entered the chart following the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>.

A <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> adaptation of the song was recorded in 1976 by <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> band <a href="The%20Dictators">The Dictators</a>, and released on their album Every Day is Saturday.

Popularity of the song increased greatly following the September 11 attacks; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem. During the first taping of the "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>" following the attacks, CBS newsman <a href="Dan%20Rather">Dan Rather</a> cried briefly as he quoted the fourth verse.

For <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVIII">Super Bowl XLVIII</a>, <a href="The%20Coca-Cola%20Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a> aired a multilingual version of the song, sung in several different languages. The commercial received some criticism on social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, and from some conservatives, such as <a href="Glenn%20Beck">Glenn Beck</a>. Despite the controversies, Coca-Cola later reused the Super Bowl ad during <a href="Super%20Bowl%20LI">Super Bowl LI</a>, the opening ceremonies of the <a href="2014%20Winter%20Olympics">2014 Winter Olympics</a> and <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016 Summer Olympics</a> and in patriotic holidays.

"From sea to shining sea", originally used in the charters of some of the English Colonies in North America, is an American <a href="idiom">idiom</a> meaning "from the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>" (or vice versa). Other songs that have used this phrase include the American patriotic song "<a href="God%20Bless%20the%20USA">God Bless the USA</a>" and <a href="Schoolhouse%20Rock">Schoolhouse Rock</a>'s "Elbow Room". The phrase and the song are also the namesake of the <a href="Shining%20Sea%20Bikeway">Shining Sea Bikeway</a>, a <a href="bike%20path">bike path</a> in Bates's hometown of <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Falmouth, Massachusetts</a>. The phrase is similar to the Latin phrase """" ("From sea to sea"), which serves as the official motto of <a href="Canada">Canada</a>.

"Purple mountain majesties" refers to the shade of the <a href="Pikes%20Peak">Pikes Peak</a> in <a href="Colorado%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Colorado Springs, Colorado</a>, which inspired Bates to write the poem.

<a href="Lynn%20Sherr">Lynn Sherr</a>'s 2001 book "America the Beautiful" discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth. The book points out that the poem has the same meter as that of "<a href="Auld%20Lang%20Syne">Auld Lang Syne</a>"; the songs can be sung interchangeably. Additionally, Sherr discusses the evolution of the lyrics, for instance, changes to the original third verse written by Bates. The song appears in <a href="Ellen%20Raskin">Ellen Raskin</a>'s "<a href="The%20Westing%20Game">The Westing Game</a>".

Assistive technology

Assistive technology is an <a href="umbrella%20term">umbrella term</a> that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for <a href="disability">people with disabilities</a> and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them. Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the <a href="technology">technology</a> needed to accomplish such tasks.

The term adaptive technology is often used as the <a href="synonym">synonym</a> for assistive technology; however, they are different terms. Assistive technology refers to "any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities", while adaptive technology covers items that are specifically designed for persons with disabilities and would seldom be used by non-disabled persons. In other words, "assistive technology is any object or system that increases or maintains the capabilities of people with disabilities," while adaptive technology is "any object or system that is specifically designed for the purpose of increasing or maintaining the capabilities of people with disabilities." Consequently, adaptive technology is a subset of assistive technology. Adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access.

Wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related <a href="activities%20of%20daily%20living">activities of daily living</a> which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and bathing. The devices comes in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a <a href="joystick">joystick</a>, <a href="sip-and-puff">sip-and-puff</a> control, or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom <a href="walking">walking</a> is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.

Patient transfer devices generally allow patients with impaired mobility to be moved by caregivers between beds, wheelchairs, commodes, toilets, chairs, stretchers, shower benches, automobiles, swimming pools, and other patient support systems (i.e., radiology, surgical, or examining tables). The most common devices are <a href="Patient%20lift">Patient lift</a>s (for vertical transfer), <a href="Transfer%20bench">Transfer bench</a>es, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, supine transfer), sit-to-stand lifts (for moving patients from one seated position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), air bearing inflatable mattresses (for supine transfer i.e., transfer from a gurney to an operating room table), and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a <a href="Patient%20lift">Patient lift</a> (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state-of-the-art transfer device by OSHA and the American Nursing Association.

A <a href="walker%20%28mobility%29">walker</a> or walking frame or Rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking. It consists of a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes, such as for children, or for heavy people. Modern walkers are height-adjustable. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.

A prosthesis, prosthetic, or prosthetic limb is a device that replaces a missing <a href="Human%20body">body</a> part. It is part of the field of <a href="biomechatronics">biomechatronics</a>, the science of using <a href="Mechanical%20system">mechanical</a> devices with human <a href="muscle">muscle</a>, <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>, and <a href="nervous%20systems">nervous systems</a> to assist or enhance motor control lost by <a href="Trauma%20%28medicine%29">trauma</a>, <a href="disease">disease</a>, or <a href="Congenital%20disorder">defect</a>. Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth (<a href="congenital">congenital</a>) or to supplement defective body parts. Inside the body, <a href="artificial%20heart%20valve">artificial heart valve</a>s are in common use with <a href="artificial%20heart">artificial heart</a>s and <a href="artificial%20lung">lungs</a> seeing less common use but under active technology development. Other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include <a href="hearing%20aids">hearing aids</a>, <a href="visual%20prosthesis">artificial eyes</a>, <a href="palatal%20obturator">palatal obturator</a>, <a href="Adjustable%20gastric%20band">gastric bands</a>, and <a href="dentures">dentures</a>.

Prostheses are specifically "not" <a href="orthoses">orthoses</a>, although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis. Prostheses are technically the complete finished item. For instance, a C-Leg knee alone is "not" a prosthesis, but only a prosthetic "component". The complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system  to the residual limb — usually a "socket", and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device. Keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged.

The terms "prosthetic" and "orthotic" are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee. The terms "prosthetics" and "orthotics" are used to describe the respective allied health fields. The devices themselves are properly referred to as "prostheses" and "orthoses" in the plural and "prosthesis" and "orthosis" in the singular.

Many people with serious visual impairments live independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques. Examples of assistive technology for visually impairment include screen readers, screen magnifiers, Braille embossers, desktop video magnifiers, and voice recorders.

Screen readers allow the visually impaired to easily access electronic information. These software programs connect to a computer to read the text displayed out loud. There are a variety of platforms and applications available for a variety of costs.

Braille is a system of raised dots formed into units called braille cells. A full braille cell is made up of six dots, with two parallel rows of three dots, but other combinations and quantities of dots represent other letters, numbers, punctuation marks, or words. People can then use their fingers to read the code of raised dots.

A braille embosser is, simply put, a printer for braille. Instead of a standard printer adding ink onto a page, the braille embosser imprints the raised dots of braille onto a page. Some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch.

Desktop video magnifiers are electronic devices that use a camera and a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials. They enlarge printed pages for those with low vision. A camera connects to a monitor that displays real time images, and the user can control settings such as magnification, focus, contrast, underlining, highlighting, and other screen preferences. They come in a variety of sizes and styles; some are small and portable with handheld cameras, while others are much larger and mounted on a fixed stand.

A screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computer's graphical output to present enlarged screen content. It allows users to enlarge the texts and graphics on their computer screens for easier viewing. Similar to desktop video magnifiers, this technology assists people with low vision. After the user loads the software into their computer's memory, it serves as a kind of "computer magnifying glass." Wherever the computer cursor moves, it enlarges the area around it. This allows greater computer accessibility for a wide range of visual abilities.

A large-print keyboard has large letters printed on the keys. On the keyboard shown, the round buttons at the top control software which can magnify the screen (zoom in), change the background color of the screen, or make the mouse cursor on the screen larger. The "bump dots" on the keys, installed in this case by the organization using the keyboards, help the user find the right keys in a tactile way.

<a href="GPS_for_the_visually_impaired">Assistive technology for navigation</a> has exploded on the <a href="http%3A//ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp">IEEE Xplore database</a> since 2000, with over 7,500 engineering articles written on assistive technologies and visual impairment in the past 25 years, and over 1,300 articles on solving the problem of navigation for people who are blind or visually impaired. As well, over 600 articles on augmented reality and visual impairment have appeared in the engineering literature since 2000. Most of these articles were published within the past 5 years, and the number of articles in this area is increasing every year. GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and cameras can pinpoint the exact location of the user and provide information on what’s in the immediate vicinity, and assistance in getting to a destination.

Some navigation assistants (for both indoors and outdoors) include:

Wearable technology are smart electronic devices that can be worn on the body as an implant or an accessory. New technologies are exploring how the visually impaired can receive visual information through wearable devices. 

Some wearable devices for visual impairment include:

<a href="Personal%20emergency%20response%20systems">Personal emergency response systems</a> (PERS), or <a href="Telecare">Telecare</a> (UK term), are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer. An example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a> risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild <a href="dementia">dementia</a>). Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks. When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.

In human–computer interaction, computer accessibility (also known as accessible computing) refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include <a href="web%20accessibility">web accessibility</a> guidelines. Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface. This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by <a href="SNAPI">SNAPI</a> and has been successfully incorporated into the <a href="Lasseo">Lasseo</a> specifications, but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.

The deaf or hard of hearing community has a difficult time to communicate and perceive information as compared to hearing individuals. Thus, these individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information. The use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to their problems by providing higher sound (for those who are hard of hearing), tactile feedback, visual cues and improved technology access. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing utilize a variety of assistive technologies that provide them with improved accessibility to information in numerous environments. Most devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision and/or vibration. These technologies can be grouped into three general categories: <a href="Assistive%20Technology%20for%20Deaf%20and%20Hard%20of%20Hearing%23Hearing%20Technology">Hearing Technology</a>, alerting devices, and <a href="Assistive%20Technology%20for%20Deaf%20and%20Hard%20of%20Hearing%23Communication%20Support">communication support</a>.

A hearing aid or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is designed to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry. This type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their communities by allowing them to hear more clearly. They amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including digital, in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.

Assistive listening devices include FM, infrared, and loop assistive listening devices. This type of technology allows people with hearing difficulties to focus on a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions, making places like auditoriums, classrooms, and meetings much easier to participate in. The assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an FM (Frequency Modulation) transmission, IR (Infra Red) transmission, IL (Induction Loop) transmission, or other transmission method. The person who is listening may use an FM/IR/IL Receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his/her preferred volume.

This type of assistive technology allows users to amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls so that they can easily partake in this medium of communication. There are also options to adjust the frequency and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs. Additionally, there is a wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from, with different degrees of amplification. For example, a phone with 26 to 40 decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss, while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel is better for more severe hearing loss.

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user. They may be as basic as pictures on a board that are used to request food, drink, or other care; or they can be advanced <a href="speech%20generating%20device">speech generating device</a>s, based on speech synthesis, that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words.

Assistive Technology for Cognition (ATC) is the use of technology (usually high tech) to augment and assist cognitive processes such as attention, memory, self-regulation, navigation, <a href="emotion%20recognition">emotion recognition</a> and management, planning, and sequencing activity. Systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of ATC are growing rapidly, but have focused on memory and planning, that there is emerging evidence for efficacy, that a lot of scope exists to develop new ATC. Examples of ATC include: <a href="NeuroPage">NeuroPage</a> which prompts users about meetings, <a href="Wakamaru">Wakamaru</a>, which provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help if something is wrong, and telephone Reassurance systems.

Memory aids are any type of assistive technology that helps a user learn and remember certain information. Many memory aids are used for cognitive impairments such as reading, writing, or organizational difficulties. For example, a Smartpen records handwritten notes by creating both a digital copy and an audio recording of the text. Users simply tap certain parts of their notes and the pen saves it and reads it back to them. From there, the user can also download their notes onto a computer for increased accessibility. Digital voice recorders are also used to record "in the moment" information for fast and easy recall at a later time.

Educational software is software that assists people with reading, learning, comprehension, and organizational difficulties. Any accommodation software such as text readers, notetakers, text enlargers, organization tools, word predictions, and talking word processors falls under the category of educational software.

Assistive technology in sport is an area of technology design that is growing. Assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive technology may be used in <a href="adaptive%20sports">adaptive sports</a>, where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.

An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new assistive technology. Assistive technology devices can be simple, or "low-tech", or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers. Assistive technology for sports may also be simple, or advanced. Accordingly, assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to the elite <a href="Paralympic%20Games">Paralympic Games</a>. More complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities "have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity".

In the United States there are two major pieces of legislation that govern the use of assistive technology within the school system. The first is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the second being the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which was first enacted in 1975 under the name The Education for All Handicapped Children Act. In 2004, during the reauthorization period for IDEA, the National Instructional Material Access Center (NIMAC) was created which provided a repository of accessible text including publisher's textbooks to students with a qualifying disability. Files provided are in XML format and used as a starting platform for braille readers, screen readers, and other digital text software. IDEA defines assistive technology as follows: "any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of a child with a disability. (B) Exception.--The term does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted, or the replacement of such device." 

Assistive technology in this area is broken down into low, mid, and high tech categories. Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading. Mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.

One of the largest problems that affect people with disabilities is discomfort with prostheses. An experiment performed in Massachusetts utilized 20 people with various sensors attached to their arms. The subjects tried different arm exercises, and the sensors recorded their movements. All of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts for prosthetics.

Assistive technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as <a href="Dvorak%20Simplified%20Keyboard">Dvorak</a> and other alternative keyboard layouts, which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys.
Assistive technology devices have been created to enable people with disabilities to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as the <a href="iPad">iPad</a>, <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> and <a href="iPod%20touch">iPod touch</a>. The Pererro is a plug and play adapter for <a href="iOS">iOS</a> devices which uses the built in <a href="Apple%20VoiceOver">Apple VoiceOver</a> feature in combination with a basic switch. This brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it. Apple, with the release of iOS 7 had introduced the ability to navigate apps using switch control. Switch access could be activated either through an external bluetooth connected switch, single touch of the screen, or use of right and left head turns using the device's camera. Additional accessibility features include the use of Assistive Touch which allows a user to access multi-touch gestures through pre-programmed onscreen buttons.

For users with physical disabilities a large variety of switches are available and customizable to the user's needs varying in size, shape, or amount of pressure required for activation. <a href="Switch%20access">Switch access</a> may be placed near any area of the body which has consistent and reliable mobility and less subject to fatigue. Common sites include the hands, head, and feet. Eye gaze and head mouse systems can also be used as an alternative mouse navigation. A user may utilize single or multiple switch sites and the process often involves a scanning through items on a screen and activating the switch once the desired object is highlighted.

The form of <a href="home%20automation">home automation</a> called <a href="assistive%20domotics">assistive domotics</a> focuses on making it possible for elderly and disabled people to live independently. Home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users. For example, automated prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre-recorded audio messages; an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven, and one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the door.

Overall, assistive technology aims to allow people with disabilities to "participate more fully in all aspects of life (home, school, and community)" and increases their opportunities for "education, social interactions, and potential for meaningful employment." It creates greater independence and control for disabled individuals. For example, in one study of 1,342 infants, toddlers and preschoolers, all with some kind of developmental, physical, sensory, or cognitive disability, the use of assistive technology created improvements in child development. These included improvements in "cognitive, social, communication, literacy, motor, adaptive, and increases in engagement in learning activities." It has been found to lighten caregiver load.

Abacus

The abacus ("plural" abaci or abacuses), also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool that was in use in Europe, China and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written <a href="Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic%20numeral%20system">Hindu–Arabic numeral system</a>. The exact origin of the abacus is still unknown. Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.

Abaci come in different designs. Some designs, like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens, are used mainly to teach arithmetic, although they remain popular in the <a href="post-Soviet%20states">post-Soviet states</a> as a tool. Other designs, such as the Japanese <a href="soroban">soroban</a>, have been used for practical calculations even involving several digits. For any particular abacus design, there usually are numerous different methods to perform a certain type of calculation, which may include basic operations like addition and multiplication, or even more complex ones, such as calculating <a href="Square%20root">square roots</a>. Some of these methods may work with non-<a href="Natural%20number">natural</a> numbers (numbers such as and ).

Although today many use <a href="Calculator">calculators</a> and <a href="Computer">computers</a> instead of abaci to calculate, abaci still remain in common use in some countries. Merchants, traders and clerks in some parts of <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="China">China</a> and <a href="Africa">Africa</a> use abaci, and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children. Some people who are unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus.

The use of the word "abacus" dates before 1387 AD, when a <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> work borrowed the word from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> to describe a sandboard abacus. The Latin word came from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἄβαξ "abax" which means something without base, and improperly, any piece of rectangular board or plank. 
Alternatively, without reference to ancient texts on etymology, it has been suggested that it means "a square tablet strewn with dust", or "drawing-board covered with dust (for the use of mathematics)" (the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the <a href="Genitive%20case">genitive form</a> of the Greek word, ἄβακoς "abakos"). Whereas the table strewn with dust definition is popular, there are those that do not place credence in this at all and in fact state that it is not proven. Greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a <a href="Northwest%20Semitic">Northwest Semitic</a>, perhaps <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician</a>, word akin to <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> "ʾābāq" (אבק), "dust" (or in post-Biblical sense meaning "sand used as a writing surface").

The preferred plural of "abacus" is a subject of disagreement, with both "abacuses" and "abaci" in use. The user of an abacus is called an "abacist".

The period 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ian abacus, a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their <a href="sexagesimal">sexagesimal</a> number system.

Some scholars point to a character from the <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>ian <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a> which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus. It is the belief of Old Babylonian scholars such as Carruccio that Old Babylonians "may have used the abacus for the operations of <a href="addition">addition</a> and <a href="subtraction">subtraction</a>; however, this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations".

The use of the abacus in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> is mentioned by the Greek historian <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, who writes that the Egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left, opposite in direction to the Greek left-to-right method. Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters. However, wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered.

During the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, around 600 BC the Persians first began to use the abacus. Under the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian</a>, <a href="Sassanian">Sassanian</a> and <a href="Iran">Iran</a>ian empires, scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them – <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, and the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, when it is thought to have been exported to other countries.

The earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the Greek abacus dates to the 5th century BC. Also <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> (384 BC–322 BC) talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head. A play by <a href="Alexis%20%28poet%29">Alexis</a> from the 4th century BC mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting, and both <a href="Diogenes%20of%20Sinope">Diogenes</a> and <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less, like the pebbles on an abacus. The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.

A tablet found on the Greek island <a href="Salamis%20Island">Salamis</a> in 1846 AD (the <a href="Salamis%20Tablet">Salamis Tablet</a>), dates back to 300 BC, making it the oldest counting board discovered so far. It is a slab of white marble long, wide, and thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them, but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line. Also from this time frame the "Darius Vase" was unearthed in 1851. It was covered with pictures including a "treasurer" holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other.

The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC.

The Chinese abacus, known as the "<a href="suanpan">suanpan</a>" (算盤, lit. "counting tray"), is typically tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator. It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. If you move them toward the beam, you count their value. If you move away, you don't count their value. The "suanpan" can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.

"Suanpan" can be used for functions other than counting. Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a>, <a href="division%20%28mathematics%29">division</a>, <a href="addition">addition</a>, <a href="subtraction">subtraction</a>, <a href="square%20root">square root</a> and <a href="cube%20root">cube root</a> operations at high speed. There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.

In the long scroll "<a href="Along%20the%20River%20During%20the%20Qingming%20Festival">Along the River During the Qingming Festival</a>" painted by <a href="Zhang%20Zeduan">Zhang Zeduan</a> during the <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> (960–1297), a "suanpan" is clearly visible beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a>'s (Feibao).

The similarity of the <a href="Roman%20abacus">Roman abacus</a> to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and <a href="%23Japanese%20abacus">Japanese</a>) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard "suanpan" has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> numeral system, which was used for traditional Chinese measures of weight.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.

Another possible source of the "suanpan" is Chinese <a href="counting%20rods">counting rods</a>, which operated with a <a href="decimal">decimal system</a> but lacked the concept of <a href="0%20%28number%29">zero</a> as a place holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907) when travel in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> and the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> would have provided direct contact with <a href="India">India</a>, allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the <a href="decimal%20point">decimal point</a> from Indian merchants and mathematicians.

The normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles ("calculi") were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, <a href="jeton">jeton</a>s were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the <a href="Roman%20numeral">Roman numeral</a> system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century. Due to <a href="Pope%20Sylvester%20II">Pope Sylvester II</a>'s reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century This abacus used beads on wires, unlike the traditional Roman counting boards, which meant the abacus could be used much faster.

Writing in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.

One example of archaeological evidence of the <a href="Roman%20abacus">Roman abacus</a>, shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units, five tens etc., essentially in a <a href="bi-quinary%20coded%20decimal">bi-quinary coded decimal</a> system, obviously related to the <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numerals</a>. The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman "ounces" (i.e. fractions).

There is no clear evidence for use of the abacus in India. The decimal number system invented in India replaced the abacus in Western Europe.

The "<a href="Abhidharmako%C5%9Babh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ya">Abhidharmakośabhāṣya</a>" of <a href="Vasubandhu">Vasubandhu</a> (316-396), a Sanskrit work on Buddhist philosophy, says that the second-century CE philosopher <a href="Vasumitra">Vasumitra</a> said that "placing a wick (Sanskrit "vartikā") on the number one ("ekāṅka") means it is a one, while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred, and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand". It is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been. Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the Abacus. Hindu texts used the term "śūnya" (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.

In Japanese, the abacus is called "<a href="soroban">soroban</a>" (, lit. "Counting tray"), imported from China in the 14th century. It was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class started, as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class. The 1/4 abacus, which is suited to decimal calculation, appeared circa 1930, and became widespread as the Japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in China. The abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket <a href="electronic%20calculator">electronic calculator</a>s. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese <a href="primary%20school">primary school</a>s as part of <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with a physical instrument.

The Chinese abacus migrated from China to <a href="Korea">Korea</a> around 1400 AD. Koreans call it "jupan" (주판), "supan" (수판) or "jusan" (주산).

Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a "nepohualtzintzin" in ancient <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> culture. This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.
The word Nepōhualtzintzin comes from <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> and it is formed by the roots; "Ne" – personal -; "pōhual" or "pōhualli" – the account -; and "tzintzin" – small similar elements. Its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the <a href="Calmecac">Calmecac</a> to the "temalpouhqueh" , who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood.

The Nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.

Altogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1 days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a>, which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.

The rediscovery of the Nepōhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo, who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc. There have also been found very old Nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a> culture, and even some bracelets of <a href="Maya%20peoples">Maya</a>n origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.

George I. Sanchez, "Arithmetic in Maya", Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20peninsula">Yucatán peninsula</a> that also computed calendar data. This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles. Sanchez worked with <a href="Sylvanus%20Morley">Sylvanus Morley</a>, a noted Mayanist.

The <a href="quipu">quipu</a> of the <a href="Inca">Inca</a>s was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data, like advanced <a href="tally%20stick">tally stick</a>s – but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a <a href="yupana">yupana</a> (<a href="Quechua%20languages">Quechua</a> for "counting tool"; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the <a href="Fibonacci%20sequence">Fibonacci sequence</a> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum.

The Russian abacus, the "schoty" (счёты), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.

As a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">former Soviet Union</a>, and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s. Even the 1874 invention of <a href="mechanical%20calculator">mechanical calculator</a>, <a href="Odhner%20Arithmometer">Odhner arithmometer</a>, had not replaced them in <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of <a href="Pocket%20calculator">microcalculators</a> had started in the Soviet Union in 1974. Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator.

The Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician <a href="Jean-Victor%20Poncelet">Jean-Victor Poncelet</a>, who served in <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia. The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and <a href="algorism">algorism</a>ic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new. Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid. The <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turks</a> and the <a href="Armenians">Armenian</a> people also used abaci similar to the Russian schoty. It was named a "coulba" by the Turks and a "choreb" by the Armenians.

Around the world, abaci have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the <a href="numeral%20system">numeral system</a> and <a href="arithmetic">arithmetic</a>.

In Western countries, a bead frame similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common (see image). It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.

The wire frame may be used either with positional notation like other abaci (thus the 10-wire version may represent numbers up to 9,999,999,999), or each bead may represent one unit (so that e.g. 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire, so numbers up to 100 may be represented). In the bead frame shown, the gap between the 5th and 6th wire, corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire, suggests the latter use.

The red-and-white abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of number-related lessons. The twenty bead version, referred to by its <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> name "rekenrek" ("calculating frame"), is often used, sometimes on a string of beads, sometimes on a rigid framework.

An adapted abacus, invented by Tim Cranmer, called a Cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals who are <a href="blindness">blind</a>. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a>, <a href="division%20%28mathematics%29">division</a>, <a href="addition">addition</a>, <a href="subtraction">subtraction</a>, <a href="square%20root">square root</a> and <a href="cube%20root">cube root</a>.

Although blind students have benefited from talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students. Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and <a href="Nemeth%20Braille">Nemeth code</a> (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.

The binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers. The abacus shows how numbers, letters, and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer, or via <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a>. The device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows. The beads represent a switch on the computer in either an "on" or "off" position.

Acid

An acid is a <a href="molecule">molecule</a> or <a href="ion">ion</a> capable of donating a <a href="Hydron%20%28chemistry%29">hydron</a> (proton or hydrogen ion H), or, alternatively, capable of forming a <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a> with an <a href="electron%20pair">electron pair</a> (a Lewis acid).

The first category of acids is the proton donors or <a href="Br%C3%B8nsted%E2%80%93Lowry%20acid%E2%80%93base%20theory">Brønsted acid</a>s. In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the <a href="hydronium%20ion">hydronium ion</a> HO and are known as <a href="Acid-base%20reaction%23Arrhenius%20theory">Arrhenius acids</a>. <a href="Johannes%20Nicolaus%20Br%C3%B8nsted">Brønsted</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Martin%20Lowry">Lowry</a> generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H.

Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid. Acids form <a href="aqueous%20solution">aqueous solution</a>s with a sour taste, can turn blue <a href="litmus">litmus</a> red, and react with <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">bases</a> and certain metals (like <a href="calcium">calcium</a>) to form <a href="Salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a>. The word "acid" is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "acidus/acēre" meaning "sour". An aqueous solution of an acid has a <a href="pH">pH</a> less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid' (as in 'dissolved in acid'), while the strict definition refers only to the <a href="solution">solute</a>. A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of <a href="Hydron%20%28chemistry%29">positive hydrogen ions</a> in the <a href="solution">solution</a>. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic.

Common aqueous acids include <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> (a solution of <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">hydrogen chloride</a> which is found in <a href="gastric%20acid">gastric acid</a> in the stomach and activates <a href="digestive%20enzymes">digestive enzymes</a>), <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> (used in <a href="car%20battery">car batteries</a>), and <a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a> (found in citrus fruits). As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. <a href="Acid%20strength">Strong acid</a>s and some concentrated weak acids are <a href="corrosive%20substance">corrosive</a>, but there are exceptions such as <a href="carborane">carborane</a>s and <a href="boric%20acid">boric acid</a>.

The second category of acids are <a href="Lewis%20acids%20and%20bases">Lewis acids</a>, which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. An example is <a href="boron%20trifluoride">boron trifluoride</a> (BF), whose boron atom has a vacant <a href="atomic%20orbital">orbital</a> which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> (NH). <a href="Gilbert%20N.%20Lewis">Lewis</a> considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly "or" by releasing protons (H) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids. Conversely, many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry acids. In modern terminology, an "acid" is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as "a Lewis acid".

Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.

Most acids encountered in everyday life are <a href="aqueous%20solutions">aqueous solutions</a>, or can be dissolved in water, so the Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant.

The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified, acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H) from an acid to a base.

Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions. Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as <a href="Lewis%20base">Lewis base</a>s due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

The Swedish chemist <a href="Svante%20Arrhenius">Svante Arrhenius</a> attributed the properties of acidity to <a href="hydron%20%28chemistry%29">hydrogen ions</a> (H) or <a href="proton">proton</a>s in 1884. An Arrhenius acid is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H ions in the water. Note that chemists often write H("aq") and refer to the <a href="hydrogen%20ion">hydrogen ion</a> when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a <a href="proton">proton</a>, does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, HO. Thus, an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water. Examples include molecular substances such as HCl and acetic acid.

An Arrhenius <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a>, on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a> (OH) ions when dissolved in water. This decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form HO molecules:

HO + OH ⇌ HO + HO

Due to this equilibrium, any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide. Thus, an Arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, while an Arrhenius base increases it.

In an acidic solution, the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10 <a href="Mole%20%28unit%29">moles</a> per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acidic solutions thus have a pH of less than 7.

While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists <a href="Johannes%20Nicolaus%20Br%C3%B8nsted">Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Martin%20Lowry">Thomas Martin Lowry</a> independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A Brønsted-Lowry acid (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base. Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> (CHCOOH), the <a href="organic%20acid">organic acid</a> that gives vinegar its characteristic taste:

Both theories easily describe the first reaction: CHCOOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of HO when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example CHCOOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH), but does not relate to the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. Nevertheless, CHCOOH is both an Arrhenius and a Brønsted-Lowry acid.

Brønsted-Lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of <a href="molecule">molecular compounds</a> in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase. <a href="Hydrogen%20chloride">Hydrogen chloride</a> (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form <a href="ammonium%20chloride">ammonium chloride</a>, NHCl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> and exists as hydronium and chloride ions. The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius's definition:

As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute. The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton-transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in <a href="benzene">benzene</a>) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH combine to form the solid.

A third, only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by <a href="Gilbert%20N.%20Lewis">Gilbert N. Lewis</a>, which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer. A Lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor. Brønsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. Many Lewis acids are not Brønsted-Lowry acids. Contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry:
In the first reaction a <a href="fluoride">fluoride ion</a>, F, gives up an <a href="lone%20pair">electron pair</a> to <a href="boron%20trifluoride">boron trifluoride</a> to form the product <a href="tetrafluoroborate">tetrafluoroborate</a>. Fluoride "loses" a pair of <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This reaction cannot be described in terms of Brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in HO gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen. Depending on the context, a Lewis acid may also be described as an <a href="Oxidizing%20agent">oxidizer</a> or an <a href="electrophile">electrophile</a>. Organic Brønsted acids, such as acetic, citric, or oxalic acid, are not Lewis acids. They dissociate in water to produce a Lewis acid, H, but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a Lewis base (acetate, citrate, or oxalate, respectively, for the acids mentioned). Few, if any, of the acids discussed in the following are Lewis acids.

Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA H + A, where HA represents the acid and A is the <a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate base</a>. This reaction is referred to as protolysis. The protonated form (HA) of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the free acid.

Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton (<a href="protonation">protonation</a> and <a href="deprotonation">deprotonation</a>, respectively). Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA H + A. In solution there exists an <a href="chemical%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a> between the acid and its conjugate base. The <a href="equilibrium%20constant">equilibrium constant</a> "K" is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that [HO] means "the concentration of HO". The <a href="acid%20dissociation%20constant">acid dissociation constant</a> "K" is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of "K" is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H.
The stronger of two acids will have a higher "K" than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for "K" spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p"K" is more frequently used, where p"K" = −log "K". Stronger acids have a smaller p"K" than weaker acids. Experimentally determined p"K" at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.

In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their <a href="anion">anion</a>s. That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.
For example, HCl has <a href="chloride">chloride</a> as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>. In the <a href="IUPAC">IUPAC</a> naming system, "aqueous" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound. Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride. The prefix "hydro-" is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.

Classical naming system:
The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one <a href="mole%20%28unit%29">mole</a> of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H and one mole of the conjugate base, A, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of <a href="strong%20acid">strong acid</a>s are <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> (HCl), <a href="hydroiodic%20acid">hydroiodic acid</a> (HI), <a href="hydrobromic%20acid">hydrobromic acid</a> (HBr), <a href="perchloric%20acid">perchloric acid</a> (HClO), <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> (HNO) and <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> (HSO). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the <a href="chemical%20polarity">polarity</a> of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.

Stronger acids have a larger "K" and a more negative p"K" than weaker acids.

Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is <a href="toluenesulfonic%20acid">toluenesulfonic acid</a> (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, <a href="polystyrene">polystyrene</a> functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.

<a href="Superacid">Superacid</a>s are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are <a href="fluoroantimonic%20acid">fluoroantimonic acid</a>, <a href="magic%20acid">magic acid</a> and <a href="perchloric%20acid">perchloric acid</a>. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline <a href="hydronium">hydronium</a> "salts". They can also quantitatively stabilize <a href="carbocation">carbocation</a>s.

While "K" measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution. The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's "K".

Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one <a href="proton">proton</a> per molecule during the process of <a href="dissociation%20%28chemistry%29">dissociation</a> (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):

Common examples of monoprotic acids in <a href="mineral%20acid">mineral acid</a>s include <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> (HCl) and <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> (HNO). On the other hand, for <a href="organic%20acids">organic acids</a> the term mainly indicates the presence of one <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a> group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in <a href="organic%20acids">organic acids</a> include <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a> (HCOOH), <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> (CHCOOH) and <a href="benzoic%20acid">benzoic acid</a> (CHCOOH).
Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).

A diprotic acid (here symbolized by HA) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH. Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K and K.

The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., "K" > "K". For example, <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> (HSO) can donate one proton to form the <a href="bisulfate">bisulfate</a> anion (HSO), for which "K" is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a> anion (SO), wherein the "K" is intermediate strength. The large "K" for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable <a href="carbonic%20acid">carbonic acid</a> can lose one proton to form <a href="bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a> anion and lose a second to form <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a> anion (CO). Both "K" values are small, but "K" > "K" .

A triprotic acid (HA) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where "K" > "K" > "K".

An <a href="inorganic">inorganic</a> example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (HPO), usually just called <a href="phosphoric%20acid">phosphoric acid</a>. All three protons can be successively lost to yield HPO, then HPO, and finally PO, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>. Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent, the successive "K" values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged. An <a href="organic%20compound">organic</a> example of a triprotic acid is <a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a>, which can successively lose three protons to finally form the <a href="citrate">citrate</a> ion.

Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution. The fractional concentration, "α" (alpha), for each species can be calculated. For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: HA, HA, and A. The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:
A plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given "K" and "K", is known as a <a href="Bjerrum%20plot">Bjerrum plot</a>. A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general "n" -protic acid that has been deprotonated "i" -times:
\alpha_{\ce H_{n-i} A^{i-} }=

Asphalt

Asphalt , also known as bitumen , is a sticky, black, and highly <a href="viscosity">viscous</a> liquid or semi-solid form of <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a>. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a <a href="Pitch%20%28resin%29">pitch</a>. Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> ἄσφαλτος "ásphaltos".

The primary use (70%) of asphalt is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with <a href="construction%20aggregate">aggregate</a> particles to create <a href="asphalt%20concrete">asphalt concrete</a>. Its other main uses are for <a href="bituminous%20waterproofing">bituminous waterproofing</a> products, including production of <a href="roofing%20felt">roofing felt</a> and for sealing flat roofs.

The terms "asphalt" and "bitumen" are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance. In <a href="American%20English">American English</a>, "asphalt" (or "asphalt cement") is commonly used for a refined residue from the <a href="distillation">distillation</a> process of selected crude oils. Outside the United States, the product is often called "bitumen", and geologists worldwide often prefer the term for the naturally occurring variety. Common colloquial usage often refers to various forms of asphalt as "<a href="tar">tar</a>", as in the name of the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a>.

Naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term "crude bitumen". Its viscosity is similar to that of cold <a href="molasses">molasses</a> while the material obtained from the <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> of <a href="crude%20oil">crude oil</a> boiling at is sometimes referred to as "refined bitumen". The Canadian province of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> has most of the world's reserves of natural asphalt, covering , an area larger than <a href="England">England</a>.

The word "asphalt" is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French "asphalte", based on <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> "asphalton", "asphaltum", which is the <a href="Latinisation%20%28literature%29">latinisation</a> of the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἄσφαλτος ("ásphaltos", "ásphalton"), a word meaning "asphalt/bitumen/<a href="Pitch%20%28resin%29">pitch</a>", which perhaps derives from ἀ-, "without" and σφάλλω ("sfallō"), "make fall". The first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically, <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall. From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French ("asphalte") and English ("asphaltum" and "asphalt"). In French, the term "asphalte" is used for naturally occurring asphalt-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the "asphaltic concrete" used to pave roads.

The expression "bitumen" originated in the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> words "jatu", meaning "pitch," and "jatu-krit", meaning "pitch creating" or "pitch producing" (referring to <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally "gwitu-men" (pertaining to pitch), and by others, "pixtumens" (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to "bitumen", thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> word "cwidu" (mastix), the German word "Kitt" (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word "kvada".

In <a href="British%20English">British English</a>, "bitumen" is used instead of "asphalt." The word "asphalt" is instead used to refer to <a href="asphalt%20concrete">asphalt concrete</a>, a mixture of <a href="construction%20aggregate">construction aggregate</a> and asphalt itself (also called "<a href="tarmac">tarmac</a>" in common parlance). Bitumen mixed with clay was usually called "asphaltum", but the term is less commonly used today.

In <a href="Australian%20English">Australian English</a>, "bitumen" is often used as the generic term for road surfaces.

In <a href="American%20English">American English</a>, "asphalt" is equivalent to the British "bitumen". However, "asphalt" is also commonly used as a shortened form of "<a href="asphalt%20concrete">asphalt concrete</a>" (therefore equivalent to the British "asphalt" or "tarmac").

In <a href="Canadian%20English">Canadian English</a>, the word "bitumen" is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy <a href="crude%20oil">crude oil</a>, while "asphalt" is used for the oil refinery product. Diluted bitumen (diluted with <a href="naphtha">naphtha</a> to make it flow in pipelines) is known as "<a href="dilbit">dilbit</a>" in the Canadian petroleum industry, while bitumen "<a href="Upgrader">upgraded</a>" to <a href="synthetic%20crude">synthetic crude</a> oil is known as "syncrude", and syncrude blended with bitumen is called "synbit".

"Bitumen" is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum. "Bituminous rock" is a form of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> impregnated with bitumen. The <a href="tar%20sands">tar sands</a> of <a href="Alberta%2C%20Canada">Alberta, Canada</a> are a similar material.

Neither of the terms "asphalt" or "bitumen" should be confused with <a href="tar">tar</a> or <a href="coal%20tars">coal tars</a>.

The components of asphalt include four main classes of compounds: 

The naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components. Most natural bitumens also contain <a href="organosulfur%20compound">organosulfur compound</a>s, resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to 4%. <a href="Nickel">Nickel</a> and <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a> are found at <10 parts per million, as is typical of some petroleum.

The substance is soluble in <a href="carbon%20disulfide">carbon disulfide</a>. It is commonly modelled as a <a href="colloid">colloid</a>, with <a href="asphaltene">asphaltene</a>s as the dispersed phase and <a href="wikt%3Amaltene">maltenes</a> as the continuous phase. "It is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt, because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large".

Asphalt may be confused with <a href="coal%20tar">coal tar</a>, which is a visually similar black, thermoplastic material produced by the <a href="destructive%20distillation">destructive distillation</a> of <a href="coal">coal</a>. During the early and mid-20th century, when <a href="town%20gas">town gas</a> was produced, coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of coal tar to <a href="macadam">macadam</a> roads led to the word "<a href="tarmac">tarmac</a>", which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> and the Canadian <a href="oil%20sands">oil sands</a>, both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar. "Pitch" is another term sometimes informally used at times to refer to asphalt, as in <a href="Pitch%20Lake">Pitch Lake</a>.

The majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum. Nonetheless, large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature. Naturally occurring deposits of bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic <a href="algae">algae</a> (<a href="diatom">diatom</a>s) and other once-living things. These remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived. Under the heat (above 50 °C) and <a href="pressure">pressure</a> of burial deep in the earth, the remains were transformed into materials such as bitumen, <a href="kerogen">kerogen</a>, or petroleum.

Natural deposits of bitumen include lakes such as the <a href="Pitch%20Lake">Pitch Lake</a> in Trinidad and Tobago and <a href="Lake%20Bermudez">Lake Bermudez</a> in <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. Natural <a href="petroleum%20seep">seeps</a> occur in the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> and in the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a>.

Bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as "oil sands" in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, Canada, and the similar "tar sands" in <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, US.
The Canadian province of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> has most of the world's reserves, in three huge deposits covering , an area larger than <a href="England">England</a> or <a href="New%20York%20state">New York state</a>. These bituminous sands contain of commercially established oil reserves, giving Canada the third largest <a href="oil%20reserves">oil reserves</a> in the world. Although historically it was used without refining to pave roads, nearly all of the output is now used as <a href="raw%20material">raw material</a> for <a href="Oil%20refinery">oil refineries</a> in Canada and the United States.

The world's largest deposit of natural bitumen, known as the <a href="Athabasca%20oil%20sands">Athabasca oil sands</a>, is located in the <a href="McMurray%20Formation">McMurray Formation</a> of Northern Alberta. This formation is from the early <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, and is composed of numerous <a href="lens%20%28geology%29">lenses</a> of oil-bearing sand with up to 20% oil. Isotopic studies show the oil deposits to be about 110 million years old. Two smaller but still very large formations occur in the <a href="Peace%20River%20oil%20sands">Peace River oil sands</a> and the <a href="Cold%20Lake%20oil%20sands">Cold Lake oil sands</a>, to the west and southeast of the Athabasca oil sands, respectively. Of the Alberta deposits, only parts of the Athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining. The other 80% has to be produced by oil wells using <a href="enhanced%20oil%20recovery">enhanced oil recovery</a> techniques like <a href="steam-assisted%20gravity%20drainage">steam-assisted gravity drainage</a>.

Much smaller heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the <a href="Uinta%20Basin">Uinta Basin</a> in Utah, US. The <a href="Tar%20Sand%20Triangle">Tar Sand Triangle</a> deposit, for example, is roughly 6% bitumen.

Bitumen may occur in <a href="hydrothermal%20vein">hydrothermal vein</a>s. An example of this is within the <a href="Uinta%20Basin">Uinta Basin</a> of <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, in the US, where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed <a href="Gilsonite">Gilsonite</a>. These veins formed by the polymerization and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the <a href="Green%20River%20Formation">Green River Formation</a> during burial and <a href="diagenesis">diagenesis</a>.

Bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s. However, detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct. The vast Alberta bitumen resources are considered to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals, mainly <a href="algae">algae</a>, that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered Alberta. They were covered by mud, buried deeply over time, and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of . Due to pressure from the rising of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> in southwestern Alberta, 80 to 55 million years ago, the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches, thus forming the oil sands.

The use of asphalt for <a href="waterproofing">waterproofing</a> and as an <a href="adhesive">adhesive</a> dates at least to the fifth <a href="millennium">millennium</a> BC in the early <a href="Indus%20Valley%20Civilization">Indus valley sites</a> like <a href="Mehrgarh">Mehrgarh</a>, where it was used to line the baskets in which crops were gathered.

In the ancient Middle East, the <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ians used natural bitumen deposits for <a href="mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a> between <a href="brick">brick</a>s and stones, to cement parts of carvings, such as eyes, into place, for ship <a href="caulking">caulking</a>, and for waterproofing. The Greek historian <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> said hot bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>.

The long <a href="Euphrates%20Tunnel">Euphrates Tunnel</a> beneath the river <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> at <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> in the time of Queen <a href="Semiramis">Semiramis</a> (ca. 800 BC) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with bitumen as a waterproofing agent.

Bitumen was used by <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ians to <a href="Embalming">embalm</a> mummies. The <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> word for asphalt is "moom", which is related to the English word <a href="mummy">mummy</a>. The Egyptians' primary source of bitumen was the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a>, which the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> knew as "Palus Asphaltites" (Asphalt Lake).

Approximately 40 AD, <a href="Dioscorides">Dioscorides</a> described the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a> material as "Judaicum bitumen", and noted other places in the region where it could be found.
The Sidon bitumen is thought to refer to materiall found at <a href="Hasbeya">Hasbeya</a>. Pliny refers also to bitumen being found in <a href="Selenic%C3%AB">Epirus</a>. It was a valuable strategic resource, the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit—between the <a href="Seleucid">Seleucid</a>s and the <a href="Nabateans">Nabateans</a> in 312 BC.

In the ancient Far East, natural bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher <a href="Fraction%20%28chemistry%29">fractions</a>, leaving a <a href="thermoplastic">thermoplastic</a> material of higher molecular weight that when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling. This was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing, such as <a href="scabbard">scabbard</a>s and other items. <a href="Statuettes">Statuettes</a> of household <a href="deities">deities</a> were also cast with this type of material in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, and probably also in <a href="China">China</a>.

In <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, archaeological recovery has indicated bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone <a href="projectile%20point">projectile point</a>s to wooden shafts. In Canada, aboriginal people used bitumen seeping out of the banks of the <a href="Athabasca%20River">Athabasca</a> and other rivers to waterproof birch bark <a href="canoe">canoe</a>s, and also heated it in smudge pots to ward off <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es in the summer.

In 1553, <a href="Pierre%20Belon">Pierre Belon</a> described in his work "<a href="Observations%20%28Pierre%20Belon%29">Observations</a>" that "pissasphalto", a mixture of <a href="Pitch%20%28resin%29">pitch</a> and bitumen, was used in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ragusa">Republic of Ragusa</a> (now <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>) for tarring of ships.

An 1838 edition of "Mechanics Magazine" cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by "a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – "principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth", which at that time made the water unusable. "He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces" in palaces, "the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation".

But the substance was generally neglected in France until the <a href="July%20Revolution">revolution of 1830</a>. In the 1830s there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used "for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes". Its rise in Europe was "a sudden phenomenon", after natural deposits were found "in France at Osbann (<a href="Bas-Rhin">Bas-Rhin</a>), the Parc (<a href="Ain">Ain</a>) and the Puy-de-la-Poix (<a href="Puy-de-D%C3%B4me">Puy-de-Dôme</a>)", although it could also be made artificially. One of the earliest uses in France was the laying of about 24,000 square yards of Seyssel asphalt at the <a href="Place%20de%20la%20Concorde">Place de la Concorde</a> in 1835.

Among the earlier uses of bitumen in the United Kingdom was for etching. William Salmon's "Polygraphice" (1673) provides a recipe for varnish used in etching, consisting of three ounces of virgin wax, two ounces of <a href="mastic%20%28plant%20resin%29">mastic</a>, and one ounce of asphaltum. By the fifth edition in 1685, he had included more asphaltum recipes from other sources.

The first British patent for the use of asphalt was "Cassell's patent asphalte or bitumen" in 1834. Then on 25 November 1837, <a href="Captain%20R.%20T.%20Claridge">Richard Tappin Claridge</a> patented the use of Seyssel asphalt (patent #7849), for use in asphalte pavement, having seen it employed in France and Belgium when visiting with <a href="Frederick%20Walter%20Simms">Frederick Walter Simms</a>, who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to Britain. Dr T. Lamb Phipson writes that his father, Samuel Ryland Phipson, a friend of Claridge, was also "instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement (in 1836)". Indeed, mastic pavements had been previously employed at <a href="Vauxhall">Vauxhall</a> by a competitor of Claridge, but without success.

Claridge obtained a patent in Scotland on 27 March 1838, and obtained a patent in Ireland on 23 April 1838. In 1851, extensions for the 1837 patent and for both 1838 patents were sought by the trustees of a company previously formed by Claridge. "Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company"—formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to Britain "Asphalte in its natural state from the mine at Pyrimont Seysell in France",—"laid one of the first asphalt pavements in Whitehall". Trials were made of the pavement in 1838 on the footway in Whitehall, the stable at Knightsbridge Barracks, "and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from Waterloo Place to St. James Park". "The formation in 1838 of Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company (with a distinguished list of aristocratic patrons, and <a href="Marc%20Isambard%20Brunel">Marc</a> and <a href="Isambard%20Kingdom%20Brunel">Isambard Brunel</a> as, respectively, a trustee and consulting engineer), gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry". "By the end of 1838, at least two other companies, Robinson's and the Bastenne company, were in production", with asphalt being laid as paving at Brighton, Herne Bay, Canterbury, Kensington, the Strand, and a large floor area in Bunhill-row, while meantime Claridge's Whitehall paving "continue(d) in good order".

In 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving asphalt, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also be used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, both of which were also proliferating in the 19th century. On the London stockmarket, there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France, Germany and England. And numerous patents were granted in France, with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in England due to their similarity to each other. In England, "Claridge's was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s".

In 1914, Claridge's Company entered into a joint venture to produce <a href="Macadam%23Tar-bound%20macadam">tar-bound macadam</a>, with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called Clarmac Roads Ltd. Two products resulted, namely "Clarmac", and "Clarphalte", with the former being manufactured by Clarmac Roads and the latter by Claridge's Patent Asphalte Co., although "Clarmac" was more widely used. However, the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> ruined the Clarmac Company, which entered into liquidation in 1915. The failure of Clarmac Roads Ltd had a flow-on effect to Claridge's Company, which was itself compulsorily wound up, ceasing operations in 1917, having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture, both at the outset and in a subsequent attempt to save the Clarmac Company.

The first use of bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples. On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the <a href="Tongva%20people">Tongva</a>, <a href="Luise%C3%B1o%20people">Luiseño</a> and <a href="Chumash%20people">Chumash</a> peoples collected the naturally occurring bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits. All three groups used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on <a href="rattle%20%28percussion%20instrument%29">rattle</a>s to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations. It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water, possibly poisoning those who drank the water. Asphalt was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.

Roads in the US have been paved with materials that include asphalt since at least 1870, when a street in front of the Newark (New Jersey) City Hall was paved. In many cases, these early pavings were made from naturally occurring "bituminous rock", such as at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in <a href="Ritchie%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Ritchie County, West Virginia</a> from 1852 to 1873. In 1876, asphalt-based paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial. Asphalt was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.

Canada has the world's largest deposit of natural bitumen in the <a href="Athabasca%20oil%20sands">Athabasca oil sands</a>, and Canadian <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> along the <a href="Athabasca%20River">Athabasca River</a> had long used it to waterproof their canoes. In 1719, a <a href="Cree">Cree</a> named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample for trade to <a href="Henry%20Kelsey">Henry Kelsey</a> of the <a href="Hudson%E2%80%99s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson’s Bay Company</a>, who was the first recorded European to see it. However, it wasn't until 1787 that fur trader and explorer <a href="Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28explorer%29">Alexander MacKenzie</a> saw the Athabasca oil sands and said, "At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance."

The value of the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen was not. The nearest town, <a href="Fort%20McMurray%2C%20Alberta">Fort McMurray, Alberta</a>, was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in <a href="Edmonton%2C%20Alberta">Edmonton, Alberta</a>. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s <a href="Karl%20Clark%20%28chemist%29">Dr. Karl A. Clark</a> of the <a href="Alberta%20Research%20Council">Alberta Research Council</a> patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the <a href="Bitumount">Bitumount</a> oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust- and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a <a href="Provincial%20historic%20sites%20of%20Alberta">Provincial Historic Site</a>.

Bitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist <a href="Joseph%20Nic%C3%A9phore%20Ni%C3%A9pce">Joseph Nicéphore Niépce</a> to make the <a href="View%20from%20the%20Window%20at%20Le%20Gras">oldest surviving photograph from nature</a>. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a <a href="pewter">pewter</a> plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a <a href="photoresist">photoresist</a> in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.

Bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Delacroix</a>. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20G%C3%A9ricault">Théodore Géricault</a>'s <a href="Raft%20of%20the%20Medusa">Raft of the Medusa</a> (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.

The vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According to the requirements of the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the <a href="Binder%20%28material%29">binder</a> in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse <a href="Construction%20aggregate">aggregates</a> such as <a href="sand">sand</a>, <a href="gravel">gravel</a> and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., <a href="Natural%20rubber">rubber</a> <a href="tire">tyres</a>), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.
A further 10% of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications, where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable.
The remaining 5% of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials, such as pipe coatings, carpet tile backing and paint.
Asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures, systems, and components, such as the following:

The largest use of asphalt is for making <a href="asphalt%20concrete">asphalt concrete</a> for road surfaces; this accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United States. Asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% asphalt cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates, but <a href="Asphalt%20concrete%23Mixture%20formulations">warm-mix asphalt technologies</a> allow producers to reduce the temperature required. There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the US, and a similar number in Europe.

When maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements, such as <a href="Pavement%20milling">milling</a> to remove a worn or damaged surface, the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures. The asphalt in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes. With some 95% of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt, a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year. According to industry surveys conducted annually by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> and the National Asphalt Pavement Association, more than 99% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.

Asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world. Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly, it is widely used for <a href="runway">runway</a>s.

<a href="Mastic%20asphalt">Mastic asphalt</a> is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt (<a href="asphalt%20concrete">asphalt concrete</a>) in that it has a higher asphalt (<a href="binder%20%28material%29">binder</a>) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% asphalt. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about thick.

A number of technologies allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form "cutbacks" with reduced melting point or mixing with water to turn the asphalt into an <a href="emulsion">emulsion</a>. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, <a href="cationic">cationic</a> and <a href="anionic">anionic</a>. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. <a href="Chipseal">Chipseal</a> involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth, and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.

Synthetic crude oil, also known as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada. Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) <a href="power%20shovel">power shovel</a>s and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) <a href="dump%20trucks">dump trucks</a> for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by <a href="Karl%20Clark%20%28chemist%29">Dr. Karl Clark</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a> during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a <a href="Upgrader">bitumen upgrader</a> which converts it into a <a href="light%20crude%20oil">light crude oil</a> equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional <a href="oil%20pipeline">oil pipeline</a>s and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.

In Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products: The <a href="Suncor%20Energy">Suncor Energy</a> upgrader near <a href="Fort%20McMurray%2C%20Alberta">Fort McMurray, Alberta</a> produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel; the <a href="Syncrude%20Canada">Syncrude Canada</a>, <a href="Canadian%20Natural%20Resources">Canadian Natural Resources</a>, and <a href="Nexen">Nexen</a> upgraders near Fort McMurray produce synthetic crude oil; and the Shell <a href="Scotford%20Upgrader">Scotford Upgrader</a> near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery. A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near <a href="Redwater%2C%20Alberta">Redwater, Alberta</a>, will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants.

Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican <a href="heavy%20crude%20oil">heavy oil</a> in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through <a href="oil%20pipeline">oil pipeline</a>s to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US <a href="Gulf%20coast">Gulf coast</a>, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US <a href="Midwest">Midwest</a> where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.

Because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with <a href="natural-gas%20condensate">natural-gas condensate</a> in a form called <a href="dilbit">dilbit</a> or with synthetic crude oil, called <a href="synbit">synbit</a>. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional crude oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as <a href="Western%20Canadian%20Select">Western Canadian Select</a>. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as <a href="Petroleum%20industry%20in%20Mexico">Mexican Mayan</a> or Arabian <a href="Dubai%20Crude">Dubai Crude</a>.

Asphalt was used starting in the 1960s as an <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble <a href="sodium%20nitrate">sodium nitrate</a> and <a href="sodium%20sulfate">sodium sulfate</a>) produced by the reprocessing of <a href="spent%20nuclear%20fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a>s or radioactive <a href="sludge">sludge</a>s from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly <a href="radiotoxic">radiotoxic</a> <a href="ionizing%20radiation%23Alpha%20particles">alpha-emitting</a> <a href="Transuranium%20element">transuranic element</a>s from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their <a href="Deep%20geological%20repository">geological disposal</a> in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma <a href="radiolysis">radiolysis</a>. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a> salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for <a href="osmosis">osmotic</a> effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a <a href="Semipermeable%20membrane">semi-permeable membrane</a>. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high <a href="ionic%20strength">ionic strength</a> of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the <a href="redox">redox</a> conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, <a href="technetium">technetium</a>, <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a> and <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded <a href="anion">anion</a>s. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.

Different type of asphalt have been used: blown bitumen (partly oxidized with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation, and harder) and direct distillation bitumen (softer). Blown bitumens like Mexphalte, with a high content of saturated hydrocarbons, are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen, with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons.

Concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered a safer alternative by the <a href="nuclear%20industry">nuclear industry</a> and the waste management organisations.

<a href="Asphalt%20shingle">Roofing shingle</a>s account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics. Asphalt is used to make <a href="Japan%20black">Japan black</a>, a <a href="lacquer">lacquer</a> known especially for its use on iron and steel, and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink, and to make the color darker. Asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.

About 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984. It is obtained as the "heavy" (i.e., difficult to distill) fraction. Material with a <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a> greater than around 500 °C is considered asphalt. Vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil (such as <a href="naphtha">naphtha</a>, gasoline and <a href="Diesel%20fuel">diesel</a>). The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications. In a <a href="de-asphalting%20unit">de-asphalting unit</a>, the crude asphalt is treated with either <a href="propane">propane</a> or <a href="butane">butane</a> in a <a href="Supercritical%20fluid">supercritical</a> phase to extract the lighter molecules, which are then separated. Further processing is possible by "blowing" the product: namely reacting it with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>. This step makes the product harder and more viscous.

Asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around . Sometimes <a href="diesel%20oil">diesel oil</a> or <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a> are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called "bitumen feedstock", or BFS. Some <a href="dump%20truck">dump truck</a>s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a <a href="release%20agent">release agent</a> due to environmental concerns.

Naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from "<a href="oil%20sands">oil sands</a>", currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven <a href="oil%20reserves">oil reserves</a> in the world. The <a href="Athabasca%20oil%20sands">Athabasca oil sands</a> are the largest bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to <a href="surface%20mining">surface mining</a>, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by "<a href="in-situ%23Petroleum">in situ</a>" methods. Because of <a href="world%20oil%20market%20chronology%20from%202003">oil price increases after 2003</a>, producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude bitumen production averaged about per day and was projected to rise to per day by 2020. The total amount of crude bitumen in Alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about , which at a rate of would last about 200 years.

Although uncompetitive economically, asphalt can be made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as sugar, <a href="molasses">molasses</a> and rice, corn and potato <a href="starch">starch</a>es. Asphalt can also be made from waste material by <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> of used <a href="motor%20oil">motor oil</a>, which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills. Use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates, resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently.

Nonpetroleum-based asphalt binders can be made light-colored. Lighter-colored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation, reducing their contribution to the <a href="urban%20heat%20island">urban heat island</a> effect. Parking lots that use asphalt alternatives are called <a href="green%20parking%20lot">green parking lot</a>s.

Selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in native deposits in <a href="Selenice">Selenice</a>, in <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, the only European asphalt mine still in use. The bitumen is found in the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction. The bitumen content varies from 83% to 92% (soluble in carbon disulphide), with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point (ring and ball) around 120 °C. The insoluble matter, consisting mainly of silica ore, ranges from 8% to 17%.
Albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans. After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman <a href="Henri%20Coquand">Coquand</a> published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the exploitation rights were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale.

Today the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines (deep and extending over several km) still remain viable. Selenizza is produced primarily in granular form, after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine.
Selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags.

A <a href="life-cycle%20assessment">life-cycle assessment</a> study of the natural selenizza compared with petroleum asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road asphalt produced in oil refineries in terms of carbon dioxide emission.

People can be exposed to asphalt in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption. The <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) has set a <a href="recommended%20exposure%20limit">recommended exposure limit</a> of 5 mg/m over a 15-minute period.

Asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving, roofing, and other applications. In examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt, the <a href="International%20Agency%20for%20Research%20on%20Cancer">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> (IARC) determined that it is the application parameters, predominantly temperature, that affect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable <a href="carcinogenic">carcinogenic</a> hazard/risk of the asphalt emissions. In particular, temperatures greater than 199 °C (390 °F), were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures, such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement. IARC has classified asphalt as a <a href="List%20of%20IARC%20Group%202B%20carcinogens">Class 2B</a> possible carcinogen.

American National Standards Institute

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI, ) is a private <a href="non-profit%20organization">non-profit organization</a> that oversees the development of <a href="Standardization">voluntary consensus standards</a> for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States. The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.

ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other <a href="standards%20organization">standards organization</a>s, <a href="government%20agency">government agencies</a>, <a href="consumer%20organization">consumer groups</a>, companies, and others. These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards.

The organization's headquarters are in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> ANSI's operations office is located in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications, membership dues and fees, accreditation services, fee-based programs, and international standards programs.

ANSI was originally formed in 1918, when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC). In 1928, the AESC became the American Standards Association (ASA). In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became United States of America Standards Institute (USASI). The present name was adopted in 1969.

Prior to 1918, these five founding engineering societies:
had been members of the United Engineering Society (UES). At the behest of the AIEE, they invited the U.S. government Departments of War, Navy (combined in 1947 to become the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> or DOD) and Commerce to join in founding a national standards organization.

According to Adam Stanton, the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919, AESC started as an ambitious program and little else. Staff for the first year consisted of one executive, Clifford B. LePage, who was on loan from a founding member, ASME. An annual budget of $7,500 was provided by the founding bodies.

In 1931, the organization (renamed ASA in 1928) became affiliated with the U.S. National Committee of the <a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">International Electrotechnical Commission</a> (<a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">IEC</a>), which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards.

ANSI's members are government agencies, organizations, corporations, academic and international bodies, and individuals. In total, the Institute represents the interests of more than 125,000 companies and 3.5 million professionals.

Though ANSI itself does not develop standards, the Institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations. ANSI accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the Institute's requirements for openness, balance, consensus, and due process.

ANSI also designates specific standards as American National Standards, or ANS, when the Institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable, accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders.

Voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers. There are approximately 9,500 American National Standards that carry the ANSI designation.

The American National Standards process involves:

In addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the United States, ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally, advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations, and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate.

The Institute is the official U.S. representative to the two major international standards organizations, the <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO), as a founding member, and the <a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">International Electrotechnical Commission</a> (IEC), via the U.S. National Committee (USNC). ANSI participates in almost the entire technical program of both the ISO and the IEC, and administers many key committees and subgroups. In many instances, U.S. standards are taken forward to ISO and IEC, through ANSI or the USNC, where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards.

The Institute administers nine standards panels:

Each of the panels works to identify, coordinate, and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas.

In 2009, ANSI and the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) formed the Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC). NESCC is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry.

Apollo 11

Apollo 11 was the <a href="spaceflight">spaceflight</a> that <a href="Moon%20landing">landed</a> the first two humans on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. Mission commander <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> and pilot <a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a>, both American, landed the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">lunar module</a> "Eagle" on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected of lunar material to bring back to Earth. <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a> piloted the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">command module</a> "Columbia" alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining "Columbia" in lunar orbit.

Apollo 11 was launched by a <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rocket from <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> in <a href="Merritt%20Island%2C%20Florida">Merritt Island, Florida</a>, on July 16 at 9:32 am <a href="Eastern%20Daylight%20Time">EDT</a> (13:32 UTC) and was the fifth manned mission of <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>. The Apollo <a href="Apollo%20%28spacecraft%29">spacecraft</a> had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages – a lower stage for landing on the Moon, and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit. 

After being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module "Eagle" and landed in the <a href="Mare%20Tranquillitatis">Sea of Tranquility</a>. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used "Eagle"'s upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned "Eagle" before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.

The landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as "one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 11 effectively ended the <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a> and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>: "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."

Apollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew (the first being <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a>) in human spaceflight history. A previous solo veteran flight had been made on Soyuz 1 in 1967 by <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> cosmonaut <a href="Vladimir%20Komarov">Vladimir Komarov</a>.

Collins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot (CMP) on <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>, his backup for that flight. After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew and promoted to backup commander.

In early 1969, Anders accepted a job with the <a href="National%20Space%20Council">National Space Council</a> effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point <a href="Ken%20Mattingly">Ken Mattingly</a> was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed) and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> CMP.



After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft "Charlie Brown" and "Snoopy", assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a> director <a href="George%20M.%20Low">George M. Low</a> to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names "Snowcone" and "Haystack" were used and put in the news release, but the crew later decided to change them.

The Command Module was named "<a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">Columbia</a>" after the "<a href="Columbiad%23In%20fiction">Columbiad</a>", the giant cannon shell "spacecraft" fired by a giant cannon (also from Florida) in <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>'s 1865 novel "<a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon">From the Earth to the Moon</a>". The Lunar Module was named "Eagle" for the <a href="national%20bird">national bird</a> of the United States, the <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>, which is featured prominently on the mission insignia.

The Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for "peaceful lunar landing by the United States". He chose an eagle as the symbol, put an <a href="olive%20branch">olive branch</a> in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. NASA officials said the talons of the eagle looked too "warlike" and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. The crew decided the <a href="Roman%20numeral">Roman numeral</a> <a href="11%20%28number%29">XI</a> would not be understood in some nations and went with "Apollo 11"; they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would "be representative of "everyone" who had worked toward a lunar landing". All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the <a href="Mission%20patch">patch</a>.

When the <a href="Eisenhower%20Dollar">Eisenhower dollar coin</a> was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side. The design was also used for the smaller <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony%20dollar">Susan B. Anthony dollar</a> unveiled in 1979, ten years after the Apollo 11 mission.

Neil Armstrong's personal preference kit carried a piece of wood from the <a href="Wright%20brothers">Wright brothers</a>' 1903 airplane's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing, along with a diamond-studded <a href="astronaut%20pin">astronaut pin</a> originally given to <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a> by the widows of the <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a> crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.

In addition to many people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information <a href="Jack%20King%20%28NASA%29">Jack King</a> providing commentary. President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard M. Nixon</a> viewed the proceedings from the <a href="Oval%20Office">Oval Office</a> of the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>.

A <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 a.m. EDT local time). It entered Earth orbit, at an altitude of by , twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the <a href="trans-lunar%20injection">trans-lunar injection</a> (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, the <a href="transposition%2C%20docking%2C%20and%20extraction">transposition, docking, and extraction</a> maneuver was performed: this involved separating the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Apollo Command/Service Module</a> (CSM) from the spent rocket stage, turning around, and docking with the Lunar Module still attached to the stage. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into <a href="heliocentric%20orbit">orbit around the Sun</a>.

On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter <a href="lunar%20orbit">lunar orbit</a>. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility (<a href="Mare%20Tranquillitatis">Mare Tranquillitatis</a>) about southwest of the crater <a href="Collins%20%28crater%29">Sabine D</a> (0.67408N, 23.47297E). The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated "<a href="Ranger%208">Ranger 8</a>" and "<a href="Surveyor%205">Surveyor 5</a>" landers along with the "<a href="Lunar%20Orbiter">Lunar Orbiter</a>" mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or <a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activity</a> (EVA) challenges.

On July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module "Eagle" separated from the Command Module "Columbia". Collins, alone aboard "Columbia", inspected "Eagle" as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.

As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were "long"; they would land miles west of their target point.

Five minutes into the descent burn, and above the surface of the Moon, the <a href="Apollo%20Guidance%20Computer">LM navigation and guidance computer</a> distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected "1202" and "1201" program alarms. Inside <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center">Mission Control Center</a> in Houston, Texas, computer engineer <a href="Jack%20Garman">Jack Garman</a> told <a href="Flight%20controller%23Guidance%20Officer%20%28GUIDANCE%20or%20GUIDO%29">guidance officer</a> <a href="Steve%20Bales">Steve Bales</a> it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated "executive overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.

When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a diameter crater (later determined to be <a href="West%20%28lunar%20crater%29">West crater</a>, named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.

Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.

Throughout the descent, Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">LM</a>. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the probes hanging from "Eagle" footpads had touched the surface, and he said: "Contact light!" Three seconds later, "Eagle" landed and Armstrong said "Shutdown." Aldrin immediately said "Okay, engine stop. ACA – out of <a href="detent">detent</a>." Armstrong acknowledged "Out of detent. Auto" and Aldrin continued "Mode control – both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm – off. 413 is in."

<a href="Charles%20Duke">Charles Duke</a>, CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying "We copy you down, "Eagle"."

Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with "Engine arm is off", before responding to Duke with the words, "Houston, <a href="Tranquility%20Base">Tranquility Base</a> here. The "Eagle" has landed." Armstrong's unrehearsed change of call sign from "Eagle" to "Tranquility Base" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: "Roger, Twan— Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot."

Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:

The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.

The astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. flag</a> by studying their landing site through "Eagle" twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his <a href="Primary%20Life%20Support%20System">Portable Life Support System</a> (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker <a href="John%20Young%20%28astronaut%29">John Young</a>, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.

Several books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon.

At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against "Eagle" side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used <a href="slow-scan%20television">slow-scan television</a> incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture. The signal was received at <a href="Goldstone%20Deep%20Space%20Communications%20Complex">Goldstone</a> in the United States but with better fidelity by <a href="Honeysuckle%20Creek%20Tracking%20Station">Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station</a> in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive <a href="Parkes%20Observatory">Parkes radio telescope</a> in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, <a href="Apollo%2011%20missing%20tapes">recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface</a> were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.
While still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a <a href="lunar%20plaque">plaque</a> mounted on the LM Descent Stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:
After describing the surface dust as "very fine-grained" and "almost like a powder," six and a half hours after landing, Armstrong stepped off "Eagle" footpad and declared, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."

Armstrong intended to say "That's one small step for a man", but the word ""a"" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said "for a man", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the "a" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words "for a" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near <a href="Parkes%20Observatory">Parkes Observatory</a>. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the "a" may have been spoken but obscured by static.

About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.

Twelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected, Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, and described the view with the simple phrase, "Magnificent desolation."
In addition to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s, Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.

Armstrong said that moving in the <a href="Gravitation%20of%20the%20Moon">lunar gravity</a>, one-sixth of Earth's, was "even perhaps easier than the simulations ... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around." Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into "Eagle" shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.

The astronauts planted a <a href="Lunar%20Flag%20Assembly">specially designed U.S. flag</a> on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Some time later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called "the most historic phone call ever made from the White House." Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but <a href="Frank%20Borman">Frank Borman</a>, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy. Armstrong thanked the President, and gave a brief reflection on the significance of the moment:
Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.

Armstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.

The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.

They deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a <a href="Lunar%20Laser%20Ranging%20experiment">Lunar Ranging</a> <a href="Retroreflector%23Retroreflectors%20on%20the%20Moon">Retroreflector</a> (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the <a href="geological%20hammer">geological hammer</a> to pound in the tubes – the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.
Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: <a href="armalcolite">armalcolite</a>, <a href="tranquillityite">tranquillityite</a>, and <a href="pyroxferroite">pyroxferroite</a>. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.

During this period, Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension. In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.

Aldrin entered "Eagle" first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM <a href="life%20support">life support</a>, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one <a href="Hasselblad">Hasselblad</a> camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.
President Nixon's speech writer <a href="William%20Safire">William Safire</a> had prepared "In Event of Moon Disaster" for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon. The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">White House Chief of Staff</a> <a href="H.%20R.%20Haldeman">H. R. Haldeman</a>, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster. According to the plan, Mission Control would "close down communications" with the LM, and a clergyman would "commend their souls to the deepest of the deep" in a public ritual likened to <a href="burial%20at%20sea">burial at sea</a>. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to <a href="Rupert%20Brooke">Rupert Brooke</a>'s First World War poem, "<a href="The%20Soldier%20%28poem%29">The Soldier</a>". The plan included presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives.

While moving within the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the <a href="circuit%20breaker">circuit breaker</a> that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch. Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.

After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in "Eagle" ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard "Columbia" in lunar orbit.

After more than 21½ total hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a <a href="Retroreflector%23Retroreflectors%20on%20the%20Moon">retroreflector</a> array used for the <a href="Lunar%20Laser%20Ranging%20experiment">Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment</a> and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure <a href="moonquake">moonquake</a>s. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the <a href="Apollo%2011%20goodwill%20messages">goodwill statements</a> by Presidents <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a>, Kennedy, <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Johnson</a>, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management. (In his 1989 book, "Men from Earth", Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating <a href="Cosmonaut">Cosmonaut</a>s <a href="Vladimir%20Mikhaylovich%20Komarov">Vladimir Komarov</a> and <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book "Moonshot", Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.

Film taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple: "The ascent stage of the LM separated ... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the <a href="attitude%20indicator">attitude indicator</a>, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over." Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.

After rendezvous with "Columbia", "Eagle"s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969, at 23:41 UTC. Just before the <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a> flight, it was noted that "Eagle" was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that "Eagle" orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an "uncertain location" on the lunar surface. The location is uncertain because the "Eagle" ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.

On July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented: ... The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly ... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people ... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, "Thank you very much."

Aldrin added: This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown ... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?"

Armstrong concluded: The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little <a href="Extravehicular%20Mobility%20Unit">EMU</a>, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.

On the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.

On July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the Command Module "Columbia" just before dawn local time (16:51 UTC) at , in the Pacific Ocean east of <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, south of <a href="Johnston%20Atoll">Johnston Atoll</a>, and from the recovery ship, .

At 16:44 UTC the <a href="drogue%20parachute">drogue parachute</a>s had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully. During <a href="splashdown">splashdown</a>, the Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. "Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers", was Armstrong's last official transmission from the "Columbia". A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a <a href="sea%20anchor">sea anchor</a> to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the "Hornet". Additionally, astronauts were rubbed down with a <a href="sodium%20hypochlorite">sodium hypochlorite</a> solution and the Command Module wiped with <a href="Betadine">Betadine</a> to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.

A second <a href="Sikorsky%20SH-3%20Sea%20King">Sea King</a> helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA <a href="flight%20surgeon">flight surgeon</a> gave each a brief physical check during the trip back to the "Hornet".

After touchdown on the "Hornet", the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen. The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the to the <a href="Mobile%20Quarantine%20Facility">Mobile Quarantine Facility</a> (MQF) where they would begin their 21 days of quarantine. This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a>, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.

President Richard Nixon was aboard "Hornet" to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, "As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before." After Nixon departed, the "Hornet" was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. The "Hornet" sailed for <a href="Naval%20Station%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> where the Command Module and MQF were airlifted to the <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a>.

In accordance with the recently promulgated <a href="Extra-Terrestrial%20Exposure%20Law">Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law</a>, the astronauts were placed in quarantine for fear that the Moon might contain undiscovered <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks. However, after almost three weeks in confinement (first in their trailer and later in the <a href="Lunar%20Receiving%20Laboratory">Lunar Receiving Laboratory</a> at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the astronauts exited quarantine.

On August 13, they rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official <a href="State%20dinner">State Dinner</a> to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice of the United States</a>, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the <a href="Century%20Plaza%20Hotel">Century Plaza Hotel</a>. President Richard Nixon and <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro T. Agnew</a> honored each astronaut with a presentation of the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>. This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day "Giant Leap" tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> of the United Kingdom. Many nations honored the first manned <a href="Moon%20landing">Moon landing</a> with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.

On September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a <a href="joint%20session%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Congress">joint session of Congress</a> on <a href="Capitol%20Hill">Capitol Hill</a>. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.

The Soviet Union was secretly attempting to compete with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of <a href="N1%20%28rocket%29">a launcher comparable to the Saturn V</a>. Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of <a href="Unmanned%20spacecraft">unmanned probes</a>. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched <a href="Luna%2015">Luna 15</a>, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in <a href="Mare%20Crisium">Mare Crisium</a> about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The <a href="Jodrell%20Bank%20Observatory">Jodrell Bank Observatory</a> radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.

The Command Module "Columbia" was displayed at the <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a> (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central "Milestones of Flight" exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the <a href="Wright%20Flyer">Wright Flyer</a>, the "<a href="Spirit%20of%20St.%20Louis">Spirit of St. Louis</a>", the <a href="Bell%20X-1">Bell X-1</a>, the <a href="North%20American%20X-15">North American X-15</a>, <a href="Project%20Mercury">Mercury</a> spacecraft "<a href="Friendship%207">Friendship 7</a>", and <a href="Gemini%204">Gemini 4</a>. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's "Apollo to the Moon" exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's <a href="Steven%20F.%20Udvar-Hazy%20Center">Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center</a> annex near <a href="Washington%20Dulles%20International%20Airport">Washington Dulles International Airport</a> in Chantilly, Virginia.

In 2009, the <a href="Lunar%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.

In March 2012 a team of specialists financed by <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a> founder <a href="Jeff%20Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> located the <a href="F-1%20%28rocket%20engine%29">F-1 engines</a> that launched Apollo 11 into space. The engines were found below the Atlantic Ocean's surface through the use of advanced sonar scanning. His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from the Apollo 11 launch.
"Columbia" was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the <a href="Steven%20F.%20Udvar-Hazy%20Center">Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center</a> in Chantilly, VA, to be readied for a four-city tour titled "Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission". This will include <a href="Space%20Center%20Houston">Space Center Houston</a> (October 14, 2017, to March 18, 2018), the <a href="Saint%20Louis%20Science%20Center">Saint Louis Science Center</a> (April 14 to September 3, 2018), the Senator John <a href="Heinz%20History%20Center">Heinz History Center</a> in Pittsburgh (September 29, 2018, to February 18, 2019), and the Seattle <a href="Museum%20of%20Flight">Museum of Flight</a> (March 16 to September 2, 2019).

On July 15, 2009, <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life.com</a> released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by "Life" photographer <a href="Ralph%20Morse">Ralph Morse</a> prior to the Apollo 11 launch.

From July 16–24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.
In addition, it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments.

On July 20, 2009, the crew of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> at the White House. "We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin", Obama said. "We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey."

The <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Presidential%20Library%20and%20Museum">John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum</a> set up a <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a> website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.

A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:

It was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken ... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today ... The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date ... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts – Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.

On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Sen. <a href="Bill%20Nelson%20%28politician%29">Bill Nelson</a> and Florida Rep. <a href="Alan%20Grayson">Alan Grayson</a>.

In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronised and released for the first time.

Apollo 8

Apollo 8, the second <a href="human%20spaceflight">human spaceflight</a> mission in the United States <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo space program</a>, was launched on December 21, 1968, and became the first crewed <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a> to leave <a href="Earth">Earth</a> <a href="orbit">orbit</a>, reach the Earth's <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, orbit it and return safely to Earth. The three-<a href="astronaut">astronaut</a> crew — Commander <a href="Frank%20Borman">Frank Borman</a>, Command Module Pilot <a href="Jim%20Lovell">James Lovell</a>, and Lunar Module Pilot <a href="William%20Anders">William Anders</a> — became the first humans to: travel beyond <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a>; escape Earth's gravity; see Earth as a whole planet; enter the gravity well of another celestial body (Earth's moon); orbit another celestial body (Earth's moon); directly see the <a href="far%20side%20of%20the%20Moon">far side of the Moon</a> with their own eyes; witness an <a href="Earthrise">Earthrise</a>; escape the gravity of another celestial body (Earth's moon); and re-enter the gravitational well of Earth. The 1968 mission, the third flight of the <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rocket and that rocket's first crewed launch, was also the first human spaceflight launch from the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a>, Florida, located adjacent to <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station">Cape Canaveral Air Force Station</a>.

Originally planned as a second <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a>/<a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command Module</a> test in an elliptical <a href="medium%20Earth%20orbit">medium Earth orbit</a> in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious Command Module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December, because the Lunar Module was not yet ready to make its first flight. This meant Borman's crew was scheduled to fly two to three months sooner than originally planned, leaving them a shorter time for training and preparation, thus placing more demands than usual on their time and discipline.

Apollo 8 took three days to travel to the Moon. It orbited ten times over the course of 20 hours, during which the crew made a Christmas Eve <a href="Apollo%20TV%20camera">television broadcast</a> where they <a href="Apollo%208%20Genesis%20reading">read the first 10 verses from</a> the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>. At the time, the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever. Apollo 8's successful mission paved the way for <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> to fulfill U.S. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. The Apollo 8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their spacecraft splashed down in the Northern Pacific Ocean. The crew was named <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a>'s "Men of the Year" for 1968 upon their return.

Lovell was originally the CMP on the back-up crew, with <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a> as the prime crew's CMP. However, Collins was replaced in July 1968, after suffering a <a href="intervertebral%20disc">cervical</a> <a href="Spinal%20disc%20herniation">disc herniation</a> that required surgery to repair.

This crew was unique among pre-shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew, as Lovell had flown twice before, on <a href="Gemini%207">Gemini VII</a> and <a href="Gemini%2012">Gemini XII</a>. This was also the first case of the rarity of an astronaut who had commanded a spaceflight mission subsequently flying as a non-commander, as Lovell had previously commanded Gemini XII.

On a lunar mission, the Command Module Pilot (CMP) was assigned the role of <a href="Celestial%20navigation">navigator</a>, while the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was assigned the role of <a href="flight%20engineer">flight engineer</a>, responsible for monitoring all spacecraft systems, even if the flight didn't include a Lunar Module.

<a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin</a> was originally the backup LMP. When Lovell was rotated to the prime crew, no one with experience on <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">CSM</a>-103 (the specific spacecraft used for the mission) was available, so Aldrin was moved to CMP and <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred Haise</a> brought in as backup LMP. Neil Armstrong went on to command Apollo 11, where Aldrin was returned to the LMP position and Collins was assigned as CMP. Haise was rotated out of the crew and onto the backup crew of Apollo 11 as LMP.

The Earth-based mission control teams for Apollo 8 consisted of astronauts assigned to the support crew, as well as non-astronaut flight directors and their staffs. The support crew members were not trained to fly the mission, but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning, while the prime and backup crews trained. They also served as <a href="Flight%20controller%23Capsule%20Communicator%20%28CAPCOM%29">CAPCOMs</a> during the mission. For Apollo 8, these crew members included astronauts <a href="John%20S.%20Bull">John S. Bull</a>, <a href="Vance%20D.%20Brand">Vance D. Brand</a>, <a href="Gerald%20P.%20Carr">Gerald P. Carr</a>, and <a href="Ken%20Mattingly">Ken Mattingly</a>. The mission control teams on Earth rotated in three shifts, each led by a flight director. The directors for Apollo 8 included Clifford E. Charlesworth (Green team), <a href="Glynn%20Lunney">Glynn Lunney</a> (Black team), and <a href="Milton%20Windler">Milton Windler</a> (Maroon team).

The triangular shape of the insignia symbolizes the shape of the Apollo Command Module (CM). It shows a red figure-8 looping around the Earth and Moon representing the mission number as well as the circumlunar nature of the mission. On the red number 8 are the names of the three astronauts.

The initial design of the insignia was developed by Jim Lovell. Lovell reportedly sketched the initial design while riding in the backseat of a <a href="Northrop%20T-38%20Talon">T-38</a> flight from <a href="California">California</a> to <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, shortly after learning of the re-designation of the flight to become a lunar-orbital mission. The graphic design of the insignia was done by Houston artist and animator William Bradley.

<a href="Apollo%204">Apollo 4</a> and <a href="Apollo%206">Apollo 6</a> had been "A" missions, unmanned tests of the Saturn V launch vehicle using an unmanned Block I production model of the Apollo Command and Service Module in Earth orbit. , scheduled for October 1968, would be a manned Earth-orbit flight of the CSM, completing the objectives for Mission "C".
Further missions depended on the readiness of the Lunar Module. Apollo 8 was planned as the "D" mission, to test the LM in a low Earth orbit in December 1968 by <a href="James%20McDivitt">James McDivitt</a>, <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a> and <a href="Rusty%20Schweickart">Russell Schweickart</a>, while Borman's crew would fly the "E" mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo 9, in early 1969.

But production of the LM fell behind schedule, and when Apollo 8's LM arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in June 1968, significant defects were discovered, leading <a href="Grumman">Grumman</a>, the lead contractor for the LM, to predict that the first mission-ready LM would not be ready until at least February 1969. This would mean delaying the "D" and subsequent missions, endangering the program's goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969.

<a href="George%20Low">George Low</a>, the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August to keep the program on track despite the LM delay. Since the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command/Service Module</a> (CSM) would be ready three months before the Lunar Module, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968. Instead of just repeating the "C" mission flight of Apollo 7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit. The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have to wait until <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a>, the scheduled "F" mission. This also meant that the medium Earth orbit "E" mission could be dispensed with. The net result was that only the "D" mission had to be delayed.
Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing both confidence in the hardware and personnel, and the potential for a significant morale boost provided by a circumlunar flight. The only person who needed some convincing was <a href="James%20E.%20Webb">James E. Webb</a>, the NASA administrator. With the rest of his agency in support of the new mission, Webb eventually approved the mission change. The mission was officially changed from a "D" mission to a "C-Prime" lunar-orbit mission, but was still referred to in press releases as an Earth-orbit mission at Webb's direction. No public announcement was made about the change in mission until November 12, three weeks after Apollo 7's successful Earth-orbit mission and less than 40 days before launch.

With the change in mission for Apollo 8, Director of Flight Crew Operations <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a> decided to swap the crews of the D and E missions. This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft, requiring Borman's crew to use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104.

On September 9, the crew entered the <a href="Space%20simulator">simulators</a> to begin their preparation for the flight. By the time the mission flew, the crew had spent seven hours training for every actual hour of flight. Although all crew members were trained in all aspects of the mission, it was necessary to specialize. Borman, as commander, was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the <a href="Atmospheric%20entry">re-entry</a>. Lovell was trained on <a href="Celestial%20navigation">navigating</a> the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the Earth. Anders was placed in charge of checking that the spacecraft was in working order.

Added pressure on the Apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s flight of some living creatures, including <a href="Russian%20tortoise">Russian tortoise</a>s, in a <a href="cislunar">cislunar</a> loop around the Moon on <a href="Zond%205">Zond 5</a> and return to Earth on September 21. There was speculation within NASA and the press that they might be preparing to launch <a href="astronaut%23Russian">cosmonauts</a> on a similar <a href="Zond%20program%23Circumlunar%20missions">circumlunar mission</a> before the end of 1968.

The Apollo 8 crew, now living in the crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center, received a visit from <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> and his wife, <a href="Anne%20Morrow%20Lindbergh">Anne Morrow Lindbergh</a>, the night before the launch. They talked about how, before his <a href="Spirit%20of%20St.%20Louis">1927 flight</a>, Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from New York City to Paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight. The total was a tenth of the amount that the Saturn V would burn every second. The next day, the Lindberghs watched the launch of Apollo 8 from a nearby dune.

The Saturn V rocket used by Apollo 8 was designated SA-503, or the "03rd" model of the Saturn V ("5") Rocket to be used in the Saturn-Apollo ("SA") program. When it was erected in the <a href="Vehicle%20Assembly%20Building">Vertical Assembly Building</a> on December 20, 1967, it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned Earth-orbit test flight carrying a <a href="Boilerplate%20%28spaceflight%29">boilerplate</a> Command/Service Module. Apollo 6 had suffered several major problems during its April 1968 flight, including severe <a href="pogo%20oscillation">pogo oscillation</a> during its first stage, two second stage engine failures, and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit. Without assurances that these problems had been rectified, NASA administrators could not justify risking a manned mission until additional unmanned test flights proved that the Saturn V was ready.

Teams from the <a href="Marshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Marshall Space Flight Center</a> (MSFC) went to work on the problems. Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation, which would not only hamper engine performance, but could exert significant g-forces on a crew. A task force of contractors, NASA agency representatives, and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated, causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket. A system using helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed.

Of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight. Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two. When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine—a faulty igniter line. The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.

The teams tested their solutions in August 1968 at the Marshall Space Flight Center. A Saturn stage IC was equipped with shock absorbing devices to demonstrate the team's solution to the problem of pogo oscillation, while a Saturn Stage II was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions. Once NASA administrators were convinced that the problems were solved, they gave their approval for a manned mission using SA-503.

The Apollo 8 spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on September 21 and the rocket made the slow 3-mile (5 km) journey to the launch pad on October 9. Testing continued all through December until the day before launch, including various levels of readiness testing from December 5 through 11. Final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation, ruptured fuel lines, and bad igniter lines took place on December 18, a mere three days before the scheduled launch.

As the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body, Apollo 8's profile had two different sets of orbital parameters, separated by a translunar injection maneuver.

Apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal circular Earth parking orbit. Apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an <a href="apogee">apogee</a> of and a <a href="perigee">perigee</a> of , with an <a href="inclination">inclination</a> of 32.51° to the <a href="Equator">Equator</a>, and an <a href="orbital%20period">orbital period</a> of 88.19 minutes. Propellant venting increased the apogee by over the 2 hours, 44 minutes and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit.

This was followed by a <a href="Trans-lunar%20injection">Trans-Lunar Injection</a> (TLI) burn of the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third stage for 318 seconds, accelerating the spacecraft from an orbital velocity of to the injection velocity of , which set a record for the highest speed, relative to Earth, that humans had ever traveled. This speed was slightly less than the Earth's <a href="escape%20velocity">escape velocity</a> of , but put Apollo 8 into an elongated elliptical Earth orbit, to a point where the Moon's gravity would capture it.

The standard lunar orbit for Apollo missions was planned as a nominal circular orbit above the Moon's surface. Initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a <a href="perilune">perilune</a> of and an <a href="apolune">apolune</a> of , at an inclination of 12° from the lunar equator. This was then circularized at by , with an orbital period of 128.7 minutes. The effect of lunar <a href="mass%20concentration%20%28astronomy%29">mass concentrations</a> ("masscons") on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted; over the course of the twenty-hour mission, the orbit was perturbated to by .

Apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from Earth of .

Apollo 8 launched at 7:51:00 a.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Eastern Standard Time</a> on December 21, 1968, using the Saturn V's <a href="Multistage%20rocket">three stages</a> to achieve Earth orbit. The <a href="S-IC">S-IC</a> first stage impacted the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> at and the <a href="S-II">S-II</a> second stage at . The <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third stage injected the craft into Earth orbit, but remained attached to later perform the <a href="trans-lunar%20injection">trans-lunar injection</a> (TLI) burn that put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon.

The <a href="Titan%20II">Titan II</a> launch vehicle used for the <a href="Project%20Gemini">Gemini program</a> had been notoriously rough-riding, and technicians promised the astronauts that the Saturn V, which was designed for the Apollo program rather than adapted from a missile, would have a much smoother ride. Lovell and Borman, both Gemini veterans, found this promise did not disappoint. During liftoff, they reported feeling nothing but a dull, muted rumble in the distance.

Once the <a href="space%20vehicle">vehicle</a> reached Earth orbit, both the crew and <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center">Houston</a> <a href="flight%20controller">flight controller</a>s spent the next 2 hours and 38 minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for TLI. The proper operation of the S-IVB third stage of the rocket was crucial: in the last unmanned test, it had failed to re-ignite for TLI.

During the flight, three fellow astronauts served on the ground as <a href="Flight%20controller%23Capsule%20Communicator%20%28CAPCOM%29">Capsule Communicator</a>s (usually referred to as "CAPCOMs") on a rotating schedule. The CAPCOMs were the only people who regularly communicated with the crew. Michael Collins was the first CAPCOM on duty and at 2 hours, 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch radioed, "Apollo 8. You are Go for TLI." This communication signified that Mission Control had given official permission for Apollo 8 to go to the Moon. Over the next 12 minutes before the TLI burn, the Apollo 8 crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the S-IVB. The engine ignited on time and performed the TLI burn perfectly.

After the S-IVB had performed its required tasks, it was jettisoned. The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it. As the crew rotated the spacecraft, they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it. This marked the first time humans could view the whole Earth at once. Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the Command/Service Module and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver. Mission Control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the <a href="Apollo%20CSM%23Reaction%20Control%20System">Reaction Control System</a> (RCS) thrusters on the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Module%20%28SM%29">Service Module</a> (SM) to add away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB. After discussion, the crew and Mission Control decided to burn in this direction, but at instead. These discussions put the crew an hour behind their flight plan.

Five hours after launch, Mission Control sent a command to the S-IVB booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change the booster's trajectory. This S-IVB would then pass the Moon and enter into a solar orbit, posing no further hazard to Apollo 8. The S-IVB subsequently went into a solar orbit with an <a href="inclination">inclination</a> of 23.47° from the <a href="Ecliptic">plane of the ecliptic</a>, and an orbital period of 340.80 days. After the <a href="translunar%20injection">insertion</a> into trans-Lunar orbit, the <a href="S-IVB">Saturn IVB</a> <a href="third%20stage">third stage</a> became a <a href="space%20debris">object</a>. It will continue to <a href="heliocentric%20orbit">orbit the Sun</a> for many years.

The Apollo 8 crew were the first humans to pass through the <a href="Van%20Allen%20radiation%20belt">Van Allen radiation belt</a>s, which extend up to from Earth. Scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecraft's high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>, or 1 <a href="Gray%20%28unit%29">milligray</a> (during a year, the average human receives a dose of 2 to 3 mGy). To record the actual radiation dosages, each crew member wore a Personal Radiation <a href="Dosimeter">Dosimeter</a> that transmitted data to Earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew. By the end of the mission, the crew experienced an average radiation dose of 1.6 mGy.

Jim Lovell's main job as Command Module Pilot was as <a href="flight%20officer">navigator</a>. Although Mission Control performed all the actual navigation calculations, it was necessary to have a crew member serving as navigator so that the crew could return to Earth in case of loss of communication with Mission Control. Lovell navigated by star sightings using a <a href="sextant">sextant</a> built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) <a href="horizon">horizon</a>. This task was difficult, because a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft, formed by the venting S-IVB, made it hard to distinguish the stars.

By seven hours into the mission, the crew was about one hour and 40 minutes behind flight plan, because of the problems in moving away from the S-IVB and Lovell's obscured star sightings. The crew now placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), also called "barbecue roll", in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft. In direct sunlight, the spacecraft could be heated to over while the parts in shadow would be . These temperatures could cause the <a href="atmospheric%20reentry%23Thermal%20protection%20systems">heat shield</a> to crack and propellant lines to burst. Because it was impossible to get a perfect roll, the spacecraft swept out a <a href="Conical%20surface">cone</a> as it rotated. The crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger.

The first mid-course correction came 11 hours into the flight. Testing on the ground had shown that the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Propulsion%20System">Service Propulsion System</a> (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its <a href="combustion%20chamber">combustion chamber</a> was "coated" first. Burning the engine for a short period would accomplish coating. This first correction burn was only 2.4 seconds and added about velocity <a href="Retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion">prograde</a> (in the direction of travel). This change was less than the planned , because of a bubble of <a href="helium">helium</a> in the <a href="nitrogen%20tetroxide">oxidizer</a> lines, which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure. The crew had to use the small RCS thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled because the Apollo 8 trajectory was found to be perfect.

Eleven hours into the flight, the crew had been awake for more than 16 hours. Before launch, NASA had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise. Borman started the first sleep shift, but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises.

About an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman obtained permission from <a href="flight%20controller">ground control</a> to take a <a href="Secobarbital">Seconal</a> <a href="Barbiturate">sleeping pill</a>. The pill had little effect. Borman eventually fell asleep, and then awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea; this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces, which the crew cleaned up as well as they could. Borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed. After recording a description of Borman's illness they asked Mission Control to check the recording, stating that they "would like an evaluation of the voice comments".

The Apollo 8 crew and Mission Control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second-floor control room (there were two identical control rooms in Houston, on the second and third floors, only one of which was used during a mission). The conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that Borman's illness was either a <a href="Gastroenteritis">24-hour flu</a>, as Borman thought, or a reaction to the sleeping pill. Researchers now believe that he was suffering from <a href="Space%20adaptation%20syndrome">space-adaptation syndrome</a>, which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their <a href="Labyrinth%20%28inner%20ear%29">vestibular system</a> adapts to <a href="weightlessness">weightlessness</a>. Space-adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft (<a href="Project%20Mercury">Mercury</a> and <a href="Project%20Gemini">Gemini</a>), because those astronauts couldn't move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft. The increased cabin space in the Apollo Command Module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement, contributing to symptoms of space sickness for Borman and, later, astronaut Russell Schweickart during <a href="Apollo%209">Apollo 9</a>.

The cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight, except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course. During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch. The Apollo 8 crew used a 2 kg camera that broadcast in <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> only, using a <a href="Video%20camera%20tube">Vidicon</a> tube. The camera had two <a href="lens%20%28optics%29">lenses</a>, a very <a href="wide-angle%20lens">wide-angle (160°) lens</a>, and a <a href="telephoto%20lens">telephoto (9°) lens</a>.

During this first broadcast, the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared from space. However, difficulties aiming the narrow-angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible. Additionally, the Earth image became saturated by any bright source without proper <a href="Optical%20filter">filters</a>. In the end, all the crew could show the people watching back on Earth was a bright blob. After broadcasting for 17 minutes, the rotation of the spacecraft took the <a href="high-gain%20antenna">high-gain antenna</a> out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday.

By this time, the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts. Lovell went to sleep 32½ hours into the flight—3½ hours before he had planned to. A short while later, Anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill.

The crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise. Two factors made the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft: three of the five windows fogging up due to out-gassed oils from the <a href="silicone">silicone</a> <a href="sealant">sealant</a>, and the <a href="Orientation%20%28geometry%29">attitude</a> required for the PTC. It was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.

Apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight. This time, the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the telephoto lens. Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth. The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth and what was visible and the colors they could see. The transmission lasted 23 minutes.

At about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight, the crew of Apollo 8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body. In other words, the effect of the Moon's <a href="Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">gravitational force</a> on Apollo 8 became stronger than that of the Earth. At the time it happened, Apollo 8 was from the Moon and had a speed of relative to the Moon. This historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their <a href="trajectory">trajectory</a> with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. They would continue to do so until they performed their last mid-course correction, switching to a <a href="Frame%20of%20reference">reference frame</a> based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit. It was only 13 hours until they would be in lunar orbit.

The last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) was a second mid-course correction. It was in <a href="Retrograde%20and%20direct%20motion">retrograde</a> (against direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by , effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon. At exactly 61 hours after launch, about from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11 seconds. They would now pass from the <a href="Geology%20of%20the%20Moon%23Lunar%20landscape">lunar surface</a>.

At 64 hours into the flight, the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion-1 (LOI-1). This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to <a href="orbital%20mechanics">orbital mechanics</a> had to be on the far side of the Moon, out of contact with the Earth. After Mission Control was polled for a "<a href="Launch%20status%20check">go/no go</a>" decision, the crew was told at 68 hours, they were Go and "riding the best bird we can find". Lovell replied, "We'll see you on the other side", and for the first time in history, humans travelled behind the Moon and out of radio contact with the Earth.

With 10 minutes before the LOI-1, the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place. At that time, they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon. They had been flying over the unlit side, and it was Lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight <a href="wiktionary%3Aoblique">oblique</a>ly illuminating the lunar surface. The LOI burn was only two minutes away, so the crew had little time to appreciate the view.

The SPS ignited at 69 hours, 8 minutes, and 16 seconds after launch and burned for 4 minutes and 7 seconds, placing the Apollo 8 spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. The crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives. If the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly <a href="ellipse">elliptical</a> lunar orbit or even flung off into space. If it lasted too long they could have struck the Moon. After making sure the spacecraft was working, they finally had a chance to look at the Moon, which they would orbit for the next 20 hours.

On Earth, Mission Control continued to wait. If the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time, the crew would appear early from behind the Moon. However, this time came and went without Apollo 8 reappearing. Exactly at the calculated moment, the signal was received from the spacecraft, indicating it was in a orbit about the Moon.

After reporting on the status of the spacecraft, Lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like:

Lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over. One of the crew's major tasks was <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> of planned future landing sites on the Moon, especially one in <a href="Mare%20Tranquillitatis">Mare Tranquillitatis</a> that would be the Apollo 11 landing site. The launch time of Apollo 8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site. A <a href="film%20camera">film camera</a> had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record a frame every second of the Moon below. Bill Anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest. By the end of the mission the crew had taken 700 photographs of the Moon and 150 of the Earth.

Throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with Earth, Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked. He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary. He also asked that they receive a "go/no go" decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit.

As they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon, the crew set up the equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface. Anders described the craters that they were passing over. At the end of this second orbit they performed the 11-second LOI-2 burn of the SPS to circularize the orbit to .

Through the next two orbits, the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon. During the third pass, Borman read a small prayer for his church. He had been scheduled to participate in a service at St. Christopher's <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a> near <a href="Seabrook%2C%20Texas">Seabrook, Texas</a>, but due to the Apollo 8 flight he was unable to. A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Rose, suggested that Borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service.

When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed "Earthrise" for the first time in human history (NASA's <a href="Lunar%20Orbiter%201">Lunar Orbiter 1</a> took the very first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon, on August 23, 1966). Borman saw the Earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon, and then called in excitement to the others, taking a black-and-white photograph as he did so. In the ensuing scramble Anders took "<a href="Earthrise">Earthrise</a>", a more famous color photo, later picked by "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century.

Due to the <a href="tidal%20locking">synchronous rotation</a> of the Moon about the Earth, Earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface. Earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the Moon, other than at selected places near the Moon's <a href="lunar%20limb">limb</a>, where <a href="libration">libration</a> carries the Earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon.

Anders continued to take photographs while Lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so Borman could rest. Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman was able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status. Borman awoke fully, however, when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good night's sleep in over three days. He ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. At first Anders protested saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. At last Anders agreed as long as Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert. For the next two orbits Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm. On subsequent Apollo missions, crews would avoid this situation by sleeping on the same schedule.
As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the second television transmission began. Borman introduced the crew, followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon. Borman described it as being "a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing". Then, after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. Each man on board <a href="Apollo%208%20Genesis%20reading">read a section from the Biblical creation story</a> from the Book of Genesis. Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth. His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit. Borman said, "And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you—all of you on the good Earth."

The only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the <a href="Trans-Earth%20injection">Trans-Earth Injection</a> (TEI), which was scheduled for 2½ hours after the end of the television transmission. The TEI was the most critical burn of the flight, as any failure of the SPS to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit, with little hope of escape. As with the previous burn, the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the Moon, out of contact with Earth.

The burn occurred exactly on time. The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the Moon at 89 hours, 28 minutes, and 39 seconds, the exact time calculated. When voice contact was regained, Lovell announced, "Please be informed, there is a <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a>", to which Ken Mattingly, the current CAPCOM, replied, "That's affirmative, you are the best ones to know." The spacecraft began its journey back to Earth on December 25, <a href="Christmas%20Day">Christmas Day</a>.

Later, Lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings, maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard. However, he accidentally erased some of the computer's memory, which caused the <a href="Apollo%20PGNCS%23Inertial%20Measurement%20Unit">Inertial Measurement Unit</a> (IMU) to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift-off and fire the thrusters to "correct" the module's attitude.

Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module's attitude, they realized they would have to re-enter data that would tell the computer its real position. It took Lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers, using the thrusters to get the stars <a href="Rigel">Rigel</a> and <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> aligned, and another 15 minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer.

Sixteen months later, Lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re-alignment, under more critical conditions, during the <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> mission, after that module's IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy. In his 1994 book, "<a href="Lost%20Moon">Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13</a>", Lovell wrote, "My training [on Apollo 8] came in handy!" In that book he dismissed the incident as a "planned experiment", requested by the ground crew. In subsequent interviews Lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident, caused by his mistake.

The cruise back to Earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft. As long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly, the spacecraft would re-enter two-and-half days after TEI and <a href="splashdown%20%28spacecraft%20landing%29">splashdown</a> in the Pacific.

On Christmas afternoon, the crew made their fifth television broadcast. This time they gave a tour of the spacecraft, showing how an astronaut lived in space. When they finished broadcasting they found a small present from Deke Slayton in the food locker: a real turkey dinner with stuffing, in the same kind of pack that the troops in Vietnam received. Another Slayton surprise was a gift of three <a href="Miniature%20%28alcohol%29">miniature bottles</a> of <a href="brandy">brandy</a>, that Borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed. They remained unopened, even years after the flight. There were also small presents to the crew from their wives. The next day, at about 124 hours into the mission, the sixth and final TV transmission showed the mission's best video images of the earth, in a four-minute broadcast.
After two uneventful days the crew prepared for re-entry. The computer would control the re-entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude, blunt end forward. If the computer broke down, Borman would take over.

Once the Command Module was separated from the Service Module, the astronauts were committed to re-entry. Six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere, the crew saw the Moon rising above the Earth's horizon, just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists. As they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing <a href="Plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> formed around the spacecraft. The spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at 6 g (59 m/s). With the computer controlling the descent by changing the <a href="Flight%20dynamics%20%28fixed-wing%20aircraft%29">attitude</a> of the spacecraft, Apollo 8 rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean. At the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at by the three main parachutes. The spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as in the North Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii.

When it hit the water, the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down, in what was termed Stable 2 position. About six minutes later the Command Module was righted into its normal apex-up splashdown orientation by the inflatable bag uprighting system. As they were buffeted by a swell, Borman was sick, waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft. It was 43 minutes after splashdown before the first <a href="frogman">frogman</a> from arrived, as the spacecraft had landed before sunrise. Forty-five minutes later, the crew was safe on the deck of the aircraft carrier.

Apollo 8 came at the end of 1968, a year that had seen much upheaval in the United States and most of the world. Even though the year saw political assassinations, political unrest in the streets of Europe and America, and the <a href="Prague%20Spring">Prague Spring</a>, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine chose the crew of Apollo 8 as its <a href="Time%20Person%20of%20the%20Year">Men of the Year</a> for 1968, recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year. They had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the Earth and orbit another celestial body. They had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty-fifty chance of fully succeeding. The effect of Apollo 8 can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger, received by Borman after the mission, that simply stated, "Thank you Apollo 8. You saved 1968."

One of the most famous aspects of the flight was the <a href="Earthrise">Earthrise</a> picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the Moon. This was the first time that humans had taken such a picture whilst actually behind the camera, and it has been credited with a role in inspiring the first <a href="Earth%20Day">Earth Day</a> in 1970. It was selected as the first of "Life" magazine's "100 Photographs That Changed the World". Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins said, "Eight's momentous historic significance was foremost"; while many space historians, such as Robert K. Poole, see Apollo 8 as the most historically significant of all the Apollo missions.

The mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first American orbital flight, <a href="Mercury-Atlas%206">Mercury-Atlas 6</a> by <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a> in 1962. There were 1200 journalists covering the mission, with the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> coverage being broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages. The Soviet newspaper "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>" featured a quote from Boris Nikolaevich Petrov, Chairman of the Soviet <a href="Interkosmos">Interkosmos</a> program, who described the flight as an "outstanding achievement of American space sciences and technology". It is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw—either live or delayed—the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon. The Apollo 8 broadcasts won an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>, the highest honor given by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Television Arts & Sciences</a>.

<a href="Madalyn%20Murray%20O%27Hair">Madalyn Murray O'Hair</a>, an <a href="Atheism">atheist</a>, later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against NASA over the reading from Genesis. O'Hair wished the courts to ban American astronauts—who were all government employees—from public prayer in space. Though the case was rejected by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> for lack of jurisdiction, it caused NASA to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the Apollo program. Buzz Aldrin, on Apollo 11, self-communicated <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> <a href="Eucharist">Communion</a> on the surface of the Moon after landing; he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years, and only obliquely referred to it at the time.

In 1969, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> issued a postage stamp (<a href="Scott%20catalogue">Scott catalogue</a> #1371) commemorating the Apollo 8 flight around the Moon. The stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the <a href="Earthrise">Earthrise</a> over the Moon taken by Anders on Christmas Eve, and the words, "In the beginning God ..." Just 18 days after the crew's return to Earth, they were featured during the <a href="Super%20Bowl%20III">1969 Super Bowl</a> pre-game show reciting the <a href="Pledge%20of%20Allegiance">Pledge of Allegiance</a> prior to the <a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a> being performed by <a href="Anita%20Bryant">Anita Bryant</a>.

In January 1970, the spacecraft was delivered to <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a>, Japan, for display in the U.S. pavilion at <a href="Expo%20%2770">Expo '70</a>. It is now displayed at the Chicago <a href="Museum%20of%20Science%20and%20Industry%20%28Chicago%29">Museum of Science and Industry</a>, along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by Lovell and the <a href="space%20suit">space suit</a> worn by Frank Borman. Jim Lovell's Apollo 8 space suit is on public display in the Visitor Center at NASA's <a href="Glenn%20Research%20Center">Glenn Research Center</a>. Bill Anders's space suit is on display at the <a href="Science%20Museum%20%28London%29">Science Museum</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, United Kingdom.

Apollo 8's historic mission has been shown and referred to in several forms, both documentary and fiction. The various television transmissions and <a href="16%20mm%20film">16 mm</a> footage shot by the crew of Apollo 8 was compiled and released by NASA in the 1969 documentary, "Debrief: Apollo 8", which was hosted by <a href="Burgess%20Meredith">Burgess Meredith</a>. In addition, Spacecraft Films released, in 2003, a three-disc DVD set containing all of NASA's TV and 16 mm film footage related to the mission including all TV transmissions from space, training and launch footage, and motion pictures taken in flight. Portions of the Apollo 8 mission can be seen in the 1989 documentary "<a href="For%20All%20Mankind">For All Mankind</a>", which won the <a href="List%20of%20Sundance%20Film%20Festival%20award%20winners">Grand Jury Prize Documentary</a> at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. The television series "<a href="American%20Experience">American Experience</a>" aired a documentary, "Race to the Moon", in 2005 during <a href="American%20Experience%20%28season%2018%29">season 18</a>. The Apollo 8 mission was well-covered in the 2007 British documentary "<a href="In%20the%20Shadow%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28film%29">In the Shadow of the Moon</a>".

Portions of the Apollo 8 mission are dramatized in the 1998 miniseries "<a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon%20%28miniseries%29">From the Earth to the Moon</a>" episode <a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon%20%28miniseries%29%23Episodes">"1968"</a>. The S-IVB stage of Apollo 8 was also portrayed as the location of an alien device in the 1970 "<a href="UFO%20%28TV%20series%29">UFO</a>" episode "Conflict".

The Apollo 8 mission was also featured in the Discovery channel's 6-part documentary series "" (Part 3, "Landing the Eagle"). All three astronauts were featured in this documentary, telling the story of their historic mission to the Moon in their own words.

Astronaut

An astronaut or cosmonaut () is a person trained by a <a href="List%20of%20human%20spaceflight%20programs">human spaceflight program</a> to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a>. Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.

Starting in the 1950s up to 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With the suborbital flight of the privately funded <a href="SpaceShipOne">SpaceShipOne</a> in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the <a href="commercial%20astronaut">commercial astronaut</a>.

The criteria for what constitutes <a href="human%20spaceflight">human spaceflight</a> vary. The <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20A%C3%A9ronautique%20Internationale">Fédération Aéronautique Internationale</a> (FAI) Sporting Code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed an <a href="K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n%20line">altitude of</a>. In the United States, professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of are awarded <a href="Astronaut%20Badge">astronaut wings</a>.

, a total of 552 people from <a href="Timeline%20of%20space%20travel%20by%20nationality">36 countries</a> have reached or more in altitude, of which 549 reached <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a> or beyond.
Of these, <a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20astronauts">24 people</a> have traveled beyond low Earth orbit, to either lunar orbit, the lunar surface, or in one case a loop around the Moon; three of the 24 did so twice: <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>, <a href="John%20Watts%20Young">John Young</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Cernan">Eugene Cernan</a>. The three astronauts who have not reached low Earth orbit are <a href="spaceplane">spaceplane</a> pilots <a href="Joseph%20A.%20Walker">Joe Walker</a>, <a href="Mike%20Melvill">Mike Melvill</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Binnie">Brian Binnie</a>.

, under the U.S. definition 558 people qualify as having reached space, above altitude. Of eight <a href="X-15">X-15</a> pilots who exceeded in altitude, only one exceeded 100 kilometers (about 62 miles).
Space travelers have spent over 41,790 <a href="Man%20hour">man-days</a> (114.5 man-years) in space, including over 100 astronaut-days of <a href="extravehicular%20activity">spacewalks</a>. As of 2016, the man with the longest cumulative time in space is <a href="Gennady%20Padalka">Gennady Padalka</a>, who has spent 879 days in space. <a href="Peggy%20Whitson">Peggy A. Whitson</a> holds the record for the most time in space by a woman, 377 days.

In 1959, when both the United States and <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> were planning, but had yet to launch humans into space, <a href="NASA">NASA</a> Administrator <a href="T.%20Keith%20Glennan">T. Keith Glennan</a> and his Deputy Administrator, Dr. <a href="Hugh%20Latimer%20Dryden">Hugh Dryden</a>, discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called "astronauts" or "cosmonauts". Dryden preferred "cosmonaut", on the grounds that flights would occur in the "cosmos" (near space), while the "astro" prefix suggested flight to the stars. Most NASA <a href="Space%20Task%20Group">Space Task Group</a> members preferred "astronaut", which survived by common usage as the preferred American term. When the Soviet Union launched the first man into space, <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a> in 1961, they chose a term which <a href="Anglicization">anglicizes</a> to "cosmonaut".

In English-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an "astronaut". The term derives from the Greek words "ástron" (ἄστρον), meaning "star", and "nautes" (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". The first known use of the term "astronaut" in the modern sense was by <a href="Neil%20R.%20Jones">Neil R. Jones</a> in his short story "The Death's Head Meteor" in 1930. The word itself had been known earlier. For example, in <a href="Percy%20Greg">Percy Greg</a>'s 1880 book "Across the Zodiac", "astronaut" referred to a spacecraft. In "Les Navigateurs de l'Infini" (1925) of <a href="J.-H.%20Rosny%20a%C3%AEn%C3%A9">J.-H. Rosny aîné</a>, the word "astronautique" (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by "aeronaut", an older term for an air traveler first applied (in 1784) to <a href="balloon%20%28aircraft%29">balloon</a>ists. An early use in a non-fiction publication is <a href="Eric%20Frank%20Russell">Eric Frank Russell</a>'s poem "The Astronaut" in the November 1934 "Bulletin of the <a href="British%20Interplanetary%20Society">British Interplanetary Society</a>".

The first known formal use of the term <a href="astronautics">astronautics</a> in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual <a href="International%20Astronautical%20Congress">International Astronautical Congress</a> in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the <a href="International%20Astronautical%20Federation">International Astronautical Federation</a> the following year.

<a href="NASA">NASA</a> applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond. NASA also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Corps">Astronaut Corps</a>. The European Space Agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its <a href="European%20Astronaut%20Corps">Astronaut Corps</a>.

By convention, an astronaut employed by the <a href="Russian%20Federal%20Space%20Agency">Russian Federal Space Agency</a> (or its <a href="Soviet%20space%20program">Soviet</a> predecessor) is called a "cosmonaut" in English texts. The word is an anglicisation of the Russian word "kosmonavt" ( ), one who works in space outside the Earth's atmosphere, a space traveler, which derives from the Greek words "kosmos" (κόσμος), meaning "universe", and "nautes" (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". Other countries of the former <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> use variations of the Russian word "kosmonavt", such as the <a href="Poland">Polish</a> "kosmonauta".

Coinage of the term "kosmonavt" has been credited to Soviet aeronautics pioneer <a href="Mikhail%20Tikhonravov">Mikhail Tikhonravov</a> (1900–1974). The first cosmonaut was <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a> pilot <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>, also the first person in space. <a href="Valentina%20Tereshkova">Valentina Tereshkova</a>, a Russian factory worker, was the first woman in space, as well as the first civilian among the Soviet cosmonaut or NASA astronaut corps to make a spaceflight. On March 14, 1995, <a href="Norman%20Thagard">Norman Thagard</a> became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, and thus became the first "American cosmonaut".

Official English-language texts issued by the government of <a href="China">China</a> use "astronaut" while texts in Russian use космонавт ("cosmonaut"). In official Chinese-language texts, "yǔ háng yuán" (, "space navigating personnel") is used for astronauts and cosmonauts, and "háng tiān yuán" (, "space navigating personnel") is used for Chinese astronauts. The phrase "tài kōng rén" (, "spaceman") is often used in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>.

The term "taikonaut" is used by some English-language news media organizations for professional <a href="Chinese%20space%20program">space travelers from China</a>. The word has featured in the <a href="Longman">Longman</a> and <a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English</a> dictionaries, the latter of which describes it as "a hybrid of the Chinese term "taikong" (space) and the Greek "naut" (sailor)"; the term became more common in 2003 when China sent its first astronaut <a href="Yang%20Liwei">Yang Liwei</a> into space aboard the "<a href="Shenzhou%205">Shenzhou 5</a>" spacecraft. This is the term used by <a href="Xinhua%20News%20Agency">Xinhua News Agency</a> in the English version of the Chinese "<a href="People%27s%20Daily">People's Daily</a>" since the advent of the Chinese space program. The origin of the term is unclear; as early as May 1998, Chiew Lee Yih () from <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, used it in <a href="newsgroup">newsgroup</a>s.

With the rise of <a href="space%20tourism">space tourism</a>, <a href="NASA">NASA</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Federal%20Space%20Agency">Russian Federal Space Agency</a> agreed to use the term "<a href="spaceflight%20participant">spaceflight participant</a>" to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies.

While no nation other than the Russian Federation (and previously the former Soviet Union), the United States, and China have launched a manned spacecraft, several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries. Inspired partly by these missions, other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage. For example, the term "spationaut" (French spelling: "spationaute") is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "spatium" for "space", the <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> term "angkasawan" was used to describe participants in the <a href="Angkasawan%20program">Angkasawan program</a>, and the <a href="Indian%20Space%20Research%20Organisation">Indian Space Research Organisation</a> hope to launch a <a href="ISRO%20Orbital%20Vehicle">spacecraft</a> in 2018 that would carry "<a href="Indian%20human%20spaceflight%20programme%23Terminology">vyomanauts</a>", coined from the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word for space.

The first human in space was Soviet <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>, who was launched on April 12, 1961, aboard <a href="Vostok%201">Vostok 1</a> and orbited around the Earth for 108 minutes. The first woman in space was Soviet <a href="Valentina%20Tereshkova">Valentina Tereshkova</a>, who launched on June 16, 1963, aboard <a href="Vostok%206">Vostok 6</a> and orbited Earth for almost three days.

<a href="Alan%20Shepard">Alan Shepard</a> became the first American and second person in space on May 5, 1961, on a 15-minute sub-orbital flight. The first American to orbit the Earth was <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a>, aboard <a href="Friendship%207">Friendship 7</a> on February 20, 1962. The first American woman in space was <a href="Sally%20Ride">Sally Ride</a>, during <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger">Space Shuttle Challenger</a>'s mission <a href="STS-7">STS-7</a>, on June 18, 1983. In 1992 <a href="Mae%20Jemison">Mae Jemison</a> became the first African American woman to travel in space aboard <a href="STS-47">STS-47</a>.

Cosmonaut <a href="Alexei%20Leonov">Alexei Leonov</a> was the first person to conduct an <a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activity</a> (EVA), (commonly called a "spacewalk"), on March 18, 1965, on the Soviet Union's Voskhod 2 mission. This was followed two and a half months later by astronaut <a href="Edward%20Higgins%20White">Ed White</a> who made the first American EVA on NASA's Gemini 4 mission.

The first manned mission to orbit the Moon, "<a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a>", included American <a href="William%20Anders">William Anders</a> who was born in Hong Kong, making him the first Asian-born astronaut in 1968.

The Soviet Union, through its <a href="Intercosmos">Intercosmos</a> program, allowed people from other "<a href="socialism">socialist</a>" (i.e. <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> and other Soviet-allied) countries to fly on its missions, with the notable exception of <a href="France">France</a> participating in <a href="Soyuz%20TM-7">Soyuz TM-7</a>. An example is <a href="Czechoslovak">Czechoslovak</a> <a href="Vladim%C3%ADr%20Remek">Vladimír Remek</a>, the first cosmonaut from a country other than the <a href="Soviet%20space%20program">Soviet Union</a> or the <a href="NASA">United States</a>, who flew to space in 1978 on a <a href="Soyuz-U">Soyuz-U</a> rocket.

On July 23, 1980, <a href="Pham%20Tuan">Pham Tuan</a> of <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> became the first <a href="Asian%20people">Asian</a> in space when he flew aboard <a href="Soyuz%2037">Soyuz 37</a>. Also in 1980, <a href="Cubans">Cuban</a> <a href="Arnaldo%20Tamayo%20M%C3%A9ndez">Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez</a> became the first person of <a href="Hispanic">Hispanic</a> and black African descent to fly in space, and in 1983, <a href="Guion%20Bluford">Guion Bluford</a> became the first African American to fly into space. In April 1985, <a href="Taylor%20Wang">Taylor Wang</a> became the first ethnic Chinese person in space. The first person born in Africa to fly in space was <a href="Patrick%20Baudry">Patrick Baudry</a> (France), in 1985. In 1985, <a href="Saudi%20arabia">Saudi Arabian</a> <a href="Sultan%20Salman%20al-Saud">Prince Sultan Bin Salman Bin AbdulAziz Al-Saud</a> became the first Arab Muslim astronaut in space. In 1988, <a href="Abdul%20Ahad%20Mohmand">Abdul Ahad Mohmand</a> became the first <a href="Afghanistan">Afghan</a> to reach space, spending nine days aboard the <a href="Mir">Mir</a> space station.

With the larger number of seats available on the Space Shuttle, the U.S. began taking international astronauts. In 1983, <a href="Ulf%20Merbold">Ulf Merbold</a> of West Germany became the first non-US citizen to fly in a US spacecraft. In 1984, <a href="Marc%20Garneau">Marc Garneau</a> became the first of 8 <a href="Canadian%20astronauts">Canadian astronauts</a> to fly in space (through 2010).
In 1985, <a href="Rodolfo%20Neri%20Vela">Rodolfo Neri Vela</a> became the first Mexican-born person in space. In 1991, <a href="Helen%20Sharman">Helen Sharman</a> became the first Briton to fly in space.
In 2002, <a href="Mark%20Shuttleworth">Mark Shuttleworth</a> became the first citizen of an African country to fly in space, as a paying spaceflight participant. In 2003, <a href="Ilan%20Ramon">Ilan Ramon</a> became the first Israeli to fly in space, although he died during a <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster">re-entry accident</a>.

On October 15, 2003, <a href="Yang%20Liwei">Yang Liwei</a> became China's first astronaut on the <a href="Shenzhou%205">Shenzhou 5</a> spacecraft.

The youngest person to fly in space is <a href="Gherman%20Titov">Gherman Titov</a>, who was 25 years old when he flew <a href="Vostok%202">Vostok 2</a>. (Titov was also the first person to suffer <a href="space%20sickness">space sickness</a>).
The oldest person who has flown in space is <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a>, who was 77 when he flew on <a href="STS-95">STS-95</a>.

The longest stay in space thus far has been 438 days, by Russian <a href="Valeri%20Polyakov">Valeri Polyakov</a>.
As of 2006, the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven, a record held by both <a href="Jerry%20L.%20Ross">Jerry L. Ross</a> and <a href="Franklin%20Chang-Diaz">Franklin Chang-Diaz</a>. The farthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was , when <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>, <a href="Jack%20Swigert">Jack Swigert</a>, and <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred Haise</a> went around the Moon during the <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> emergency.

The first civilian in space was <a href="Valentina%20Tereshkova">Valentina Tereshkova</a> aboard <a href="Vostok%206">Vostok 6</a> (she also became the first woman in space on that mission).
Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the USSR's Air Force, which had no female pilots whatsoever at that time. A month later, <a href="Joseph%20Albert%20Walker">Joseph Albert Walker</a> became the first American civilian in space when his <a href="X-15%20Flight%2090">X-15 Flight 90</a> crossed the line, qualifying him by the international definition of spaceflight. Walker had joined the US Army Air Force but was not a member during his flight. 
The first people in space who had never been a member of any country's armed forces were both <a href="Konstantin%20Feoktistov">Konstantin Feoktistov</a> and <a href="Boris%20Yegorov">Boris Yegorov</a> aboard <a href="Voskhod%201">Voskhod 1</a>.

The first non-governmental space traveler was <a href="Byron%20K.%20Lichtenberg">Byron K. Lichtenberg</a>, a researcher from the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> who flew on <a href="STS-9">STS-9</a> in 1983. In December 1990, <a href="Toyohiro%20Akiyama">Toyohiro Akiyama</a> became the first paying space traveler as a reporter for <a href="Tokyo%20Broadcasting%20System">Tokyo Broadcasting System</a>, a visit to <a href="Mir">Mir</a> as part of an estimated $12 million (<a href="USD">USD</a>) deal with a Japanese TV station, although at the time, the term used to refer to Akiyama was "Research Cosmonaut". Akiyama suffered severe <a href="space%20adaptation%20syndrome">space sickness</a> during his mission, which affected his productivity.

The first self-funded <a href="space%20tourist">space tourist</a> was <a href="Dennis%20Tito">Dennis Tito</a> on board the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TM-3 on April 28, 2001.

The first person to fly on an entirely privately funded mission was <a href="Mike%20Melvill">Mike Melvill</a>, piloting <a href="SpaceShipOne%20flight%2015P">SpaceShipOne flight 15P</a> on a suborbital journey, although he was a <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a> employed by <a href="Scaled%20Composites">Scaled Composites</a> and not an actual paying space tourist. Seven others have paid the <a href="Russian%20Space%20Agency">Russian Space Agency</a> to fly into space:


The first NASA astronauts were selected for training in 1959. Early in the space program, military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at NASA, although neither John Glenn nor Scott Carpenter (of the <a href="Mercury%20Seven">Mercury Seven</a>) had any university degree, in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection. Selection was initially limited to military pilots. The earliest astronauts for both America and the USSR tended to be <a href="fighter%20aircraft">jet fighter</a> pilots, and were often test pilots.

Once selected, NASA astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas, including training for <a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activity</a> in a facility such as NASA's <a href="Neutral%20Buoyancy%20Laboratory">Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory</a>. Astronauts-in-training may also experience short periods of <a href="weightlessness">weightlessness</a> in aircraft called the "<a href="vomit%20comet">vomit comet</a>", the nickname given to a pair of modified <a href="KC-135">KC-135</a>s (retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively, and replaced in 2005 with a <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20C-9">C-9</a>) which perform <a href="Parabola">parabolic</a> flights. Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft. This is mostly done in <a href="T-38%20Talon">T-38 jet aircraft</a> out of <a href="Ellington%20Field">Ellington Field</a>, due to its proximity to the <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Johnson Space Center</a>. Ellington Field is also where the <a href="Shuttle%20Training%20Aircraft">Shuttle Training Aircraft</a> is maintained and developed, although most flights of the aircraft are done out of <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Edwards Air Force Base</a>.




<a href="Educator%20Astronaut%20Project">Mission Specialist Educators</a>, or "Educator Astronauts", were first selected in 2004, and as of 2007, there are three NASA Educator astronauts: <a href="Joseph%20M.%20Acaba">Joseph M. Acaba</a>, <a href="Richard%20R.%20Arnold">Richard R. Arnold</a>, and <a href="Dorothy%20Metcalf-Lindenburger">Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger</a>.
<a href="Barbara%20Morgan">Barbara Morgan</a>, selected as back-up teacher to <a href="Christa%20McAuliffe">Christa McAuliffe</a> in 1985, is considered to be the first Educator astronaut by the media, but she trained as a mission specialist.
The Educator Astronaut program is a successor to the <a href="Teacher%20in%20Space">Teacher in Space</a> program from the 1980s.

Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including <a href="decompression%20sickness">decompression sickness</a>, <a href="barotrauma">barotrauma</a>, immunodeficiencies, loss of bone and muscle, loss of eyesight, <a href="orthostatic%20intolerance">orthostatic intolerance</a>, sleep disturbances, and radiation injury. A variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the National Space and Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) to address these issues. Prominent among these is the <a href="Advanced%20Diagnostic%20Ultrasound%20in%20Microgravity">Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity</a> Study in which astronauts (including former ISS commanders <a href="Leroy%20Chiao">Leroy Chiao</a> and <a href="Gennady%20Padalka">Gennady Padalka</a>) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.

A 2006 Space Shuttle experiment found that "<a href="Salmonella%20typhimurium">Salmonella typhimurium</a>", a bacterium that can cause <a href="food%20poisoning">food poisoning</a>, became more virulent when cultivated in space. More recently, in 2017, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> were found to be more resistant to <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s and to thrive in the near-weightlessness of space. <a href="Microorganism">Microorganism</a>s have been observed to survive the <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a> of outer space.

On December 31, 2012, a <a href="NASA">NASA</a>-supported study reported that <a href="manned%20spaceflight">manned spaceflight</a> may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

In October 2015, the <a href="NASA%20Office%20of%20Inspector%20General">NASA Office of Inspector General</a> issued a <a href="Effect%20of%20spaceflight%20on%20the%20human%20body">health hazards report</a> related to <a href="human%20space%20exploration">space exploration</a>, including a <a href="human%20mission%20to%20Mars">human mission to Mars</a>.

Over the last decade, flight surgeons and scientists at NASA have seen a pattern of vision problems in astronauts on long-duration space missions. The syndrome, known as visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), has been reported in nearly two-thirds of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

An astronaut on the International Space Station requires about 0.83 kilograms (1.83 pounds) weight of food inclusive of food packaging per meal each day. (The packaging for each meal weighs around 0.12 kilograms - 0.27 pounds) Longer-duration missions require more food.

Shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes. Five months before flight, menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician. Foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment. Caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure (BEE) formula.
On Earth, the average American uses about 35 gallons (132 liters) of water every day. On board the ISS astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons (11 liters) per day.

In Russia, cosmonauts are awarded <a href="Pilot-Cosmonaut%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation</a> upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Hero of the Russian Federation</a>. This follows the practice established in the USSR where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>.

At NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver <a href="Astronaut%20Badge%23NASA%20Astronaut%20Pins">lapel pin</a>. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin.

A Modest Proposal

A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick, commonly referred to as A Modest Proposal, is a <a href="Satire%23Juvenalian">Juvenalian satirical</a> <a href="essay">essay</a> written and published anonymously by <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a> in 1729. Swift suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical <a href="hyperbole">hyperbole</a> mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> policy toward the <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> in general.

In English writing, the phrase "a modest proposal" is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire.

Swift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then-influential <a href="William%20Petty">William Petty</a> and the <a href="Social%20engineering%20%28political%20science%29">social engineering</a> popular among followers of <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>. These lampoons include <a href="appeal%20to%20authority">appealing to the authority</a> of "a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London" and "the famous <a href="George%20Psalmanazar">Psalmanazar</a>, a native of the island <a href="Taiwan">Formosa</a>" (who had already confessed to "not" being from Formosa in 1706). This essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the English language. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states, "A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a <a href="fricassee">fricassee</a>, or a <a href="ragout">ragout</a>."
In the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by <a href="paralipsis">paralipsis</a>:
George Wittkowsky argued that Swift’s main target in "A Modest Proposal" was not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills. Swift was especially insulted by projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution. A memorable example of these sorts of schemes "involved the idea of running the poor through a <a href="joint-stock%20company">joint-stock company</a>". In response, Swift's "Modest Proposal" was "a burlesque of projects concerning the poor" that were in vogue during the early 18th century.

"A Modest Proposal" also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who "regard people as commodities". In the piece, Swift adopts the "technique of a political arithmetician" to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.

Critics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy. Edmund Wilson argues that statistically "the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defense of crime (arrogated to Marx) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population". Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that "springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake".

Charles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift's specific strategy is twofold, using a "trap" to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, "details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty" but feels emotion solely for members of his own class. Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create "two opposing points of view" that "alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way."

Swift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses "the vocabulary of animal husbandry" to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn "people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound".

Swift uses the proposer's serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, textbook-approved order of argument from Swift's time (which was derived from the Latin rhetorician <a href="Quintilian">Quintilian</a>). The contrast between the "careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme" and "the ridiculousness of the proposal" create a situation in which the reader has "to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan".

Scholars have speculated about which earlier works Swift may have had in mind when he wrote "A Modest Proposal".

James Johnson argued that "A Modest Proposal" was largely influenced and inspired by <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a>'s "<a href="Apologeticus">Apology</a>": a satirical attack against early Roman persecution of Christianity. James William Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations. Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works "A Modest Proposal" and "Apology". In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that "human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human." Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language. In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic "justification by ownership" over the subject of sacrificing children—Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the English mistreatment of the Irish poor.

It has also been argued that "A Modest Proposal" was, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essay "The Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Children" by Swift's rival <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>.

<a href="Bernard%20Mandeville">Bernard Mandeville</a>'s "Modest Defence of Publick Stews" asked to introduce public and state controlled <a href="bordello">bordello</a>s. The 1726 paper acknowledges women's interests andwhile not being a complete satirical texthas been discussed as well as an inspiration for Jonathan Swifts title. Mandeville had become famous with the <a href="The%20Fable%20of%20the%20Bees">Fable of The Bees</a> and deliberations on private vices and public benefits in 1705 already.

John Locke from the First Treatise of Government

"Be it then as Sir Robert says, that Anciently, it was usual for Men to sell and Castrate their Children. Let it be, that they exposed them; Add to it, if you please, for this is still greater Power, "that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them": If this proves a right to do so, we may, by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for there are examples of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have the Principle Aggravation from this, that they cross the main intention of Nature, which willeth the increase of Mankind, and the continuation of the Species in the highest perfection, and the distinction of Families, with the Security of the Marriage Bed, as necessary thereunto" (First Treatise, sec. 59).

Robert Phiddian's article "Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal" focuses on two aspects of "A Modest Proposal": the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satiric voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that "there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody".

While Swift's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of "Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet", argues that to understand the piece fully, it is important to understand the economics of Swift’s time. Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century England. "[I]f one regards the "Modest Proposal" simply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact".

At the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that "people are the riches of the nation", and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less. Furthermore, "in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry". In those times, the "somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity".

Louis A. Landa presents Swift's "A Modest Proposal" as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that "people are the riches of a nation". Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy. The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer. Swift also recognises the implications of such a fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens. Swift however, Landa argues, is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that England was denying Irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity.

"A Modest Proposal" is included in many literature programs as an example of <a href="Satire%23Early%20modern%20western%20satire">early modern western satire</a>. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses. Outside of the realm of English studies, "A Modest Proposal" is a relevant piece included in many comparative and global literature and history courses, as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts, humanities, and even the social sciences.

The essay has been emulated many times. In his book "A Modest Proposal" (1984), evangelical author <a href="Frank%20Schaeffer">Frank Schaeffer</a> emulated Swift's work in social conservative polemic against abortion and <a href="euthanasia">euthanasia</a> in a future <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a> that advocated <a href="recycling">recycling</a> of aborted <a href="embryos">embryos</a> and <a href="fetuses">fetuses</a>, as well as some disabled infants with compound intellectual, physical and physiological difficulties. (Such <a href="Baby%20Doe%20Rules">Baby Doe Rules</a> cases were then a major concern of the <a href="pro-life">pro-life</a> movement of the early 1980s, which viewed selective treatment of those infants as <a href="disability%20discrimination">disability discrimination</a>.) In his book "A Modest Proposal for America" (2013), statistician <a href="Howard%20Friedman">Howard Friedman</a> opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by ultra-conservatives.

A Modest Video Game Proposal is the title of an open letter sent by activist/former attorney <a href="Jack%20Thompson%20%28activist%29">Jack Thompson</a> on October 10, 2005. He proposed that, if someone could "create, manufacture, distribute, and sell a video game in 2006" that allows players to play the scenario he has written, in which the character kills video game developers.

<a href="Hunter%20S.%20Thompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a>'s "<a href="Fear%20and%20Loathing%20in%20America">Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist</a>", which contains hundreds of private letters written by Thompson over the years, contains a letter in which he uses "A Modest Proposal"'s satire technique against the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Thompson writes a letter to a local <a href="Aspen%2C%20Colorado">Aspen</a> newspaper informing them that, on Christmas Eve, he was going to use <a href="napalm">napalm</a> to burn a number of dogs and hopefully any humans they find.

Alkali metal

The alkali metals are a <a href="group%20%28periodic%20table%29">group</a> (column) in the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> consisting of the <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s <a href="lithium">lithium</a> (Li), <a href="sodium">sodium</a> (Na), <a href="potassium">potassium</a> (K), <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a> (Rb), <a href="caesium">caesium</a> (Cs), and <a href="francium">francium</a> (Fr). This group lies in the <a href="s-block">s-block</a> of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an <a href="atomic%20orbital">s-orbital</a>: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide the best example of <a href="periodic%20trends">group trends</a> in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised <a href="homology%20%28chemistry%29">homologous</a> behaviour.

The alkali metals are all shiny, <a href="hardness">soft</a>, highly <a href="reactivity%20%28chemistry%29">reactive</a> metals at <a href="standard%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a> and readily lose their <a href="valence%20electron">outermost electron</a> to form <a href="cation">cation</a>s with <a href="electric%20charge">charge</a> +1. They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to <a href="redox">oxidation</a> by atmospheric moisture and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> (and in the case of lithium, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a> and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals. In the modern <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">IUPAC</a> nomenclature, the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements, excluding <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals. All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.

All of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds: in order of <a href="abundance%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">abundance</a>, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high <a href="radioactivity">radioactivity</a>; francium occurs only in the minutest <a href="trace%20radioisotope">traces</a> in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a>s. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of <a href="ununennium">ununennium</a> (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to <a href="relativistic%20quantum%20chemistry">relativistic effects</a>, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a>s; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.

Most alkali metals have many different applications. One of the best-known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in <a href="atomic%20clock">atomic clock</a>s, of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the <a href="sodium-vapour%20lamp">sodium-vapour lamp</a>, which emits light very efficiently. <a href="Salt">Table salt</a>, or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Sodium and potassium are also <a href="essential%20element">essential element</a>s, having major biological roles as <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>s, and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.

The physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns valence <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a>, which results in weak <a href="metallic%20bonding">metallic bonding</a>. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low <a href="density">densities</a>, <a href="melting%20point">melting</a> and <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a>s, as well as <a href="heat%20of%20sublimation">heats of sublimation</a>, <a href="heat%20of%20vaporization">vaporisation</a>, and <a href="heat%20of%20dissociation">dissociation</a>. They all crystallise in the <a href="body-centered%20cubic">body-centered cubic</a> crystal structure, and have distinctive <a href="flame%20test">flame colours</a> because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic</a> and <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic radii</a>, as well as very high <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal</a> and <a href="electrical%20conductivity">electrical conductivity</a>. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactivity</a>; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.

The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other <a href="group%20%28periodic%20table%29">group</a> are to each other. Indeed, the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic radii</a>; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic radius</a>, decreasing <a href="electronegativity">electronegativity</a>, increasing <a href="Reactivity%20%28chemistry%29">reactivity</a>, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their <a href="density">densities</a> increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their <a href="reduction%20potential">reduction potential</a>s: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li ion has a very high <a href="hydration%20energy">hydration energy</a> in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.

The stable alkali metals are all silver-coloured metals except for caesium, which has a pale golden tint: it is one of only three metals that are clearly coloured (the other two being copper and gold). Additionally, the heavy <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>s <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, <a href="strontium">strontium</a>, and <a href="barium">barium</a>, as well as the divalent <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s <a href="europium">europium</a> and <a href="ytterbium">ytterbium</a>, are pale yellow, though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium. Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation. They all crystallise in the <a href="body-centered%20cubic">body-centered cubic</a> crystal structure, and have distinctive <a href="flame%20test">flame colours</a> because their outer s electron is very easily excited. Indeed, these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble.

All the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, they are usually stored in <a href="mineral%20oil">mineral oil</a> or <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a> (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s to form the <a href="alkali%20metal%20halide">alkali metal halide</a>s, which are white <a href="ionic%20crystal">ionic crystal</a>line compounds that are all <a href="solubility">soluble</a> in water except <a href="lithium%20fluoride">lithium fluoride</a> (<a href="lithium">Li</a><a href="fluorine">F</a>). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly <a href="alkali">alkali</a>ne <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a>s and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if the same number of moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first <a href="ionization%20energy">ionisation energies</a> in their respective periods of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> because of their low <a href="effective%20nuclear%20charge">effective nuclear charge</a> and the ability to attain a <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a> configuration by losing just one <a href="electron">electron</a>. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>s and <a href="phenols">phenols</a>, gaseous <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, and <a href="alkyne">alkyne</a>s, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.

The second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus; thus, they almost always lose a single electron, forming cations. The <a href="alkalide">alkalide</a>s are an exception: they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a −1 oxidation state, which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides, the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form <a href="anion">anion</a>s and were thought to be able to appear in <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a> only as cations. The alkalide anions have filled <a href="s-orbital">s-subshells</a>, which gives them enough stability to exist. All the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides, and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual <a href="stoichiometry">stoichiometry</a> and low <a href="ionization%20potential">ionisation potentials</a>. Alkalides are chemically similar to the <a href="electride">electride</a>s, which are salts with trapped <a href="electron">electron</a>s acting as anions. A particularly striking example of an alkalide is "inverse <a href="sodium%20hydride">sodium hydride</a>", HNa (both ions being <a href="coordination%20complex">complexed</a>), as opposed to the usual sodium hydride, NaH: it is unstable in isolation, due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium, although several derivatives are predicted to be <a href="metastability">metastable</a> or stable.

In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions form <a href="metal%20ions%20in%20aqueous%20solution">aqua ions</a> of the formula [M(HO)], where "n" is the solvation number. Their <a href="coordination%20number">coordination number</a>s and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the <a href="first%20coordination%20sphere">first coordination sphere</a>, also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a <a href="dative%20covalent%20bond">dative covalent bond</a>, with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to <a href="Polarizability">polarise</a> the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity. The solvation number for Li has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the <a href="tetrahedron">tetrahedral</a> [Li(HO)]: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 may be the result of the formation of contact <a href="ion%20pair">ion pair</a>s, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach [Li(HO)] through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an <a href="octahedron">octahedral</a> hexaaqua ion. There are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion, forming the octahedral [Na(HO)] ion. While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions, it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the [K(HO)] and [Rb(HO)] ions, which have the <a href="square%20antiprism">square antiprism</a>atic structure, and that caesium forms the 12-coordinate [Cs(HO)] ion.
The chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small Li cation <a href="chemical%20polarity">polarises</a> <a href="anion">anion</a>s and gives its compounds a more <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent</a> character. Lithium and <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> have a <a href="diagonal%20relationship">diagonal relationship</a> due to their similar atomic radii, so that they show some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable <a href="nitride">nitride</a>, a property common among all the <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>s (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals. In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form <a href="organometallic%20compound">organometallic compound</a>s with significant covalent character (e.g. Li<a href="methyl%20group">Me</a> and MgMe).

Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and <a href="lithium%20hydroxide">lithium hydroxide</a> is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not <a href="deliquescent">deliquescent</a>. Conversely, <a href="lithium%20perchlorate">lithium perchlorate</a> and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li has a high <a href="solvation%20energy">solvation energy</a>. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a>: this allows salts like <a href="lithium%20chloride">lithium chloride</a> and <a href="lithium%20bromide">lithium bromide</a> to be used in <a href="dehumidifier">dehumidifier</a>s and <a href="air-conditioner">air-conditioner</a>s.

Francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high <a href="atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a>, causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making <a href="relativistic%20quantum%20chemistry">relativistic effects</a> more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing <a href="electronegativity">electronegativities</a> and <a href="ionisation%20energy">ionisation energies</a> of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic radius</a> is expected to be abnormally low. Thus, contrary to expectation, caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals, not francium. All known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium, such as the first ionisation energy, electron affinity, and anion polarisability, though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values, ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium. Some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity (47.2 kJ/mol) and the enthalpy of dissociation of the Fr molecule (42.1 kJ/mol). The CsFr molecule is polarised as CsFr, showing that the 7s subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the 6s subshell of caesium. Additionally, francium superoxide (FrO) is expected to have significant covalent character, unlike the other alkali metal superoxides, because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of francium.

All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers; hence, their isotopes must be either <a href="odd%E2%80%93odd%20nuclei">odd–odd</a> (both proton and <a href="neutron%20number">neutron number</a> are odd) or <a href="odd%E2%80%93even%20nuclei">odd–even</a> (<a href="proton%20number">proton number</a> is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a>s, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd <a href="primordial%20nuclide">primordial nuclide</a>s are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to <a href="Semi-empirical%20mass%20formula%23Pairing%20term">nuclear pairing effects</a>.

Due to the great rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a> potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single <a href="beta-decay%20stable%20isobars">beta-stable nuclide</a>, since there is not a difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (<a href="isobar%20%28nuclide%29">isobars</a>) free to <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 <a href="monoisotopic%20element">monoisotopic element</a>s that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. <a href="Beryllium">Beryllium</a> is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.

All of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>: <a href="sodium-22">sodium-22</a> and <a href="sodium-24">sodium-24</a> are <a href="trace%20radioisotope">trace radioisotope</a>s produced <a href="cosmogenic">cosmogenic</a>ally, potassium-40 and <a href="rubidium-87">rubidium-87</a> have very long <a href="half-life">half-lives</a> and thus occur naturally, and all <a href="isotopes%20of%20francium">isotopes of francium</a> are <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a>. Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural long-lived radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. Natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the long-lived radioisotope rubidium-87.

<a href="Caesium-137">Caesium-137</a>, with a half-life of 30.17 years, is one of the two principal <a href="medium-lived%20fission%20product">medium-lived fission product</a>s, along with <a href="strontium-90">strontium-90</a>, which are responsible for most of the <a href="radioactivity">radioactivity</a> of <a href="spent%20nuclear%20fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a> after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the <a href="Chernobyl%20accident">Chernobyl accident</a>. Caesium-137 undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable <a href="barium-137">barium-137</a>. It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation. Caesium-137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay. Caesium-137 has been used as a <a href="Flow%20tracer">tracer</a> in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of <a href="tritium">tritium</a>. Small amounts of <a href="caesium-134">caesium-134</a> and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all <a href="nuclear%20weapon%20test">nuclear weapon test</a>s and some <a href="nuclear%20accident">nuclear accident</a>s, most notably the <a href="Goi%C3%A2nia%20accident">Goiânia accident</a> and the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the <a href="zone%20of%20alienation">zone of alienation</a> around the <a href="Chernobyl%20nuclear%20power%20plant">Chernobyl nuclear power plant</a>. Its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts, and is taken up by the body, which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium.

The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other <a href="group%20%28periodic%20table%29">group</a> are to each other. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic radius</a>, decreasing <a href="electronegativity">electronegativity</a>, increasing <a href="reactivity%20%28chemistry%29">reactivity</a>, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their <a href="density">densities</a> increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.

The atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group. Because of the <a href="shielding%20effect">shielding effect</a>, when an atom has more than one <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a>, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the <a href="valence%20electron">outermost electron</a> only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the <a href="nuclear%20charge">nuclear charge</a> (which is equal to the <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.

The <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic radii</a> of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a> than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the <a href="effective%20nuclear%20charge">effective nuclear charge</a> has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.

The first ionisation energy of an <a href="chemical%20element">element</a> or <a href="molecule">molecule</a> is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one <a href="mole%20%28unit%29">mole</a> of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a> +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the <a href="nuclear%20charge">nuclear charge</a>, the amount of <a href="shielding%20effect">shielding</a> by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in <a href="main%20group%20element">main group element</a>s. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels. Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases. (This trend is broken in francium due to the <a href="relativistic%20quantum%20chemistry">relativistic</a> stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations. This makes francium's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus, increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium.)

The second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a> and is thus difficult to remove.

The reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group. This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and <a href="atomisation%20energy">atomisation energies</a> of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a>s, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the <a href="metallic%20bond">metallic bond</a> of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in <a href="atomic%20radius">radius</a> and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the <a href="activation%20energy">activation energy</a> of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.

Electronegativity is a <a href="chemical%20property">chemical property</a> that describes the tendency of an <a href="atom">atom</a> or a <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a> to attract <a href="electron">electron</a>s (or <a href="electron%20density">electron density</a>) towards itself. If the bond between <a href="sodium">sodium</a> and <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> in <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a> were <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent</a>, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an <a href="ionic%20bond">ionic bond</a>). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.

Because of the higher electronegativity of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, <a href="lithium%20iodide">lithium iodide</a> (<a href="lithium">Li</a><a href="iodine">I</a>) will dissolve in <a href="organic%20solvent">organic solvent</a>s, a property of most covalent compounds. <a href="Lithium%20fluoride">Lithium fluoride</a> (Li<a href="fluorine">F</a>) is the only <a href="alkali%20halide">alkali halide</a> that is not soluble in water, and <a href="lithium%20hydroxide">lithium hydroxide</a> (Li<a href="hydroxide">OH</a>) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not <a href="deliquescent">deliquescent</a>.

The melting point of a substance is the point where it changes <a href="state%20of%20matter">state</a> from <a href="solid">solid</a> to <a href="liquid">liquid</a> while the boiling point of a substance (in liquid state) is the point where the <a href="vapor%20pressure">vapour pressure</a> of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to <a href="gas">gas</a>. As a metal is heated to its melting point, the <a href="metallic%20bond">metallic bond</a>s keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point. Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group. This is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons. As the atoms increase in size going down the group (because their atomic radius increases), the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil, thus lowering the melting and boiling points. (The increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect.)

The alkali metals all have the same <a href="crystal%20structure">crystal structure</a> (<a href="body-centered%20cubic">body-centred cubic</a>) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at <a href="room%20temperature">room temperature</a>.

The alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds can be described as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, <a href="ionic%20bond">ionic bond</a>ing gives way to <a href="metallic%20bond">metallic bond</a>ing along the series NaCl, NaO, NaS, NaP, NaAs, NaSb, NaBi, Na.

All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water, producing an <a href="aqueous%20solution">aqueous solution</a> of a strongly <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a> alkali metal <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a> and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group: lithium reacts steadily with <a href="effervescence">effervescence</a>, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, of which there are two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.

Recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a <a href="Coulomb%20explosion">Coulomb explosion</a> rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.

The hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give <a href="oligomer">oligomer</a>ic <a href="alkoxide">alkoxide</a>s. They easily react with <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> to form <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a>s or <a href="bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a>s, or with <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> to form <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a>s or <a href="bisulfide">bisulfide</a>s, and may be used to separate <a href="thiol">thiol</a>s from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="tin">tin</a>, and <a href="lead">lead</a> react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. <a href="Silicon%20dioxide">Silicon dioxide</a> is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack <a href="silicate%20glass">silicate glass</a>.

The alkali metals form many <a href="intermetallic%20compound">intermetallic compound</a>s with each other and the elements from groups <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">2</a> to <a href="boron%20group">13</a> in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries, such as the <a href="sodium%20amalgam">sodium amalgam</a>s with <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, including NaHg and NaHg. Some of these have ionic characteristics: taking the alloys with <a href="gold">gold</a>, the most electronegative of metals, as an example, NaAu and KAu are metallic, but RbAu and <a href="caesium%20auride">CsAu</a> are semiconductors. <a href="NaK">NaK</a> is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature, although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air. The <a href="eutectic%20mixture">eutectic mixture</a> melts at −12.6 °C. An alloy of 41% caesium, 47% sodium, and 12% potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy, −78 °C.

The intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements (<a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="gallium">gallium</a>, <a href="indium">indium</a>, and <a href="thallium">thallium</a>), such as NaTl, are poor <a href="Electrical%20conductor">conductors</a> or <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a>s, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the <a href="Zintl%20phase">Zintl anions</a> involved. Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl—) with a covalent <a href="diamond%20cubic">diamond cubic</a> structure with Na ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.

<a href="Boron">Boron</a> is a special case, being the only nonmetal in group 13. The alkali metal <a href="boride">boride</a>s tend to be boron-rich, involving appreciable boron–boron bonding involving <a href="deltahedron">deltahedral</a> structures, and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high <a href="vapour%20pressure">vapour pressure</a> at elevated temperatures. This makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700 °C, and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess. Furthermore, exceptionally in this group, reactivity with boron decreases down the group: lithium reacts completely at 700 °C, but sodium at 900 °C and potassium not until 1200 °C, and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium. Rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised. Various phases are known, such as LiB, NaB, NaB, and KB. Under high pressure the boron–boron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following <a href="polyhedral%20skeletal%20electron%20pair%20theory">Wade's rules</a> to forming Zintl anions like the rest of group 13.

Lithium and sodium react with <a href="carbon">carbon</a> to form <a href="acetylide">acetylide</a>s, LiC and NaC, which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with <a href="acetylene">acetylene</a>. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium react with <a href="graphite">graphite</a>; their atoms are <a href="intercalation%20%28chemistry%29">intercalated</a> between the hexagonal graphite layers, forming <a href="graphite%20intercalation%20compound">graphite intercalation compound</a>s of formulae MC (dark grey, almost black), MC (dark grey, almost black), MC (blue), MC (steel blue), and MC (bronze) (M = K, Rb, or Cs). These compounds are over 200 times more electrically conductive than pure graphite, suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers (e.g. ). Upon heating of KC, the elimination of potassium atoms results in the conversion in sequence to KC, KC, KC and finally KC. KC is a very strong <a href="reducing%20agent">reducing agent</a> and is pyrophoric and explodes on contact with water. While the larger alkali metals (K, Rb, and Cs) initially form MC, the smaller ones initially form MC, and indeed they require reaction of the metals with graphite at high temperatures around 500 °C to form. Apart from this, the alkali metals are such strong reducing agents that they can even reduce <a href="buckminsterfullerene">buckminsterfullerene</a> to produce solid fullerides MC; sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium can form fullerides where "n" = 2, 3, 4, or 6, and rubidium and caesium additionally can achieve "n" = 1.

When the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the <a href="carbon%20group">carbon group</a> (<a href="silicon">silicon</a>, <a href="germanium">germanium</a>, <a href="tin">tin</a>, and <a href="lead">lead</a>), ionic substances with cage-like structures are formed, such as the <a href="silicide">silicide</a>s M<a href="silicon">Si</a> (M = K, Rb, or Cs), which contains M and tetrahedral ions. The chemistry of alkali metal <a href="germanide">germanide</a>s, involving the germanide ion <a href="germanium">Ge</a> and other cluster (<a href="Zintl%20ion">Zintl</a>) ions such as , , , and [(Ge)], is largely analogous to that of the corresponding silicides. Alkali metal <a href="stannide">stannide</a>s are mostly ionic, sometimes with the stannide ion (<a href="tin">Sn</a>), and sometimes with more complex Zintl ions such as , which appears in tetrapotassium nonastannide (KSn). The monatomic <a href="plumbide">plumbide</a> ion (<a href="lead">Pb</a>) is unknown, and indeed its formation is predicted to be energetically unfavourable; alkali metal plumbides have complex Zintl ions, such as . These alkali metal germanides, stannides, and plumbides may be produced by reducing germanium, tin, and lead with sodium metal in liquid ammonia.

Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which reacts with <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> at <a href="standard%20conditions">standard conditions</a>, and its <a href="nitride">nitride</a> is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an <a href="reactivity%20%28chemistry%29">unreactive</a> gas because breaking the strong <a href="triple%20bond">triple bond</a> in the <a href="dinitrogen">dinitrogen</a> molecule (N) requires a lot of energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N and the formation of N ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the <a href="lattice%20energy">lattice energy</a> of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen <a href="exothermic">exothermic</a>, forming <a href="lithium%20nitride">lithium nitride</a>. The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be <a href="endothermic">endothermic</a>, so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions. <a href="Sodium%20nitride">Sodium nitride</a> (NaN) and <a href="potassium%20nitride">potassium nitride</a> (KN), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions. Steric hindrance forbids the existence of rubidium or caesium nitride. However, sodium and potassium form colourless <a href="azide">azide</a> salts involving the linear anion; due to the large size of the alkali metal cations, they are thermally stable enough to be able to melt before decomposing.

All the alkali metals react readily with <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula MPn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a <a href="pnictogen">pnictogen</a> – phosphorus, arsenic, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, or <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>). This is due to the greater size of the P and As ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, and KP. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of NaAs is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula MAs are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some <a href="metallic%20bond">metallic bond</a>ing. The <a href="antimonide">antimonide</a>s are unstable and reactive as the <a href="antimony">Sb</a> ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas <a href="stibine">stibine</a> (SbH). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. <a href="Bismuth">Bismuth</a>ides are not even wholly ionic; they are <a href="intermetallic%20compound">intermetallic compound</a>s containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.

All the alkali metals react vigorously with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> at standard conditions. They form various types of oxides, such as simple <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s (containing the O ion), <a href="peroxide">peroxide</a>s (containing the ion, where there is a <a href="single%20bond">single bond</a> between the two oxygen atoms), <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a>s (containing the ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form <a href="lithium%20oxide">lithium oxide</a>, but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of <a href="sodium%20oxide">sodium oxide</a> and <a href="sodium%20peroxide">sodium peroxide</a>. Potassium forms a mixture of <a href="potassium%20peroxide">potassium peroxide</a> and <a href="potassium%20superoxide">potassium superoxide</a>, while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are <a href="pyrophoric">pyrophoric</a> (spontaneously catch fire in air).

The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.) In addition, the small size of the Li and O ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful <a href="oxidising%20agent">oxidising agent</a>s. <a href="Sodium%20peroxide">Sodium peroxide</a> and <a href="potassium%20superoxide">potassium superoxide</a> react with <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in <a href="submarine">submarine</a> air purifiers; the presence of <a href="water%20vapour">water vapour</a>, naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient. All the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red <a href="ozonide">ozonide</a>s (MO) through low-temperature reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with <a href="ozone">ozone</a>: the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>. They slowly decompose at standard conditions to the superoxides and oxygen, and hydrolyse immediately to the hydroxides when in contact with water. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium also form sesquioxides MO, which may be better considered peroxide disuperoxides, .

Rubidium and caesium can form a great variety of suboxides with the metals in formal oxidation states below +1. Rubidium can form RbO and RbO (copper-coloured) upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the ozonide CsO and several brightly coloured <a href="suboxide">suboxide</a>s, such as CsO (bronze), CsO (red-violet), CsO (violet), CsO (dark green), CsO, CsO, as well as CsO. The last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate CsO.

The alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens (<a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, <a href="tellurium">tellurium</a>, and <a href="polonium">polonium</a>), and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known (with the exception of francium's). Reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides, with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question. For example, sodium can react with sulfur to form the <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a> (<a href="sodium%20sulfide">NaS</a>) and various <a href="polysulfide">polysulfide</a>s with the formula NaS ("x" from 2 to 6), containing the ions. Due to the basicity of the Se and Te ions, the alkali metal <a href="selenide">selenide</a>s and <a href="telluride%20%28chemistry%29">tellurides</a> are alkaline in solution; when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium, alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the and ions. They may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present, and are colourless, water-soluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium. The alkali metal <a href="polonide">polonide</a>s are all ionic compounds containing the Po ion; they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around 300–400 °C.

The alkali metals are among the most <a href="electropositive">electropositive</a> elements on the periodic table and thus tend to <a href="ionic%20bond">bond ionically</a> to the most <a href="electronegative">electronegative</a> elements on the periodic table, the <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s (<a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>, <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, <a href="bromine">bromine</a>, <a href="iodine">iodine</a>, and <a href="astatine">astatine</a>), forming <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a> known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>, otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali metal halides are <a href="solubility">soluble</a> in water except for <a href="lithium%20fluoride">lithium fluoride</a> (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high <a href="lattice%20enthalpy">lattice enthalpy</a>. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li and F ions, causing the <a href="electrostatic%20interaction">electrostatic interaction</a>s between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for <a href="magnesium%20fluoride">magnesium fluoride</a>, consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.

The alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides, where the <a href="hydride">hydride</a> anion acts as a <a href="pseudohalogen">pseudohalide</a>: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a>s. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for <a href="lithium%20cyanide">lithium cyanide</a>, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely. Ternary alkali metal halide oxides, such as NaClO, KBrO (yellow), NaBrO, NaIO, and KBrO, are also known. The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations.

Alkali metal cations do not usually form <a href="coordination%20complex">coordination complex</a>es with simple <a href="Lewis%20base">Lewis base</a>s due to their low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits <a href="coordination%20number">coordination number</a>s from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In <a href="aqueous%20solution">aqueous solution</a>, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes ([M(HO))]), with the exception of the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ([Li(HO))]); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, <a href="anhydrous">anhydrous</a> salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as <a href="desiccant">desiccant</a>s. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with <a href="crown%20ether">crown ether</a>s (e.g. <a href="12-crown-4">12-crown-4</a> for Li, <a href="15-crown-5">15-crown-5</a> for Na, <a href="18-crown-6">18-crown-6</a> for K, and <a href="21-crown-7">21-crown-7</a> for Rb) and <a href="cryptand">cryptand</a>s due to electrostatic attraction.

The alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M and e, which react to form hydrogen gas and the <a href="metal%20amide%23Alkali%20metal%20amides">alkali metal amide</a> (MNH, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a> in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>s <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, <a href="strontium">strontium</a>, <a href="barium">barium</a>, as well as the divalent <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s, <a href="europium">europium</a> and <a href="ytterbium">ytterbium</a>. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of <a href="solvated%20electron">solvated electron</a>s, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), <a href="diatomic%20molecule">diatomic</a> alkali metal molecules (M) and alkali metal anions (M). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful <a href="reducing%20agent">reducing agent</a>s and are often used in chemical synthesis.

Being the smallest alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable <a href="organometallic%20compound">organometallic compound</a>s, which are bonded covalently. <a href="Organolithium%20reagent">Organolithium</a> compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, and tend to form <a href="oligomer">oligomer</a>s with the structure (RLi) where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the <a href="charge%20density">charge density</a> of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a <a href="carbanion">carbanion</a>, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">bases</a> and <a href="carbon%20nucleophile">nucleophiles</a>. For use as bases, <a href="butyllithium">butyllithium</a>s are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is <a href="methyllithium">methyllithium</a> ((CHLi)), which exists in tetrameric ("x" = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric ("x" = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially "n"-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, as might be expected given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which plays an important role in the <a href="Grignard%20reaction">Grignard reaction</a>. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a>s and <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s by reaction with metal <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a>s. The reaction with <a href="nickel%20tetracarbonyl">nickel tetracarbonyl</a>, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes <a href="electrophilic%20substitution">electrophilic substitution</a> to give the desired aldehyde (using H as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.

Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also react with "N","N"-disubstituted <a href="amide">amide</a>s to give aldehydes and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>. They thermally decompose to eliminate a β-hydrogen, producing <a href="alkene">alkene</a>s and <a href="lithium%20hydride">lithium hydride</a>: another route is the reaction of <a href="ether">ether</a>s with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s (ArCOH) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'C(Ar)OH). Finally, they may be used to synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.

Unlike the organolithium compounds, the organometallic compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of <a href="organosodium%20chemistry">organosodium</a> compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from <a href="organolithium%20compound">organolithium compound</a>s, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is <a href="sodium%20cyclopentadienide">sodium cyclopentadienide</a>. <a href="Sodium%20tetraphenylborate">Sodium tetraphenylborate</a> can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is <a href="Schlosser%27s%20base">Schlosser's base</a>, a mixture of <a href="n-Butyllithium">"n"-butyllithium</a> and <a href="potassium%20tert-butoxide">potassium "tert"-butoxide</a>. This reagent reacts with <a href="propene">propene</a> to form the compound <a href="allylpotassium">allylpotassium</a> (KCHCHCH). <a href="cis-2-butene">"cis"-2-Butene</a> and <a href="trans-2-butene">"trans"-2-butene</a> equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas <a href="isomerisation">isomerisation</a> is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the <a href="steric%20hindrance">sterically</a> congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.

Alkyl and aryl derivatives of sodium and potassium tend to react with air. They cause the cleavage of <a href="ether">ether</a>s, generating alkoxides. Unlike alkyllithium compounds, alkylsodiums and alkylpotassiums cannot be made by reacting the metals with alkyl halides because <a href="Wurtz%20coupling">Wurtz coupling</a> occurs:

As such, they have to be made by reacting <a href="organomercury%20compound">alkylmercury</a> compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents. While methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium, methylpotassium is more ionic and has the <a href="nickel%20arsenide">nickel arsenide</a> structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations.

The alkali metals and their hydrides react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example <a href="cyclopentadiene">cyclopentadiene</a>s and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, the most common of which being <a href="tetrahydrofuran">tetrahydrofuran</a>. The most important of these compounds is <a href="sodium%20cyclopentadienide">sodium cyclopentadienide</a>, NaCH, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with <a href="cyclooctatetraene">cyclooctatetraene</a> in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal <a href="cyclooctatetraenide">cyclooctatetraenide</a>s; for example, <a href="dipotassium%20cyclooctatetraenide">dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide</a> (KCH) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as <a href="uranocene">uranocene</a>. The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green <a href="sodium%20naphthalenide">sodium naphthalenide</a>, Na[CH•], a strong reducing agent.

Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered, there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first <a href="period%208%20element">period 8 element</a>, the undiscovered element <a href="ununennium">ununennium</a> (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter <a href="Congener%20%28chemistry%29">congeners</a>; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as <a href="periodic%20trends">periodic trends</a>, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered <a href="reactivity%20%28chemistry%29">reactivity</a> is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the <a href="metallic%20radius">metallic</a> and <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic radii</a>; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's <a href="electron%20affinity">electron affinity</a> far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the <a href="polarisability">polarisability</a> of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0 °C and 30 °C.
The stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240 <a href="picometer">pm</a>, very close to that of rubidium (247 pm), so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>, which is not seen in any other alkali metal, in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected. Indeed, many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large <a href="covalent">covalent</a> character, due to the involvement of the 7p electrons in the bonding.
Not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium. Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 169, unhexennium, under ununennium, Dirac-Fock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element 165, unhexpentium, which is predicted to have the electron configuration [Og] 5 g 6f 7d 8s 8p 9s. Furthermore, this element would be intermediate in properties between an alkali metal and a <a href="group%2011%20element">group 11 element</a>, and while its physical and atomic properties would be closer to the former, its chemistry may be closer to that of the latter. Further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium, having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium, and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium, having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium. However, the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron, possibly allowing oxidation states beyond +1, whence the likely transition metal behaviour of unhexpentium. Due to the alkali and <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>s both being <a href="s-block">s-block</a> elements, these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals <a href="unbinilium">unbinilium</a> (Ubn) and unhexhexium (Uhh).

The probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2015; in fact, it is suspected that they may not be able to exist. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers. Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium stems from the fact that both elements are located close to the expected locations of <a href="island%20of%20stability">islands of stabilities</a>, centered at elements 122 (Ubb) and 164 (Uhq).

Many other substances are similar to the alkali metals in their tendency to form monopositive cations. Analogously to the <a href="pseudohalogen">pseudohalogen</a>s, they have sometimes been called "pseudo-alkali metals". These substances include some elements and many more <a href="polyatomic%20ion">polyatomic ion</a>s; the polyatomic ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power.

The element <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, with one electron per neutral atom, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal; when it is considered to be an alkali metal, it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a <a href="diatomic">diatomic</a> gas consisting of two atoms per <a href="molecule">molecule</a> (H); however, the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules (such as <a href="dilithium">dilithium</a>, Li) at high temperatures, when they are in the <a href="gas">gas</a>eous state.

Hydrogen, like the alkali metals, has one <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a> and reacts easily with the <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s, but the similarities end there because of the small size of a bare proton H compared to the alkali metal cations. Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a>. It is sometimes placed above <a href="carbon">carbon</a> due to their similar electronegativities or <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> due to their similar chemical properties.

The first ionisation energy of hydrogen (1312.0 <a href="kilojoule%20per%20mole">kJ/mol</a>) is much higher than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative <a href="hydride">hydride</a> ion, and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis. (The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as <a href="alkalide">alkalide</a>s, but these are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) An argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic, unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens. The radius of the H anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens: indeed, H is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons. It was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties; while this has been shown to not be the case, under extremely high <a href="pressure">pressure</a>s, such as those found at the cores of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as <a href="metallic%20hydrogen">metallic hydrogen</a>. The <a href="resistivity">electrical resistivity</a> of liquid <a href="metallic%20hydrogen">metallic hydrogen</a> at 3000 K is approximately equal to that of liquid <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a> and <a href="caesium">caesium</a> at 2000 K at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal-to-metal transition.

The 1s electron configuration of hydrogen, while superficially similar to that of the alkali metals (ns), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the <a href="hydron%20%28chemistry%29">hydron</a> H, or gain one to form the <a href="hydride">hydride</a> ion H. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as <a href="ionisation%20energy">ionisation energy</a> and <a href="electron%20affinity">electron affinity</a>, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150 <a href="femtometre">fm</a> compared to the 50–220 pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of <a href="acid-base%20chemistry">acid-base chemistry</a>. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s, which are an effect of charge-transfer, <a href="electrostatic">electrostatic</a>, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).

The <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> ion () has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals, acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium, and is often considered a close relative. For example, most alkali metal <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a> are <a href="solubility">soluble</a> in water, a property which ammonium salts share. Ammonium is expected to behave stably as a metal ( ions in a sea of delocalised electrons) at very high pressures (though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around, 100 <a href="pascal%20%28unit%29">GPa</a>), and could possibly occur inside the <a href="Gas%20giant%23Uranus%20and%20Neptune">ice giants</a> <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>, which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields. It has been estimated that the transition from a mixture of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> and dihydrogen molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below 25 GPa. Under standard conditions, ammonium can form a metallic amalgam with mercury.

Other "pseudo-alkali metals" include the <a href="alkylammonium">alkylammonium</a> cations, in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. In particular, the <a href="quaternary%20ammonium%20cation">quaternary ammonium cation</a>s () are very useful since they are permanently charged, and they are often used as an alternative to the expensive Cs to stabilise very large and very easily polarisable anions such as . Tetraalkylammonium hydroxides, like alkali metal hydroxides, are very strong bases that react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonates. Furthermore, the nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony atom (the heavier nonmetallic <a href="pnictogen">pnictogen</a>s), creating a <a href="phosphonium">phosphonium</a> () or <a href="arsonium">arsonium</a> () cation that can itself be substituted similarly; while <a href="stibonium">stibonium</a> () itself is not known, some of its organic derivatives are characterised.

<a href="Cobaltocene">Cobaltocene</a>, Co(CH), is a <a href="metallocene">metallocene</a>, the <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> analogue of <a href="ferrocene">ferrocene</a>. It is a dark purple solid. Cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons, one more than usually found in organotransition metal complexes, such as its very stable relative, ferrocene, in accordance with the <a href="18-electron%20rule">18-electron rule</a>. This additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the Co–C bonds. Consequently, many chemical reactions of Co(CH) are characterized by its tendency to lose this "extra" electron, yielding a very stable 18-electron cation known as cobaltocenium. Many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts, and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate. Like the alkali metals, cobaltocene is a strong reducing agent, and <a href="decamethylcobaltocene">decamethylcobaltocene</a> is stronger still due to the combined <a href="inductive%20effect">inductive effect</a> of the ten methyl groups. Cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener <a href="rhodium">rhodium</a> to give <a href="rhodocene">rhodocene</a>, an even stronger reducing agent. <a href="Iridocene">Iridocene</a> (involving <a href="iridium">iridium</a>) would presumably be still more potent, but is not very well-studied due to its instability.

<a href="Thallium">Thallium</a> is the heaviest stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At the bottom of the periodic table, the <a href="inert%20pair%20effect">inert pair effect</a> is quite strong, because of the <a href="relativistic%20effects">relativistic</a> stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> closely resemble the corresponding potassium or <a href="silver">silver</a> compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl (164 <a href="picometer">pm</a>), K (152 pm) and Ag (129 pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in <a href="continental%20Europe">continental Europe</a> (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a>'s 1869 <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> and <a href="Julius%20Lothar%20Meyer">Julius Lothar Meyer</a>'s 1868 periodic table. (Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the <a href="boron%20group">boron group</a> and left the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium. While Tl is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are <a href="stereochemistry">stereochemically</a> active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the thallium halides (except <a href="thallium%28I%29%20fluoride">TlF</a>) are quite insoluble in water, and <a href="thallium%28I%29%20iodide">TlI</a> has an unusual structure because of the presence of the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium.

The <a href="group%2011%20element">group 11 metals</a> (or coinage metals), <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="silver">silver</a>, and <a href="gold">gold</a>, are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d-shells. Physically, they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with <a href="post-transition%20metal">post-transition metal</a>s. "The filled "d" subshell and free "s" electron of Cu, Ag, and Au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity. Transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between "s" electrons and the partially filled "d" subshell that lower electron mobility." Chemically, the group 11 metals behave like main-group metals in their +1 valence states, and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals: this is one reason for their previously being labelled as "group IB", paralleling the alkali metals' "group IA". They are occasionally classified as post-transition metals. Their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals. Their monopositive ions are <a href="paramagnetic">paramagnetic</a> and contribute no colour to their salts, like those of the alkali metals.

In Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table, copper, silver, and gold are listed twice, once under group VIII (with the <a href="iron%20triad">iron triad</a> and <a href="platinum%20group%20metal">platinum group metal</a>s), and once under group IB. Group IB was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due to the existence of copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time. However, eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A–B bifurcation. Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.

The coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: ps; group 11: ds). However, the similarities are largely confined to the <a href="stochiometry">stoichiometries</a> of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties. This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals are at the top of the <a href="electrochemical%20series">electrochemical series</a>, whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom. The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a> character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a <a href="pseudohalogen">pseudohalogen</a> because its 5d6s configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d6s configuration of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>.

Sodium compounds have been known since ancient times; salt (<a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>) has been an important commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word "salary", referring to "salarium", money paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. <a href="Georg%20Ernst%20Stahl">Georg Ernst Stahl</a> obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and <a href="Henri%20Louis%20Duhamel%20du%20Monceau">Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau</a> was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.

Pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a>, who derived it from <a href="Potassium%20hydroxide">caustic potash</a> (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented <a href="voltaic%20pile">voltaic pile</a>. Previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium's extreme reactivity. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance <a href="caustic%20soda">caustic soda</a> (NaOH, lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different. Later that year, the first pieces of pure molten sodium metal were similarly prepared by <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a> through the <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of molten <a href="caustic%20soda">caustic soda</a> (now called sodium hydroxide).
<a href="Petalite">Petalite</a> (<a href="Lithium">Li</a><a href="Aluminium">Al</a><a href="Silicon">Si</a><a href="Oxygen">O</a>) was discovered in 1800 by the <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian chemist <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bonif%C3%A1cio%20de%20Andrada">José Bonifácio de Andrada</a> in a mine on the island of <a href="Ut%C3%B6%2C%20Sweden">Utö, Sweden</a>. However, it was not until 1817 that <a href="Johan%20August%20Arfwedson">Johan August Arfwedson</a>, then working in the laboratory of the chemist <a href="J%C3%B6ns%20Jacob%20Berzelius">Jöns Jacob Berzelius</a>, <a href="discovery%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">detected</a> the presence of a new element while analysing petalite ore. This new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though its <a href="lithium%20carbonate">carbonate</a> and <a href="lithium%20hydroxide">hydroxide</a> were less <a href="solubility">soluble in water</a> and more <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">alkaline</a> than the other alkali metals. Berzelius gave the unknown material the name ""lithion"/"lithina"", from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> word "λιθoς" (transliterated as "lithos", meaning "stone"), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium, which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood. He named the metal inside the material ""lithium"". Lithium, sodium, and potassium were part of the discovery of <a href="periodic%20table">periodicity</a>, as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same <a href="group%20%28periodic%20table%29">group</a> that were noted by <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20D%C3%B6bereiner">Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner</a> in 1850 as having similar properties.
Rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the <a href="spectroscope">spectroscope</a>, invented in 1859 by <a href="Robert%20Bunsen">Robert Bunsen</a> and <a href="Gustav%20Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a>. The next year, they discovered caesium in the <a href="mineral%20water">mineral water</a> from <a href="Bad%20D%C3%BCrkheim">Bad Dürkheim</a>, Germany. Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, finding it in the mineral <a href="lepidolite">lepidolite</a>. The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their <a href="emission%20spectrum">emission spectra</a>: a bright red line for rubidium (from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "rubidus", meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue line for caesium (derived from the Latin word "caesius", meaning sky-blue).

Around 1865 <a href="John%20Alexander%20Reina%20Newlands">John Newlands</a> produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the <a href="octave">octave</a>s of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.
After 1869, <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of a group with sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and thallium. Two years later, Mendeleev revised his table, placing hydrogen in group 1 above lithium, and also moving thallium to the <a href="boron%20group">boron group</a>. In this 1871 version, copper, silver, and gold were placed twice, once as part of <a href="group%2011%20element">group IB</a>, and once as part of a "group VIII" encompassing today's groups <a href="group%208%20element">8</a> to 11. After the introduction of the 18-column table, the group IB elements were moved to their current position in the <a href="d-block">d-block</a>, while alkali metals were left in "group IA". Later the group's name was changed to "group 1" in 1988. The <a href="trivial%20name">trivial name</a> "alkali metals" comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group 1 elements are all strong <a href="alkali">alkali</a>s when dissolved in water.

There were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before <a href="Marguerite%20Perey">Marguerite Perey</a> of the <a href="Curie%20Institute%20%28Paris%29">Curie Institute</a> in Paris, France discovered francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of <a href="isotopes%20of%20actinium">actinium-227</a>, which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 <a href="electronvolt">keV</a>. However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure <a href="actinium">actinium</a>-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being <a href="thorium">thorium</a>, <a href="radium">radium</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>, or <a href="thallium">thallium</a>. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure that she later revised to 1%.

The next element below francium (<a href="Mendeleev%27s%20predicted%20elements">eka</a>-francium) in the periodic table would be <a href="ununennium">ununennium</a> (Uue), element 119. The synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of <a href="einsteinium">einsteinium</a>-254 with <a href="calcium">calcium</a>-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California. No atoms were identified, leading to a limiting yield of 300 <a href="barn%20%28unit%29">nb</a>.

It is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium-254, which is favoured for production of <a href="superheavy%20element">ultraheavy elements</a> because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms, to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories, and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of ultraheavy elements. However, given that ununennium is only the first <a href="period%208%20element">period 8 element</a> on the <a href="extended%20periodic%20table">extended periodic table</a>, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions, and indeed attempts to synthesise it in 2019 and 2020 are currently planned at laboratories at Japan and Russia. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, due to <a href="nucleon%20drip%20line">drip instabilities</a>, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number: they would require new, more powerful technology to make.

The <a href="Oddo%E2%80%93Harkins%20rule">Oddo–Harkins rule</a> holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers, with the exception of hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability. All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them (the <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>es and the <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>s) in the Solar System. The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e and not in <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a>. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a> and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a> and <a href="boron">boron</a> due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the <a href="triple-alpha%20process">triple-alpha process</a>, fusing three helium nuclei to form <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, and skipping over those three elements.

The <a href="Earth">Earth</a> formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the <a href="formation%20and%20evolution%20of%20the%20solar%20system">formation and evolution of the solar system</a>. In turn, the <a href="history%20of%20Earth">natural history of the Earth</a> caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98 kg. It is composed mostly of <a href="iron">iron</a> (32.1%), <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> (30.1%), <a href="silicon">silicon</a> (15.1%), <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> (13.9%), <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> (2.9%), <a href="nickel">nickel</a> (1.8%), <a href="calcium">calcium</a> (1.5%), and <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to <a href="planetary%20differentiation">planetary differentiation</a>, the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.

The alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur naturally in pure form in nature. They are <a href="Goldschmidt%20classification">lithophiles</a> and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and so associate strongly with <a href="silica">silica</a>, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also <a href="incompatible%20element">incompatible element</a>s due to their large <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic radii</a>.

Sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth, both being among the ten <a href="abundance%20of%20elements%20in%20Earth%27s%20crust">most common elements in Earth's crust</a>; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s crust measured by weight, making it the <a href="Abundance%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">sixth most abundant element</a> overall and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include <a href="halite">halite</a>, <a href="amphibole">amphibole</a>, <a href="cryolite">cryolite</a>, <a href="nitratine">nitratine</a>, and <a href="zeolite">zeolite</a>. Many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as <a href="Utah">Utah</a>'s <a href="Great%20Salt%20Lake">Great Salt Lake</a> and the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a>. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.

Despite its chemical similarity, lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size. Due to its relatively low reactivity, it can be found in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 <a href="micromolar">micromolar</a>. Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in <a href="ferromagnesium">ferromagnesium</a> minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18 <a href="parts%20per%20million">ppm</a>, comparable to that of <a href="gallium">gallium</a> and <a href="niobium">niobium</a>. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is <a href="spodumene">spodumene</a>, which occurs in large deposits worldwide.

Rubidium is approximately as abundant as <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals <a href="leucite">leucite</a>, <a href="pollucite">pollucite</a>, <a href="carnallite">carnallite</a>, <a href="zinnwaldite">zinnwaldite</a>, and <a href="lepidolite">lepidolite</a>, although none of these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, <a href="tin">tin</a>, and <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>, but is much less abundant than rubidium.

<a href="Isotopes%20of%20francium">Francium-223</a>, the only naturally occurring isotope of francium, is the <a href="decay%20product">product</a> of the <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in <a href="uranium">uranium</a> minerals. In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 10 uranium atoms. It has been calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the <a href="crust%20%28geology%29">earth's crust</a> at any time, due to its extremely short <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 22 minutes.

The production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their <a href="silicate">silicate</a> ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the <a href="aluminium%20hydroxide">hydroxide</a>. The remaining insoluble alkali metal <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a> is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with <a href="calcium%20chloride">calcium chloride</a> typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> or <a href="calcium">calcium</a> for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> for purification.

Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of <a href="mineral%20spring">mineral spring</a>s, <a href="brine">brine</a> pools, and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused <a href="lithium%20chloride">lithium chloride</a> and <a href="potassium%20chloride">potassium chloride</a>.

Sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried <a href="seabed">seabed</a>, but is now produced through <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a> by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700 °C through the use of a <a href="Downs%20cell">Downs cell</a>. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of <a href="sodium%20azide">sodium azide</a>. Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as <a href="sylvite">sylvite</a> (<a href="potassium%20chloride">potassium chloride</a>). Previously, potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of <a href="potassium%20chloride">potassium chloride</a> or <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from <a href="seawater">seawater</a>. However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850 °C.
Although sodium is less reactive than potassium, this process works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can easily be distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.
For several years in the 1950s and 1960s, a by-product of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the <a href="Tanco%20Mine">Tanco Mine</a> in Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from <a href="pollucite">pollucite</a>. Today, a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the <a href="fractional%20crystallization%20%28chemistry%29">fractional crystallisation</a> of a rubidium and caesium <a href="alum">alum</a> (<a href="Caesium">Cs</a>,<a href="Rubidium">Rb</a>)<a href="Aluminium">Al</a>(<a href="Sulfate">SO</a>)·12<a href="Water">HO</a>, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 recrystallisations. The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s per year. Caesium, however, is not produced from the above reaction. Instead, the mining of <a href="pollucite">pollucite</a> ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium, extracted from the ore mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction. Both metals are produced as by-products of lithium production: after 1958, when interest in lithium's thermonuclear properties increased sharply, the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly. Pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with <a href="calcium">calcium</a> metal at 750 °C and low pressure.

As a result of its extreme rarity in nature, most francium is synthesised in the nuclear reaction <a href="Gold">Au</a> + <a href="Oxygen">O</a> → <a href="Francium">Fr</a> + 5 <a href="neutron">n</a>, yielding <a href="francium-209">francium-209</a>, <a href="francium-210">francium-210</a>, and <a href="francium-211">francium-211</a>. The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms, which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above. When the only natural isotope francium-223 is specifically required, it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium-227, itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural radium-226, one of the daughters of natural uranium-238.

Lithium, sodium, and potassium have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts but do not have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in <a href="lithium-ion%20battery">batteries</a>, and <a href="lithium%20oxide">lithium oxide</a> can help process silica. <a href="Lithium%20stearate">Lithium stearate</a> is a thickener and can be used to make lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which is also used to absorb <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> in space capsules and submarines. <a href="Lithium%20chloride">Lithium chloride</a> is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.

Sodium compounds have many applications, the most well-known being sodium chloride as <a href="table%20salt">table salt</a>. Sodium salts of <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s are used as soap. Pure sodium metal also has many applications, including use in <a href="sodium-vapor%20lamp">sodium-vapour lamps</a>, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help smooth the surface of other metals. Being a strong reducing agent, it is often used to reduce many other metals, such as <a href="titanium">titanium</a> and <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange liquid in <a href="fast%20breeder%20nuclear%20reactor">fast breeder nuclear reactor</a>s due to its low melting point, viscosity, and <a href="cross-section%20%28physics%29">cross-section</a> towards neutron absorption.

Potassium compounds are often used as <a href="fertiliser">fertiliser</a>s as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition. <a href="Potassium%20hydroxide">Potassium hydroxide</a> is a very strong base, and is used to control the <a href="pH">pH</a> of various substances. <a href="Potassium%20nitrate">Potassium nitrate</a> and <a href="potassium%20permanganate">potassium permanganate</a> are often used as powerful oxidising agents. <a href="Potassium%20superoxide">Potassium superoxide</a> is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas. Pure potassium metal is not often used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors.

Rubidium and caesium are often used in <a href="atomic%20clock">atomic clock</a>s. Caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate; if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second. Rubidium ions are often used in purple <a href="firework">firework</a>s, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.

Francium has no commercial applications, but because of francium's relatively simple <a href="atomic%20structure">atomic structure</a>, among other things, it has been used in <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a> experiments, leading to more information regarding <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a>s and the <a href="coupling%20constant">coupling constant</a>s between <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels, similar to those predicted by <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum theory</a>.

Pure alkali metals are dangerously reactive with air and water and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, <a href="halocarbon">halocarbon</a>s, <a href="plastic">plastic</a>s, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires. Some Class D dry powder <a href="fire%20extinguisher">extinguishers</a> designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.

Experiments are usually conducted using only small quantities of a few grams in a <a href="fume%20hood">fume hood</a>. Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive <a href="isopropanol">isopropanol</a>. The alkali metals must be stored under <a href="mineral%20oil">mineral oil</a> or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be <a href="argon">argon</a> or nitrogen gas, except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air, even under oil, because even a small amount of air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.

The bioinorganic chemistry of the alkali metal ions has been extensively reviewed.
Solid state crystal structures have been determined for many complexes of alkali metal ions in small peptides, nucleic acid constituents, carbohydrates and ionophore complexes.

Lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. <a href="Lithium%20carbonate">Lithium carbonate</a> is used as a <a href="mood%20stabiliser">mood stabiliser</a> in <a href="psychiatry">psychiatry</a> to treat <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a> (<a href="manic-depression">manic-depression</a>) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2 grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and <a href="poison">poison</a>s the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an <a href="essential%20element">essential</a> <a href="trace%20element">trace element</a>, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.

Sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as <a href="electrolytes">electrolytes</a> inside and outside <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a>. Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and <a href="pH">pH</a>; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. <a href="Sodium%20chloride">Sodium chloride</a> (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for <a href="pickling">pickling</a> and <a href="jerky%20%28food%29">jerky</a>; most of it comes from processed foods. The <a href="Dietary%20Reference%20Intake">Dietary Reference Intake</a> for sodium is 1.5 grams per day, but most people in the United States consume more than 2.3 grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.

Potassium is the major <a href="cation">cation</a> (positive ion) inside <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">animal cells</a>, while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells. The <a href="concentration">concentration</a> differences of these charged particles causes a difference in <a href="electric%20potential">electric potential</a> between the inside and outside of cells, known as the <a href="membrane%20potential">membrane potential</a>. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by <a href="ion%20transporter">ion transporter</a> proteins in the <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>. The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an <a href="action%20potential">action potential</a>—a "spike" of electrical discharge. The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as <a href="neurotransmission">neurotransmission</a>, muscle contraction, and heart function. Disruption of this balance may thus be fatal: for example, ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to <a href="hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</a> strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. Potassium chloride is used in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> for <a href="lethal%20injection">lethal injection</a> executions.
Due to their similar atomic radii, rubidium and caesium in the body mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing <a href="hypokalemia">potassium deficiency</a>. Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70 kg person contains on average 0.36 g of rubidium, and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.

Caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger and is therefore a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to <a href="hypokalemia">hypokalemia</a>, <a href="arrythmia">arrythmia</a>, and acute <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a>, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant. The <a href="median%20lethal%20dose">median lethal dose</a> (LD) value for <a href="caesium%20chloride">caesium chloride</a> in mice is 2.3 g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD values of <a href="potassium%20chloride">potassium chloride</a> and <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.

<a href="Radioisotope">Radioisotope</a>s of caesium require special precautions: the improper handling of caesium-137 <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a> sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of <a href="Goi%C3%A2nia">Goiânia</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing <a href="caesium%20chloride">caesium salt</a> sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with <a href="caesium-134">caesium-134</a>, <a href="iodine-131">iodine-131</a>, and <a href="strontium-90">strontium-90</a>, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a> which constitute the greatest risk to health. Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.

Alphabet

An alphabet is a standard set of <a href="letter%20%28alphabet%29">letters</a> (basic written <a href="symbols">symbols</a> or <a href="graphemes">graphemes</a>) that is used to write one or more <a href="language">language</a>s based upon the general principle that the letters represent <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>s (basic significant sounds) of the <a href="spoken%20language">spoken language</a>. This is in contrast to other types of <a href="writing%20system">writing system</a>s, such as <a href="syllabary">syllabaries</a> (in which each character represents a <a href="syllable">syllable</a>) and <a href="logograph">logograph</a>ies (in which each character represents a word, <a href="morpheme">morpheme</a>, or semantic unit).

The <a href="Proto-Canaanite">Proto-Canaanite</a> script, later known as the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician alphabet</a>, is the first fully phonemic script. Thus the Phoenician alphabet is considered to be the first alphabet. The Phoenician alphabet is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic</a>, <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek</a>, <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin</a>, <a href="Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic</a>, <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a>, and possibly <a href="Brahmic%20scripts">Brahmic</a>. Under a terminological distinction promoted by <a href="Peter%20T.%20Daniels">Peter T. Daniels</a>, an "alphabet" is a script that represents both <a href="vowel">vowel</a>s and <a href="consonant">consonant</a>s as letters equally. In this narrow sense of the word the first "true" alphabet was the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>, which was developed on the basis of the earlier <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician alphabet</a>. In other alphabetic scripts such as the original Phoenician, <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a> or <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic</a>, letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants; such a script is also called an <a href="abjad">abjad</a>. A third type, called <a href="abugida">abugida</a> or alphasyllabary, is one where vowels are shown by <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>s or modifications of consonantal base letters, as in <a href="Devanagari">Devanagari</a> and other South Asian scripts. The <a href="Khmer%20alphabet">Khmer alphabet</a> (for <a href="Cambodian%20language">Cambodian</a>) is the longest, with 74 letters.

There are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular being the <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> (which was derived from the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek</a>). Many languages use modified forms of the Latin alphabet, with additional letters formed using diacritical marks. While most alphabets have letters composed of lines (<a href="linear%20writing">linear writing</a>), there are also <a href="non-linear%20writing">exceptions</a> such as the alphabets used in <a href="Braille">Braille</a>.

Alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters. This makes them useful for purposes of <a href="collation">collation</a>, specifically by allowing words to be sorted in <a href="alphabetical%20order">alphabetical order</a>. It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of "numbering" ordered items, in such contexts as <a href="numbered%20list">numbered list</a>s and number placements.

The English word "alphabet" came into <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> from the <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> word "alphabetum", which in turn originated in the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἀλφάβητος ("alphabētos"). The Greek word was made from the first two letters, "<a href="alpha%20%28letter%29">alpha</a>" and "<a href="beta%20%28letter%29">beta</a>". The names for the Greek letters came from the first two letters of the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician alphabet</a>; "<a href="aleph">aleph</a>", which also meant "ox", and "<a href="bet%20%28letter%29">bet</a>", which also meant "house".

Sometimes, like in the <a href="alphabet%20song">alphabet song</a> in English, the term "ABCs" is used instead of the word "alphabet" ("Now I know my ABCs"...). "Knowing one's ABCs", in general, can be used as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything.

The history of the alphabet started in <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>. Egyptian writing had a set of some <a href="Egyptian%20uniliteral%20signs">24 hieroglyphs</a> that are called uniliterals, to represent syllables that begin with a single <a href="consonant">consonant</a> of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for <a href="logogram">logogram</a>s, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.
In the <a href="Middle%20Bronze%20Age">Middle Bronze Age</a>, an apparently "alphabetic" system known as the <a href="Proto-Sinaitic%20script">Proto-Sinaitic script</a> appears in Egyptian turquoise mines in the <a href="Sinai%20peninsula">Sinai peninsula</a> dated to circa the 15th century BC, apparently left by Canaanite workers. In 1999, John and Deborah Darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at Wadi el-Hol dated to circa 1800 BC and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 BC, strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time. Based on letter appearances and names, it is believed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphs. This script had no characters representing vowels, although originally it probably was a syllabary, but unneeded symbols were discarded. An alphabetic <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a> script with 30 signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in <a href="Ugarit">Ugarit</a> before the 15th century BC. This script was not used after the destruction of Ugarit.

The Proto-Sinaitic script eventually developed into the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician alphabet</a>, which is conventionally called "Proto-Canaanite" before ca. 1050 BC. The oldest text in Phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of King <a href="Ahiram">Ahiram</a>. This script is the parent script of all western alphabets. By the tenth century, two other forms can be distinguished, namely <a href="Canaanite%20language">Canaanite</a> and <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet">Aramaic</a>. The Aramaic gave rise to the <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a> script. The <a href="South%20Arabian%20alphabet">South Arabian alphabet</a>, a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the <a href="Ge%27ez%20alphabet">Ge'ez alphabet</a> (an <a href="abugida">abugida</a>) is descended. Vowelless alphabets, which are not true alphabets, are called <a href="abjad">abjad</a>s, currently exemplified in scripts including <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic</a>, <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a>, and <a href="Syriac%20alphabet">Syriac</a>. The omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory solution and some "weak" consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable (<a href="Mater%20lectionis">matres lectionis</a>). These letters have a dual function since they are also used as pure consonants.

The Proto-Sinaitic or Proto-Canaanite script and the <a href="Ugaritic%20script">Ugaritic script</a> were the first scripts with a limited number of signs, in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time, <a href="Cuneiform">Cuneiform</a>, <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a>, and <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a>. The Phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters, making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn. Another advantage of Phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages, since it recorded words phonemically.

The script was spread by the Phoenicians across the Mediterranean. In Greece, the script was modified to add the vowels, giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the West. The vowels have independent letter forms separate from the consonants, therefore it was the first true alphabet. The Greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in Greek to represent the vowels. The vowels are significant in the Greek language, and the syllabical <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> script that was used by the <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> Greeks from the 16th century BC had 87 symbols including 5 vowels. In its early years, there were many variants of the Greek alphabet, a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it.

The <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>, in its <a href="Euboean%20alphabet">Euboean form</a>, was carried over by Greek colonists to the Italian peninsula, where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the <a href="Italic%20languages">Italic languages</a>. One of these became the <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>, which was spread across Europe as the Romans expanded their empire. Even after the fall of the Roman state, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works. It eventually became used for the descendant languages of Latin (the <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a>) and then for most of the other languages of Europe.

Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with <a href="ligature%20%28typography%29">ligatures</a>, such as <a href="%C3%A6">æ</a> in <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a> and <a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a> and <a href="Ou%20%28letter%29">Ȣ</a> in <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian</a>; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the <a href="thorn%20%28letter%29">thorn</a> þ in <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> and <a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a>, which came from the <a href="Runic%20alphabet">Futhark</a> runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the <a href="Eth%20%28letter%29">eth</a> ð of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modified "d". Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, and <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, which uses the letters "j, k, x, y" and "w" only in foreign words.

Another notable script is <a href="Elder%20Futhark">Elder Futhark</a>, which is believed to have evolved out of one of the <a href="Old%20Italic%20alphabet">Old Italic alphabet</a>s. Elder Futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the <a href="Runic%20alphabet">Runic alphabet</a>s. The Runic alphabets were used for Germanic languages from AD 100 to the late Middle Ages. Its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry, although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood. These alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet, except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century.

The <a href="Old%20Hungarian%20script">Old Hungarian script</a> is a contemporary writing system of the Hungarians. It was in use during the entire history of Hungary, albeit not as an official writing system. From the 19th century it once again became more and more popular.

The <a href="Glagolitic%20alphabet">Glagolitic alphabet</a> was the initial script of the liturgical language <a href="Old%20Church%20Slavonic">Old Church Slavonic</a> and became, together with the Greek uncial script, the basis of the <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic script</a>. Cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts, and is notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. <a href="Cyrillic%20alphabets">Cyrillic alphabets</a> include the <a href="Serbian%20Cyrillic%20alphabet">Serbian</a>, <a href="Macedonian%20alphabet">Macedonian</a>, <a href="Bulgarian%20alphabet">Bulgarian</a>, <a href="Russian%20alphabet">Russian</a>, <a href="Belarusian%20alphabet">Belarusian</a> and <a href="Ukrainian%20alphabet">Ukrainian</a>. The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by <a href="Saints%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius">Saints Cyril and Methodius</a>, while the Cyrillic alphabet was invented by <a href="Clement%20of%20Ohrid">Clement of Ohrid</a>, who was their disciple. They feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> and the <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew alphabet</a>.

The longest European alphabet is the Latin-derived <a href="Slovak%20alphabet">Slovak alphabet</a> which has 46 letters.

Beyond the logographic <a href="Written%20Chinese">Chinese writing</a>, many phonetic scripts are in existence in Asia. The <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a>, <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew alphabet</a>, <a href="Syriac%20alphabet">Syriac alphabet</a>, and other <a href="abjad">abjad</a>s of the Middle East are developments of the <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet">Aramaic alphabet</a>, but because these writing systems are largely <a href="consonant">consonant</a>-based they are often not considered true alphabets.

Most alphabetic scripts of India and Eastern Asia are descended from the <a href="Brahmi%20script">Brahmi script</a>, which is often believed to be a descendant of Aramaic.

In <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, the <a href="Hangul">Hangul</a> alphabet was created by <a href="Sejong%20the%20Great">Sejong the Great</a>. Hangul is a unique alphabet: it is a <a href="featural%20alphabet">featural alphabet</a>, where many of the letters are designed from a sound's place of articulation (P to look like the widened mouth, L to look like the tongue pulled in, etc.); its design was planned by the government of the day; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions, in the same way as <a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese characters</a>, to allow for mixed-script writing (one syllable always takes up one type-space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound-block).

<a href="Zhuyin">Zhuyin</a> (sometimes called "Bopomofo") is a <a href="semi-syllabary">semi-syllabary</a> used to phonetically transcribe <a href="Standard%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a> in the <a href="Taiwan">Republic of China</a>. After the later establishment of the <a href="China">People's Republic of China</a> and its adoption of <a href="Pinyin">Hanyu Pinyin</a>, the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it is still widely used in <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> where the Republic of China still governs. Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Like an alphabet the phonemes of <a href="syllable%20onset">syllable initials</a> are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary the phonemes of the <a href="syllable%20rime">syllable finals</a> are not; rather, each possible final (excluding the <a href="Syllable%20medial">medial glide</a>) is represented by its own symbol. For example, "luan" is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ ("l-u-an"), where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final "-an". While Zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a <a href="romanization">romanization</a> system—that is, for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese characters on computers and cellphones.

European alphabets, especially Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of Asia. Arabic is also widely used, sometimes as an abjad (as with <a href="Urdu%20alphabet">Urdu</a> and <a href="Persian%20alphabet">Persian</a>) and sometimes as a complete alphabet (as with <a href="Kurdish%20alphabet">Kurdish</a> and <a href="Uyghur%20alphabet">Uyghur</a>).

The term "alphabet" is used by <a href="Linguistics">linguists</a> and <a href="paleographer">paleographer</a>s in both a wide and a narrow sense. In the wider sense, an alphabet is a script that is "segmental" at the <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> level—that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish "true" alphabets from two other types of segmental script, <a href="abjad">abjad</a>s and <a href="abugida">abugida</a>s. These three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels: abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed; abugidas are also consonant-based, but indicate vowels with <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>s to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, on the other hand, consonants and vowels are written as independent letters. The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the <a href="Middle%20Bronze%20Age%20alphabets">Wadi el-Hol script</a>, believed to be an abjad, which through its successor <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician</a> is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic</a>, <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek</a>, <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin</a> (via the <a href="Old%20Italic%20alphabet">Old Italic alphabet</a>), <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> (via the Greek alphabet) and <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a> (via <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet">Aramaic</a>).

Examples of present-day abjads are the <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic</a> and <a href="Hebrew%20script">Hebrew script</a>s; true alphabets include <a href="Latin%20script">Latin</a>, Cyrillic, and Korean <a href="hangul">hangul</a>; and abugidas are used to write <a href="tigrinya%20language">Tigrinya</a>, <a href="Amharic%20language">Amharic</a>, <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>, and <a href="Thai%20language">Thai</a>. The <a href="Canadian%20Aboriginal%20syllabics">Canadian Aboriginal syllabics</a> are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply, since each glyph stands for a consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel. (In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph.)

All three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. <a href="Ugaritic%20script">Ugaritic</a>, for example, is basically an abjad, but has syllabic letters for . (These are the only time vowels are indicated.) Cyrillic is basically a true alphabet, but has syllabic letters for (я, е, ю); <a href="Coptic%20alphabet">Coptic</a> has a letter for . <a href="Devanagari">Devanagari</a> is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use अ as a <a href="zero%20consonant">zero consonant</a> as the graphic base for such vowels.

The boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, <a href="Sorani">Sorani</a> <a href="Kurdish%20language">Kurdish</a> is written in the <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic script</a>, which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the <a href="Phagspa%20script">Phagspa script</a> of the <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol Empire</a> was based closely on the <a href="Tibetan%20script">Tibetan abugida</a>, but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short "a" was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the <a href="Ge%27ez%20alphabet">Tigrinya abugida</a> and the <a href="Ge%27ez%20alphabet">Amharic abugida</a> (ironically, the original source of the term "abugida") have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became <a href="logogram">logographic</a>. (See below.)

Thus the primary <a href="Categorisation">classification</a> of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For <a href="Tone%20%28linguistics%29">tonal languages</a>, further classification can be based on their treatment of tone, though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in <a href="Somali%20language">Somali</a> and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for <a href="Vietnamese%20alphabet">Vietnamese</a> (a true alphabet) and <a href="Thai%20alphabet">Thai</a> (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the <a href="Pollard%20script">Pollard script</a>, an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone. More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for <a href="Hmong%20alphabet">Hmong</a> and <a href="Zhuang%20alphabet">Zhuang</a>. For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; in <a href="Zhuyin">Zhuyin</a> not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the <a href="virama">virama</a> of Indic.

The number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small. The Book <a href="Pahlavi%20scripts">Pahlavi</a> script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the <a href="Rotokas%20alphabet">Rotokas alphabet</a> has only twelve letters. (The <a href="Hawaiian%20alphabet">Hawaiian alphabet</a> is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the <a href="%CA%BBOkina">ʻokina</a> and five long vowels. However, <a href="Hawaiian%20Braille">Hawaiian Braille</a> has only 13 letters.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been "conflated"—that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic</a>, another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented "g, d, y, k," or "j". However, such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi <a href="papyrus">papyri</a>, up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is, they had become <a href="logogram">logogram</a>s as in Egyptian <a href="Demotic%20Egyptian">Demotic</a>.

The largest segmental script is probably an abugida, <a href="Devanagari">Devanagari</a>. When written in Devanagari, Vedic <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the "visarga" mark for final aspiration and special letters for "kš" and "jñ," though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the "khutma" letters (letters with a dot added) to represent sounds from Persian and English. Thai has a total of 59 symbols, consisting of 44 consonants, 13 vowels and 2 syllabics, not including 4 diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length.

The largest known abjad is <a href="Sindhi%20language">Sindhi</a>, with 51 letters. The largest alphabets in the narrow sense include <a href="Kabardian%20language">Kabardian</a> and <a href="Abkhaz%20language">Abkhaz</a> (for <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a>), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and <a href="Slovak%20language">Slovak</a> (for the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>), with 46. However, these scripts either count <a href="digraph%20%28orthography%29">di- and tri-graphs</a> as separate letters, as Spanish did with "ch" and "ll" until recently, or uses <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>s like Slovak "č".

The Georgian alphabet ( "") is alphabetical writing system. It is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent with 33 letters. Original Georgian alphabet had 38 letters but 5 letters were removed in 19th century by <a href="Ilia%20Chavchavadze">Ilia Chavchavadze</a>. The Georgian Alphabet is much closer to Greek than the other Caucasian alphabets. The numeric value runs parallel to the Greek one, the consonants without a Greek equivalent are organized at the end of the alphabet. Origins of the Alphabet are still unknown, some Armenian and Western scholars believe it was created by Mesrop Mashtots (Armenian: Մեսրոպ Մաշտոց Mesrop Maštoc')also known as Mesrob the Vartabed,who was an early medieval Armenian linguist, theologian, statesman and hymnologist, best known for inventing the Armenian alphabet c. 405 AD, other Georgian and Western, scholars are against this theory.

Syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs, and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands. Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.

The Armenian alphabet ( ' or ') is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the Armenian language. It was introduced by Mesrob Mashdots around 405 AD, an Armenian linguist and ecclesiastical leader, and originally contained 36 letters. Two more letters, օ (o) and ֆ (f), were added in the Middle Ages. During the 1920s orthography reform, a new letter և (capital ԵՎ) was added, which was a ligature before ե+ւ, while the letter Ւ ւ was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter ՈՒ ու (which was a digraph before).

The Armenian word for "alphabet" is "" (), named after the first two letters of the Armenian alphabet Ա այբ ayb and Բ բեն ben. The Armenian script's directionality is horizontal left-to-right, like the Latin and Greek alphabets.

Alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters, which can then be used for purposes of <a href="collation">collation</a>—namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called "<a href="alphabetical%20order">alphabetical order</a>".

The basic ordering of the <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> (A

K
L
M
N
O

Z), which is derived from the Northwest Semitic "Abgad" order, is well established, although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters (such as the <a href="French%20language">French</a> "é", "à", and "ô") and of certain combinations of letters (<a href="Multigraph%20%28orthography%29">multigraphs</a>). In French, these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation. However, in <a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a>, the accented letters such as "á", "í", and "ö" are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts. In Spanish, "ñ" is considered a separate letter, but accented vowels such as "á" and "é" are not. The "ll" and "ch" were also considered single letters, but in 1994 the <a href="Real%20Academia%20Espa%C3%B1ola">Real Academia Española</a> changed the collating order so that "ll" is between "lk" and "lm" in the dictionary and "ch" is between "cg" and "ci", and in 2010 the tenth congress of the <a href="Association%20of%20Spanish%20Language%20Academies">Association of Spanish Language Academies</a> changed it so they were no longer letters at all.

In German, words starting with "sch-" (which spells the German phoneme ) are inserted between words with initial "sca-" and "sci-" (all incidentally loanwords) instead of appearing after initial "sz", as though it were a single letter—in contrast to several languages such as <a href="Albanian%20alphabet">Albanian</a>, in which "dh-", "ë-", "gj-", "ll-", "rr-", "th-", "xh-" and "zh-" (all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters) would follow the letters "d", "e", "g", "l", "n", "r", "t", "x" and "z" respectively, as well as Hungarian and Welsh. Further, German words with <a href="umlaut%20%28diacritic%29">umlaut</a> are collated ignoring the umlaut—contrary to <a href="Turkish%20alphabet">Turkish</a> that adopted the <a href="grapheme">grapheme</a>s ö and ü, and where a word like "tüfek", would come after "tuz", in the dictionary. An exception is the German telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like "ä" = "ae" since names as "Jäger" appear also with the spelling "Jaeger", and are not distinguished in the spoken language.

The <a href="Danish%20orthography">Danish</a> and <a href="Norwegian%20orthography">Norwegian</a> alphabets end with "æ"—"ø"—"å", whereas the Swedish and <a href="Finnish%20orthography">Finnish</a> ones conventionally put "å"—"ä"—"ö" at the end.

It is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence. Some alphabets today, such as the <a href="Hanuno%27o%20script">Hanuno'o script</a>, are learned one letter at a time, in no particular order, and are not used for <a href="collation">collation</a> where a definite order is required. However, a dozen <a href="Ugaritic%20alphabet">Ugaritic</a> tablets from the fourteenth century BC preserve the alphabet in two sequences. One, the "ABCDE" order later used in Phoenician, has continued with minor changes in <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek</a>, <a href="Armenian%20alphabet">Armenian</a>, <a href="Gothic%20alphabet">Gothic</a>, <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a>, and <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin</a>; the other, "HMĦLQ," was used in southern Arabia and is preserved today in <a href="Ge%27ez%20alphabet">Ethiopic</a>. Both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years.

<a href="Runic%20alphabet">Runic</a> used an unrelated <a href="Elder%20Futhark">Futhark</a> sequence, which was later <a href="Younger%20Futhark">simplified</a>. <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic</a> uses its own sequence, although Arabic retains the traditional <a href="abjadi%20order">abjadi order</a> for numbering.

The <a href="Brahmic%20family">Brahmic family</a> of alphabets used in India use a unique order based on <a href="phonology">phonology</a>: The letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth. This organization is used in Southeast Asia, Tibet, Korean <a href="hangul">hangul</a>, and even Japanese <a href="kana">kana</a>, which is not an alphabet.

The Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound (<a href="acrophony">acrophony</a>), continue to be used to varying degrees in <a href="Samaritan%20alphabet">Samaritan</a>, <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet">Aramaic</a>, <a href="Syriac%20alphabet">Syriac</a>, <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek</a> and <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic</a>.

The names were abandoned in <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin</a>, which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant; the two exceptions were <a href="Y">Y</a> and <a href="Z">Z</a>, which were borrowed from the Greek alphabet rather than Etruscan, and were known as "Y Graeca" "Greek Y" (pronounced "I Graeca" "Greek I") and "zeta" (from Greek)—this discrepancy was inherited by many European languages, as in the term "zed" for Z in all forms of English other than American English. Over time names sometimes shifted or were added, as in "double U" for <a href="W">W</a> ("double V" in French), the English name for Y, and American "zee" for Z. Comparing names in English and French gives a clear reflection of the <a href="Great%20Vowel%20Shift">Great Vowel Shift</a>: A, B, C and D are pronounced /eɪ, biː, siː, diː/ in today's English, but in contemporary French they are /a, be, se, de/. The French names (from which the English names are derived) preserve the qualities of the English vowels from before the Great Vowel Shift. By contrast, the names of F, L, M, N and S (/ɛf, ɛl, ɛm, ɛn, ɛs/) remain the same in both languages, because "short" vowels were largely unaffected by the Shift.

In Cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on Slavic words; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in Latin.

When an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language, an <a href="orthography">orthography</a> generally comes into being, providing rules for the <a href="spelling">spelling</a> of words in that language. In accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based, these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>s (significant sounds) of the spoken language. In a perfectly <a href="phonemic%20orthography">phonemic orthography</a> there would be a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes, so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling, and vice versa. However this ideal is not usually achieved in practice; some languages (such as <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> and <a href="Finnish%20language">Finnish</a>) come close to it, while others (such as English) deviate from it to a much larger degree.

The pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

Languages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways:

National languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard. However, with an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as <a href="English%20language">English</a>, it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet.

Some national languages like <a href="Finnish%20language">Finnish</a>, <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>, <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>, <a href="Serbo-Croatian%20language">Serbo-Croatian</a> (<a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a>, <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a> and <a href="Bosnian%20language">Bosnian</a>) and <a href="Bulgarian%20language">Bulgarian</a> have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes. Strictly speaking, these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb "to spell" (meaning to split a word into its letters), the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables. Similarly, the <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> verb corresponding to 'spell (out)', "compitare", is unknown to many Italians because spelling is usually trivial, as Italian spelling is highly phonemic. In standard <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa, as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. <a href="French%20language">French</a>, with its <a href="silent%20letter">silent letter</a>s and its heavy use of <a href="nasal%20vowel">nasal vowel</a>s and <a href="elision">elision</a>, may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation, though complex, are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.

At the other extreme are languages such as English, where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way. For English, this is partly because the <a href="Great%20Vowel%20Shift">Great Vowel Shift</a> occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times, retaining their original spelling at varying levels. Even English has general, albeit complex, rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate.

Sometimes, countries have the written language undergo a <a href="spelling%20reform">spelling reform</a> to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language. These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> switched from the Arabic alphabet to a Latin-based <a href="Turkish%20alphabet">Turkish alphabet</a>.

The standard system of symbols used by <a href="linguist">linguist</a>s to represent sounds in any language, independently of orthography, is called the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>.

Atomic number

The atomic number or proton number (symbol Z) of a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> is the number of <a href="proton">proton</a>s found in the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> of an <a href="atom">atom</a>. It is identical to the <a href="charge%20number">charge number</a> of the nucleus. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an <a href="electric%20charge">uncharged</a> atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of <a href="electron">electron</a>s.

The sum of the atomic number "Z" and the <a href="neutron%20number">number of neutrons</a>, "N", gives the <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> "A" of an atom. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes) and the <a href="Binding%20energy%23Mass%20change">mass defect</a> of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> of any atom, when expressed in <a href="Atomic%20mass%20unit">unified atomic mass units</a> (making a quantity called the "<a href="atomic%20mass">relative isotopic mass</a>"), is within 1% of the whole number "A".

Atoms with the same atomic number "Z" but different neutron numbers "N", and hence different atomic masses, are known as <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see <a href="monoisotopic%20element">monoisotopic element</a>s), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard <a href="atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a>. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century.

The conventional symbol "Z" comes from the <a href="German%20language">German</a> word meaning "number", which, prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>, whose order is approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this "Z" number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word (and its English equivalent "atomic number") come into common use in this context.

Loosely speaking, the existence or construction of a <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> of elements creates an ordering of the elements, and so they can be numbered in order.

<a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables in order of <a href="atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a> ("Atomgewicht"). However, in consideration of the elements' observed chemical properties, he changed the order slightly and placed <a href="tellurium">tellurium</a> (atomic weight 127.6) ahead of <a href="iodine">iodine</a> (atomic weight 126.9). This placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number, "Z", but that number was not known or suspected at the time.

A simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory, however. Besides the case of iodine and tellurium, later several other pairs of elements (such as argon and potassium, cobalt and nickel) were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights, thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties. However the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a> elements, whose atomic number was not obvious, led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from <a href="lutetium">lutetium</a> (element 71) onwards (<a href="hafnium">hafnium</a> was not known at this time).

In 1911, <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> gave a <a href="Rutherford%20model">model</a> of the atom in which a central core held most of the atom's mass and a positive charge which, in units of the electron's charge, was to be approximately equal to half of the atom's atomic weight, expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms. This central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight (though it was almost 25% different from the atomic number of gold , ), the single element from which Rutherford made his guess). Nevertheless, in spite of Rutherford's estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 (but was element on the periodic table), a month after Rutherford's paper appeared, <a href="Antonius%20van%20den%20Broek">Antonius van den Broek</a> first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was "exactly" equal to its place in the periodic table (also known as element number, atomic number, and symbolized "Z"). This proved eventually to be the case.

The experimental position improved dramatically after research by <a href="Henry%20Moseley">Henry Moseley</a> in 1913. Moseley, after discussions with Bohr who was at the same lab (and who had used Van den Broek's hypothesis in his <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the atom), decided to test Van den Broek's and Bohr's hypothesis directly, by seeing if <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s emitted from excited atoms fitted the Bohr theory's postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of "Z".

To do this, Moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions (K and L lines) produced by the elements from aluminum ("Z" = 13) to gold ("Z" = 79) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an <a href="x-ray%20tube">x-ray tube</a>. The square root of the frequency of these photons increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression. This led to the conclusion (<a href="Moseley%27s%20law">Moseley's law</a>) that the atomic number does closely correspond (with an offset of one unit for K-lines, in Moseley's work) to the calculated <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a> of the nucleus, i.e. the element number "Z". Among other things, Moseley demonstrated that the <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a> series (from <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a> to <a href="lutetium">lutetium</a> inclusive) must have 15 members—no fewer and no more—which was far from obvious from the chemistry at that time.

After Moseley's death in 1915, the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium ("Z" = 92) were examined by his method. There were seven elements (with "Z" < 92) which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered, corresponding to atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, 87 and 91. From 1918 to 1947, all seven of these missing elements were discovered. By this time the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered, so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium ("Z" = 96).

In 1915 the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of "Z", which were now recognized to be the same as the element number, was not understood. An old idea called <a href="Prout%27s%20hypothesis">Prout's hypothesis</a> had postulated that the elements were all made of residues (or "protyles") of the lightest element hydrogen, which in the Bohr-Rutherford model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one. However, as early as 1907 Rutherford and <a href="Thomas%20Royds">Thomas Royds</a> had shown that alpha particles, which had a charge of +2, were the nuclei of helium atoms, which had a mass four times that of hydrogen, not two times. If Prout's hypothesis were true, something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms.

In 1917 Rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a <a href="nuclear%20reaction">nuclear reaction</a> between alpha particles and nitrogen gas, and believed he had proven Prout's law. He called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 (alternate names being proutons and protyles). It had been immediately apparent from the work of Moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> nuclei, and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra <a href="protons">protons</a> presumed present in all heavy nuclei. A helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two "nuclear electrons" (electrons bound inside the nucleus) to cancel two of the charges. At the other end of the periodic table, a nucleus of gold with a mass 197 times that of hydrogen, was thought to contain 118 nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of + 79, consistent with its atomic number.

All consideration of nuclear electrons ended with <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a>'s discovery of the neutron in 1932. An atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons, and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79 protons. After 1932, therefore, an element's atomic number "Z" was also realized to be identical to the <a href="proton%20number">proton number</a> of its nuclei.

The conventional symbol "Z" possibly comes from the <a href="German%20language">German</a> word (atomic number). However, prior to 1915, the word "Zahl" (simply "number") was used for an element's assigned number in the periodic table.

Each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom, which is "Z" (the atomic number). The <a href="electron%20configuration">configuration</a> of these electrons follows from the principles of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. The number of electrons in each element's <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a>s, particularly the outermost <a href="valence%20shell">valence shell</a>, is the primary factor in determining its <a href="chemical%20bonding">chemical bonding</a> behavior. Hence, it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of "any" mixture of atoms with a given atomic number.

The quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers. As of 2010, all elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed. Synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions, such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created. In general, the <a href="half-life">half-life</a> becomes shorter as atomic number increases, though an "<a href="island%20of%20stability">island of stability</a>" may exist for undiscovered isotopes with certain numbers of protons and neutrons.

The discipline of anatomy is divided into <a href="macroscopic%20scale">macroscopic</a> and <a href="microscopic%20scale">microscopic anatomy</a>. Macroscopic anatomy, or <a href="gross%20anatomy">gross anatomy</a>, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided <a href="eyesight">eyesight</a>. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of <a href="superficial%20anatomy">superficial anatomy</a>. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> of various structures, known as <a href="histology">histology</a>, and also in the study of <a href="cell%20biology">cells</a>.

The <a href="history%20of%20anatomy">history of anatomy</a> is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the <a href="organ%20%28anatomy%29">organs</a> and structures of the <a href="human%20body">human body</a>. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and <a href="cadaver">cadaver</a>s (corpses) to 20th century <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a> techniques including <a href="Radiography">X-ray</a>, <a href="Ultrasound%20imaging">ultrasound</a>, and <a href="MRI">magnetic resonance imaging</a>.

Anatomy and <a href="physiology">physiology</a>, which study (respectively) the structure and <a href="function%20%28biology%29">function</a> of organisms and their parts, make a natural pair of <a href="multidisciplinary%20approach">related disciplines</a>, and they are often studied together.

Derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "anatomē" "dissection" (from "anatémnō" "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά "aná" "up", and τέμνω "témnō" "I cut"), anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of <a href="organism">organism</a>s including their systems, organs and <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a>. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from <a href="physiology">physiology</a> and <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of <a href="bile">bile</a>, the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions.

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or <a href="Macroscopic%20scale">macroscopic</a> anatomy and <a href="Microscopic%20scale">microscopic</a> anatomy. <a href="Gross%20anatomy">Gross anatomy</a> is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes <a href="superficial%20anatomy">superficial anatomy</a> or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. <a href="Microscopic%20anatomy">Microscopic anatomy</a> is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including <a href="histology">histology</a> (the study of tissues), and <a href="embryology">embryology</a> (the study of an organism in its immature condition).

Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include <a href="dissection">dissection</a>, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and <a href="endoscopy">endoscopy</a>, in which a <a href="video%20camera">video camera</a>-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. <a href="Angiography">Angiography</a> using <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s or <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20angiography">magnetic resonance angiography</a> are methods to visualize blood vessels.

The term "anatomy" is commonly taken to refer to <a href="human%20anatomy">human anatomy</a>. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The term "zootomy" is also sometimes used to specifically refer to animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in <a href="plant%20anatomy">plant anatomy</a>.

The <a href="Kingdom%20%28biology%29">kingdom</a> <a href="Animalia">Animalia</a> or metazoa, contains <a href="multicellular%20organism">multicellular organism</a>s that are <a href="heterotroph">heterotroph</a>ic and <a href="Motility">motile</a> (although some have secondarily adopted a <a href="Sessility%20%28zoology%29">sessile</a> lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate <a href="Tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> and these animals are also known as <a href="eumetazoa">eumetazoa</a>ns. They have an internal <a href="digestion">digestive</a> chamber, with one or two openings; the <a href="gamete">gamete</a>s are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the <a href="zygote">zygote</a>s include a <a href="blastula">blastula</a> stage in their <a href="Embryogenesis">embryonic development</a>. Metazoans do not include the <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s, which have undifferentiated cells.

Unlike <a href="plant%20cell">plant cell</a>s, <a href="animal%20cells">animal cells</a> have neither a cell wall nor <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s. Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell. The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell, including those found in <a href="muscle">muscle</a>s, <a href="nerve">nerve</a>s and <a href="skin">skin</a>. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of <a href="phospholipid">phospholipid</a>s, <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> and a <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a>. All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic <a href="germ%20layer">germ layer</a>s. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called <a href="diploblasty">diploblastic</a> and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called <a href="triploblasty">triploblastic</a>. All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the <a href="ectoderm">ectoderm</a>, <a href="mesoderm">mesoderm</a> and <a href="endoderm">endoderm</a>.

Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: <a href="connective%20tissue">connective</a>, <a href="epithelium">epithelial</a>, <a href="muscle%20tissue">muscle</a> and <a href="nervous%20tissue">nervous tissue</a>.
<a href="Connective%20tissue">Connective tissue</a>s are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the <a href="extracellular%20matrix">extracellular matrix</a>. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, <a href="adipose%20tissue">adipose tissue</a>, fibrous connective tissue, <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> and <a href="bone">bone</a>. The extracellular matrix contains <a href="protein">protein</a>s, the chief and most abundant of which is <a href="collagen">collagen</a>. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a> to support or protect the body. An <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> is a thickened, rigid <a href="cuticle">cuticle</a> which is stiffened by <a href="mineralisation%20%28biology%29">mineralization</a>, as in <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in <a href="insect">insect</a>s. An <a href="endoskeleton">endoskeleton</a> is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed.

<a href="Epithelial%20tissue">Epithelial tissue</a> is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by <a href="cell%20adhesion%20molecule">cell adhesion molecule</a>s, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be <a href="Squamous%20epithelial%20cell">squamous</a> (flat), <a href="Simple%20cuboidal%20epithelium">cuboidal</a> or <a href="Columnar%20epithelial%20cell">columnar</a> and rest on a <a href="basal%20lamina">basal lamina</a>, the upper layer of the <a href="basement%20membrane">basement membrane</a>, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the <a href="respiratory%20tract">respiratory tract</a> there is a type of <a href="pseudostratified%20ciliated%20columnar%20epithelium">ciliated</a> epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are <a href="Microvillus">microvilli</a> on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are <a href="Intestinal%20villus">intestinal villi</a>. <a href="Skin">Skin</a> consists of an outer layer of <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. <a href="Keratinocyte">Keratinocyte</a>s make up to 95% of the cells in the <a href="epidermis%20%28skin%29">skin</a>. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a <a href="cuticle">cuticle</a>. In simple animals this may just be a coat of <a href="glycoproteins">glycoproteins</a>. In more advanced animals, many <a href="gland">gland</a>s are formed of epithelial cells.

<a href="Myocyte">Muscle cells</a> (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. <a href="Muscle%20tissue">Muscle tissue</a> functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile <a href="Myofibril">filaments</a> and is separated into three main types; <a href="Smooth%20muscle%20tissue">smooth muscle</a>, <a href="Skeletal%20striated%20muscle">skeletal muscle</a> and <a href="cardiac%20muscle">cardiac muscle</a>. Smooth muscle has no <a href="Striated%20muscle%20tissue">striations</a> when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as <a href="sea%20anemone">sea anemone</a> tentacles and the body wall of <a href="sea%20cucumber">sea cucumber</a>s. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the <a href="uterus">uterus</a>, <a href="bladder">bladder</a>, <a href="intestines">intestines</a>, <a href="stomach">stomach</a>, o<a href="esophagus">esophagus</a>, <a href="respiratory%20airways">respiratory airways</a>, and <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s. <a href="Cardiac%20muscle">Cardiac muscle</a> is found only in the <a href="heart">heart</a>, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

<a href="Nervous%20tissue">Nervous tissue</a> is composed of many nerve cells known as <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s which transmit information. In some slow-moving <a href="Symmetry%20in%20biology%23Radial%20symmetry">radially symmetrical</a> marine animals such as <a href="ctenophore">ctenophore</a>s and <a href="cnidarian">cnidarian</a>s (including <a href="sea%20anemone">sea anemone</a>s and <a href="jellyfish">jellyfish</a>), the nerves form a <a href="nerve%20net">nerve net</a>, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as <a href="chemoreceptor">chemoreceptor</a>s and <a href="photoreceptor%20cell">photoreceptors</a> are found in groups and send messages along <a href="biological%20neural%20network">neural networks</a> to other parts of the organism. Neurons can be connected together in <a href="Ganglion">ganglia</a>. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a> (brain and spinal cord) and a <a href="peripheral%20nervous%20system">peripheral nervous system</a>. The latter consists of <a href="Sensory%20neuron">sensory nerves</a> that transmit information from sense organs and <a href="Motor%20neuron">motor nerves</a> that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the <a href="somatic%20nervous%20system">somatic nervous system</a> which conveys sensation and controls <a href="voluntary%20muscle">voluntary muscle</a>, and the <a href="autonomic%20nervous%20system">autonomic nervous system</a> which involuntarily controls <a href="smooth%20muscle">smooth muscle</a>, certain glands and internal organs, including the <a href="stomach">stomach</a>.

All <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s have a similar basic <a href="body%20plan">body plan</a> and at some point in their lives, mostly in the <a href="embryogenesis">embryonic</a> stage, share the major <a href="chordate">chordate</a> characteristics; a stiffening rod, the <a href="notochord">notochord</a>; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the <a href="neural%20tube">neural tube</a>; <a href="pharyngeal%20arch">pharyngeal arch</a>es; and a tail posterior to the anus. The <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a> is protected by the <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a> and is above the notochord and the <a href="Gut%20%28anatomy%29">gastrointestinal tract</a> is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the <a href="ectoderm">ectoderm</a>, connective tissues are derived from <a href="mesoderm">mesoderm</a>, and gut is derived from the <a href="endoderm">endoderm</a>. At the posterior end is a <a href="tail">tail</a> which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the <a href="anus">anus</a> at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>, formed in the development of the segmented series of <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the <a href="nucleus%20pulposus">nucleus pulposus</a> of the <a href="intervertebral%20disc">intervertebral disc</a>s. However, a few vertebrates, such as the <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a> and the <a href="coelacanth">coelacanth</a> retain the notochord into adulthood. <a href="Gnathostomata">Jawed vertebrates</a> are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a> because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> to support his theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>.

The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in <a href="cartilaginous%20fish">cartilaginous fish</a>, or bone in <a href="bony%20fish">bony fish</a>. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no <a href="Limb%20%28anatomy%29">limbs</a> or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the <a href="fish%20fin">fins</a>, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the <a href="caudal%20fin">caudal fin</a>s, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the <a href="gill">gill</a>s and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or <a href="middle%20ear">middle ear</a>. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the <a href="lateral%20line">lateral line</a> system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.

Sharks and rays are <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> fish with numerous <a href="Primitive%20%28phylogenetics%29">primitive</a> anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal <a href="Fish%20scale%23Placoid%20scales">placoid scales</a>. They have a <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a> into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a <a href="swim%20bladder">swim bladder</a>. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, <a href="Egg%20yolk">yolky</a> eggs. Some species are <a href="ovoviviparous">ovoviviparous</a> and the young develop internally but others are <a href="oviparous">oviparous</a> and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.

The bony fish lineage shows more <a href="Derived%20trait">derived</a> anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an <a href="operculum%20%28fish%29">operculum</a>, and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping <a href="Fish%20scale">scales</a>. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawn</a> a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.

<a href="Amphibian">Amphibian</a>s are a <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">class</a> of animals comprising <a href="frog">frog</a>s, <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s and <a href="caecilian">caecilian</a>s. They are <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have <a href="articular%20processes">articular processes</a>. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little <a href="keratin">keratin</a> and lacks scales, but contains many <a href="mucous%20gland">mucous gland</a>s and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two <a href="atrium%20%28heart%29">atria</a> and one <a href="ventricle%20%28heart%29">ventricle</a>. They have a <a href="urinary%20bladder">urinary bladder</a> and <a href="metabolic%20waste%23nitrogen%20wastes">nitrogenous waste products</a> are excreted primarily as <a href="urea">urea</a>. Amphibians breathe by means of <a href="buccal%20pumping">buccal pumping</a>, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the <a href="Buccopharyngeal%20membrane">buccopharyngeal</a> region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with <a href="gas%20exchange">gas exchange</a> through the skin which needs to be kept moist.

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.

<a href="Reptile">Reptile</a>s are a class of animals comprising <a href="turtle">turtle</a>s, <a href="tuatara">tuatara</a>s, <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s, <a href="snake">snake</a>s and <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s. They are <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s, but the snakes and a few species of <a href="lizard">lizard</a> either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their <a href="lung">lung</a>s by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a <a href="Sex%20organ">copulatory organ</a> present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by <a href="Amniote">amniotic membranes</a> which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or <a href="Ovoviviparity">develop internally</a> in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a>.

Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny <a href="carapace">carapace</a> above and a <a href="plastron">plastron</a> below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.

Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> period. There is one living species, "<a href="Sphenodon%20punctatus">Sphenodon punctatus</a>". The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack <a href="Bronchus">bronchi</a>. The tuatara has a well-developed <a href="parietal%20eye">parietal eye</a> on its forehead.

Lizards have skulls with only one <a href="Skull%23Fenestrae">fenestra</a> on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.

Snakes are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of <a href="pelvic%20spur">pelvic spur</a>s. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent "spectacle" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.

Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.

Birds are <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are <a href="wing">wing</a>s covered with <a href="feather">feather</a>s and adapted for flight. Birds are <a href="endotherm">endotherm</a>ic, have a high <a href="metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a>, a light <a href="Skeleton">skeletal system</a> and powerful <a href="muscle">muscle</a>s. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.

The feathers are outgrowths of the <a href="epidermis%20%28zoology%29">epidermis</a> and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single <a href="uropygial%20gland">uropygial gland</a> near the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird <a href="personal%20grooming">preens</a>. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.

<a href="Mammal">Mammal</a>s are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of <a href="Tooth%20enamel">prismatic enamel</a>. The teeth are shed once (<a href="Deciduous%20teeth">milk teeth</a>) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a <a href="cochlea">cochlea</a> in the <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a>. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete <a href="sweat%20gland">sweat</a>. Some of these glands are specialized as <a href="mammary%20gland">mammary gland</a>s, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with <a href="lung">lung</a>s and have a muscular <a href="Thoracic%20diaphragm">diaphragm</a> separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.

Mammals are <a href="amniote">amniote</a>s, and most are <a href="Vivipary">viviparous</a>, giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying <a href="monotreme">monotreme</a>s, the <a href="platypus">platypus</a> and the <a href="echidna">echidna</a>s of Australia. Most other mammals have a <a href="placenta">placenta</a> through which the developing <a href="foetus">foetus</a> obtains nourishment, but in <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>s, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's <a href="Pouch%20%28marsupial%29">pouch</a> where it latches on to a <a href="nipple">nipple</a> and completes its development.

Humans have the overall body plan of a mammal. Humans have a <a href="human%20head">head</a>, <a href="neck">neck</a>, <a href="Trunk%20%28anatomy%29">trunk</a> (which includes the <a href="thorax">thorax</a> and <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a>), two <a href="arm">arm</a>s and <a href="hand">hand</a>s, and two <a href="human%20leg">legs</a> and <a href="foot">feet</a>.

Generally, students of certain <a href="biology">biological sciences</a>, <a href="paramedic">paramedic</a>s, prosthetists and orthotists, <a href="physical%20therapy">physiotherapists</a>, <a href="occupational%20therapy">occupational therapists</a>, <a href="Nursing">nurses</a>, and <a href="medical%20school">medical students</a> learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of <a href="dissection">dissection</a> and inspection of <a href="cadaver">cadaver</a>s. The study of microscopic anatomy (or <a href="histology">histology</a>) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a <a href="microscope">microscope</a>.
Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, <a href="Gray%27s%20Anatomy">Gray's Anatomy</a>, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially <a href="surgery">surgeons</a> and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as <a href="histopathology">histopathology</a> and <a href="radiology">radiology</a>.
Academic anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.

<a href="Invertebrate">Invertebrate</a>s constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s such as "<a href="Paramecium">Paramecium</a>" to such complex multicellular animals as the <a href="octopus">octopus</a>, <a href="lobster">lobster</a> and <a href="dragonfly">dragonfly</a>. They constitute about 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>ns have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by <a href="Cilium">cilia</a> or <a href="Flagellum">flagella</a> or may proceed via the advance of <a href="pseudopodia">pseudopodia</a>, food may be gathered by <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a>, energy needs may be supplied by <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> and the cell may be supported by an <a href="endoskeleton">endoskeleton</a> or an <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.

<a href="Metazoa">Metazoa</a>ns are multicellular organism, different groups of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an <a href="extracellular%20matrix">extracellular matrix</a> which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the <a href="mesoderm">mesoderm</a> is present in <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>s, <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s and some <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s. <a href="Exoskeleton">Exoskeleton</a>s are derived from the epidermis and is composed of <a href="chitin">chitin</a> in <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). <a href="Calcium%20carbonate">Calcium carbonate</a> constitutes the shells of <a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a>, <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s and some tube-building <a href="Polychaete">polychaete worms</a> and <a href="silica">silica</a> forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s and <a href="radiolaria">radiolaria</a>. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the <a href="pinacoderm">pinacoderm</a> of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (<a href="polyp">polyp</a>s, <a href="sea%20anemone">sea anemone</a>s, <a href="jellyfish">jellyfish</a>) and the <a href="collagen">collagen</a>ous cuticle of <a href="annelid">annelid</a>s. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as <a href="Microvillus">microvilli</a>, cilia, bristles, <a href="Spine%20%28zoology%29">spines</a> and <a href="tubercle">tubercle</a>s.

<a href="Marcello%20Malpighi">Marcello Malpighi</a>, the father of microscopical anatomy, discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being captured above the ring.

<a href="Arthropod">Arthropod</a>s comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species.

<a href="Insect">Insect</a>s possess <a href="segmentation%20%28biology%29">segmented</a> bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a <a href="Thorax%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">thorax</a> and an <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a>. The head typically bears a pair of sensory <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a>, a pair of <a href="compound%20eye">compound eye</a>s, one to three simple eyes (<a href="ocelli">ocelli</a>) and three sets of modified appendages that form the <a href="insect%20mouthparts">mouthparts</a>. The thorax has three pairs of segmented <a href="arthropod%20leg">legs</a>, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of <a href="insect%20wing">wings</a>. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the <a href="digestion">digestive</a>, <a href="Respiration%20%28physiology%29">respiratory</a>, <a href="Excretion">excretory</a> and reproductive systems. There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.

<a href="Spider">Spider</a>s a class of <a href="arachnid">arachnid</a>s have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a <a href="cephalothorax">cephalothorax</a> and an <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a>. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called <a href="chelicerae">chelicerae</a> which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called <a href="pedipalp">pedipalp</a>s attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the <a href="palpal%20bulb">copulatory organ</a>.


In 1600 BCE, the <a href="Edwin%20Smith%20Papyrus">Edwin Smith Papyrus</a>, an <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20medicine">Ancient Egyptian</a> <a href="Medical%20manual">medical text</a>, described the <a href="heart">heart</a>, its vessels, <a href="liver">liver</a>, <a href="spleen">spleen</a>, <a href="kidneys">kidneys</a>, <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a>, <a href="uterus">uterus</a> and <a href="Urinary%20bladder">bladder</a>, and showed the <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s diverging from the heart. The <a href="Ebers%20Papyrus">Ebers Papyrus</a> (c. 1550 BCE) features a "treatise on the heart", with vessels carrying all the body's fluids to or from every member of the body.

Ancient Greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world. Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made, which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and the nervous system.

The <a href="Hellenistic%20Egypt">Hellenistic Egypt</a>ian city of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology. Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the Greeks, but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.

Some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria. Two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were <a href="Herophilus">Herophilus</a> and <a href="Erasistratus">Erasistratus</a>. These two physicians helped pioneer human <a href="dissection">dissection</a> for medical research. They also conducted <a href="vivisection">vivisection</a>s on the cadavers of condemned criminals, which was considered taboo until the Renaissance – Herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections. Herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine. Some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse, the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls then veins, and that the atria were parts of the heart. Herophilus’s knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and nervous system, and characterizing the course of disease. Erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain, including the cavities and membranes, and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum During his study in Alexandria, Erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems. He was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body. His distinction between the arteries and veins – the arteries carrying the air through the body, while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery. Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart, including the tricuspid. During the third century, Greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses. It was Herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis. Herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain, appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the "seat of intellect" and not a "cooling chamber" as propounded by Aristotle Herophilus is also credited with describing the optic, oculomotor, motor division of the trigeminal, facial, vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves.

Great feats were made during the third century in both the digestive and reproductive systems. Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver. He showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes. He recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland.

The anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the "<a href="Hippocratic%20Corpus">Hippocratic Corpus</a>", an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors. <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> described <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> anatomy based on animal <a href="dissection">dissection</a>. <a href="Praxagoras">Praxagoras</a> identified the difference between <a href="artery">arteries</a> and <a href="vein">vein</a>s. Also in the 4th century BCE, <a href="Herophilos">Herophilos</a> and <a href="Erasistratus">Erasistratus</a> produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on <a href="vivisection">vivisection</a> of criminals in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> during the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>.

In the 2nd century, <a href="Galen%20of%20Pergamum">Galen of Pergamum</a>, an <a href="anatomist">anatomist</a>, <a href="clinician">clinician</a>, writer and <a href="Philosophy">philosopher</a>, wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times. He compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals. He was one of the first experimental physiologists through his <a href="vivisection">vivisection</a> experiments on animals. Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years. His work was known to <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> doctors only through <a href="Islamic%20Golden%20Age">Islamic Golden Age</a> medicine until it was translated from the Greek some time in the 15th century.

Anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century; as the historian Marie Boas writes, "Progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid". Between 1275 and 1326, the anatomists <a href="Mondino%20de%20Luzzi">Mondino de Luzzi</a>, <a href="Alessandro%20Achillini">Alessandro Achillini</a> and <a href="Antonio%20Benivieni">Antonio Benivieni</a> at <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times. Mondino's "Anatomy" of 1316 was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy. It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the abdomen, then the thorax, then the head and limbs. It was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century.

<a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> (1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by <a href="Andrea%20del%20Verrocchio">Andrea del Verrocchio</a>. He made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.

<a href="Andreas%20Vesalius">Andreas Vesalius</a> (1514–1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), professor of anatomy at the <a href="University%20of%20Padua">University of Padua</a>, is considered the founder of modern human anatomy. Originally from <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brabant">Brabant</a>, Vesalius published the influential book "<a href="De%20humani%20corporis%20fabrica">De humani corporis fabrica</a>" ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543. The accurate and intricately detailed illustrations, often in <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> poses against Italianate landscapes, are thought to have been made by the artist <a href="Jan%20van%20Calcar">Jan van Calcar</a>, a pupil of <a href="Titian">Titian</a>.

In England, anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science; these were given by the <a href="Barber%20surgeon">Company of Barbers and Surgeons</a> in the 16th century, joined in 1583 by the Lumleian lectures in surgery at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians">Royal College of Physicians</a>.

In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century. Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain. Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York were all renowned for <a href="body%20snatching">body snatching</a> activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins. A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even <a href="anatomy%20murder">anatomy murder</a> were practised to obtain cadavers. Some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers. The practice was halted in Britain by the <a href="Anatomy%20Act">Anatomy Act</a> of 1832, while in the United States, similar legislation was enacted after the physician <a href="William%20S.%20Forbes">William S. Forbes</a> of <a href="Jefferson%20Medical%20College">Jefferson Medical College</a> was found guilty in 1882 of "complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in Lebanon Cemetery".

The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir <a href="John%20Struthers%20%28anatomist%29">John Struthers</a>, <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Anatomy%20%28Aberdeen%29">Regius Professor of Anatomy</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a> from 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of "pre-clinical" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of <a href="comparative%20anatomy">comparative anatomy</a>, published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the <a href="Tay%20Whale">Tay Whale</a>. From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools. Medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching. <a href="Ignaz%20Semmelweis">Ignaz Semmelweis</a> investigated <a href="puerperal%20fever">puerperal fever</a> and he discovered how it was caused. He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.

Before the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were <a href="dissection">dissection</a> of the dead and <a href="inspection">inspection</a>, <a href="palpation">palpation</a> and <a href="auscultation">auscultation</a> of the living. It was the advent of <a href="microscopy">microscopy</a> that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of <a href="achromatic%20lens">achromatic lens</a>es increased the <a href="Angular%20resolution">resolving power</a> of the microscope and around 1839, <a href="Matthias%20Jakob%20Schleiden">Matthias Jakob Schleiden</a> and <a href="Theodor%20Schwann">Theodor Schwann</a> identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the <a href="microtome">microtome</a> was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of <a href="histology">histology</a> and <a href="Cell%20biology">cytology</a> began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of <a href="biopsy">biopsy</a> specimens. The invention of the <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a> brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the <a href="ultrastructure">ultrastructure</a> of cells and the <a href="organelle">organelle</a>s and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of <a href="X-ray%20diffraction">X-ray diffraction</a> for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of <a href="molecular%20anatomy">molecular anatomy</a>.

Equally important advances have occurred in "non-invasive" techniques for examining the interior structures of the body. <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s can be passed through the body and used in medical <a href="radiography">radiography</a> and <a href="fluoroscopy">fluoroscopy</a> to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness. <a href="Magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">Magnetic resonance imaging</a>, <a href="X-ray%20computed%20tomography">computed tomography</a>, and <a href="Medical%20ultrasonography">ultrasound imaging</a> have all enabled examination of internal structures, living or dead, in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.

Affirming the consequent

Affirming the consequent, sometimes called converse error, fallacy of the converse or confusion of necessity and sufficiency, is a <a href="formal%20fallacy">formal fallacy</a> of inferring the <a href="converse%20%28logic%29">converse</a> from the original statement. The corresponding argument has the general <a href="argument%20form">form</a>:

An argument of this form is <a href="validity">invalid</a>, i.e., the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true. Since "P" was never asserted as the "only" sufficient condition for "Q", other factors could account for "Q" (while "P" was false).

To put it differently, if "P" implies "Q", the only inference that can be made is "non-Q" implies "non-P". ("Non-P" and "non-Q" designate the opposite propositions to "P" and "Q".) This is known as logical <a href="contraposition">contraposition</a>. Symbolically:

formula_2

The name "affirming the <a href="consequent">consequent</a>" derives from the premise "Q", which affirms the "then" clause of the <a href="indicative%20conditional">conditional</a> premise.

Example 1

One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion. For example:

Owning Fort Knox is not the "only" way to be rich. Any number of other ways exist to be rich.

However, one can affirm with certainty that "if someone is not rich" ("non-Q"), then "this person does not own Fort Knox" ("non-P"). This is the <a href="contrapositive">contrapositive</a> of the first statement, and it must be true if and only if the original statement is true.

Example 2

Arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example:

But having the flu is not the "only" cause of a sore throat since many illnesses cause sore throat, such as the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a> or <a href="strep%20throat">strep throat</a>.

Affirming the consequent is commonly used in <a href="rationalization%20%28psychology%29">rationalization</a>, and thus appears as a <a href="coping%20mechanism">coping mechanism</a> in some people.

Example 3

In "<a href="Catch-22">Catch-22</a>", the chaplain is interrogated for supposedly being 'Washinton Irving'/'Irving Washington', who has been blocking out large portions of soldier's letters home. The colonel has found such a letter, but with the Chaplain's name signed.

"P" in this case is 'The chaplain signs his own name', and "Q" 'The chaplain's name is written'. The chaplain's name may be written, but he did not necessarily write it, as the colonel falsely concludes "(and in fact he did not, as in the novel, Yossarian signed the name"")".

Ambiguity

Ambiguity is a type of <a href="uncertainty">uncertainty</a> of <a href="meaning%20%28linguistics%29">meaning</a> in which several interpretations are <a href="wikt%3Aplausible%23Adjective">plausible</a>. It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose <a href="intention">intended</a> meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps. (The "<a href="wikt%3Aambi-%23Prefix">ambi</a>-" part of the <a href="Terminology">term</a> reflects an idea of "<a href="2%20%28number%29">two</a>", as in "two meanings".)

The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with <a href="vagueness">vagueness</a>. In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.

Context may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.

The <a href="Polysemy">lexical ambiguity</a> of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. "Meaning" here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, the word "bank" has several distinct lexical definitions, including "<a href="Bank">financial institution</a>" and "<a href="Bank%20%28geography%29">edge of a river</a>". Or consider "<a href="apothecary">apothecary</a>". One could say "I bought herbs from the apothecary". This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary (<a href="pharmacist">pharmacist</a>) or went to the apothecary (<a href="pharmacy">pharmacy</a>).

The context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says "I buried $100 in the bank", most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word.

Lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as <a href="word%20sense%20disambiguation">word sense disambiguation</a>.

The use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used). The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politician whose "<a href="weasel%20word">weasel word</a>s" and <a href="obfuscation">obfuscation</a> are necessary to gain support from multiple <a href="Electoral%20district">constituents</a> with <a href="mutually%20exclusive">mutually exclusive</a> conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of <a href="political%20science">political science</a>.

More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. "Good", for example, can mean "useful" or "functional" ("That's a good hammer"), "exemplary" ("She's a good student"), "pleasing" ("This is good soup"), "moral" ("a good person" versus "the lesson to be learned from a story"), "<a href="righteous">righteous</a>", etc. " I have a good daughter" is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply <a href="prefix">prefix</a>es and <a href="suffix">suffix</a>es can also create ambiguity ("unlockable" can mean "capable of being unlocked" or "impossible to lock").

<a href="Syntactic%20ambiguity">Syntactic ambiguity</a> arises when a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax. This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. "He ate the cookies on the couch", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies. "To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license." This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license. Or it could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher. Only rewriting the sentence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.
For the notion of, and theoretic results about, syntactic ambiguity in artificial, <a href="formal%20languages">formal languages</a> (such as computer <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>s), see <a href="Ambiguous%20grammar">Ambiguous grammar</a>.

<a href="Spoken%20language">Spoken language</a> can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words. For example, "ice cream" and "I scream". Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a <a href="mondegreen">mondegreen</a>.

<a href="Semantic%20ambiguity">Semantic ambiguity</a> happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase—a word or phrase that has more than one meaning. In "We saw her duck" (example due to Richard Nordquist), the word "duck" can refer either

For example, "You could do with a new automobile. How about a test drive?" The clause "You could do with" presents a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless. Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity. The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to <a href="vagueness">vagueness</a>.

Linguistic ambiguity <a href="Ambiguity%20%28law%29">can be a problem in law</a>, because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.

Philosophers (and other users of logic) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say, "I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth", an example of a glittering generality. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after "taxes" (to convey the first sense) or by changing "which" to "that" (to convey the second sense) or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true – an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In continental philosophy (particularly phenomenology and existentialism), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. Martin Heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole.[3] In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work Being and Nothingness an "essay in phenomenological ontology" Jean-Paul Sartre follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. Simone de Beauvoir tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings (The Ethics of Ambiguity), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: "as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment." Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: "Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us, therefore, try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting". Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous. Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not, in fact, separate. Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence have led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.

In literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool. Groucho Marx's classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor, for example: "Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know". Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue" (where "blue" can refer to the color, or to sadness).

In narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel "The Great Gatsby".

Christianity and Judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with 'ambiguity'. Many Christians and Jews endorse Rudolf Otto's description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans.[dubious – discuss] The orthodox Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous, or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases. (The title of one of his most famous books, Orthodoxy, itself employing such a paradox.)

Metonymy involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or jargon, for the name of the whole object (for example "wheels" to refer to a car, or "flowers" to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants). In modern vocabulary critical semiotics,[9] metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as "sweet ride" to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humour.

In <a href="music">music</a>, pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some <a href="polytonality">polytonality</a>, <a href="polymeter">polymeter</a>, other ambiguous <a href="metre">meters</a> or <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a>s, and ambiguous <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrasing</a>, or (Stein 2005, p. 79) any <a href="aspect%20of%20music">aspect of music</a>. The <a href="music%20of%20Africa">music of Africa</a> is often purposely ambiguous. To quote <a href="Donald%20Francis%20Tovey">Sir Donald Francis Tovey</a> (1935, p. 195), "Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value."

In visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the <a href="Necker%20cube">Necker cube</a>, which can be interpreted in two ways. Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called <a href="multistable%20perception">multistable perception</a>.
The opposite of such ambiguous images are <a href="impossible%20object">impossible object</a>s.

Pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?

Some <a href="Constructed%20language">languages have been created</a> with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially <a href="Polysemy">lexical ambiguity</a>. <a href="Lojban">Lojban</a> and <a href="Loglan">Loglan</a> are two related languages which have been created for this, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to <a href="syntax">syntax</a> and <a href="semantic">semantic</a> rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.

In computer science, the <a href="SI%20prefix">SI prefix</a>es <a href="kilo-">kilo-</a>, <a href="mega-">mega-</a> and <a href="giga-">giga-</a> were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 (1024, 1024 and 1024) contrary to the <a href="metric%20system">metric system</a> in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand, one million, and one billion. This usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices (e.g. <a href="DRAM">DRAM</a>) addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense.

Subsequently, the Ki, Mi, and Gi prefixes were introduced so that <a href="metric%20prefix%23Binary%20prefixes">binary prefixes</a> could be written explicitly, also rendering k, M, and G "unambiguous" in texts conforming to the new standard — this led to a "new" ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes (necessarily indicating the new style) as to whether the usage of k, M, and G remains ambiguous (old style) or not (new style). Note also that 1 M (where M is ambiguously 1,000,000 or 1,048,576) is "less" uncertain than the engineering value 1.0e6 (defined to designate the interval 950,000 to 1,050,000), and that as non-volatile storage devices began to commonly exceed 1 GB in capacity (where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit), GB and TB almost always mean 10 and 10 <a href="bytes">bytes</a>.

<a href="Mathematical%20notation">Mathematical notation</a>, widely used in <a href="physics">physics</a> and other <a href="science">science</a>s, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several <a href="Lexical%20%28semiotics%29">lexical</a>, <a href="syntactic">syntactic</a> and <a href="semantic">semantic</a> ambiguities remain.

The ambiguity in the style of writing a <a href="Function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> should not be confused with a <a href="multivalued%20function">multivalued function</a>, which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several <a href="special%20function">special function</a>s still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:

Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.
It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, formula_1. Then, if one sees formula_2, there is no way to distinguish whether it means formula_1 multiplied by formula_4, or function formula_5 evaluated at argument equal to formula_4. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.

Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages (<a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a> and <a href="Fortran">Fortran</a>) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The <a href="Wolfram%20Language">Wolfram Language</a> used in <a href="Mathematica">Mathematica</a> allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression f=f(x) is qualified as an error.

The order of operations may depend on the context. In most <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>s, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, formula_7 is interpreted as formula_8; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.
Sometimes, one uses "italics" letters to denote elementary functions.
In the <a href="scientific%20journal">scientific journal</a> style, the expression
formula_9
means
product of variables
formula_10,
formula_11,
formula_12 and
formula_13, although in a slideshow, it may mean formula_14.

A comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.
If it is written formula_15, the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables
formula_16, formula_12 and formula_18, or it is indication to a trivalent tensor.
The writing of formula_15 instead of formula_20 may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers. The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.

Subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in formula_21.
formula_22, which could be understood to mean either formula_23 or formula_24. In addition, formula_25 may mean formula_26, as formula_27 means formula_28 (see <a href="tetration">tetration</a>).

formula_29, which by convention means formula_30, though it might be thought to mean formula_31, since formula_32 means formula_33.

formula_34, which arguably should mean formula_35 but would commonly be understood to mean formula_36 .

It is common to define the <a href="coherent%20states">coherent states</a> in <a href="quantum%20optics">quantum optics</a> with formula_37 and states with fixed number of photons with formula_38. Then, there is an "unwritten rule": the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and formula_39photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if formula_40 is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and formula_41 means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized <a href="adimensional">adimensional</a>, <a href="dimensionless">dimensionless</a> variables are used. Expression formula_42 may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.

Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even <a href="dimension">dimension</a>, as in the case of the <a href="Einstein%20coefficients">Einstein coefficients</a>), depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> states in <a href="Tractatus%20Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a>: "... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning."

A highly confusing term is "gain". For example, the sentence "the gain of a system should be doubled", without context, means close to nothing.
It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.
It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.
It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).

The term "intensity" is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of <a href="irradiance">irradiance</a>, <a href="luminous%20intensity">luminous intensity</a>, <a href="radiant%20intensity">radiant intensity</a>, or <a href="radiance">radiance</a>, depending on the background of the person using the term.

Also, confusions may be related with the use of <a href="atomic%20percent">atomic percent</a> as measure of concentration of a <a href="dopant">dopant</a>, or <a href="Optical%20resolution">resolution</a> of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also <a href="Accuracy%20and%20precision">Accuracy and precision</a> and its talk.

The <a href="Berry%20paradox">Berry paradox</a> arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as "definable" or "nameable". Terms of this kind give rise to <a href="Virtuous%20circle%20and%20vicious%20circle">vicious circle</a> fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.

In mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of <a href="underdetermination">underdetermination</a>—for example, formula_43 leaves open what the value of "X" is—while its opposite is a <a href="self-contradiction">self-contradiction</a>, also called <a href="inconsistency">inconsistency</a>, <a href="paradoxicalness">paradoxicalness</a>, or <a href="oxymoron">oxymoron</a>, or in mathematics an <a href="inconsistent%20system">inconsistent system</a>—such as formula_44, which has no solution.

Logical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and <a href="impossible%20object">impossible object</a>s, such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of <a href="M.%20C.%20Escher">M. C. Escher</a>.
